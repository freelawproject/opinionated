They waited quietly for the police, whom a board secretary had telephoned, to arrive. When the police came, the defendants stated that they would submit to arrest nonviolently. They then asked if they might pray, received permission, and proceeded to pray and to read aloud from the New Testament. They also distributed a signed letter in which they attempted to justify their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-18\">Subsequently, the defendants were charged in a four-count indictment with (1) willful damage to governmental property, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361; (2) removal, mutilation, and destruction of records, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071; (3) interfering with the administration of the Military Selective Service Act, 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) conspiracy to commit the above offenses, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. A jury acquitted the defendants on the three substantive counts but convicted them of violating Section 371, the conspiracy count. Each defendant was sentenced to one year in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>At trial, the defendants, three of whom had elected to proceed <em>pro se, </em>argued that they had not acted with an unlawful purpose. Their aim allegedly had been to save lives. They stressed what they considered to have been the educational and symbolic nature of their acts. On appeal, they raise several issues, the resolution of any one of which in their favor would assertedly mandate reversal of the judgments of conviction. Most of these issues concern supposed trial errors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 primary contention, however, is that the pertinent portion of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), the violation of which was one of the alleged objectives of the conspiracy, is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">In considering the contentions of the defendants, we do so on the basis that they are to be accorded the same constitutional protection and fair trial rights possessed by every other individual in our system of justice. Irrespective of the sincerity with which they held their beliefs, and despite their motivation, which reasonably could be construed as having prompted a protest made on behalf of their fellows of the human race against the then current war involvement, the defendants\u2019 invasion of a governmental office and the destruction of its records are intolerable and inexcusable in a civilized society. While we deny condonation, we do not deny basic rights which must be protected in an evenhanded manner if a civilized society is to be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>Standing Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">We must first determine whether the defendants may challenge their conspiracy conviction on constitutional grounds. The Government argued below and argues here that the defendants may not seek the reversal of the judgments against them because they question the constitutionality of only one of the three unlawful \u201cobjects\u201d of the conspiracy, namely, the violation of 50 U.S. C. App. \u00a7 462(a). The Government contends that the jury could have reasonably determined that the defendants (a) had conspired to violate either or both of the other two statutes, the constitutionality of which the defendants do not contest, and (b) had not conspired to violate Section 462(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Our attention has been directed to no case that is \u201con all fours\u201d with the present case, and the Government cites only one decision, United States v. Tanner, 471 F.2d 128 (7th Cir. 1972), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 949, 93 S.Ct. 269, 34 L.Ed.2d 220, to support its argument. <em>Tanner </em>in relevant part states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">\u201cIn addition, Rice and Chipman challenge Count IV of the indictment [a substantive count] for failing to allege acts that fall within the \u2018special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u2019 We fail to see how Rice and Chipman have standing to raise this claim since neither were indicted for the substantive offense charged. The offense charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Count IV affected the trial of these appellants only insofar as it was one of the several unlawful objects alleged in the conspiracy count. However valid appellants\u2019 claim is on this issue, it does not affect their convictions on the conspiracy count so long as any one of the objects of the conspiracy is unchallenged.\u201d 471 F.2d at 139-140.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We are not persuaded that, on the basis of this brief paragraph, we must abort defendants\u2019 constitutional claims. In <em>Tanner, </em>Count IV charged a substantive violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1363, and the conspiracy count charged a conspiracy to commit actions in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 837, 1363, 1364, 1952, 2275, 81, and 1992. See United States v. Tanner, 279 F.Supp. 457, 463 n.l (N.D.Ill.1967). The challenge to Count IV in <em>Tanner </em>did not go to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1363 nor was the section per se otherwise challenged. The contention which this court ultimately accepted.in reversing as to Count IV was that factually there had been no violation of .the statute inasmuch as the damaged dock and vessel were not at the time upon a body of water which would accord federal jurisdiction, although such jurisdiction had been alleged in the count. The particular holding in <em>Tanner </em>involves, therefore, nothing more than the well-established law that conspirators need not accomplish the violation of the laws with which they are charged with conspiring to violate. 15A C.J.S. Conspiracy \u00a7 44, at 753 (1967). This is a far cry from saying that a person can properly be charged with conspiring to commit a violation of an unconstitutional statute, the foundation stone of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Also, unlike Rice and Chipman in <em>Tanner, </em>the defendants here were named in all the substantive counts referred to in Count IV, the conspiracy charge. Because the jury returned a general verdict on that count, we cannot know which of the three statutes the violations of which were the \u201cobjects\u201d of the conspiracy the jury relied on in convicting the defendants. The trial court had instructed the jury that actions taken to attain <em>any </em>of the three alleged objects would suffice for conviction. We do not assume that the learned trial judge had any intention to footnote this instruction by a proviso: \u201ceven though one of the objects was the violation of a statute unenforceable because of unconstitutionality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Although the defendants do not challenge the constitutionality of Sections 1361 and 2071, their failure in this respect does not amount to a concession that they were guilty of conspiring to violate the statutes which the jury found they had not violated substantively. It is hornbook law that a conspiracy to commit a crime is a different offense from the commission of the crime which is the object of the conspiracy. However, the defendants point out in connection with the triple object of the conspiracy count that the \u201cjury may have reasonably concluded on the basis of the evidence at trial that the defendants neither conspired to damage or attempt to damage government records in excess of $100, nor conspired to remove, mutilate, obliterate or destroy government records, nor conspired to use means of force or violence to hinder the administration of the Selective Service system.\u201d The simple fact is that we cannot say with any certainty which of the three objects was crucial to the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">We are not unmindful of general statements in the cases to the effect that proof of conspiracy to violate any one of several statutes alleged in the indictment will support a conviction. See, e. <em>g., </em>United States v. Mack, 112 F.2d 290 (2d Cir. 1940). While we do experience some conceptual difficulties with this general statement, recognizing again that the offense of conspiracy is separate from the statutory offenses constituting the objects of the conspiracy and assuming arguendo the correctness of the general statement, we do not find the principle applicable in the particular factual situation here involved because of our inability to state the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>jury\u2019s determination. We decline to speculate on such a matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">To the extent that an isolated statement that there is \u201cno failure of proof in the fact that one of its objects alleged as unlawful may not have been so,\u201d Moss v. United States, 132 F.2d 875, 878 (6th Cir. 1943), appears to be inconsistent with the result we have reached, we cannot accept the implication as being applicable here, and, if it is, we cannot accept it as good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The controlling matter here, in our opinion, is not the proof upon which the jury might have convicted under the conspiracy count but rather the proof upon which the jury did convict. Chief Justice Hughes put the matter well in an analogous situation in Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 367-368, 51 S. Ct. 532, 535, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThe verdict against the appellant was a general one. It did not specify the ground upon which it rested. As there were three purposes set forth in the statute, and the jury were instructed that their verdict might be given with respect to any one of them, independently considered, it is impossible to say under which clause of the statute the conviction was obtained. If any one of these clauses, which the state court has held to be separable, was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under that clause. It may be added that this is far from being a merely academic proposition, as it appears, upon an examination of the original record filed with this Court, that the State\u2019s attorney upon the trial emphatically urged upon the jury that they could convict the appellant under the first clause alone, without regard to the other clauses. It follows that instead of its being permissible to hold, with the state court, that the verdict could be sustained if any one of the clauses of the statute were found to be valid, the necessary conclusion from the manner in which the case was sent to the jury is that, if any of the clauses in question is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">A further parallel is noted in that in final argument in the present case the Government\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">\u201cNow the defendants have tried to make a point that they were peaceful, that they didn\u2019t use force or violence. Well, that is not required. The statute says \u2018otherwise.\u2019 Anyway in which they interfere, such as damaging.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">The Government in its brief reads this as meaning \u201chindering acts that an ordinary person might not think of as forceful or violent.\u201d Juries are not necessarily composed of \u201cordinary\u201d persons, but even an ordinary person might well, in recalling the final argument, fasten on the words, \u201c[t]he statute says \u2018otherwise,\u2019 \u201d and not remember the qualifying example which did not purport to be exclusive nor limited to matters like \u201cforce or violence.\u201d As will be developed hereinafter, the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d are of substantial significance to the result we reach. Even if the Government attorney did not purport in closing argument to include communication by letter or speech in \u201cor otherwise,\u201d there likewise was nothing which would exclude interfering or hindering by communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">In sum, we are of the opinion that the statutory requirement of conspiring to commit an \u201coffense against the United States,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, is not fulfilled by an offense which fails to meet constitutional muster even though that offense is only one of several alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">At this point, we note a significant distinction between Counts III and IV. Although Count III supposedly was based on a violation of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a), it did not follow the statutory language in what we deem to be an essential respect. The statute refers to \u201cforce or violence <em>or </em>otherwise\u201d; Count III, the substantive count, uses \u201cforce, violence <em>and </em>otherwise.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>To convict under the substantive count, the jury arguably would have had to find that the defendants used force and violence; in contrast, to convict under Count IV, the jury would not have had to find that the defendants had intended to use force and violence. It is the \u201cor otherwise\u201d phrase that defendants contend invalidates the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">\n<em>Constitutional Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Section 462(a) contains many clauses, but the one with which we are here concerned reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">\u201cor any person or persons who shall <em>knowingly hinder or interfere or attempt to do so in any way, by force or violence or otherwise, with the administration of this title </em>or the rules or regulations made pursuant thereto, or who conspires to commit any one or more of such offenses, shall, upon conviction in any district court of the United States of competent jurisdiction, be punished by imprisonment for not more than five years .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The words \u201cor otherwise\u201d were not in the original act but were added by way of amendment in 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The defendants attack this clause of \u00a7 462(a) as presently constituted on three grounds: (1) it lacks the specificity required of a criminal statute, and, hence, its application to the defendants deprived them of due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment; (2) it is unconstitutional on its face because it abridges the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment; and (3) it is unconstitutional as applied to these defendants because it infringes their' right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">\n<em>Void-for-Vagueness Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">The defendants begin their void-for-vagueness argument by quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s formulation of the vagueness doctrine: \u201c[A] statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law.\u201d Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926). Next, to apply this general rule to their case, the defendants adopt the analysis that they assert the Supreme Court recommended in Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 368-370, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), namely, the positing of hypothetical questions in order to determine whether the contours of a statute are reasonably ascertainable. After presenting these questions, the defendants conclude that \u201c[t]he result is that no one can be sure of what among a vast range of possible acts would be criminally prohibited under this statute .... One could hardly ask for a more subjective statutory term in a criminal statute than the term \u2018or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">However, in relation to the vagueness issue, the emphasis, in our opinion, must be on \u201chinder\u201d and \u201cinterfere\u201d rather than on \u201cor otherwise,\u201d <em>i. e., </em>the impact rather than the means of accomplishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">We first note that the difficulty of determining whether certain marginal cases are within the meaning of the language of a challenged criminal statute does not automatically render that statute unconstitutional for indefiniteness. United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-'8, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 1542, 91 L.Ed. 1877 (1947). \u201c[T]he Constitution does not require impossible standards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-16\">Second, a number of courts have found \u201chinder\u201d or \u201cinterfere\u201d or words synonymous with them to be sufficiently precise, see, <em>e. g., </em>Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U.S. 611, 615-616, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 20 L.Ed.2d 182 (1968); People v. Del Toro, 155 Colo. 487, 395 P.2d 357, 358 (1964) ; Powers v. McCullough, 258 Iowa 738, 140 N.W.2d 378, 384-385 (1966). Similar language is used in other federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>criminal statutes, <em>e. g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1510, and these statutes have survived constitutional attack. See, <em>e. g., </em>Anderson v. United States, 215 F.2d 84 (6th Cir. 1954), cert, denied, 348 U.S. 888, 75 S.Ct. 208, 99 L.Ed. 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Further, the words \u201chinder or interfere\u201d must be considered in context, <em>see </em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Whether certain acts hindered or interfered with the administration of the Selective Service Act is a factual question for a jury to determine. The task does not present insuperable difficulties for a jury. In a prosecution under the pertinent part of Section 462(a), the Government has to prove to the jury\u2019s satisfaction that a defendant\u2019s acts had the necessary prohibited impact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. </em>Hartzel v. United States, 322 U.S. 680, 64 S.Ct. 1233, 88 L.Ed. 1534 (1944). In this connection, we point out that the Government also must prove specific intent. That is, not only does the prosecutor have to establish the deleterious effect of a defendant\u2019s actions (or the attempt to achieve that effect), but he must also establish that the defendant <em>knowingly </em>acted with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits. The provision thus exempts innocent or inadvertent conduct. <em>See </em>Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); Hartzel v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In light of these authorities, we conclude that the words \u201chinder or interfere\u201d are sufficiently precise.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Consideration of the additional language \u201cby force or violence or otherwise\u201d does not alter our conclusion. That language indicates the means which one may not use to accomplish the unlawful hindrance or interference. Although the phrase does not specify all the prohibited means, it does adequately inform one that any method by which the purposeful interference is accomplished or attempted to be achieved is improper. Thus, it serves a clarifying function and is not, as the Government surprisingly asserts, \u201cundoubtedly superfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we find that the part of Section 462(a) in question here is not so vague as to violate constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">\n<em>The First Amendment Overbreadth Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">\u201cIn every instance a statute must on its face be at least adequately complete and precise to give notice to reasonable men as to what conduct is prohibited. But a statute\u2019s warning may extend too far \u2014 it may describe and give warning regarding conduct which cannot be constitutionally penalized.\u201d United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340, 355 (7th Cir. 1972), cert, denied, 410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706, (1973) (footnotes omitted). The defendants argue that the relevant clause of Section 462(a) suffers from this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">Judge Fairchild\u2019s explication in <em>Dellinger, supra, </em>of the overbreadth doctrine is germane here. Not only does it pithily summarize a complicated topic, but it is an important and recent precedent in this circuit. Under Judge Fairchild\u2019s analytic approach, a court should answer two main questions: (1) \u201cthe <em>threshold </em>question whether the statute relates to expression and is therefore governed by first amendment considerations,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe <em>removal question, </em>whether the expressive conduct is so related to action that the expression is therefore carved away from the protection of the first amendment.\u201d 472 F.2d at 358. (Emphases in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-18\">As to the first question, we look not merely to the words of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>but to its impact also. Thus, that the challenged clause of Section 462(a) does not explicitly refer to speech or expression does not foreclose the conclusion that it is unconstitutionally overbroad. \u201cCl]f a statute in its impact has or can be expected substantially to involve expression, that must be sufficient, whether or not the words of the statute so provide.\u201d United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The Government admits that the \u201chinder or interfere\u201d clause when linked to \u201cotherwise\u201d accomplishment is susceptible to unconstitutional application. It asserts, however, that the provision affects First Amendment rights in only \u201cremote circumstances\u201d because its aim allegedly is the regulation of noncom-municative conduct only. As further support for the claim that the clause poses no substantial threat to First Amendment interests, the Government argues that no prosecutor has yet misused the statute and that if an overzealous U.S. Attorney were to prosecute someone for privileged conduct, the courts would point out his error.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Government\u2019s response does not still the defendants\u2019 qualms \u2014 nor does it allay our doubts as to the constitutionality question. The existence of the weapon is the chilling factor in inhibiting free expression and the speculative possibility that the weapon might not be used provides scant warmth to one whose proposed expression might conceivably be within wounding range.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In our discussion of the void-for-vagueness issue, we indicated that the challenged provision provides adequate warning because it informs one that all acts the intended effect of which is the hindering of or interfering with the administration of the Selective Service Act are forbidden. The statute, literally read, proscribes the use of <em>any means whatsoever </em>to accomplish the hindrance. In United States v. Eberhardt, 417 F.2d 1009 (4th Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 909, 90 5. Ct. 907, 25 L.Ed.2d 90 (1970), an appeal by Father Philip Berrigan and others from convictions stemming from their having poured blood on Selective Service files in a Baltimore, Maryland, draft board office, the Fourth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">\u201cAlso incorrect is the appellants\u2019 position that the statute requires a showing of \u2018force or violence.\u2019 The statute clearly states that the hindering or interfering may be accomplished by \u2018force or violence or otherwise.\u2019 The words \u2018or otherwise' were added by section 12 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 evincing a plain intention to relieve the prosecution from the obligation to prove the use of aggressive force or violence.\u201d 417 F.2d at 1013 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">In their brief, the defendants present a number of hypothetical situations which the pertinent portion of Section 462(a) would encompass through the \u201cor otherwise\u201d phrase. The gist of these examples is that any person who objects to a particular policy of the Government which implicates the Selective Service system and who wishes his protest to be effective, that is, that the military\u2019s recruitment or draft activities be \u201chindered,\u201d risks being indicted for a felony \u2014even if the protestor confines his efforts to nonforceful means such as speechmaking, pamphleteering, picketing, or peaceful assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">Because the statutory language is broad and unfocused, we cannot determine precisely what conduct \u2014 non-First Amendment activities, activities which at least have colorable claims to First Amendment protection, or both \u2014 it is meant to affect. It is no answer to argue that many broadly-worded laws lend themselves to impermissible applications. We cannot agree that the prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ability of invalid applications of the provision challenged here is simply conjectural or that its impact on protected conduct is slight.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">In sum, the \u201cor otherwise\u201d phrase, by facially outlawing the use of any and all means to accomplish the forbidden hindrance or interference, inescapably comprehends First Amendment interests or, in Judge Fairchild\u2019s words, \u201crelates to expression.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Under the <em>Dellinger </em>analysis, the second pertinent question we must consider is whether the \u201chinder or interfere\u201d clause punishes expressive conduct only when it \u201cis so related to [imminent lawless] action that the expression is therefore carved away from the protection of the first amendment.\u201d Certainly we can conceive of expressive conduct that comes within Section 462(a) and which would not be protected by the First Amendment. For example, as the defendants admit, the purposeful destruction of Selective Service records, even though intended by the actors to be \u201csymbolic\u201d and to express their opposition to the Selective Service system, would not per se be privileged under the First Amendment. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">However, the difficulty with the challenged provision is that its ban is not limited to expressive conduct \u201coutside\u201d the First Amendment. For example, a speaker or writer might declare in strong and persuasive terms that the war in Southeast Asia was intolerable and unconscionable and that every citizen should vocally protest the nation\u2019s participation. Irrespective of the correctness of such a view, its delivery in speech or writing might be accomplished with such a convincing sincerity that young auditors or readers would flee to Canada rather than answering the call of their Selective Service boards. Even though the words had this impact, it would be difficult to conclude that the speechmaking or pamphleteering was other than protected activity. Yet, the actor could be prosecuted for a violation of Section 462(a) in that he had attempted to hinder or interfere with the administration of the Selective Service by means \u201cotherwise\u201d than force or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">If the First Amendment has any substance, it must mean that the Government\u2019s powers, even where the Government is seeking to protect legitimate interests, are not absolute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe protection given speech and press was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). Further, the First Amendment protects us from the \u201ccensorship of ideas [which are] good or bad, sound or unsound . . . .\u201d Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 36, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2621, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). \u201cThe right to speak freely and to promote diversity of ideas and programs is . one of the chief distinctions that sets us apart from totalitarian regimes .... It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\u201d Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S. Ct. 894, 895, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). <em>Cf. </em>Emerson, The Right to Protest, in The Rights Of Americans 208, 224 (N. Dorsen ed. 1970, 1971), \u201cNo society, at least <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>no open society, can expect to achieve a state of perfect order.\u201d The challenged clause is so broadly worded that it interferes with protected conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Although the Government declares that \u201cclearly there is a valid commonsense construction of the statute which avoids abridgment of first amendment interests,\u201d the construction it pro-, poses is the elimination from consideration of the phrase \u201cby force or violence or otherwise.\u201d We have two objections to this proposal. First, we are hesitant to wield the judicial scalpel on a congressional enactment in such a Procrustean fashion, particularly where the most constitutionally troublesome language resulted from an amendment to the basic clause. We would be shirking our duty to evaluate legislation in light of the Constitution\u2019s requirements if we excised doubtful phrases by ingenuously labelling them \u201csuperfluous.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>the dissent in <em>Dellinger, supra, </em>472 F.2d at 412-416. Second, the truncated version would be subject to the same objections. The Government\u2019s duty to prove scienter would be insufficient to save the statute. As the defendants point out, \u201c[i]f intentional conduct could save all statutes from facial invalidity, then the doctrine of facial invalidity could hardly have arisen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A theory of statutory construction which the Government for some reason did not urge is nevertheless of sufficient potential applicability as to require us to address our attention to it. That theory, the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>has been capsulized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cWhere general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of \u2022 persons or things, the general words, under the rule or maxim of construction known as \u2018ejusdem generis,\u2019 will be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those enumerated, unless an intention to the contrary is clearly shown.\u201d 82 C.J.S. Statutes \u00a7 332b, at 658 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Of more particular interest for the present case, the above text states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201cThe rule finds application and has frequently been applied where such terms as \u2018other,\u2019 \u2018any other,\u2019 \u2018others,\u2019 \u2018or otherwise,\u2019 or \u2018other thing\u2019 follow an enumeration of particular classes, and where this occurs such words are to be read as \u2018other such like,\u2019 and are construed to include only others of like kind or character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">On first reading it might appear that the above would be dispositive of the present constitutional issue. However, the determination of whether <em>ejusdem generis </em>is applicable to a particular statute is not that simple a matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">Thus, in Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 56 S.Ct. 395, 80 L.Ed. 522 (1936), the Court had for resolution the question of whether holding an officer to avoid arrest was within the meaning of \u201cheld for ransom or reward or otherwise\u201d in the Federal Kidnaping Act. Just as in the present case, the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d had been added to the original statute by amendment. The defendant contended that the rule of <em>ejus-dem generis </em>applied and that \u201cotherwise\u201d therefore referred to some pecuniary consideration or payment of something of value. The Court, however, while noting that penal statutes are to be narrowly construed and that the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>although well-established, is only an instrumentality for ascertaining the correct meaning of words when there is uncertainty, held that the words added by the amendment sufficiently broadened the statute to include the nonpecuniary situation there involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">A similar result was reached in United States v. Alpers, 338 U.S. 680, 70 S. Ct. 352, 94 L.Ed. 457 (1950). The Court had before it a case in which the Court of Appeals had invoked the rule of <em>ejusdem generis. </em>\u201cSince the words \u2018book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print\u2019 ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>pearing in the statute refer to objects comprehensible by sight only, the court [of appeals] construed the general words \u2018other matter of indecent character\u2019 to be limited to matter of the same genus. The Court of Appeals held phonograph records without the statute, so interpreted, since phonograph records are comprehended by the sense of hearing.\u201d 338 U.S. at 682, 70 S.Ct. at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>if applied would defeat the obvious purpose of the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Similarly, the defendant\u2019s contention that the rule was applicable to restrict the meaning of \u201cother writing\u201d was rejected in Goldsmith v. United States, 42 F.2d 133 (2d Cir. 1930), cert, denied, 282 U.S. 837, 51 S.Ct. 26, 75 L.Ed. 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">On the other hand,, in a civil case, Clarke v. Gold Dust Corp., 106 F.2d 598 (3d Cir. 1939), cert, denied, 309 U.S. 671, 60 S.Ct. 614, 84 L.Ed. 1017 (1940), the court held that under the rule the phrase \u201cor other corporation\u201d employed in a statute must be restricted to corporations similar to those enumerated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Finding it somewhat difficult to ascertain clear guidelines from the foregoing cases and declining to find any significance either in a civil-criminal dichotomy or in a theory that the courts would only not apply the rule of construction when it would result in a reversal of a criminal conviction, we turn to an authoritative textbook for general principles for the application of the rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">\u201cThe doctrine applies when the following conditions exist: (1) the statute contains an enumeration by specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration constitute a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general term follows the enumeration; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">\u201cA \u2018class\u2019 is an artificial creation to provide ease in dealing with numerous items with similar characteristics. Thus \u2018a class\u2019 is a generalization which accurately or inaccurately associates items for a particular purpose or treatment. Without some objective or purpose classification is impossible. Consequently, the rule of <em>ejusdem ge-neris </em>depending as it does on pure form provides a dangerous yardstick with which to measure the statutory coverage which the legislature intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">\u201cThe restrictive effective [sic] of the rule of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is consistent with the nineteenth century suspicion of statutory change. It is another manifestation of the rule that statutes in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed. Usually the legislative intent is directly contrary to the result obtained by the <em>ejusdem generis </em>rule. The legislative intent is to enumerate specific objects or conditions which have come to their attention, but this enumeration is not intended to limit the operation of the statute to the specific objects set forth. They provide express examples of the problem; the legislative intent is to regulate <em>the problem </em>and not the <em>enumeration.\u201d </em>2 J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 4910, at 400-1 (3d ed. by F. Horack, 1943) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Upon the basis of the foregoing as elaborated upon by the subsequent explanatory text, \u00a7\u00a7 4911-14, we conclude that the doctrine is not applicable here. We note the following specific factors. (1) The terms preceding the general term \u201cotherwise\u201d are general and in their generality contain no particular aspects of diversity of meaning. (2) The preceding terms substantially embrace the characteristic which they both describe, thereby indicating that the phrase \u201cor otherwise\u201d would take a meaning beyond the class. (3) The application of the rule would render the general words substantially meaningless for the reason there is nothing <em>ejusdem generis </em>to fall within their purview. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>(4) The contrary intent is apparent in the words here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">By way of elaboration upon the last point, which apparently has been considered a crucial one, <em>e. g., </em>in United States v. Alpers, <em>supra, </em>we turn to eases and legislative \u2022 history involving Section 462(a). As we have noted hereinbefore, at least one appellate court has rejected a restrictive construction of the present statutory provision. United States v. Eberhardt, <em>supra. </em>A pre-amendment decision, Bagley v. United States, 136 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1943), is pertinent to this matter. The indictment there charged that the defendant did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cknowingly, unlawfully and feloniously hinder and interfere by force and violence with the administration of this Act [Selective Training and Service Act of 1940] . . . and did . make to and in the presence of [three witnesses] ... a threat to inflict bodily harm upon the members of Local Board No. One . . . .\u201d 136 F.2d at 568 n. 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, holding that the indictment did not allege and the proof adduced did not make out the offense. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cThe language in which th'\u00e9 act was couched was not put there by accident or inadvertence. It was carefully chosen by Congress ... in order to insure, the fullest preservation of freedom of opinion and expression, that the act would not be the instrument of partisan prosecution to suppress that freedom, and that prosecutions under it would be brought only where there was forcible rather than ideological opposition to the draft [T]he force and violence charged were the mere utterance of words under circumstances which could not amount to acts of force and violence, hindering and interfering with the draft board in the performance of its duties.\u201d 136 F.2d at 569, 570.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The defendant had said that he was \u201c100% for Hitler,\u201d had destroyed an occupational questionnaire, and had boasted that he would destroy the next questionnaire sent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Clearly, the Government had attempted to prosecute defendant Bagley for speaking. And, although the basis for the appellate court\u2019s reversal is somewhat ambiguous, the thrust of the opinion is that the statutory prohibition of forceful and violent means did not encompass the \u201cmere utterance of words,\u201d at least absent circumstances showing that the threatener was capable of and intended to carry out his threats physically to harm the board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\"><em>Bagley </em>was one of only two cases involving the challenged portion of the statute between 1940, when the original statute was passed, and 1948, when the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d were added. That addition was the only significant, substantive change. In Senate Report No. 1268 of May 12, 1948, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">\u201cThis subsection [section 12(a)] provides the same penalties for violations of the provisions of this legislation as were provided for violations of the 1940 act, and is substantially a reenactment of section 11 of that act. Certain changes of language have been made to incorporate judicial determinations made pursuant to the predecessor act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">The defendants contend that this legislative history in light of <em>Bagley </em>reflects that \u201cCongress intended to enlarge the scope of the statute so as to abridge First Amendment rights.\u201d We decline to ascribe this malevolent purpose to Congress. However, we do find it clear that Congress did intend the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d to be meaningful, not just superfluous. Having rejected <em>ejusdem generis, </em>we must find that the words, whether or not Congress specifically meant them to be so, are sufficiently broad to include interference or hindrance by protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">The Government\u2019s other \u201csolutions\u201d to the problems the challenged clause raises are also inadequate. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>noted before, its sanguine assurance that prosecutors will not misuse the statute does not obviate the disturbing fact that the statute\u2019s coverage includes privileged activity. The Government\u2019s argument that if abuses do occur the courts will rectify them deserves more extended comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">It is clear that there is no \u201cabsolute\u201d right to freedom of expression. The Government may impose certain limitations on even clearly First Amendment-protected conduct; regulation of time, place, and manner, for example, is permissible. See, <em>e. g., </em>Adderley v. Florida, 385 U.S. 39, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 554-555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965); Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). Thus, although a statute restricts the exercise of certain First Amendment rights, the statute is not necessarily invalid. The determination whether a given law is unconstitutional requires a subtle analysis that takes into account a variety of factors, including a balancing of competing interests and goals, those of the Government and those of the individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We are of the opinion that a decision that the challenged clause is unconstitutional in a particular case would not establish whether the clause would be deemed unconstitutional in other situations. In other words, because of the wide range of activities that the clause encompasses and the special considerations relevant to each situation, it is likely that no single opinion resolving a case or controversy can clearly and coherently delineate the division between constitutional and unconstitutional applications. Consequently, although we have held that the challenged provision of Section 462(a) is not overly vague on its face, we think that, in reference to conduct privileged under the First Amendment, it fails to give adequate guidance both to potential actors and to law-enforcement officials. \u201cA person contemplating action within the literal scope is left in doubt whether his claim of privilege will be upheld, unless his situation is on all fours with that of an earlier claimant. To be rid of doubt he must be able not only to predict and assess the context and consequences of planned action, but also must^guess how events will be reflected on a cold record in a reviewing court.\u201d Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 844, 872 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Apparently only one other court has ruled on the constitutionality of the challenged portion of Section 462(a). In United States v. Farinas, 308 F.Supp. 459 (S.D.N.Y.1969), conviction affirmed on appeal, 448 F.2d 1334 (2d Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 405 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 946, 30 L.Ed.2d 810 (1972), the defendant unsuccessfully challenged the clause in a motion to dismiss the indictment. The indictment had charged him, <em>inter alia,, </em>with having violated the provision \u201cin that after being warned that activity disruptive of the processing of other registrants would constitute a felony he had persisted in such activity by making speeches, distributing literature and engaging in boisterous and unruly behavior.\u201d 308 F.Supp. at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">In a cursory discussion, the district court \u201cresolved\u201d the constitutional issues by approving language from United States v. Spock, 416 F.2d 165, 173 n. 20 (1969), wherein the First Circuit had rejected a challenge to another clause of Section 462(a) and had disposed of the overbreadth argument urged there by stating it is \u201c[t]he court\u2019s obligation . to make sure that such a statute does not improperly infringe upon speech in any particular instance.\u201d After quoting from <em>Spock </em>the <em>Farinas </em>court concluded that whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was privileged \u201cmust await development of the facts upon trial.\u201d 308 F.Supp. at 466-67. The <em>Farinas </em>decision thus avoids the difficult questions that Judge Fairchild in <em>Dellinger, supra, </em>stated a court must face and which we, in the present case, have tried to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>In United States v. Dellinger, <em>supra, </em>472 F.2d at 357, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of overbreadth applies when a statute lends itself to a substantial number of impermissible applications, such that it is capable of deterring protected conduct, when the area affected by the challenged law substantially involves first amendment interests, and when there is not a valid construction which avoids abridgment of first amendment interests.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">As we indicated in the foregoing discussion, we think that the present case meets the criteria for the application of the overbreadth doctrine. The challenged clause of Section 462(a) is unconstitutional on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">We do not lightly decide to invalidate a congressional enactment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, we are convinced that Congress, in seeking to promote what is undoubtedly a valid governmental interest, namely, the smooth administration of the Selective Service Act, legislated too broadly. We stress that we are <em>not </em>holding that Congress may not protect that legitimate interest. We do hold that the challenged provision\u2019s substantial curtailment of the citizens\u2019 right to exercise peacefully their First Amendment liberties \u2014 liberties so cherished that we accord them \u201cpreferred status\u201d \u2014is an improper remedy. Not only does the \u201cor otherwise\u201d provision reach privileged conduct and arguably privileged conduct, but it admits of no reasonable construction limiting the wide range of its application to such conduct. In short, the Congress paid insufficient attention to the constitutionally-mandated requirement of precision in drafting so as to avoid or to minimize conflict with First Amendment rights. An overinclu-sive proscription resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">We are of the opinion the better procedure is that of invalidating the clause now rather than choosing to pursue the alternative course of overturning particular invalid applications one by one as they arise. Under these circumstances, we find it unnecessary to determine whether the challenged clause is invalid as applied to the defendants here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3xL\">\u201cThe traditional and \u2018restrained\u2019 approach when ...

On or about April 29, 1971, at Evanston, in the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, John Wayne Baranski, Thomas Peter Clark, Eileen Marie Kruetz, and Mary Elizabeth Lubbers placed and caused to be placed in the office of Local Draft Boards 98, 99 and 100 of the Selective Service System located at 912 Chicago Avenue, Evanston, Illinois, approximately 15 pink envelopes containing a yellow letter entitled \u201cLetter to Evanston Draft Board Members\u201d, and dated April 29, 1971 and signed \u201cThe Four of Us, John Wayne Baranski, Thomas Peter Clark, Eileen Marie Kru-etz, Mary Elizabeth Lubbers.\u201d Also placed in the office of Draft Boards 98, 99 and 100 was a letter to \u201cDear Friends\u201d dated April 29, 1971 and signed \u201cIn Love and Hope for peace, The Four of Us\u201d with signatures, John, Eileen, Mary Beth, and Thom. The reverse side of this letter is entitled \u201cFact Sheet Biographies\u201d and set forth a biography of each of the four signatories of the above letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-11\">. In part, Count III charged that the four defendants \u201cdid willfully and knowingly hinder, interfere <em>and attempt to do so, </em>by force, violence <em>and otherwise, </em>with the administration [of the Selective Service Act and regulations thereof] by entering the offices - . . . and removing, tearing, and pouring a red liquid substance over Selective Service files and thereby destroying official records contained therein and by disrupting official activities at said location; in violation of Title 50 Appendix, United States Code, Section 462(a).\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-20\">Of significance to the disposition reached, the \u201cremoving,\u201d \u201ctearing,\u201d \u201cpouring,\u201d and \u201cdestroying\u201d would appear to be the only activity of the defendants which could reasonably be equated with \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cviolence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\">. These other issues are: (1) whether the trial judge erred by failing to examine prospective jurors regarding their possible religious prejudices and prejudices against anti-war activists; (2) whether the judge violated Rule 43, Fed.R.Crim.P., by communicating with the jury off the record and outside the presence of the defendants in respect to questions submitted by the jury during its deliberations; (3) whether the judge erred by responding as he did to the jury\u2019s questions; and (4) whether the supplemental, allegedly \u201cAllen-type\u201d charge given by the judge on his own motion was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AFh\">. Count IV, the conspiracy count, charged, in part, a conspiracy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhA\">\u201cto willfully hinder and interfere with the administration of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967, in violation of Title 50 Appendix, United States Code, Section 462(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtsQ\">The count also charged a conspiracy to violate two other statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1361 and 2071, the subjects of substantive counts I and II, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"AqS8\">The full text of Count IV is set forth in the appendix of this opinion,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b617-8\">. The fact that \u201cattempt\u201d is expressly included in \u00a7 462(a) would not change the requisite proof as an attempted act would necessarily have to have the prohibited impact of hindrance or interference upon accomplishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\">. <em>Of. </em>Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 373, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 1323, 12 L.Ed.2d 377 (1964), \u201cWell-intentioned prosecutors ... do not neutralize the vice of a vague law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b618-15\">. As previously noted, the jury may well have received the impression that the Government considered the word \u201cotherwise\u201d to be broad sweeping.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">. <em>See </em>Scanlon, A Theory of Freedom of Expression, 1 Phil. &amp; Public Affairs 204 (1972) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-11\">\u201cThe doctrine of freedom of expression is generally thought to single out a class of \u2018protected acts\u2019 which it holds to be immune from restrictions to which other acts are subject, . . . [0]n any strong version of the doctrine there will be cases where protected acts are held immune from restriction despite the fact that they have as consequences harms which would normally be sufficient to justify the imposition of legal sanctions. It is the existence of such cases which makes freedom of expression a signifcant doctrine</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\">. Our finding of invalidity is restricted to the \u201chinder or interfere\u201d clause of Section 462(a). That clause is clearly separable from the rest of Section 462(a), and we express no opinion as to the constitutionality</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">of the other provisions of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\">. Our holding that the challenged clause is unconstitutional on its face also makes it unnecessary for us to reach the other issues raised on this appeal. (See footnote 2, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">We do note, however, that the issue regarding the \u201cAllen-type\u201d charge has been decided adversely to the position of the defendants in the recent <em>en bane </em>decision of this court in United States v. Silvern, 484 F.2d 879 (7th Cir., 1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b625-16\">. Although we reverse the judgments of conviction, we note that the securing of a new indictment containing no reference to a conspiracy to violate the clause of 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 462(a) successfully challenged here and limited to constitutionally valid \u201cobjects\u201d would be permitted. <em>Of. </em>United States v. Beard, 414 F.2d 1014, 1017 (3d Oir. 1969).
