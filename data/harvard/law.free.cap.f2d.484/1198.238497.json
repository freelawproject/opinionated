The district court appears to have acknowledged that the information furnished appellant was erroneous, but reasoned that at th\u00e9 time of the reception of the plea the clear guidelines of United States v. Conway, 415 F.2d 158 (3d Cir. 1969), had not yet been announced. Such an approach does not appear to recognize that <em>Conway </em>simply applied the teachings of Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370 (1957), a decision handed down twelve (12) years prior to the plea in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We deem as inapplicable to these proceedings the doctrine of Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), that a subsequent change in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>law which greatly reduces the possible sentences which might have been imposed does not vitiate a previously entered guilty plea. The clarification of the law did not originate in <em>Conway, </em>it stemmed from <em>Prince.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">In United States v. Jasper, 481 F.2d 976 (3d Cir., 1973), we reported that \u201cthe court\u2019s first advice gave too low a maximum, the statement by the Assistant United States Attorney assumed, contrary to <em>Prince </em>that the sentence could be pyramided, and the court, while finally stating the correct maximum on each count, did not correct the pyramiding; misstatement.\u201d We held that defendant\u2019s acknowledgment that he understood this colloquy \u201cis hardly sufficient to indicate that he knew the real potential consequences of his plea.\u201d (481 F.2d 981.) <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, we are convinced that the controlling principle is that stated in Berry v. United States, <em>supra, </em>412 F.2d at 191: \u201cWhether prejudice resulted from the entry of the guilty plea is not measured by the severity or leniency of the sentence imposed; prejudice inheres when an accused pleads guilty, thus convicting himself of a criminal offense, without understanding the significance or consequences of his action.\u201d The appellant having been told that the maximum sentence was 75 years, when in fact the maximum was considerably less than that, we are persuaded that there was not total compliance with F.R.Cr.P. 11, McCarthy v. United States, <em>supra, </em>and that he did not enter his plea with \u201cunderstanding of the . . . consequences of the plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">The plea of guilty will be vacated, the sentence imposed thereon will be vacated, and the proceedings remanded with a direction to permit appellant to plead anew.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">. Berry v. United States, 412 F.2d 189, 192 (3d Cir. 1969), citing United States ex rel. Crosby v. Brierley, 404 F.2d 790 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">. Appellant entered his plea October 23, 1969, subsequent to McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b). The sentence was modified on January 15, 1970, to imprisonment for a period of 7 years under the provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(c) of the Youth Corrections Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">. In <em>Prince </em>the defendant had been sentenced to 20 years for robbery of a federally insured bank and 15 years for entering the bank with the intention to commit a felony. The Court held that \u201cwhen Congress made either robbery or an entry for that purpose a crime it intended that the maximum punishment for robbery should remain at 20 years, but that, even if the culprit should fall short of accomplishing his purpose, he could be imprisoned for 20 years for entering with the felonious intent.\u201d 352 U.S. at 329, 77 S.Ct. at 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">In this case, appellant was indicted in four multiple counts charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (b) and (d). Count one charged a taking by force and violence the sum of $474.00 belonging to the bank, a violation of (a). Count two also referred to (a), charging an entering of the bank to commit a felony. Count three charged a violation of (b), the actual taking. Count four charged a violation of (d), \u201cputting in jeopardy\u201d the lives of others while committing (a) and (b). In the statutory text, a violation of (a) calls for a penalty of 20 years for the robbery clause, or the entering clause. Section (b), the larceny clause, calls for a 10-year penalty. Section (d) is the use-of-firearm clause with its 25-year penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">The following colloquy took place at the plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXAV\">THE COURT: Do you know on each of those counts if you enter a plea of guilty you could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 years and/or a fine of $5,000.00; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-14\">APPELLANT: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-15\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your honor, I believe it is 20 years on the first two counts, and 25 years on the fourth count, a total of 75 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-16\">THE COURT: All right, I stand corrected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-17\">Do you understand that, Mr. Kelsey, 20 years on the first two counts, 10 years on the third count and 25 years on the fourth count?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-18\">APPELLANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-19\">Without dissecting the entire colloquy, we note that the use of the 75 years by defense counsel had the capability of being interpreted as follows: count one, 20 years; count two, 20 years; count three, 10 years; count four, 25 years, or a total of 75 years. By the court\u2019s statement: \u201cAll right, I stand corrected,\u201d the court unwittingly endorsed the erroneous computation of appellant\u2019s counsel. <em>Prince </em>flatly held that there could not be an accumulation of sentences on counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-20\">In any event, the government does not in its brief suggest that appellant was not misinformed, but contends that this was harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1254-7\">. In dissent, Judge Van Dusen stated: \u201cOn the facts presented by this record, I would apply the holdings in the Fifth and Tenth Circuits that misinformation, given to a defendant at arraignment by a district judge, which indicates a possible longer sentence than the law permits does not invalidate a plea of guilty entered after receipt of such misinformation. United States v. Woodall, 438 F.2d 1317, 1329 (5th Cir. 1971) ; Murray v. United States, 419 F.2d 1076, 1079 (10th Cir. 1969).\u201d 481 F.2d at 984. The majority rejected his view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
