The dam is neither in the survey or planning stage, nor is it before Congress for authorization or construction. Those stages have long since passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Inasmuch as the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331 et seq., are applicable to this project, the district judge quite appropriately ordered the Corps of Engineers to supplement their final Environmental Impact Statement so as to include the view of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. His view was that the 1972 Amendments were applicable and that no value for water quality storage could be assigned as a benefit in the dam project. The Environmental Impact Statement will appropriately reflect those views.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-13\">. 33 U.S.C. 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Those sections provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">(b) (1) In the survey or planning of any reservoir by the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, or other Federal agency, consideration shall be given to inclusion of storage for regulation of streamflow, except that any such storage and water releases shall not be provided as a substitute for adequate treatment or other methods of controlling waste at the source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-27\">(b) (3) The need for, the value of, and the impact of,fr storage for water quality control shall be determined by the Administrator, and his views on these matters shall be set forth in any report or presentation to Congress proposing authorization or construction of any reservoir including such storage.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
