The evidence of guilt is summarized in the opinion of the Appellate Court of Illinois affirming the conviction. People v. Allum, 78 Ill.App.2d 462, 223 N.E.2d 187 (1st Dist. 1967). At his trial, and also on appeal, petitioner was represented by retained counsel. The competence of his counsel is evident from our examination of the trial transcript and is not challenged by petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-21\">Robert J. Welsh, one of the police officers who took defendant into custody immediately after the incident, testified on behalf of the prosecution. Although officer Welsh\u2019s testimony is not mentioned in the Appellate Court\u2019s summary of the evidence of guilt, it provides the basis for petitioner\u2019s collateral attack on his conviction because officer Welsh described an oral statement which petitioner made after he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-22\">Petitioner\u2019s oral statement, as described in Welsh\u2019s testimony, contained no incriminating admission, but in one respect was inconsistent with the testimony which petitioner later gave in his own defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *In other respects, however, the in-custody statement tended to support petitioner\u2019s defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At no point during the testimony about peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>tioner\u2019s in-custody statement did petitioner\u2019s counsel make any objection. On the contrary, he cross-examined the officer to bring out certain facts helpful to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On November 19, 1971, petitioner initiated his first collateral attack on the conviction by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the court below. He alleged that officer Welsh\u2019s testimony about his in-custody statement was improperly received under the rule of Es-cobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758,12 L.Ed.2d 977.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The district court, after appointing counsel, dismissed an amended petition for failure to exhaust state remedies. On appeal petitioner argues that there is no available state remedy and therefore the exhaustion requirement is inapplicable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee responds, alternatively, (1) it is not entirely clear that no state remedy exists and the only way to find out is for petitioner to give the Illinois courts an opportunity to consider his claim, or (2) if no Illinois remedy exists, it is because petitioner has deliberately by-passed an adequate remedy and therefore federal relief is also barred. Petitioner\u2019s rejoinder to the second response is that he did not knowingly waive any constitutional right and should not be foreclosed by his counsel\u2019s oversight. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438-440, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">We agree with petitioner\u2019s analysis of the Illinois post-conviction procedures. It is perfectly clear that neither the statutory writ of error <em>cor-am nobis,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor state habeas corpus <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is available. The remedy which is arguably available is relief under the Illinois Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Ill.Rev. Stat. Ch. 38, \u00a7 122-1 et seq. However, in construing that statute the Illinois Supreme Court has held that if an error which could have been raised on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>is not raised, it is deemed waived for post-conviction purposes. There are exceptions to the waiver rule if the defendant was deprived of his right to appeal, or his appellate counsel was incompetent, or if \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d would be offended by enforcing a waiver. See People v. Frank, 48 Ill.2d 500, 272 N.E.2d 25, 27 (1971). Petitioner\u2019s analysis of the Illinois cases indicates that none of the exceptions to the waiver rule is applicable here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Respondent argues that the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d exception is sufficiently imprecise to make it inappro--' priate for a federal court to assume jurisdiction without first giving the Illinois courts an opportunity to construe their own waiver rule. We reject this argument for two reasons. First, we agree with petitioner that this exception has only been applied in fairly clear-cut situations, none of which fits this case. Second, even if a broader and more subjective test of fundamental fairness is applicable, our own appraisal of the record leads us rather confidently to the conclusion that there is nothing fundamentally unfair in the application of the waiver rule to the issue petitioner seeks to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">This is quite clearly a case in which the exhaustion defense, if upheld, would merely burden the state judiciary and the petitioner with a series of futile proceedings which would eventuate in the refiling of a federal petition like the one now before us. Since we would then be faced with respondent\u2019s second argument \u2014that the federal claim was waived by the failure to object to the admissibility of the statement at trial \u2014 the interests of justice will be served by deciding that issue now.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">The explanation for the unavailability of any state remedy is the failure by petitioner\u2019s counsel to object to the admissibility of the evidence he now challenges. In these circumstances, respondent argues, the omission should be treated as a \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d which bars a federal collateral attack as well as state post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">If an alleged error was not even called to the attention of the state trial judge, it is normally inappropriate for a federal court to review the issue unless, of course, extraordinary circumstances, such as a subsequent change in the law, are asserted. Usually, there-' fore, a waiver of a valid constitutional claim in the trial court should foreclose that claim as a basis for post-conviction collateral relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">The Illinois procedures as a whole are tantamount to a rule providing that if an objection, even on constitutional grounds, to the admissibility of evidence is not made at or before trial, the objection should be deemed to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>been waived unless \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requires a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">If the failure to object was a deliberate tactical decision made by the petitioner himself with a full understanding of his legal rights, it would clearly waive his federal, as well as his state, right to object to the use of that evidence. If, however, the failure was a tactical decision by his lawyer, made without his express approval, or was an oversight by trial counsel, petitioner contends that the waiver should be ineffective for federal purposes though it does end state review of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Petitioner relies on language from the opinion in Fay v. Noia which has been frequently quoted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That case involved a collateral attack by one of three defendants convicted of murder on the basis of coerced confessions which had been received in evidence over their timely objections at the trial. Direct appeals and subsequent legal proceedings by the two co-defendants resulted in their release. Fay had not appealed, apparently fearing that a new trial might ultimately result in the imposition of the death penalty. Under New York practice, his failure to appeal waived error in the admission of his coerced confession. On review of the district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas corpus relief, the Supreme Court held the waiver ineffective. See 372 U.S. at 446, 83 S.Ct. 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">The Court\u2019s opinion emphasizes the importance of the defendant\u2019s participation in the waiver decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is worthy of note, however, that the Court did not say that a decision made by counsel, in which the defendant did not participate, can never bar relief. On the contrary, the Court stated only that such a decision \u201cdoes not automatically bar relief.\u201d 372 U.S. at 439, 83 S.Ct. at 849. We infer that in some situations the acts of counsel, although not explicitly approved by the defendant, may fairly effect a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">If counsel is to have the responsibility for conducting a contested criminal trial, quite obviously he must have the authority to make important tactical decisions promptly as a trial progresses. The very reasons why counsel\u2019s participation is of such critical importance in assuring a fair trial for the defendant, see Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, make it inappropriate to require that his tactical decisions always be personally approved, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>even thoroughly understood, by his client. Unquestionably, assuming the lawyer\u2019s competence, the client must accept the consequences of his trial strategy. A rule which would require the client\u2019s participation in every decision to object, or not to object, to proferrefd evidence would make a shambles of orderly procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We have no doubt that a deliberate tactical decision by competent counsel not to object to the admission of evidence may waive his client\u2019s right to claim that the use of the evidence was constitutional error. In this case, however, petitioner claims that the failure to object was the result of an \u201coversight\u201d by his lawyer. He implicitly argues that the effectiveness of a waiver turns on a subjective appraisal of the advocate\u2019s actual motivation. To make that appraisal he contends that an evidentiary hearing is required even though a perusal of the trial transcript strongly indicates that counsel made a deliberate tactical decision to permit officer Welsh to testify about the in-custody statement. We believe the Court\u2019s recent decision in Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233, 93 S.Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973), dictates rejection of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In <em>Davis </em>the Court held that a collateral attack on a federal conviction based on a claim of unconstitutional discrimination in the composition of the grand jury was foreclosed by the failure to make the objection in advance of trial. The waiver rule which the Court enforced, Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, provides that the failure to raise any defense to the institution of the prosecution by motion before trial \u201cconstitutes a waiver thereof, but the Court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.\u201d This rule is not unlike the Illinois waiver rule which forecloses collateral relief unless \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d makes relief from the waiver appropriate. Since the federal rule barred the constitutional claim even though the failure to make a timely objection may well have been the product of counsel\u2019s oversight, rather than deliberate, the Court squarely rejected the argument that cases applying the rule of Fay v. Noia make any waiver of constitutional rights ineffective unless deliberately made and expressly approved by the defendant. Even the dissenting opinion in <em>Davis </em>would accept certain oversights \u2014 or at least failure to act with diligence \u2014 as a \u201cdeliberate relinquishment\u201d of a constitutional claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">The question of whether there has been an effective (or \u201cdeliberate\u201d) waiver turns, we believe, not on subjective motivation, but on an evaluation of the act or omission giving rise to the waiver, as well as the significance of its consequences. So analyzed, we are persuaded that the failure to object at trial to the admissibility of testimony describing petitioner\u2019s in-custody statement gave rise to the kind of waiver that should be placed in the same category as a \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d of state remedies barring subsequent collateral attack in the federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">The facts which we find persuasive are these: First, the omission giving rise to the waiver occurred in the trial court as well as on appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ond, there was a reasonable tactical basis for counsel\u2019s failure to object to the statement. Third, the claim in this case is entitled to no greater respect than the constitutional claim which the Court rejected in <em>Davis. </em>The rule of the <em>Escobe-do </em>case is not applied retroactively, Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 ;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is enforced for prophylactic reasons and does not call into question the accuracy of the fact-finding process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor does this case involve conduct offensive to civilized standards of decency.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We therefore conclude that even if petitioner is correct in his interpretation of the Illinois waiver rule, the order dismissing the habeas corpus petition must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-15\">. The inconsistency is somewhat bizarre. Officer Casey had testified that he arrived at the decedent\u2019s apartment in response to a call, looked through the bedroom window while standing on a ladder after attempting in vain to obtain entry into the apartment, and observed the defendant engaged in an act of sexual intercourse with the victim. Petitioner\u2019s in-custody statement to officer Welsh was consistent with this testimony. However, at trial petitioner testified that he was merely shaking the decedent for the purpose of awakening her when the officer saw him through the window. Tr. 164, 186-187, 194, 199.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-23\">. For example, on direct examination officer Welsh testified that the petitioner had stated that he had been having trouble with a peeping Tom in the neighborhood. Tr. 119. On cross-examination officer Welsh quoted petitioner as denying that he had had a fight with the decedent or had struck her; the officer further quoted him as saying: \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t hurt her, she is a lovely person; that he would never hurt her\u201d (Tr. 126), and that he had lived with her for approximately seven or eight years. The examination about the in-custody statement further tended to establish a contradiction between officer Welsh\u2019s trial testimony and testimony he gave at the coroner\u2019s inquest with respect to the extent of petitioner\u2019s intoxication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. In the district court petitioner relied on the following excerpt from <em>Escobedo :</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cWe hold, therefore, that where, as here, pect has been taken into police custody, the the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an-unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the sus-police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to elicting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the State by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. [335] at 342, 83 S.Ct. [792] at 795, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 at 804, 93 A.L.R.2d 733, and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d 378 U.S. at 490-491, 84 S.Ct. 1765.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">It is arguable that petitioner\u2019s allegations were insufficient because the statement was not incriminating, but for purposes of decision we assume that a timely objection would have been sustained. In explanation of the failure to raise the point previously, petitioner alleged that \u201cthe man representing me gave very poor concern for my rights.\u201d R.2, page 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-14\">. 28 U.S.O. \u00a7 2254(b) provides \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, <em>or that there is either an absence of available State corrective process or the ex- . istence of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights of the prisoner.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-16\">.

Burns v. People, 9 111. 2d 477, 138 N.E.2d 525 (1956). Moreover, the two-year statute of limitations, see \u00a7 72(3), would bar a 1973 claim based on a 1965 conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b796-17\">. The Illinois habeas corpus remedy is available if the trial court had no jurisdiction or if an event subsequent to the conviction entitles the defendant to his discharge. See 111. Rev. Stat. Ch. 65, \u00a7 22; People ex rel. Haven v. Macieiski, 38 Ill.2d 396, 398, 231 N.E. 2d 433 (1968) ; People ex rel. Skinner v. Randolph, 35 Ill.2d 589, 590, 221 N.E.2d 279 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b797-9\">. \u201cAmong the small number of reported cases where \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 necessitated the relaxation of the waiver rule are: People v. Hamby, 32 Ill.2d 291, 205 N.E.2d 456 (1965) where the issues raised in the post-conviction petition were the same issues which the petitioner had repeatedly requested his attorney to raise on direct appeal; his attorney had refused such requests; and petitioner had been denied leave to present these issues <em>pro se </em>on appeal; People v. Raymond, 42 Ill.2d 564, 248 N.E.2d 663 (1969), where the petitioner alleged in his post-conviction petition that the state had knowingly suppressed evidence at trial favorable to his case; People v. Ikerd, 47 Ill.2d 211, 265 N.E.2d 120 (1970), where the allegation in the post-conviction petition was based upon a right recognized for the first time after the defendant\u2019s direct appeal; and People v. Somerville, 42 Ill.2d 1, 245 N.E.2d 461 (1969), where the petitioner alleged that he was deprived effective assistance of counsel at trial. However, it is most significant to note that the Illinois Supreme Court went on in <em>Somerville </em>to invoke the waiver rule barring review of the petitioner\u2019s additional claim that her constitutional right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was also violated. The Illinois Supreme Court held that, \u2018since no motion to suppress was made, nor was the issue raised in any way at the trial or in any way of the appeals, we must agree with the State that such claim is untimely made in this post-conviction proceeding.\u2019 245 N.E.2d at p. 468.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s brief, pp. 9-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\">. \u201c . . . the federal habeas judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has deliberately by-passed the orderly procedure of the state courts and in so doing has forfeited his state court remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"amj-dedup-0\">\u201cBut we wish to make very clear that this grant of discretion is not to be interpreted as a permission to introduce legal fictions into federal habeas corpus. The classic definition of waiver enunciated in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 [58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461], . . . \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u2019 \u2014 furnishes the controlling standard. If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief if the state courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the merits \u2014 though of course only after the federal court has satisfied itself, by holding a hearing or by some other means, of the facts bearing upon the applicant\u2019s default. . . . the standard here put forth depends on the considered choice of the petitioner. ... A choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief. Nor does a state court\u2019s finding of waiver bar independent determination of the question by the federal courts on habeas, for waiver affecting federal rights is a federal question. . . . Each case must stand on its own facts.\u201d 372 U.S. at 438-440, 83 S.Ct. at 849.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b798-16\">. That emphasis is, of course, entirely appropriate with respect to major decisions, such as the entry of a guilty plea, the waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, or the decision not to appeal, which are appropriately made only with a full understanding of the consequences of the available alternatives. In such cases, counsel\u2019s advice is of the utmost importance, but ultimately the client\u2019s decision is controlling. The waiver in Pay v. Noia was of that character.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. In his dissenting opinion Mr. Justice Marshall stated: \u201cI have little difficulty in saying that, where one must present evidence in order to support a constitutional claim, the failure to exercise due diligence in searching for that evidence is a deliberate relinquishment of that claim.\u201d 411 U.S. at 256, 93 S.Ct. at 1590.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\">. In this respect this ease is therefore like <em>Davis </em>and unlike Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 22 L.Ed.2d 227, and Fay v. Noia, <em>supra, </em>which the dissenters in <em>Dams </em>considered controlling. Accordingly, if a federal court were now to entertain petitioner\u2019s collateral attack, it would be reviewing an issue which has never been presented to any Illinois judge. It is noteworthy that in <em>Kaufman </em>the first point made in explanation of the inapplicability of the \u201cdeliberate by-pass\u201d claim was that \u201ccounsel had objected at trial. . . . \u201d 394 U.S. at 220 n. 3, 89 S.Ct. 1068.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b800-13\">. <em>Cf. </em>Curtis Publishing Co. v.
