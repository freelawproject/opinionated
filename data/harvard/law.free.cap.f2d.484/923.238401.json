Sec. 151 et. seq. \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1) by engaging in threats of reprisal, coercive interrogation, promises and grants of benefits and 8(a)(3) and (1) in discharging employees because of their union activity are amply supported by the record as a whole. Further, because the Board\u2019s findings are clearly supported, we cannot regard the company\u2019s resistance thereto as anything but frivolous: \u201cSome penalty should attach to taking up our time with such a meritless contention.\u201d N.L.R.B. v. Smith &amp; Wesson, 424 F.2d 1072, 1073 (1st Cir. 1970). Application for enforcement of the order of the National Labor Relations Board is granted and pursuant to FRAP 38 the Board will recover, in addition to its regular costs, the sum of $250 for expenses.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
