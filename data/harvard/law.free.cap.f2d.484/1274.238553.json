She was sentenced to two-year terms of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a)(2) on each count to run concurrently. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-25\">The exact Fourth Amendment issues raised by appellant were decided in favor of the government position in the companion case of United States v. Ogden, -F.2d-(9th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-26\"> We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government on this appeal. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Mrs. Ogden was in Nebraska when her husband, David Ogden, was growing and harvesting marijuana and was aware of his activities. She was traveling with him to Monterey, California at the time of their arrest and had in her possession claim cheeks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>to three pieces of baggage which contained either contraband or paraphernalia for making marijuana bricks. The trier of fact was not compelled to believe Mrs. Ogden\u2019s self-serving story, corroborated by her husband, that she was not involved in the growing, harvesting, and distribution of marijuana. United States v. Cisneros, 448 F.2d 298 (9th Cir. 1971). We agree with the conclusion of the district court that the evidence was sufficient to convict Mrs. Ogden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">The trial judge properly complied with Rule 23(c), F.R.Cr.P., by filing the findings of fact in- a memorandum decision, although subsequently to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
