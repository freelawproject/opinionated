Alleging that he was a seaman, Foret sued his employer and rig owner Reading and Bates Offshore Drilling Co., the plat,form owner Atlantic Richfield, and the railing manufacturer J. Ray McDermott, Inc. for damages and maintenance under the Jones Act, general maritime law, and Louisiana tort law. The District Court entered an order granting summary judgment for Reading and Bates on the ground that Foret was <em>not a </em>seaman and therefore has no maritime claim against his employer and for Atlantic Richfield on the ground that \u201cit had nothing to do with the operations being conducted by Reading &amp; Bates . . . at the time of the accident.\u201d Foret appeals from this order. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">\u201cIn a multiple party suit, such as this one, a summary judgment adjudicating the claims or rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties is not a final appealable judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 unless the district court makes (1) an \u2018express determination that there is no just reason for delay\u2019 and (2) \u2018an express direction for the entry of judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).\u201d Melancon v. Ins. Co. of North America, 476 F.2d 594 (1973). Since the District Court did not make either the requisite \u201cexpress determination\u201d or the requisite \u201cexpress direction\u201d here, this court \"is without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Melancon v. Ins. Co. of North America, supra; Bailey v. Rowan Drilling Co., 441 F.2d 57 (CA5, 1971); United States v. Crow, Pope, and Land Enterprises, Inc., 474 F.2d 200 (CA5, 1973). <em>See also </em>6 J. Moore, Federal Practice, ([ 54.34 [2.-2] n. 10 (2nd Ed. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-18\">If the District Court enters a new judgment and accompanies it with a Rule 54(b) certificate, the appeal from that new judgment may be submitted on the record and briefs prepared for this appeal as supplemented by the new judgment and certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-19\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
