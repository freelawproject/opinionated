If this is true, and if the circumstances of appellant\u2019s confinement are no different than those of adult offenders, then we have no doubt that some kind of relief is appropriate. As Mr. Chief Justice Burger has stated, \u201cthe basic theory of [the Youth Correction Act] is rehabilitative and in a sense this rehabilitation may be regarded as comprising the <em>quid pro quo </em>for a longer confinement but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo in an ordinary prison.\u201d Carter v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 306 F.2d 283, 285 (1962). <em>See </em>Harvin v. United States, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 199, 445 F.2d 675, 678-682 (1971) (en banc); United States v. Howard, 146 U.S.App.D.C. 10, 449 F.2d 1086, 1092-1093 (1971) (citing Harvin). <em>See generally </em>United States v. Alsbrook, 336 F. Supp. 973 (D.C.1971); United States v. Lowery, 335 F.Supp. 519 (D.C.1971). Consequently, we remand this ease and order that a hearing be held to determine whether appellant is receiving treatment as mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">The order of the district court will be affirmed and the case will be remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the instructions in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
