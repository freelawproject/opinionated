Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b515-16\">DYER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">This appeal raises two questions: (1) whether an in rem judgment was properly entered against the SS PORTO-RIA even though the vessel was not arrested; and (2) whether the vessel owner, Industr\u00edale Mar\u00edtima S.P.A., is subject to an in personam judgment as a carrier because the voyage sub-charterer of the vessel issued a bill of lading subscribed \u201csigned as per authority of the Master.\u201d Because the district court erroneously resolved both these questions in the affirmative in granting judgment against the vessel and against the owner, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">The PORTORIA, owned by Industr\u00ed-ale, transported a cargo of wire rod from Antwerp, Belgium to Houston, Texas in February and March 1968. The contract of carriage was entered into between Associated Metals &amp; Minerals Corp., the owner of the cargo, and Cobelfret Lines, the voyage sub-charterer from the time charterer, Skaarup Shipping Corporation. Cobelfret issued a bill of lading containing the clause \u201csigned as per authority of the Master.\u201d Because of alleged rust damage to the cargo, Associated brought this action which resulted in an in rem judgment against the vessel, and an in personam judgment against the owner and the voyage charterer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-19\">It is undisputed that no process in rem was issued, the PORTORIA was not arrested, and the owner did not waive attachment of the vessel. Thus it is clear that the district court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>entering an in rem judgment against the ship. As we said in Dow Chemical Co. v. Barge UM-23-B, 5 Cir. 1970, 424 P. 2d 307, 311:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">[N]o process in rem ever issued against the barge and it was not arrested. Attachment subjecting the res to the jurisdiction of the court is a prerequisite to a finding of in rem liability. Lewis v. Maritime Overseas Corporation, D.Or.1958, 163 F.Supp. 453; 1 Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 11 at p. 20; <em>see </em>Ex Parte Republic of Peru, 1943, 318 U.S. 578, at 587, 63 S.Ct. 793, 87 L.Ed. 1014; The Resolute, 1897, 168 U.S. 437, at 439, 18 S.Ct. 112, 42 L.Ed. 533.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Turning now to the in personam liability of the owner, Industr\u00edale contends that since the cargo owner\u2019s cause of action was based on the Carriage of Goods by Seas Act (COGSA), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1300 et seq., there could be in person-am liability only if the owner was a carrier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying on a failure of proof by the cargo owner that the vessel owner granted authority to the voyage charterer to sign the bill of lading on its behalf, Industr\u00edale asserts that there was no contract between it and Associated, and that the district court erred in entering an- in personam judgment against it. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In the recent Second Circuit case of Demsey &amp; Associates v. SS SEA STAR, 2 Cir. 1972, 461 F.2d 1009, even though the words \u201cfor the Master\u201d appeared on the bill of lading signed by the agent of the voyage charterer, the court concluded that \u201c[bjecause, however, Atlantic [the vessel owner] did not authorize World Bulk\u2019s agent [the voyage charterer] to issue the bills of lading, Atlantic is not liable <em>in personam.\u201d </em>Id. at 1015. It would seem self-evident that it was cargo\u2019s burden to show that the owner was a party to the contract between cargo and the voyage charterer and its failure so to do establishes that cargo never relied upon the owner to perform the contract of carriage, but relied exclusively upon the voyage charterer to insure the proper carriage of goods. <em>See </em>International Selling Corporation v. Aiden Shipping Company, Ltd, S.D.N.Y.1972, 1972 A.M.C. 669; Tube Products of India v. SS RIO GRANDE, S.D.N.Y.1971, 334 F.Supp. 1039; United Nations Children\u2019s Fund v. SS NORDSTERN, S.D.N.Y.1965, 251 F.Supp. 833; Scrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading (17th ed. 1964) p. 51.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Because of our disposition of the case we do not reach the other points raised by cargo. The judgment of the district court is reversed and judgment is rendered in favor of the SS PORTORIA, her engines etc., and Industr\u00edale Mar\u00edti-ma S.P.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-20\">. Cobelfret Lines, the voyage charterer, did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">. Section 1301(a) of COGSA defines a carrier as \u201cthe owner or the charterer who enters into a contract of carriage with a shipper.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-19\">. Cargo\u2019s contention that owner\u2019s counsel made a judicial admission of liability and cargo\u2019s alternative argument premised on tort liability of the owner are without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
