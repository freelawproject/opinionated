He was sentenced to the custody of the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>General for five years imprisonment. Defendant was tried by the district court on the basis of stipulated evidence which had been adduced at a pre-trial hearing on a motion to suppress, the motion having alleged a fourth amendment violation. The sole issue presented on appeal is whether a search of defendant at the airport by deputy marshals violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On 9 September 1971, at approximately 12 o\u2019clock midnight, Deputy United States Marshal Paul Pongrace, assigned to the Air Piracy Detail at O\u2019Hare Airport, was observing passengers who were waiting to board an American Airlines flight to San Francisco. Deputy Pon-grace noticed defendant Fern sitting in a lounge in the boarding area. It appeared to Deputy Pongrace that the defendant was pretending to read a newspaper and thereby conceal the fact that he was glancing about at the people around him. He observed defendant change his seat several times, leaving a carryall suit bag behind but at all times clutching a white flight bag. Prior to the 12:05 departure time, Deputy Pon-grace cheeked with the ticket agent and was informed that defendant had purchased a one-way ticket to San Francisco. He then determined that Fern met the basic characteristics of the air piracy personality profile. Pongrace and a second deputy marshal positioned themselves at the boarding gate in order to cheek the identification of Fern and another profile selectee. When Fern approached, the marshals identified themselves and asked defendant for some personal identification. He produced a New York State driver\u2019s license in the name of William Fern and a Canadian citizenship paper bearing the name of \u201cGum Chien Leong\u201d. He claimed that he lived in San Francisco but, when asked where in San Francisco he resided, he answered that he did not know the address. He also claimed that he was traveling from New York to San Francisco although his ticket stub showed that he had boarded in Chicago. Throughout the encounter defendant stammered, \u201cperspired profusely\u201d and exhibited other numerous mannerisms.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A search of defendant\u2019s person produced nothing. However, at the conclusion of the search defendant suddenly backed up against the jetway wall. Deputy Pongrace grabbed his flight bag and felt a hard object like a weapon. He handed the bag to the other deputy to be searched. The marshal opened the bag and pulled out a hair dryer. A further search revealed a clear, plastic bag filled with heroin and two newspaper-wrapped bricks of smoking opium.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Defendant contends that had the marshals sought a search warrant prior to the search, they would not have been able to establish probable cause justifying the issuance of a search warrant. Nor, argues defendant, does the case involve consent, hot pursuit, exigent circumstances, or something in plain view\u2014 any of which would constitute an exception to the general rule excluding evidence obtained as a result of a warrant-less search and seizure. Finally, recognizing the possible applicability of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed.2d 889 (1968), defendant argues that Deputy Pongrace did not have knowledge of sufficient \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d so as to \u201creasonably warrant\u201d the search involved. 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S. Ct. 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Defendant admits that in three recent decisions the Courts of Appeals for the Second, Third and Fourth Circuits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> have sustained narcotics seizures in cases comparable to the case at bar. United States v. Bell, 464 F.2d 667 (2nd Cir. 1972); United States v. Epperson, 454 F.2d 769 (4th Cir. 1972); United States v. Lindsey, 451 F.2d 701 (3rd Cir. 1971). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>However, he contends that each case is distinguishable on its facts from his case. He notes that in both <em>Bell </em>and <em>Epperson, </em>a magnetometer (a metal detecting device) was utilized and revealed a high metallic content on the defendants which neither defendant was able to explain. Defendant suggests that in each case the magnetometer results provided the reasonably articulate level of suspicion of physical danger which justified the search and seizure. Thus, he argues that the failure to use the magnetometer in his case precluded a <em>Terry </em>showing which could have justified the search and seizure. In <em>Lindsey, </em>the marshal had also observed the nervous mannerisms of the defendant and, when he asked the defendant for identification, was given conflicting identifications. Having noted bulges in Lindsey\u2019s coat pocket, the marshal conducted a pat-down search and found the bulges \u201cvery solid\u201d. He extracted from the pocket two aluminum-wrapped packages later found to contain heroin. Because of the possibility of an airplane highjacking and the limited time the marshal had to act, the court held that \u201cthe level of suspicion required for a <em>Terry </em>investigative stop and protective search should be lowered.\u201d 451 F.2d at 703. Defendant characterized this holding as \u201ca drastic constitutional principle . . . justified solely -on the basis of the danger that skyjacking presents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The government contends that the <em>Terry </em>decision clearly establishes that the reasonable suspicion required to justify an investigatory stop is determined by the context of each case, <em>i. e., </em>a flexible rather than a fixed standard. It correctly notes that the Supreme Court established a balancing test in which \u201cthe governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion\u201d is balanced against the particular invasion of \u201cthe constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen\u201d caused by the search and seizure. <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1879. The governmental interest includes not only the prevention of crime, but also the protection of the officer and \u201cother prospective victims of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, 88 S.Ct. at 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In the instant case the government argues that the governmental interest in preventing the crime of skyjacking at the only point where such prevention is practical, <em>i. e., </em>on the ground, and its interest in protecting \u201cother prospective victims of violence\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>the airline passengers, justified not only the stop of defendant but also the search of his flight bag. In addition, it argues that the marshals possessed knowledge of an ample number of \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d to justify the search of the defendant. Besides their observation of defendant\u2019s suspicious behavior and the conflicting identifications for which defendant was unable to offer a satisfactory explanation, the marshals had determined that defendant met the basic characteristics of the air piracy personality profile used by the Federal Aviation Administration. With reference to defendant\u2019s criticism that the characteristics constituting the air piracy profile were too limited in number and too broad in scope, the government notes the testimony of John T. Dailey, a psychologist for the Federal Aviation Administration. At trial Dr. Dailey cited a study of 60 prior airplane skyjackings which revealed that all 60 of the skyjackers fit the characteristics of the profile, whereas only one per cent of all airplane passengers fit the profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Concerning defendant\u2019s contention that the use of a magnetometer should be an important, if not essential, prerequisite to an airport-boarding search, the government cites additional testimony of Dr. Dailey to the effect that the magnetometer is not indispensable to the successful operation of the anti-skyjacking system and in fact can be separated. <em>Lindsey, supra, </em>is also cited as authority for the proposition that the use of a magnetometer is not an absolute prerequisite to an airport-boarding search.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">We find considerable merit in each of the arguments advanced by the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>ment. The authorities cited provide ample support for its position that sufficient \u201cspecific and articulable facts\u201d existed to justify the marshals\u2019 stop of defendant and the search of his flight bag. The facts available to the marshals would have clearly warranted a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the action taken was appropriate. <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 23, 88 S.Ct. 1868. The governmental interests which justified the stop and search are so obvious and of such vital importance that courts are now \u201ctreating airport security searches as an exceptional and exigent situation under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d United States v. Moreno, 475 F.2d 44, 48 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">As was well stated by the 5th Circuit in <em>Legato,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">In United States v. Moreno . . , this court recognized that the public danger posed by air piracy has transformed the airport into a \u201ccritical zone where special fourth amendment considerations apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">[T]he Moreno court made it clear that such an intrusion is not unconstitutional if it is based upon a particularized set of facts which reasonably substantiates the investigating officer\u2019s belief that the individual searched was armed in some fashion and hence a threat to air security. United States v. Legato, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">Commenting on that question of reasonableness, the 5th Circuit in Skipwith stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">In the critical pre-boarding area where this search started, reasonableness does not require that officers search only those passengers who meet a profile or who manifest signs of nervousness or who otherwise appear suspicious. Such a requirement would have to assume that hijackers are readily identifiable or that they invariably possess certain traits. The number of lives placed at hazard by this criminal paranoia forbid taking such deadly chances. . . . United States v. Skipwith, <em>supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">We are not troubled by the fact that the marshals extended their search to include defendant\u2019s flight bag. The following passage from the <em>Moreno </em>decision demonstrates why airport security officers have not been limited to the traditional stop and frisk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-15\">In applying <em>Terry, </em>were we to hold that airport security officials must always confine themselves to a \u201cpat down\u201d search where there is a proper basis for an air piracy investigation, we think that such a per se restriction in the final analysis would be self-defeating. We have already pointed out that the hijacker can conceal explosives or weapons in places which might be overlooked in the course of a cursory pat down. It should be emphasized that such a search is not primarily for the investigating officer\u2019s protection, but rather for the protection of a distinct and uniquely threatened class \u2014 this nation\u2019s air carriers, their crews and passengers. 475 F.2d at 51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-27\"> District Judge Myron D. Gordon of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\">. Since the instant case was argued here, the 5th Circuit in two separate decisions handed down June 14, 1973, United States v. Skip-with, 482 F.2d 1272, and United States v. Legato, 480 F.2d 408, have also sustained nar-cot\u00edes seizures in similar situations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b723-17\">MYRON L. GORDON, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AED\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-18\">I respectfully dissent. The issues presented by the instant case are two-fold: first, whether probable cause existed for the search and secondly, whether the appellant voluntarily consented to the search. I find neither probable cause nor consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-19\">Airport searches have provoked a large amount of recent litigation. See such decisions as United States v. Ruiz-Estrella, 481 F.2d 723 (2d Cir., 1973); United States v. Moreno, 475 F.2d 44 (5th Cir. 1973); United States v. Skipwith, 482 F.2d 1272 (5th Cir., 1973); United States v. Legato, 480 F.2d 408 (5th Cir., 1973); United States v. Davis, 482 F.2d 893 (9th Cir., 1973); United States v. Doran, 482 F.2d 929 (9th Cir., 1973); United States v. Echols, 477 F.2d 37 (8th Cir., 1973); United States v. Kroll, 481 F.2d 884 (8th Cir., 1973), and United States v. Wilkerson, 478 F.2d 813 (8th Cir., 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>I do not believe that the type of \u201cstop and frisk\u201d situation discussed in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) is applicable here. In <em>Terry, </em>the Court determined that a \u201cfrisk\u201d or limited search for weapons \u201cconstitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished personal security\u201d, but the Court concluded at p. 29, 88 S.Ct. at p. 1884:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">\u201c. . . The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">There is no inherent right to travel to a certain place in a particular aircraft. Accordingly, airline authorities may condition the sale of a ticket or permission to board the airplane upon a person\u2019s consent to be searched for weapons, explosives, and the like. One\u2019s consent to such a search should be reasonably express; it should not be broadly implied because the consent to a search amounts to a waiver of a fundamental constitutional right. Waiver in this context means the \u201cintentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">It is clear from the facts of this case that the search of the appellant\u2019s handbag conducted here cannot be brought within the ambit of <em>Terry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The mere fact that the appellant fitted a \u201cbehavioral profile\u201d does not constitute probable cause for the search in this case. Moreover, when faced with a heated issue such as this, I think we might reflect on the unfortunate ruling in Ko-rematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 65 S.Ct. 193, 89 L.Ed. 194 (1944), before approving the search in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"AT9\">In the recent case of Condrado Almei-da-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 274, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2540, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">\u201c. . . It is well to recall the words of Mr. Justice Jackson, soon after his return from the Nuremberg Trials:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a_s-dedup-0\">\u2018These [Fourth Amendment rights], I protest, are not mere second-class rights but belong in the catalog of indispensable freedoms. Among the deprivations of rights, none is so effective in cowing a population, crushing the spirit of the individual and putting terror in every heart. Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government.\u2019 Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 180 [69 S.Ct. 1302, 1313, 93 L.Ed. 1879] (Jackson, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">\u201cThe Court that decided Carroll v.

But that Court resisted the pressure of official expedience against the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">I believe that the evidence was illegally seized and must therefore be suppressed.
