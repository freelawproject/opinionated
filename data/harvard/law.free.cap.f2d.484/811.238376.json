W.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Snow waived his right to a jury trial and was tried before a judge alone. In such circumstances, Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the court to enter findings of fact to support its verdict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No findings were entered in this case. Although the trial judge directed the prosecutor to prepare the findings for the court\u2019s approval, the prosecutor apparently never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-29\">This error frustrates our review of the case. Snow\u2019s main argument on appeal is that the prosecution failed to prove that he acted with criminal intent \u2014 an essential element of the criminal charge. Referring to our opinion in Castle v. United States, 120 U.S. App.D.C. 398, 400, 347 F.2d 492, 494 (1965), Snow maintains that his escape was \u201can act committed under compulsion, such as apprehension of serious and immediate bodily harm . \u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We said in <em>Castle </em>that such an act is \u201cinvoluntary, and, therefore, not criminal.\u201d A determination as to whether Snow\u2019s escape falls into that category necessarily involves issues of fact. On the present record, however, we have no indication of the trial court\u2019s findings on the factual questions. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>cannot tell whether the judge failed to consider Snow\u2019s defense, whether he did not recognize compulsion to be a defense to the criminal charge, or whether he decided that the facts do not support a finding of compulsion. Since there are colorable questions on factual issues in this case, the case must be remanded for the entry of findings of fact dealing-with all elements of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Judge Tamm\u2019s suggestion that a remand here is a \u201cwaste of judicial time\u201d is a serious concern in an era when the District Court\u2019s caseload is heavy. The proper way to save time in this case, however, would have -been to enter the required findings within a reasonable period after the original trial. In a decision requiring a somewhat similar statement from trial judges, it was recognized that \u201c[s]uch a [statement] is not onerous if the matter was dealt with in a conscientious manner in passing on the merits.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The requirement that a trial judge prepare findings which will cast light on his reasoning is not a trivial matter. It is an important element of fairness to the accused. As a distinguished trial judge has observed, \u201cThe existence of a rationale may not make the hurt pleasant, or even just. But the absence, or refusal, of reasons is a hallmark of injustice.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the trial court\u2019s statement is an important element of judicial administration, because \u201c. an appellate court must be able to ascertain the grounds for [a lower court\u2019s decision] in order to fulfill its responsibility of review.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">For these reasons, we remand the case for the entry of findings, as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-20\">. The charge was brought under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-22\">. The rule requires findings of fact \u201con request\u201d. In this case, where the trial judge recognized the need for findings and directed that they be prepared, it was unnecessary for counsel to make a request.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b865-31\">. The record indicates that Snow had been accused by other inmates in the halfway house of stealing clothing from a room in the house. Snow\u2019s testimony, which was partially corroborated by another witness, described an atmosphere of hostility, threats, and fighting during the weekend when Snow escaped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b866-9\">.

The pertinent rule (Rule 23) provides that where required the district judge shall provide pertinent findings before the appellate judges consider whether there has been prejudicial error.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b866-14\">TAMM, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Amg\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">I would affirm the action of the district court in this case. It is my view that a remand to the district court for the entry of findings of fact is a waste of judicial time on the part of both this court and the district court. The record before us is sufficient by my standards to justify affirmation of the appellant\u2019s conviction and does not justify a further waste of judicial time in pursuit of a legal trivia.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">JUDGMENT</p>\n<author id=\"b866-17\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b866-18\">On April 25, 1973 an order was entered remanding the record to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion filed herein on the same date. The record has been returned supplemented by the remand proceedings. On consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b866-19\">Ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the District Court appealed from in this cause is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-20\">The duty of counsel is fully discharged without filing a suggestion for rehearing <em>en banc </em>unless the case meets the rigid standards of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 35(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
