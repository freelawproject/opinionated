The district court, 344 F.Supp. 183, held that the presumption must control unless there is evidence of continued life during the seven-year period. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">After an evidentiary hearing and an appeal, the Secretary denied a claim for child\u2019s insurance benefits under \u00a7 202(d) of the Social Security Act, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 402(d). The child\u2019s mother then brought this action in the district court pursuant to \u00a7 205(g), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). From a summary judgment in her favor, the Secretary has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">At the time of his departure in November, 1958, the wage earner was known as Ernest Ballard. Prior to his marriage to the plaintiff in July, 1955, he had been known as Earl Bullard. The Hearing Examiner found that he was an unstable person with expensive habits. During the marriage, plaintiff\u2019s savings were dissipated and she found it necessary to file bankruptcy proceedings. The family moved several times. In January, 1958, the claimant was born. Ballard failed to provide adequate support for the child. In November, 1958 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>plaintiff and the child returned to her mother\u2019s home in Kankakee. Advised of Ballard\u2019s intent to visit them, plaintiff arranged to have him arrested upon his arrival at the railroad station and jailed for non-support. At the court hearing, he signed an agreement to support the child and was released. He then expressed an intent to visit his child that afternoon, but in fact left for parts unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">In 1966 plaintiff filed an application for widow\u2019s insurance benefits, which was denied and is not before us. In 1969 she applied, on behalf of her son, for a child\u2019s benefit. The claim was rejected on the basis of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s determination that Ballard\u2019s \u201cabsence was not unexplained within the meaning of \u00a7 404.705.\u201d Although the record contains some hearsay evidence of continued life,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Examiner\u2019s decision rested squarely on the pre-depar-ture facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">The district court recognized that this is a \u201ccase of first impression\u201d in this circuit and described an apparent conflict in other court of appeals decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>The court concluded that it would be paradoxical to permit the same pre-de-parture evidence both to create the presumption and to destroy it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In our opinion the same evidence is not self-contradictory. The evidence which raises the presumption is proof that Ballard was absent and unheard of for a period of seven, years <em>after </em>November 15, 1958. The evidence on which the Secretary relies to rebut that presumption concerns events <em>on or before </em>November 15, 1958. The Secretary\u2019s analysis is not paradoxical; it may nevertheless, of course, be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">To place the legal issue in proper focus, it is useful to differentiate between the character of an explanation and the time when it is made. One may easily posit eases in which a fugitive\u2019s pre-de-parture statements so plainly describe an intent to disappear completely from former associates \u2014 such as an estranged spouse, muscular creditors, or a strict commanding officer \u2014 that a continued life under a new identity is at least as probable as death even though seven years have elapsed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pushed to its logical conclusion the rule which the district court has followed would mean that after an absence of seven years death must be presumed no matter how strong the evidence of intent to disappear and to effect a complete change of identity, provided there were no post-departure explanation of his whereabouts. There are four reasons why we believe the Secretary\u2019s regulation did not promulgate such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">First, history teaches us that deliberate desertions do in fact take place frequently. Whatever our personal predilections might be, the statute does not authorize the payment of benefits to deserted victims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A wage earner\u2019s prolonged absence, which is more probably the consequence of deliberate desertion by a living spouse or parent than of death, should not, therefore, create a right to statutory benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Second, the Secretary\u2019s regulation is quite obviously based on the common law presumption. As we read the common law authorities, the presumption of death resting on evidence of an absence for seven years, could be rebutted either by (a) evidence of continued life during that period, or (b) evidence of motivation that created a probability of continued life notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>standing the lack of any communication from the absentee for a prolonged period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, pre-departure evidence was admissible to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Third, the text of the regulation itself quite plainly authorizes alternative means of rebutting the presumption. The regulation requires that the individual be \u201cunexplainedly absent\u201d and also \u201cunheard of\u201d for a seven-year period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The presumption then applies \u201cin the absence of any evidence to the contrary.\u201d A fair reading of this language indicates that the Secretary may adduce evidence to contradict either the unexplained character of the absence or the fact that the individual has not been heard of for seven years. If only the latter evidence were admissible, the requirement that the absence be unexplained would be meaningless. For by hypothesis every absence that meets the second requirement will be unexplained during the entire period 'subsequent to the last time anyone had heard of the absentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">Finally, we are told that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation has been consistently followed in thousands of cases since the regulation was first promulgated in 1951.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There is no suggestion that this interpretation is not completely consistent with the governing statute. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his own regulation is therefore entitled to great respect. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F. C. C., 395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371; Universal Battery Co. v. United States, 281 U.S. 580, 50 S.Ct. 422, 74 L.Ed. 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">Having concluded that ' predeparture evidence may support a finding that the wage earner\u2019s absence is not unexplained, the only issue which remains is whether the evidence in this record is sufficient to support that finding. This is a question of fact controlled by the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review. Under that standard, we are satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to support the Secretary\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-15\">. \u201cWhenever it is necessary to determine the death of an individual in order to determine the right of another to a monthly benefit or a lump-sum payment under section 202 of the Act, and such individual has been unexplainedly absent from his residence and unheard of for a period of seven years, the Administration, upon satisfactory establishment of such facts and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, will presume that such individual has died.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.705.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-6\">. A cousin informed a Social Security investigator in 1967 that he had not heard from Ballard \u201cin at least two or three years,\u201d implying that he had heard from him several years after his departure; Ballard\u2019s sister said she had not heard from him for about seven years, again implying a possible communication after 1958. She also indicated that her cousin had told her that Ballard, was living with another woman near Paw Paw Lake, Michigan \u201cabout four years ago.\u201d Tr. 115, 116, 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b945-7\">. \u201cRegardless of this fact, the wage earner\u2019s absence for more than seven years does not appear to be an unexplained absence. The family\u2019s many moves, the wage earner\u2019s expensive habits, his instability, a separation in the marriage that occurred before his disappearance, and an arrest brought about by the information that the claimant furnished the police would suggest much domestic discord existing since the marriage of the claimant and the wage earner on July 6, 1955. The wage earner was apparently in good health and may well have found reason to disappear and escape the discord he found in his home.\u201d Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision at 3. The Secretary\u2019s redetermination was, however, based in part on the evidence of continued life. Tr. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\">. Even if there is a conflict between the important decisions of other courts of appeals, it does not seem as grave to us as it did to the district court. In Dowell v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 809 (6th Cir. 1967) and Miller v. Richardson, 457 F.2d 378 (3rd Cir. 1972), the courts accepted the factual determination of the Secretary that pre-departure evidence effectively explained the insured\u2019s absence and, thus, rebutted the presumption that he was dead. In Gardner v. Wilcox, 370 F.2d 492 (9th Cir. 1966), the court similarly held that pre-departure evidence was relevant to deciding whether the insured\u2019s absence was explained or not, and that there was not insufficient evidence for such a finding on the facts presented. Since the Hearing Examiner had not weighed the evidence, however, but had maintained that if <em>any </em>explanatory evidence were forthcoming, the absence could not, as a matter of law, be \u201cunexplained,\u201d the court remanded the case to him to make a specific finding of fact. The district court, and Judge Chambers dissenting in <em>Wilcox, </em>thought the decision inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s prior ruling in Secretary v. Meza, 368 F.2d 389 (1966). In that case, plantiff\u2019s husband had left her in 1948. As late as 1954, Social Security records showed him employed in another jurisdiction. More than seven years after 1954, plaintiff applied for benefits. The court held that 1954 constituted a second disappearance and that the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that there was ' an explanation for that disappearance was not supported by substantial evidence. If the case cannot be reconciled with <em>Wilcox, </em>as Judge Chambers thought,' the inconsistency lies in the application of the substantial evidence test, which does not concern us here. We cannot agree with the district court that <em>Meza </em>held that pre-departure evidence was not relevant, for in that case, Judge Duniway said, \u201cThe presumption [of death] can . be dissipated in two ways. One would be by presenting evidence that the missing person is alive .... <em>The other showing would he hy proof of facts that rationally explain, the anomaly of the disappearance in a manner consistent with continued life.\u201d </em>368 F.2d at 392 (emphasis added). Aubrey v. Richardson, 462 F.2d 782 (3rd Cir. 1972) may, however, be different, though it does not squarely contradict our holding. The court said that it disagreed with the Secretary\u2019s position that \u201cno affirmative evidence that the insured is alive is necessary.\u201d 462 F.2d at 784. As we read the opinion, the court does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>not foreclose reliance upon pre-departure evidence. It felt, however, that more \u201cthan mere conjecture\u201d as to possible explanations is necessary, quoting Judge Duniway\u2019s language, <em>supra, </em>but adding the gloss that the facts must be those \u201cwhich do \u2014 not merely may\u201d rationally explain the absence. 462 F. 2d at 785. The court concluded that the facts before it \u2014 including the Departmental Appeals\u2019 Council\u2019s reversal of the Hearing Examiner\u2019s award of benefits \u2014 did not amount to more than conjecture. Judge Van Dusen dissented, maintaining that facts not dissimilar to those before us, did constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. \u201cAt best, the uncontradicted evidence, as hereinabove summarized, indicates that there did exist a motive for Ballard\u2019s possible desertion of the family on November 15, 1958. There is no evidence of the continued life of Ballard after that date, unless the same evidence of disappearance, which raises the presumption of death, will support an overriding inference of continued life. In the view of this court, the regulation will not permit interpretation which produces such such a paradoxical result.\u201d Decision of the District Court at 188.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b946-14\">. Seven years is an arbitrary period, adopted by English courts confronted with absences of men who had run off to sea, by analogy from the statutes governing bigamy, 1 Jac. I ch. 11 (1604) and estates for life, 19 Car. II ch. 6 (1667). The origin of the rule appears to be Doe v. Jesson, 6 East 80, 102 Eng.Rep. 1217 (1805). It is said that after the elapse of seven years, the ordinary presumption of ongoing life ceases, and that of death arises. J. Thayer, A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law 323 (1898).

It has been plain since the presumption of death was first firmly established that evidence concerning the circumstances of depart-ture are relevant to deciding whether, in any particular case, death will be presumed. Writing for the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1840, Chief Justice Shaw said: \u201cThe presumption is greatly strengthened when departure of an individual was from his native place, the seat of his ancestors, and the home of his brothers and sisters, and family connections; and still further, when it was to enter upon the perilous employment of a seafaring life <em>and </em>when he has not been heard of, by those who would be most likely to know him, for upwards of thirty years.\u201d Loring v. Steineman, 1 Metcalf 204, 211 (emphasis added). It is also clear that evidence concerning the motive for desertion may tend to rebut the presumption: \u201cThe strength of this presumption varies with the circumstances; its force depends on the character of the person, his attachment to his home, and the circumstances under which he left. . . . Evidence tending to show the desire of the absent person to conceal his identity, . . . that he was a fugitive from justice, or any other fact or circumstance surrounding his disappearance, tending to support or rebut the presumption is admissible.\u201d Wachovia Bank <em>&amp; </em>Trust Co. v.
