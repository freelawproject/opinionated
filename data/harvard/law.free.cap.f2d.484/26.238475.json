The appellant contends that the district court in imposing sentence improperly denied his request for a civil commitment made under Title II of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4251 et seq. The appellant claims that the district court denied him NARA treatment on the basis of the statutory exclusion from such treatment of defendants previously convicted of two or more felonies. Appellant urges that the statute so providing is unconstitutional. The record of the sentencing proceeding clearly indicates that the district court considered a range of factors such as the defendant\u2019s criminal record and marital history in reaching the decision to deny the defendant\u2019s request for NARA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>treatment and that the denial of the NARA sentencing alternative was based on the court's exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">We affirm on this ground and do not, therefore, reach the issue of the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4251(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
