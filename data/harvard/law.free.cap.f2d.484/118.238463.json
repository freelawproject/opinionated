He asserts that the district court abused its discretiori when it permitted the government to place in evidence three marijuana cigarettes found on his person at the time he was arrested with a commercial quantity of the substance in his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">To keep out the evidence, the appellant had offered to stipulate that he was acquainted with the characteristics of marijuana, the principal purpose for which the three cigarettes were being offered. The government rejected the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">We find no abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Deck v.
