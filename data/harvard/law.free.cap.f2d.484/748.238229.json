The lower court condemned the shipment because the defendant\u2019s production procedure violated the \u201ccurrent good manufacturing practice\u201d (GMP) provision of the Act, 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). Appellant contends that that provision is unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment because of its alleged vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>The GMP provision stems from congressional concern over the danger that dangerously impure drugs might escape detection under a system predicated only on seizure of drugs shown to be in fact adulterated. In order to insure public safety,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 Congress determined in 1962 that it was necessary to regulate the means of production themselves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cA drug . . . shall be deemed adulterated ... if ... the methods used in, or the facilities or controls for, its manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to or are not operated or administered in conformity with current good manufacturing practice to assure that such drug meets the requirements of this chapter as to safety and has the identity and strength, and meets the quality and purity characteristics, which it purports or is represented to possess. . . . \u201d 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 351(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">By way of implementation, the FDA has promulgated detailed regulations to spell out the precise requirements of the section. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 133 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The district court found violations of GMP standards by defendant which include the failure to keep basic production records, inadequate testing of active ingredients before use, and insufficient tests of the finished product prior to shipment. These findings are not contested on appeal and we therefore consider them established.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">In Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 86 S.Ct. 518, 15 L.Ed.2d 447, the Court stated: \u201cIt is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause if it is so vague and standardless that it leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits or leaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402-403, 86 S.Ct. at 520.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-16\">Appellant contends that \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B) fails to meet this standard. We conclude that the term \u201ccurrent good manufacturing practice\u201d adequately defines a standard which the Administrator was authorized to particularize in interpretative regulations. Defendant does not deny that the regulations, which he has plainly violated, were adequate to notify him that his', conduct was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-17\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on attacks on the statutory terms \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201cgood.\u201d The term \u201ccurrent\u201d was considered by the Supreme Court in Connally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 46 S.Ct. 126, 70 L.Ed. 322. In <em>Connally, </em>the court struck down an Oklahoma statute which prohibited the payment of \u201cless than the current rate of per diem wages in the locality where the work is performed.\u201d The crucial failing of the statute related to the nonexistence of any determinable current wage rate and the ambiguity of the term \u201clocality.\u201d See 269 U.S. at 393-395, 46 S.Ct. at 128. Whatever strength the <em>Connally </em>decision has today, it does not compel the same result in a far different context. We have no trouble with the use of the word in \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B). The term \u201ccurrent\u201d fixes the point in time when the acceptability of the relevant production practices must be determined. Thus, the statute does not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>mit prosecution for failure to follow safety practices which were not recognized prior to the production of the subject drugs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">The term \u201cgood\u201d likewise acquires adequate meaning when read in context even though, as defendant observes, a good dictionary lists a good many definitions of the word. Alternative definitions do not create impermissible ambiguity if the relevant definition is capable of interpretation by reference to objective criteria. We believe that \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B) affords sufficient guidance to avoid the problem encountered in Ricks v. District of Columbia, 134 U.S. App.D.C. 201, 414 F.2d 1097 (1965), and United States v. Margeson, 259 F.Supp. 256 (E.D.Pa.1966), where the challenged vagrancy statutes required one to give a \u201cgood account\u201d of oneself. The word \u201cgood,\u201d as used in the GMP provision, is not unduly subjective.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The Constitution requires only a reasonable degree of certainty in statutory language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">\u201c . . . [F]ew words possess the precision of mathematical symbols, most statutes must deal with untold and unforeseen variations in factual situations, and the practical necessities of discharging the business of government inevitably limit the specificity with which legislators can spell out prohibitions. Consequently, no more than a reasonable degree of certainty can be demanded. Nor is it unfair to require that one who deliberately goes perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that he may cross the line.\u201d Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U.S. 337, 340, 72 S.Ct. 329, 330, 96 L.Ed. 367.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Appellant also ignores the detailed regulations promulgated by the FDA which considerably illuminate the statutory language.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 21 CFR \u00a7 133 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">In view of the customary presumption of constitutionality <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the established high regard for the purposes of the Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we readily sustain the GMP provision. The language utilized by Congress in this statute is neither less certain nor more difficult to interpret than language elsewhere in the same Act which has been upheld. See United States v. Sullivan, 332 U.S. 689, 68 S.Ct. 331, 92 L.Ed. 297 (\u201cadequate directions for use, such adequate warnings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>against use . . . dangerous to health, or against unsafe dosage . as are necessary for the protection of users\u201d); United States v. Shreveport Grain <em>&amp; </em>Elevator Co., 287 U.S. 77, 53 S.Ct. 42, 77 L.Ed. 175 (\u201creasonable variations shall be permitted\u201d); United States v. 2600 State Drugs, Inc., 235 F.2d 913 (7th Cir. 1956) (\u201cnot safe for use\u201d). The same can be said of language contained in other statutes. See Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U.S. 611, 616, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 20 L.Ed.2d 182 (\u201cunreasonably interfere\u201d) ; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 491, 77 S.Ct. 1304,1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (obscenity); Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 33 S.Ct. 780, 57 L.Ed. 1232 (\u201crestraint of trade\u201d); Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp., 299 U.S. 183, 196, 57 S. Ct. 139, 81 L.Ed. 109 (\u201cfair and open competition\u201d); Bandini Petroleum Co. v. Superior Court, 284 U.S. 8, 18, 52 S. Ct. 103, 76 L.Ed. 136 (\u201cunreasonable waste of natural gas\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Moreover, an argument identical to defendant\u2019s was made and rejected in United States v. Bel-Mar Laboratories, Inc., 284 F.Supp. 875 (E.D.N.Y.1968). Judge Mishler\u2019s treatment of the constitutional question in that case is thorough and persuasive; we adopt his views. See also United States v. Kendall Co., 234 F.Supp. 628 (D.Mass.1971). The GMP provision is as precise as necessary under the circumstances; it is not unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that defendant violated reasonably stable, definite, and ascertainable standards of current good manufacturing practice designed to insure the production of unadulterated drugs.

Appellant also argues that even if the section has a definite meaning, it creates a standard subject to such rapid change that a drug manufacturer is unable to ascertain at any point in time what is expected of him. This argument overlooks the interpretative regulations. In our opinion it is appropriate for the statute to authorize changes in regulations to reflect the Administrator\u2019s evaluation of \u201ccurrent\u201d practice. We think the GMP standard is sufficiently fixed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">. \u201c[T]he Secretary\u2019s interpretative regulations as to good manufacturing practice for purposes of judging the adequacy of the methods, facilities, and controls would be prima facie evidence of what constitutes current good manufacturing practice in any proceeding involving [\u00a7 351(a)(2)] of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the bill.\u201d 1962 U.S.Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2890.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-10\">.
