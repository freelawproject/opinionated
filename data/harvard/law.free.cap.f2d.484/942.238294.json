Crim.P. 35) and of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). In the instant action, Thompson attacks a sentence imposed in 1965 after he pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit espionage, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(c). He was sentenced in 1965 to thirty years imprisonment, and is currently serving that term. During his incarceration, Thompson apparently has earned a Bachelor of Laws Degree from LaSalle Correspondence University and he brings his newly acquired talents to bear on the present appeal. He claims that his present sentence is illegal because it was imposed for the commission of a crime other than the one to which he pleaded guilty. Our examination of the record impels the conclusion that Thompson\u2019s claims are wholly without merit. The entry of plea and imposition of sentence in 1965 were free of legal or constitutional infirmity. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">We would be loathe to memorialize the present case in a written opinion but for the need to clarify and correct several statements made in Judge Bruchhau-sen\u2019s opinion below. In ruling on the instant motion, Judge Bruchhausen stated that Thompson pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(c)), espionage (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)), conspiracy to commit a crime against the United States (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371), and acting as an agent of a foreign government (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951). This recitation of the record was erroneous. Indeed, it is clear that Thompson pleaded guilty only to conspiracy to commit espionage and was sentenced for that offense only. But, the Judge\u2019s incorrect statement in 1973 of the pellucid record obviously cannot serve to undermine the validity of Thompson\u2019s 1965 plea and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">Judge Bruchhausen also misinterpreted the nature of the instant motion. He regarded the appellant\u2019s application for relief as a motion for reduction of sentence under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35 and accordingly grounded, his denial on untimeliness. Thompson, however, sought relief in the alternative. He not only asked for a reduction of sentence, but, in addition, moved for correction of an allegedly illegal sentence. Since an attack upon the legality of a sentence is not limited by time strictures (Fed.R.Crim.P. 35), the motion was timely. In any event, this ground of attack and Thompson\u2019s other contentions were wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
