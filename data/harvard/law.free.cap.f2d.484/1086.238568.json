On cross-motions for summary judgment, and after an <em>in camera </em>inspection, the District Court held that the portions of the Manual not available to the public were exempt from disclosure under exemptions two and five of the FOIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For lack of a detailed record essential to this type action, we are unable to determine if the information sought by appellant falls within one of the exemptions. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">The Defense Contract Audit Agency was established .to provide necessary audit services to government officers in contract administration. DCAA acts in an advisory capacity to the contracting officer, and verifies that the costs incurred in performing a contract for the Armed Services comply with criteria of the Armed Services Procurement Regulations by conducting an examination of government contractors\u2019 books and records. In view of the large number of government contractors and the great volume of contracts in different stages of performance, the DCAA must necessarily be selective and must limit its scrutiny to a relatively small portion of the books and records which could be audited. The Defense Contract Audit Agency Manual, first issued in its <em>current </em>form in 1965,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was designed to guide DCAA auditors in effective auditing in a selective manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-17\">Appellant alleges that the Manual, or parts of it, have regularly been made available to members of the public, including on occasion appellant\u2019s clients. Appellees do not dispute this but, rather, allege that these disclosures were never authorized.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, a relatively complete description of the contents of the Manual, including quotations from it, has been published in a treatise on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>defense contract auditing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the Manual is made available to certain non-federal agencies and foreign governments who deal with American contractors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, to at least some extent, the Manual has been made available to individuals outside the DCAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">The Government argued before the trial court that the information in controversy was exempt because it was \u201c(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency\u201d; constituted \u201c(5) inter-agency or intra-agen-cy memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency\u201d; and/or was composed of \u201c(7) investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a party other than an agency.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, after examining the Manual <em>in camera, </em>on motions for summary judgment held that it was a \u201cplaybook,\u201d or \u201cgame plan,\u201d i.e., tactics to be employed, and that this playbook was exempt from disclosure under categories (2) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">On appeal appellant abandoned his efforts to obtain those portions of the Manual that constitute a mere playbook.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He redoubled his argument, however, that portions of the Manual dealt with the allowability of costs. Such portions, according to appellant, constitute a form of substantive \u201csecret law\u201d that must be disclosed under the FOIA. Appellant also argued that the disclosure of portions of the Manual to various individuals, other non-federal agencies and foreign governments, constituted a waiver of exemption as to those portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-14\">II. <em>The Nature of the Information Sought</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-15\">Before the trial court appellant was requesting the entire contents of the Manual. According to the Government, the non-public portions of the Manual provide \u201cuniform guidance and instructions concerning the criteria to be used in deciding what must be audited, how it shall be audited, what is to be the depth of the examination, what the frequency of the audit shall be, and how to determine the extent of reliance which may be placed on the contractor\u2019s own inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>nal controls.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, the Manual is a mere \u201cplaybook\u201d that tells auditors where to look in the mass of books and records confronting them, but does not provide substantive guidance or otherwise set standards for what costs will actually be allowed. If a contractor knows in advance the coverage, depth, and scope of an audit, the contractor may be able to claim improper costs in areas that will receive little or no scrutiny. Thus, the Government argues that, for an audit to be effective, the portion of the Manual on coverage, depth, and scope must be kept secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Appellant disputes as a matter of fact this characterization of the Manual\u2019s contents. As a matter of law appellant\u2019s primary theory originally was that the Manual was an \u201cadministrative staff manual . . . that affect [s] a member of the public.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The FOIA specifically requires that such \u201cadministrative staff manuals\u201d be made available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">In addition to his principal contention that the entire Manual be disclosed as being an \u201cadministrative staff manual,\u201d appellant advanced two subsidiary arguments that, if accepted, would require the disclosure of <em>portions </em>of the Manual. <em>First, </em>appellant contended that at least portions of the Manual set forth standards of interpretation of ASPR and guidelines for the allowability of costs; these portions were said to constitute a form of \u201csecret law\u201d that must be disclosed under the FOIA. <em>Secondly, </em>appellant claimed that portions of the Manual had been made available to various persons and entities outside the Federal Government, and that at least as to these disclosed portions, DCAA had waived any right it might have to keep them secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">At oral argument appellant abandoned his request for the entire Manual and narrowed his efforts to seeking disclosure of the portions that constituted \u201csecret law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Due to this concession, we no longer have reason to consider whether the entire Manual must be disclosed under the requirement covering \u201cadministrative staff manuals.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> By like token, we need not consider the argument that disclosure to certain individuals and entities constituted a waiver of any right to keep those portions secret. This is true because appellant has stated that he wants only those portions of the Manual which constitute \u201csecret law.\u201d Since appellant has an undeniable right to obtain such law, it is irrelevant whether those portions may also be obtained under a theory of waiver. We therefore do not decide any waiver issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-13\">There does not appear to be any disagreement between the parties regarding what the nature of the \u201csecret law\u201d being sought actually is. The portions sought by appellant, which the Government agrees should be made available if they actually exist, are those which either create or determine the extent of the substantive rights and liabilities of a person affected by those portions. Information that falls within this definition would include, for example, guidelines for what costs would be allowed under ASPR, and rules or interpretations dealing with other substantive laws. Appellant does not seek to obtain disclosure of those portions of the Manual that prescribe techniques to uncover the facts relevant to a particular contract. Nor is a right to disclosure claimed for procedures directing auditors to concentrate examination on certain elements of a contractor\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-14\">It is clear that if any portion of the Manual does consist of interpretations of rules and statutes or guidelines for allowability of costs, appellant has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>right to obtain disclosure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, this was conceded by government counsel during oral argument. The sole remaining issue is thus purely factual\u2014 whether the Manual does contain any \u201csecret law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">In the unsatisfactory manner in which these FOIA cases have been arising, we have no record before us containing the answer to this issue. The District Judge was confronted with appellant\u2019s original claim for total access to the Manual, opposed by the Government\u2019s claim to blanket exemption under three exceptions to disclosure. On cross-motions for summary judgment, after <em>in camera </em>examination of the several volumes constituting the Manual, the District Judge sustained the Government\u2019s overall non-disclosure position under exemptions (2) and (5). Counsel apparently made no discriminating analysis of how portions of the Manual might differ in their purpose, nature, and content, and thus be subject to different criteria of disclosure; understandably, the trial judge made none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">III. <em>Procedures Under the FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">\n<em>A. Problems of Testing Disclosability of Allegedly Secret Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">Recently in Vaughn v. Rosen<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this court had occasion to discuss the problems inherent in implementing the FOIA. Despite the heavy emphasis in favor of disclosure<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the specific requirement that the <em>Government </em>shall have the burden of proving that information need not be revealed,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we noted in <em>Vaughn </em>that procedures most often used in FOIA cases permit the Government very easily to avoid disclosure.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since the party seeking disclosure does not know the contents of the information sought, he cannot argue as effectively that the documents sought are, for example, \u201csecret law\u201d to which he is entitled access. In contrast, the Government does have access to the information and with confidence can convincingly argue to the trial judge that the factual nature of the information is as the Government alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">As we noted in <em>Vaughn, </em>the burden of actually determining whether the information is as the Government describes it falls ultimately on the court system.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After the Government alleges that the documents in controversy do not contain material which must be disclosed, but on the other hand consist of information whose secrecy must be preserved, the very claim of secrecy, under the usual court procedures in vogue, means that the Government has substantially relieved itself of the burden of proving more. To preserve secrecy it is then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>up to the trial judge to wade through the mass of documents and determine whether the information must be disclosed. The party seeking disclosure is helpless to contradict the Government\u2019s description of the information or effectively to assist the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">In <em>Vaughn </em>we concluded that the ease with which the Government could carry its burden, and the difficulty that a trial judge faces in determining whether information should be disclosed, created intolerable problems. <em>First, </em>it encouraged agencies to argue for the widest possible exemption from disclosure for the greatest bulk of material. <em>Secondly, </em>it had a tendency to undermine the reliability of a trial judge\u2019s findings; a trial judge, without the aid of counsel seeking disclosure, cannot be expected to investigate and isolate the factual nature of individual documents in a mass of similar appearing material. <em>Thirdly, </em>because the points of factual dispute have not been isolated by the traditional forms of argumentation and adversary testing, a determination is virtually un-reviewable on appeal. The case at bar we remand for additional proceedings which hopefully will rectify to some extent these flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">B. <em>Procedures Upon Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">1. As in Vaughn v. Rosen, we believe that the problems adverted to will be substantially ameliorated if the Government is required to provide particularized and specific justification for exempting information from disclosure. This justification must not consist of \u201cconclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions, such as the trial court was treated to in this case, but will require a relatively detailed analysis in manageable segments.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is particularly important that information which is in effect substantive law not be concealed beneath a mass of other material. Even when the law is closely intermingled with other data, we cannot conceive of a situation in which legal interpretations and guidelines could not be segregated from other material and isolated in a form which could be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-10\">2. Upon remand the Government should correlate its reasons for claiming that the various portions of the Manual should not be disclosed with the relevant portions of the Manual.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1146-11\">[A] n indexing system would subdivide the document under consideration into manageable parts cross-referenced to the relevant portion of the Government\u2019s justification. Opposing counsel should consult with a view toward eliminating from consideration those portions that are not controverted and narrowing the scope of the court\u2019s inquiry. After the issues are focused, the District Judge may examine and rule on each element of the itemized list.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIFj\">3. Finally, if the District Judge deems it appropriate, he may appoint a special master to examine the Manual, the Government\u2019s justification, and the indexing. This could, in some circumstances, relieve much of the burden of evaluating voluminous documents that currently falls on the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-14\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-15\">The ease is remanded so that the Government may undertake to index and justify the Manual in a manner consistent with Part III of this opinion, and for the District Judge to rule thereon. So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">. \u201c(a) Bach agency shall make available to the public information as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-6\">\u201c(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-7\">\u201c(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the ease of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submit-tals or requests, or obtain decisions ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-8\">\u201c(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-9\">\u201c(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1141-10\">\u201c(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsUn\">\u201c(E) each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing.

These impediments derive, of course, from exactly the problem against which the Act was directed \u2014 the enthusiasm for secrecy that seems all too often epidemic in our Government. Courts are responsible under the Act for testing broad claims of exemption from disclosure, claims that information must remain secret, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>against the precise categories of necessary secrecy that Congress has defined. Yet the claim of exemption has, in the past, foreclosed adversary analysis of whether, in fact, exemption is warranted, presenting the grave danger that, despite the best efforts of the court, the claim alone might conclude the case. <em>See </em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. FTC, 146 U. S.App.D.C. 237, 450 F.2d 698, 715-716 (1971) (Bazelon, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">I do not suppose, nor, I assume, does the Court, that the procedures we have mandated to govern the remands here and in Vaughn v. Rosen, - U.S.App. D.C.-, -F.2d - (1973) will completely dispose of the problem. They are, like much in the law, an experiment to be tried by experience. And experience may prove that additional steps or different approaches are called for. Nonetheless, I think that these procedures bear substantial promise of facilitating enforcement of the Act. I join in the opinion of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
