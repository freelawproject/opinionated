Appellant further asserts that the 1967 amendment to the Act providing that \u201cthis chapter is intended to supersede any law of any State . . . inconsistent with its provisions\u201d, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1203, precludes New Hampshire from applying any other standard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-22\">The central issue presented by this case is, therefore, whether the applicable New Hampshire standard of tort liability is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the provisions of the federal Act. The Flammable Fabrics Act provides for injunction, seizure of materials, and criminal penalties,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for violation of flammability standards promulgated by the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>of Commerce pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1193 and 1201.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Act makes no provision for private relief for those harmed in accidents involving flammable fabrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The legislative history indicates that the 1967 amendments which included the \u201csupremacy clause\u201d were, as a group, intended to increase the protection of consumers. The amendments were designed to permit the Secretary of Commerce \u201cto continually update flammability standards to keep pace with new technological processes developed by the industry\u201d. 1967 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, p. 2134. Up until that time, because legislative action was required, no new standards had been promulgated for fourteen years. By creating a means for the Secretary of Commerce to make revision through administrative process, the Congress hoped to facilitate an improvement of the applicable standards which were then thought to be deficient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note that at the time of this case the standards had not as yet been updated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">The evident solicitude of Congress for the plight of burn victims who are most often the very young and the aged <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7must be taken into consideration when interpreting the \u201csupremacy clause\u201d. We hold, therefore, that New Hampshire\u2019s application of its strict liability standard in tort actions involving injury from burning clothing is not \u201cinconsistent with [the] provisions\u201d of the Flammable Fabrics Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">The district court considered appellant\u2019s compliance with federal standards as relevant to a defense to the claim, see Schreiber &amp; Rheingold, Products Liability 1:60 (P.L.I. 1967); 1 Frumer &amp; Friedman, Products Liability \u00a7 8.07 [1]. However, the federal standard was rejected as a measure of defectiveness or unreasonable danger under New Hampshire law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court measured \u201cunreasonable danger\u201d in light of approximately normal conditions like those in effect when a garment is being worn and is accidentally and non-negligently exposed to heat or flame. The judge, as trier of fact, found that the ignition rate of the garment in question left no time for instinctive reaction between the time of impingement of the flame and the time the material burst into flames.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is a standard fully consistent with the Restatement Rule which is geared to protect the consumer from conditions not contemplated or apparent that are unreasonably dangerous for <em>normal </em>handling and consumption.

But such conclusions do not always follow, and the criminal law must be regarded as a very unreliable analogy to the law of torts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">The dichotomy between criminal and tort law has been codified in the Restatement of Torts: \u201cCompliance with a legislative enactment or an administrative regulation does not prevent a finding of negligence where a reasonable man would take additional precautions\u201d. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 288C (1965). While this section applies to negligence cases, it also reflects a general assumption that criminal law has no necessary implications for tort law: an \u201cenactment or regulation may . provide only for criminal liability, and not for civil liability ... In such eases the initial question is whether the legislation or regulation is to be given any effect in a civil suit. Since the legislation has not so provided, the court is under no compulsion to accept it as defining any standard of conduct for purposes of a tort action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 286 comment d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">Since the Flammable Fabrics Act did not provide private civil remedies and does not preclude state development of such remedies, the states are not limited to applying the federal criminal and regulatory standards in civil cases involving burns from ignited fabrics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">.

It does not appear from the record whether the argument concerning the supremacy clause was made to the district court. In any event, that court did not discuss the clause in its opinion. Instead, it addressed itself to the claimed inadequacy of the federal standards. <em>See, e. g., </em>E. Swartz, Products Liability \u2014 The Torch Cases, 76 Case &amp; Comment 5-6 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1080-24\">. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1195 and 1196.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">. The Act provides for hearings where findings about the materials in question can be made and regulations promulgated, 15 U.S. O.A. \u00a7 1193(b).

A special heartbreak is that 40 percent of these victims are children under 10 years of age.\u201d James H.
