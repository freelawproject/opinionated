The trial record is really devoid of any element of entrapment. Moreover, had such been the case, Rose took the witness stand and denied any participation whatsoever in the transaction. A directed verdict of not guilty could not have been justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-21\">Although himself denying any personal participation in the actual distribution of the contraband, Rose argued below and argues here that the proof offered on behalf of the government showed that his alleged participation was an \u201cagent of the undercover government agent\u201d, who actually acquired the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>drugs. Unfortunately, it was Rose who first approached the undercover agent and inquired as to whether he would like to purchase some high quality cocaine or speed. This inquiry resulted in the visit to Bryant and the illegal distribution. This consideration aside, this is a distri-. bution case and the appellate argument is crushed beneath the weight of our recent decisions in United States v. Johnson [opinion dated July 19, 1973] 481 F.2d 645, and United States v. Miller [opinion dated August 6, 1973] 483 F.2d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The judgment of conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
