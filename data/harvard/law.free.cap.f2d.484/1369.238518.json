This is particularly appropriate because the district court, this court, and all parties proceeded with one eye on the New York case as it developed in Hanly v. Mitchell, 460 F.2d 640 (2d Cir. 1972), cert, denied, 409 U.S. 990, 93 S. Ct. 313, 34 L.Ed.2d 256 (1972) <em>(Hanly </em>7), and Hanly v. Kleindienst, 471 F.2d 823 (2d Cir. 1972) <em>(Hanly II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1424-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-19\">The New York project, known as the Foley Square Courthouse Annex (Foley Square) consists of two buildings each approximately 12 stories high with a total of 345,601 gross square feet, one an office building for the staffs of the United States Attorney and Marshal and the other a detention center known as Metropolitan Correction Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-20\">Noting that not all agency action requires the preparation of an impact statement, the court in <em>Hanly I </em>stated that \u201cthe responsible federal agency has the authority to make its own threshold determination as to . . . [whether the federal action is \u2018major\u2019 and also has a \u2018significant\u2019 effect on the environment] in deciding whether an impact statement is necessary.\u201d <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 644. On the basis of a short memorandum by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>GSA that tersely discussed problems of water, heat, sewage and garbage and concluded that the \u201cimpact of the proposed action will have no adverse effects on the environment, including ecological systems, population distribution, transportation, water or air pollution, nor will it be any threat to health or life systems or urban congestion,\u201d the Court of Appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction, holding that the memorandum was sufficient to support GSA\u2019s determination that the <em>office building </em>in Foley Square would have no adverse effects on the environment. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 645-646.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1425-5\">However, the detention center, the Foley Square \u201cjail,\u201d was viewed as distinct from the office building determination. GSA had attempted to justify the detention center on the basis of the same abrupt memorandum which had satisfactorily terminated environmental attacks on the office building, but the Court of Appeals reversed the district court\u2019s denial of preliminary injunctive relief, holding that as to the detention center, \u201cin the context of an act designed to require federal agencies to affirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record, this perfunctory and conclusory language simply does not suffice, even for purposes of a threshold section 102(2) (C) determination.\u201d <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 647.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court stated that GSA must at least consider those factors peculiar to detention centers which have an impact on the urban environment. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 646-648.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">The Chicago project, known as the United States Courthouse Annex and Federal Parking Facility (Chicago Annex), consists of one triangular-shaped 27-story building with an area of approximately 180,000 gross square feet for the detention center and a second rectangular 8-story, open-sided building with an area of approximately 315,000 gross square feet for the parking garage for about 850 automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-15\">In the present case, the GSA at first relied upon a 4-stage statement similar in length and content to the Foley Square memorandum to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>threshold determination that the Chicago Annex was not one significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The district court originally denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on March 30, 1973, but we directed the vacation of that order on April 26, 1973 in appeal No. 73-1324 and in our order of that date disposed of three defenses which had been interposed by the governmental defendants: we held (1) that the plaintiffs (two Chicago banks, the Union League Club of Chicago, two not-for-profit citizens\u2019 planning organizations and an individual) had standing to sue under Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972) by virtue of their \u201cuse\u201d of the area to be affected by the construction of the Chicago Annex; (2) that \u201c[although the plaintiffs could have brought this action earlier than they did,\u201d we declined to invoke laches because of \u201cthe public interest status accorded ecology preservation by the Congress,\u201d in accordance with Arlington Coalition on Transportation v. Volpe, 458 F.2d 1323, 1329 (4th Cir. 1972); and (3) that the fact that one plaintiff bank which later withdrew from the case had been recalcitrant with respect to answering interrogatories did not detract from the right of the other plaintiffs to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">As the Second Circuit did in <em>Hanly I, </em>we remanded the case to the district court with directions to enter an injunction effective in no less than 30 days unless in the interim GSA supplemented its threshhold environmental impact assessment and the court upon a hearing determined that it was adequate. If such assessment was not adequate, an injunction was to be entered and continued in force until an environmental impact statement was made in full compliance with Section 102(2) (C) of NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">The district court entered an order on May 7, 1973, enjoining further construction of the Chicago Annex as of 5:00 P. M. on May 26, 1973. In that interim, GSA invited and received objections to the construction based upon environmental effects and after consideration of these and other factors filed on May 15 a 142-page supplemental environmental assessment supported by a large number of exhibits. GSA considered the supplemental data and on May 17 made its determination \u201cthat construction and operation of the U. S. Courthouse Annex and Federal Parking Facility is not considered to be a major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-7\">The plaintiffs had submitted letters, statements and other documentary material to GSA, which were included in the GSA exhibits supporting the assessment. The assessment and exhibits were introduced in evidence when the district court held its hearing on May 21 and 22, at which time the plaintiffs called 5 witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">On May 25, the district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and, in effect, vacated the May 7 order providing for an injunction effective May 26. In a 38-page memorandum opinion, Judge McGarr made findings and conclusions and adjudged that the GSA determination as to the lack of significant environmental impact of the Chicago Annex project (1) was consistent with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Executive Order 11514 flowing therefrom and the Guidelines of the Council on Environmental Quality on Statements on Proposed Federal Actions Affecting the Environment, Circular No. A-95 Revised (February 9, 1971) and (2) \u201cwas not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law or without observance of procedure required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">A subsequent hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 application for a permanent injunction was held on June 19, 1973, wherein the evidence received in support of the motion for preliminary relief was considered and the plaintiffs called 5 additional witnesses. On June 22 the court made additional findings and conclusions and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a permanent injunction, as well as reaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>firming his judgment regarding the GSA determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to alter and amend the memorandum opinion of May 25, 1973, denying a preliminary injunction, and from the June 22 order denying a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">After remand in <em>Hanly I </em>a new threshold determination of lack of significant effect on the quality of the human environment was made by GSA in the form of a 25-page assessment of environmental impact with some exhibits attached. The district court then denied plaintiffs\u2019 renewed application for a preliminary injunction and the <em>Hanly II </em>appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">In the majority opinion, written by Judge Mansfield, the Court of Appeals held that although a court reviewing administrative action must determine <em>de novo </em>all questions of law, must determine whether factual findings are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d or \u201cwithout observance of procedure required by law\u201d (Administrative Procedure Act \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2) (A) and (D)), and must accept the administrative agency\u2019s decisions as to mixed questions of law and fact if they have \u201cwarrant in the record\u201d and a \u201creasonable basis in law\u201d (NLRB v. Hearst Publication, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944)), the arbitrary and capricious standard should apply to NEPA exemption determinations since \u201csignificantly\u201d as used in Section 102(2) (C) can be isolated as a question of law (Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d 823, 828-829.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">In discussing the proper interpretation of the term \u201csignificantly,\u201d the Court noted a complete lack of Congressional or administrative guidelines, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-11\">\u201cCongress apparently was willing to depend principally upon the agency\u2019s good faith determination as to what conduct would be sufficiently serious from an ecological standpoint to require use of the full-scale procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayv-dedup-0\"><em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 830. The majority opinion then concluded that \u201cin deciding whether a major federal action will \u2018significantly\u2019 affect the qualify of the human environment the agency in charge, although vested with broad discretion, should normally be required to review the proposed action in the light of at least two relevant factors: (1) the extent to which the action will cause adverse environmental effects in excess of those created by existing uses in the area affected by it, and. (2) the absolute quantitative adverse environmental effects of the action itself, including the cumulative harm that results from its contribution to existing adverse conditions or uses in the affected area.\u201d <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 830-831.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-12\">Before applying the suggested tests to the Chicago Annex, it is well to compare it with the Foley Square detention center in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">The Foley Square jail was built in the Civic Center area of lower Manhattan in an area with many government buildings and courthouses but also immediately south of New York\u2019s Chinatown where 50,000 people live, including 3,000 persons living in two large apartment buildings directly facing the jail some 100-150 feet away. It replaced an older Federal Detention Center located at West Street in Manhattan. It was designed as the detention center for 449 persons awaiting trial or convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>short-term federal offenses; it provides space for diagnostic services, and medical, recreational and administrative facilities; as many as 48 detainees may participate in a community treatment program whereby they will be permitted to spend part of each day in the city engaged in work or study activity, returning to the center after completion of each day\u2019s business; another program will provide service for out-patient nonresidents; and the center is serviced by about 130 employees, only 90 of whom are on the premises at any one time. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 642; <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">The Chicago Annex detention center is being built on a square block bounded by Van Bur\u00e9n, Clark, Congress Parkway and Federal Streets, on the south fringe of the downtown Chicago business district or \u201cLoop\u201d in a blighted area of deteriorating buildings including \u201cflophouses,\u201d adult book stores, arcades, liquor stores and taverns, interspersed with several new non-residential office and business buildings such as the Illinois Bell Telephone Building, the Western Union Building, the Federal Reserve Bank and many others. The Annex is in close proximity to the five major downtown Chicago federal buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is five blocks from the Chicago Civic Center and state courthouses and six blocks from the City Hall and County Buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">The district court found that \u201c[t]here is no suggestion in this case that the detention facility will be built in close proximity to existing residential area [n]or is there any evidence in the record which compels the conclusion that the site will ever be in close proximity to residential areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-6\">The Chicago Annex, unlike Foley Square, does not replace another federal detention center at another location within the city, but will house detainees presently maintained at the Cook County Jail on the southwest side of Chicago, City of Chicago House of Correction and Central Headquarters of the Chicago Police Department at 11th and State Streets, five blocks from the Annex, and at several county jails in adjoining counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">The Annex is designed for approximately 393 detainees awaiting trial and serving short-term sentences; it provides space for diagnostic services and medical, recreational, educational, dining, counseling and administrative facilities; it will include a community treatment cehter to administer a pre-release program, but each participant in the program will be screened and those with a history of assaults or affiliated with organized crime or otherwise classified as serious offenders will be, excluded; and the detention center will employ 153 persons whereas the parking facility will employ 24 persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">Foley Square cost over $20 million, harmonized architecturally with existing area buildings, enhanced the appearance of the neighborhood, did not have fortress walls or steel-barred windows but instead had polycarbonate plastic shatter-proof windows of a dark gray color designed to insulate the community from visual contact with the detainees. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 644; <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F. 2d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">The Chicago Annex will cost over $20 million; the design earned an honor award for excellence from the Smithsonian Institute upon the recommendation of the National Public Advisory Panel on Architectural Services; a large portion of the site will be a 26,300 square foot open plaza landscaped with trees and provided with benches for the public and well-lighted for both daylight and evening use by the public;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>Clark and Congress Street sides of the site will also be lined with trees and planters; the entire ground level of the detention building will be a public lobby with large expanses of glass, lounge seating and a receptionist area. The neighborhood will be greatly enhanced; there will be no fortress walls or steel-barred windows; 5-inch wide windows, rigidly glazed with bronze-tinted tempered glass prevents persons in the plaza or otherwise outside from either being aware of activities in the facility or from communicating vocally or visually with persons inside the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">The district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-5\">\u201cEvery building, government or private, has an affect on the environment. This is particularly true of large buildings for commercial or institutional purposes. Yet the erection, completion, and occupancy of such buildings in the central city is traditionally considered a contribution to the quality of life worthy of commendation and expressions of appreciation from public officials representing the community. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-6\">* * -x- * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-7\">\u201c . . . In making its determination of negative environmental impact, the General Services Administration had before it and considered information on the construction of the building, its conformity to the building codes, the adequacy of existing utilities proposed to be used, the availability and adequate supply of water, waste disposal facilities, gas, electricity and telephone service. Studies were made of the impact of the building on traffic, both on the side street which serves its entrance and which will be substantially widened and the major thoroughfares to which it is adjacent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-9\">\u201cFrom the record, it is clear that considered as a structure, the proposed U.S. Courthouse Annex and Federal Parking Facility has no more environmental impact on the quality of life in the Chicago urban community than any other of the well constructed, well designed buildings which are being erected in the city on a variety of sites. The extensive evidence in the record satisfies the Court that there has been no abuse of discretion in the GSA determination of no significant environmental impact by virtue of the design, construction, or location of this structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">The district court then closely analyzed the evidence and summarized it as follows: the essential contentions of the plaintiffs were that a \u201cjail\u201d and an 850-car parking facility have a significant environmental impact; plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses were reluctant to state flatly that in their opinions the proposed facility would have a deleterious environmental impact; the impact upon the quality of life of a structure designated as a jail is none the less real because psychological; and a concern for public safety was expressed by some but not all of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">In <em>Hanly II, </em>the Court of Appeals considered the 25-page assessment by GSA and the evidence offered by the plaintiffs in that case and concluded that \u201c[jjudged by the comparative uses in the area and according to its quantitative environmental effects, [the Foley Square detention center] should not have a significant effect upon the human environment\u201d. 471 F.2d at 833. However, the Court remanded the case to require GSA to make a further investigation of two issues not considered by GSA or the district court: whether a drug maintenance program would be carried on at the Center with the attendant dangers of the presence of drug addicts, drug pushers and hangers-on and whether the risk of crime might be increased as a result of the operation of the center. <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 834, 836. As Judge McGarr noted in the present case, after the <em>Hanly II </em>remand \u201cit must be assumed that the areas of concern to the Court were satisfactorily resolved at the District Court level . [because] the detention facili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>ty in issue was completed and is in use</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">In regard to the Chicago Annex, the GSA supplemental assessment expressly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\">\u201cThe U.S. Courthouse Annex will <em>not </em>operate a drug maintenance unit. The Bureau of Prisons does not have a drug maintenance program at any Bureau operated community-based facility nor are any planned for the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">In regard to the <em>Harily II </em>issue of increased risk of crime, expressed in the Chicago Annex case as a concern for public safety, the district court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-7\">\u201cIt is hardly necessary to observe that the criminals housed in the detention center are securely inside. Evidence of the security precautions connected with the use of part of the building as a prison, indicates more than adequate regard for public safety. Plaintiffs emphasize, however, that an area of greater concern lies in the visitation of this facility by probationers and parolees and other persons subject to accusation of crime and involved in the presentence investigation .or counseling processes. The evidence amply demonstrates, and the General Services Administration did not err in concluding, that this situation is not a significant environmental concern. Indeed plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, who were unstinting in their praise of the Everett McKinley Dirksen Building, were totally unaware that the same processes which they fear in the new building have been going on in the Dirksen Building since it has been open, and for many years in the old Courthouse which once stood across the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">In regard to traffic, GSA showed that there will average 4 ingresses and egresses per business day for service deliveries and two daily ingresses and egresses for detainee transportation, mostly at non-peak traffic hours; that of the 850 vehicles to be parked, '350 are federal vehicles already occupying downtown parking space and the additional vehicles will have little effect upon the 238,000 vehicles presently entering the downtown area; that the facility adjoins the Congress Parkway which feeds directly into all main arterial highways and the interstate highway system without requiring traveling through the loop area. The district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-10\">\u201cThe evidence considered by the General Services Administration has as its principal thrust the fact that the additional parking made available in this building will not significantly increase the volume of traffic in and out of the Loop areas nor contribute significantly to congestion in the streets immediately surrounding the building. The General Services Administration reached this conclusion based upon this evidence. Having considered the same evidence, and additionally the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 traffic expert, Professor John Bailey, this Court cannot conclude that this administrative determination was an abuse of discretion or was in any way unreasonable or arbitrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-11\">The district court found that GSA gave sufficient consideration to alternative sites; that under the circumstances of this case public hearings were not required but that GS\u00c1 early disclosed its plans to the public and gave all interested parties ample opportunity to present their views and objections; that Sections 102(2) (A) and (D) were complied with and (B) and (C) were inappli\u00e9able (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2) (A), (B), (C) and (D) ); and that the future plans for the City of Chicago were not significantly adversely affected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-12\">\u201cWhether there is a significant and adverse environmental impact resulting from the construction of the U.S. Courthouse Annex and Federal Parking Facility must be considered in the context of the place of the project in the overall plan for urban renewal and development of the area immediately south of Chicago\u2019s Loop, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>the subject of almost constant reference by plaintiffs and all of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses. The evidence reveals that development of this section of the city has been suggested to city planners by the recent availability for other purposes of some six hundred acres of land in the area immediately south of the Loop once utilized as a railroad yard. With the development of this land as the nucleus, broader plans have been formulated for the renovation of the entire area south of the Loop, commencing at a point somewhat south of the site of the building involved in the instant controversy and extending southward to approximately Roosevelt Road. The oft-referred-to plan is commendable but somewhat amorphous. It has not yet been published, nor was any copy of it available at the trial. According to the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, it invplves the development of a \u2018New Town-In Town\u2019 concept embracing residential, commercial and industrial buildings made more desirable by their close proximity to the downtown area. The planners and the plans seem not to have been deterred by the fact that it will be contiguous with the Chicago Police Department Central Headquarters which also embraces a detention facility and supports the usual traffic of persons charged with crime going to and from the courts and administrative offices housed in that building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-4\">\u201cIn contrast to the amorphous plan with which plaintiffs contend the proposed structure is not in harmony, are the present existing conditions surrounding the site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-6\">\u201cIt is also apparent from the evidence that New Town-In Town will not, in its contemplated residential development, come closer than several blocks from the Courthouse Annex, even if the residential development were put at the northern-most extremity of the new project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-8\">Finally, the district court reached the ultimate conclusion that the GSA determination \u201cwas not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law or without observance of procedure required by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-10\">The Congressional declaration of national environmental policy expressed in NEPA is as broad as the mind can conceive. After speaking of the \u201coverall welfare and development of man,\u201d Congress declared that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-11\">\u201c[I]t is the continuing policy of the Federal Government ... to use all practicable means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and promote the general welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-12\">42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4331(a) (Cum.Supp.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-13\">Of necessity, NEPA must be construed to include protection of the quality of life for city residents <em>(Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 647) particularly in view of \u201cthe profound influences of population growth, high-density urbanization, [and] industrial expansion .- . .\u201d (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4331(a)).

All of these aims have a recognized beneficient effect on the quality of the human environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-13\">Unlike Foley Square, the Chicago Annex does not replace an existing detention center but rather creates a separate centralized detention center for persons awaiting trial who otherwise would be scattered throughout Cook and adjoining counties in ordinary city and county jails as part of the general prison population. In concept, the Chicago Annex facility reflects the real and significant difference between the function of pre- and post-trial detention. It represents a progressive solution to a perplexing problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-14\">The problem of the pre-trial treatment of persons charged with crime but not convicted and thus presumed innocent has plagued society at least since the time of Blackstone, who observed: <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-15\">\u201c[This] imprisonment, as has been said, is only for safe custody, and not for punishment; therefore, in this dubious interval between commitment and trial, a prisoner ought to be used with utmost humanity; and neither loaded with needless fetters, nor subjected to other hardships than such are requisite for the purpose of confinement only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-16\">The Introduction to the Standards Relating to Pretrial Release of the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice notes that \u201c [d] efendants presumed innocent are subjected to the psychological and physical deprivation of jail life, usually under more onerous conditions than are imposed on convicted defendants.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>The Report of the President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 179 (1967) recommended \u201c[w]herever possible, persons awaiting trial should be housed and handled separately from offenders.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This recommendation was based on a task force conclusion that \u201c[i]t is probably true that persons who have not yet been convicted of a crime, are subjected to the worst aspects of the American correctional system.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See, e. g., </em>Anderson v.

It could not serve its function in a rural community;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it could serve its functions to a lesser degree but obviously not blend environmentally in the residential urban areas outside of the downtown area;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the facility could only be placed in the downtown section where the relatively few residents are in hotels and clubs, where the building blends into the courthouse \u2014 government\u2014office building complex<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and serves its functions to the maximum degree, and where it upgrades and enhances what had become a blighted area.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\">The major environmental obstacle in Foley Square was the presence of some 50,000 residents in close proximity to the proposed center, including 3,000 in the apartment buildings 100-150 feet away. The court there was concerned with \u201cthe peculiar environmental impact of squeezing a jail into a narrow area directly across the street from two large apartment houses,\u201d with families fearing \u201criots and disturbances\u201d <em>(Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 646),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and with \u201cthe sensibilities of a neighborhood\u201d <em>(Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 835). Here the district court found no present, nor forseeable future possibility of, close proximity to residential areas. The court further found that \u201cwhen, if ever, this New Town- \u2014 In Town project will commence,\u201d its contemplated residential development will not come closer than several blocks from the Annex.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1434-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-12\">Upon analysis of the Chicago Annex in the context of the <em>Hanly </em>cases, certain conclusions inexorably emerge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">As the agency responsible for the acquisition of the site, the design and construction of the buildings, and their ultimate operation, GSA was the appropriate body to make the original determination as to environmental impact. <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>There appears to be no dispute that this $20 million project is a \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d even as the Foley Square $20 million project was conceded to be a major action. <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 826-827. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">In making the threshold determination of whether the Chicago Annex was one of those \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d requiring a detailed environmental impact statement (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4332(2) (C)), GSA was required to \"affirmatively develop a reviewable environmental record.\u201d <em>Hanly I, </em>460 F.2d at 647; <em>Hanly II, </em>471 F.2d at 827, 836.
