The district court, acting under the grant of jurisdiction contained in Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, held inapplicable the <em>Boys </em>Markets<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exception to the anti-injunction mandate of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104, and denied injunctive relief. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-8\">Monongahela is a public utility which provides electric service to most of northern and central West Virginia. Defendant Local 2332 is the collective bargaining representative for all hourly-paid employees of the Company\u2019s Panhandle Division located in Weirton, West Virginia. In early May 1973, members of Local 2357 went on strike at the Company\u2019s Clarksburg Division. Pickets from Local 2357 were subsequently established at the Panhandle Division in Weirton to publicize the strike then being conducted in Clarksburg. In order to show sympathy and solidarity with members of the Clarksburg Local, the employees of the Panhandle Division represented by the defendant Local 2332 refused to cross the picket line, and a work stoppage followed. William Wil-harm, manager of the Panhandle Division, made repeated requests for the Panhandle employees to return to work, and he asked both the Local and the Cincinnati Regional Office of the IBEW to disavow the work stoppage and to direct its members to return to work and process any grievance they might have through the applicable steps of the grievance procedure contained in the collective bargaining agreement. No action to end the strike was taken by the Panhandle employees, the Local, or the Regional Office, and the work stoppage continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">The collective bargaining agreement between Local 2332 and the Company became effective on March 1, 1972, and continues in force until July 1, 1974. It provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-11\">ARTICLE IX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-12\">\n<em>Adjustment of Grievance</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-13\">Section 1. Any dispute between the Company or employees covered by this Agreement with respect to the interpretation, application, or <em>claimed violation of any </em>express provision of this Agreement shall constitute a grievance which shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of this Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-14\">ARTICLE X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Wg\"><em>No Strike </em>\u2014 No <em>Lockout</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-15\">Section 1. During the term of this Agreement, there shall be no strike, work stoppage, slowdown or any other interference with or impeding of work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-16\">Section 2. No employee shall participate in any such strike, <em>work stoppage, </em>slowdown or any other interference with or impeding of work and the Union will not authorize, instigate, aid or condone any such activity. Upon notification by the Company that a violation of this Article exists or is threatened, the Union shall immediately take all steps within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>power to prevent or terminate any action or conduct in violation of this Article. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-4\">The Company brought this action in district court seeking both injunctive relief and damages on the grounds that the refusal to cross the picket line and the resultant work stoppage were in direct violation of Article X of the collective bargaining agreement. The defendant Local contended that the refusal to cross the picket line was an individual decision of each employee, neither authorized nor sanctioned by the Local, and that the employees were engaging in activity which was protected by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and which did not come within the scope of <em>Boys Markets. </em>Following a hearing, the district judge orally denied the Company\u2019s application for a preliminary injunction, and an order denying both preliminary and permanent injunctive relief was thereafter entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">A brief history and analysis of federal labor policy is required in order to determine whether the district court erred in concluding that <em>Boys Markets </em>was not applicable to the facts of this case and that the court was therefore barred by che Norris-LaGuardia Act from granting an injunction against the work stoppage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Congress passed the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 as a reaction to the widespread misuse by federal courts of injunctive relief in labor-management controversies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 4 of the Act prohibits federal courts from issuing temporary or permanent injunctions in most labor disputes,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and strict procedural safeguards are provided for those cases where injunctions are appropriate. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">Against this clear federal policy of nonintervention in labor disputes, however, emerged an \u201cequally strong policy to encourage the settlement of labor disputes through enforcement of compulsory arbitration agreements.\u201d Avco Corp. v. Local No. 787, 459 F.2d 968, 970 (3d Cir. 1972). Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, passed in 1947 to supplement existing state jurisdiction over labor contract matters, granted federal courts jurisdiction over \u201csuits for violation of contracts between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>an employer and a labor organization.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although initially considered only a grant of jurisdiction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 801 was later interpreted to allow federal courts to order specific performance to enforce arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements. Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">In Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, 370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1318, 8 L.Ed.2d 462 (1962), the Supreme Court failed to reconcile these two competing federal labor policies \u2014 the prohibition against antistrike injunctions and the preference for compulsory arbitration to maintain industrial peace. <em>Sinclair </em>involved a strike in direct violation of a no-strike provision in a collective bargaining agreement. The Court affirmed the district court\u2019s refusal to enjoin the strike by adopting a literal reading of Section 4 of Norris-LaGuardia, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 104, and holding that the Act\u2019s anti-injunction provision was not limited by Section 301 of the LMRA, <em>i. e., </em>federal courts do not have jurisdiction to issue injunctions against violations of a no-strike clause if the labor dispute is one encompassed by Section 4.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The effect of <em>Sinclair </em>was to create a new dilemma: if its holding were limited to federal courts, and injunctive relief left available in state courts, the declared need for uniformity among state and federal courts <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with respect to enforcement of labor contracts would be destroyed; if <em>Sinclair </em>were extended to state courts, it would have to be done despite \u201cexplicit evidence that Congress expressly intended not to encroach upon the existing jurisdiction of the state courts.\u201d Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U.S. 502, 509, 82 S. Ct. 519, 523, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-15\">The Supreme Court decided <em>Boys Markets </em>in order to solve the dilemma created by <em>Sinclair </em>and to avoid possible \u201cwholesale dislocation in the allocation of judicial business between state and federal courts\u201d that might be caused by disparity of remedy available in courts of concurrent jurisdiction. 398 U.S. at 246-247, 90 S.Ct. at 1590. The Court there chose to reject the literal interpretation of Norris-LaGuardia announced in <em>Sinclair </em>and to adopt a strong policy favoring the settlement of labor disputes through enforcement of compulsory arbitration. By way of explanation of its decision to overrule <em>Sinclair </em>in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-16\">The <em>Sinclair </em>decision ... seriously undermined the effectiveness of the arbitration technique as a method peacefully to resolve industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, and similar devices. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the unavailability of equitable relief in the arbitration context presents a serious impediment to the congressional policy favoring the voluntary establishment of a mechanism for the peaceful resolution of labor disputes, that the core purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not sacrificed by the limited use of equitable remedies to further this important policy, and consequently that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the granting of injunctive relief in the circumstances of the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\">398 U.S. at 252-253, 90 S.Ct. at 1593.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The anti-injunction provision of Norris-LaGuardia still retained much of its vitality after <em>Boys Markets, </em>however, as the Court specifically limited its holding \u2014that injunctive relief against labor disputes may be available \u2014 to a narrow fact situation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-6\">We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure. Nor does it follow from what we have said that injunctive relief is appropriate as a matter of course in every case of a strike over an arbitrable grievance. The dissenting opinion in <em>Sinclair </em>suggested the following principles for the guidance of the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive relief \u2014 principles that we now adopt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-7\">\u201cA District Court entertaining an action under \u00a7 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act. When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunctive order until it first holds that the contract <em>does </em>have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike. Beyond this, the District Court must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity \u2014 whether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">398 U.S. at 253-254, 90 S.Ct. at 1594. (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">We believe the facts of the instant case clearly bring it within the narrow <em>Boys Markets </em>exception. The collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Local is written in extremely broad and encompassing language. Article X of the agreement prohibits employees from participating in any work stoppage or interference with or impeding of work, and it forbids the union from authorizing or condoning such activity. Further, the union has the affirmative duty to take all steps necessary to terminate this conduct upon notification that a violation of the agreement is threatened. Article IX provides for the mandatory adjustment of any unresolved grievance which involves \u201cthe interpretation, application, or claimed violation of any express provision of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">The wording of a pai\u2019ticular arbitration agreement is an important factor in determining questions of coverage. United Textile Workers v. Newberry Mills, Inc., 315 F.2d 217, 218-219 (4th Cir. 1963). The Supreme Court has stated that courts should liberally construe such agreements, resolve all doubt in favor of arbitration, and order arbitration \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d United Steelworkers v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 582-583, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1353, 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). Applying this standard<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the arbitration agreement before us, we think the dispute as to whether the refusal to cross the picket line and the resulting work stoppage violated Article X was clearly subject to mandatory adjustment under Article IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">We also note that it is immaterial to the Company\u2019s duty to arbitrate that the grievance procedure is employee oriented. The Company is bound to arbitrate if the Local elects to pursue that . remedy, and the Local is bound to arbitrate a grievance rather than to resort to a work stoppage. <em>Avco, supra, </em>459 F.2d at 972. The claimed violation of the bargaining agreement is, therefore, \u201ca grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">The final element necessary to bring the case within the doctrine of <em>Boys Markets </em>is whether an injunction is warranted under ordinary principles of equity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district judge below specifically found that a breach of the no-strike clause had occurred and would continue, that the work stoppage had caused and would continue to cause irreparable injury, and that the Company had no adequate remedy at law. ' He then concluded that \u201cunder general equitable principles, the injunction would and should issue as a matter of course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\"> While the district court made these findings which we think sufficient to require the application of <em>Boys Markets, </em>the district judge refused to enjoin the work stoppage, apparently in reliance upon NLRB v. Union Carbide Corp., 440 F.2d 54 (4th Cir. 1971). The holding we enunciated in <em>Union Carbide </em>was that the action of two non-striking employees, who refused as a matter of principle to cross a picket line maintained by striking employees of a common employer, was protected activity within the meaning of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act and that the employer\u2019s action in discharging these employees violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. There, however, the discharged employees were not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and, consequently, were not subject to the provisions of a no-strike clause. While there exists a statutory right of employees to refuse to cross a picket line of another union, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b), this right may be waived, and was waived here, by the action of their union in agreeing to a no-strike clause. NLRB v. Rockaway News Supply Co., 345 U.S. 71, 80, 73 S.Ct. 519, 97 L.Ed. 832 (1953). We believe, therefore, that <em>Union Carbide </em>is distinguishable from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">As their final contention, the defendant Local contends that each employee individually decided not to cross the picket line, and that these refusals were not sanctioned by the Local. We think this argument is contrary to the evidence and merits little discussion. The Local had a duty under the bargaining agreement to do all within its power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>to terminate any conduct by its members which violated the agreement. Yet, neither the Local nor its Regional Office took any action whatsoever to induce the employees to cross the picket line, even after repeated requests by the Company to disavow the work stoppage. We have no difficulty in concluding, therefore, that the Local did in fact condone the employees\u2019 refusal to cross the picket line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">The case will be remanded to the district court for the issuance of an appropriate injunction compelling arbitration and preventing work stoppage pending arbitration. Pending action by the district court, our Rule 8 injunction will be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1264-17\">. Boys Markets, Inc. v.
