Rey, Edna H. Rey, and C. Richard Tinguely appeal from the dismissal, as statutorily barred, of their complaint against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 1346(b), 2671 through 2680. Accepting, as we must, e. g., John Walker &amp; Sons v. Tampa Cigar Co., 5 Cir. 1952, 197 F.2d 72, the truth of plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 allegations, we note the following sequence of events as disclosed by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">In April 1969, plaintiff-appellant Joseph J. Rey was a contractor with the United States for the removal of edible garbage from the U.S. Military Reservation at Fort Bliss, Texas. Rey used the garbage removed under the contract to feed hogs belonging to Rey and plaintiff-appellant Tinguely. The contract specified that routine inspection and testing of the garbage removal operation was to be performed by Dr. L. E. Moffit of the Animal Health Division, United States Department of Agriculture. The contract also required that Dr. Moffit be notified if more than a usual number of plaintiffs\u2019 hogs died.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">On April 21, 1969, sixteen of plaintiffs\u2019 hogs died, and Rey immediately notified Dr. Moffit. Dr. Moffit examined the carcasses, and with Rey\u2019s permission destroyed three additional hogs of different ages and from different pens to test for hog cholera infection in the herd. Dr. Moffit promised he would notify plaintiffs and their veterinarian promptly of the test results. On April 30, 1969, Dr. Moffit notified plaintiffs that the hogs were infected with hog cholera, and imposed a quarantine on the hogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">At that time, a live virus vaccine was available for hog cholera. Use of the vaccine was hazardous, however, as the vaccine could cause otherwise uninfected hogs to contract fatal hog cholera. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Upon receipt of the April 30 notice from Dr. Moffit, and after consultation with their own veterinarian, plaintiffs proceeded to inject their hogs with the live vaccine. As a result of the inoculations, a large number of plaintiffs\u2019 hogs died. Plaintiffs Joseph and Edna Rey lost 415 hogs, with an asserted market value of $21,580; plaintiff Tinguely lost 185 hogs with a claimed market value of $7,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In point of fact, still according to plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, Dr. Moffit did not receive the laboratory test results until May 19, 1969; these results indicated that plaintiffs\u2019 hogs were <em>not infected </em>with hog cholera. Plaintiffs alleged additional delay before the correct test results were communicated to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the lower court on January 6, 1971. The complaint alleged that Dr. Moffit, as an employee of the government, ordered the herd of hogs quarantined at the time the initial testing was done, and that the fatal vaccinations were performed because of the quarantine. The complaint alleged, inter alia, negligence in failing to notify plaintiffs within a reasonable time that their hogs were not subject to quarantine, negligence in certifying that the hogs had cholera, and negligence in not notifying plaintiffs of the proper diagnosis. On March 12, 1971, the government answered, denying plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">On January 5, 1972, the government filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by the statutory quarantine exception to the Federal Tor-t Claims Act, Title 28, U.S. C., Section 2680(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 31, 1972, plaintiffs filed a motion and affidavit controverting the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, asserting that their claim rested upon the \u201cnegligent operational activities of the defendant\u201d and not upon \u201cthe imposition or establishment of a quarantine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">On July 31, 1972, the matter came on for hearing in the court below. In response to the district court\u2019s concern that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint charged negligent imposition of a quarantine, barred by Section 2680(f), plaintiffs renewed their position that the complaint was based on Dr. Moffit\u2019s negligence in stating that the hogs had cholera, not on damages arising from the effects of a quarantine. The district court thereupon ordered the parties to get together a stipulation of the facts by August 4, so that the court could speedily dispose of the case. No such stipulation was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">Instead, on August 3, 1972, in response to the trial court\u2019s expressed concern that plaintiffs\u2019 claim was barred by Section 2680(f), plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with leave of court. The amended complaint omitted any reference to the imposition of any quarantine, and proceeded on the theory that plaintiffs\u2019 damages were proximately caused by the negligence of Dr. Moffit in his actions concerning the diagnosis and testing for hog cholera. The law suit lapsed into quiescence for several months. On December 14, 1972, without further hearing of any sort, and without government response by motion or otherwise to the amended complaint, the district court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 suit <em>sua sponte </em>stating that the claim was \u201ca claim caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States,\u201d and hence barred by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2680(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>We affirm but for a different reason than that stated by the trial court. We do so despite our disapproval of the district court\u2019s rather cavalier dismissal without holding a further hearing on the issues raised by the amended complaint. This is the unusual case where dismissal on the barebone pleading \u2014 as augmented here by appellant Rey\u2019s affidavit \u2014 is not fatal error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Insofar as the original complaint alleged that plaintiffs-appellants suffered damage because Dr. Moffit incorrectly imposed a quarantine, we agree with the court below that such claims are barred by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2680(f). Allegations of negligence in the procedures, either through diagnosis or testing, by which Dr. Moffit arrived at a decision to impose a quarantine would also be barred by Section 2680(f). Dalehite v. United States, 1953, 346 U.S. 15, 32, 73 S.Ct. 956, 966, 97 L.Ed. 1427, 1439 (dictum). But we construe the Section 2680(f) quarantine bar to apply only to damages proximately caused by the \u201cimposition or establishment of a quarantine,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> such as loss in value occasioned by physical restraint on stock for a period of time or losses caused by the forced exposure of healthy animals to diseased animals within the quarantine area. Damages incidental to the quarantine itself, for example, damage caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle during the quarantine inspection process, would not in our judgment be barred by Section 2680(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">But plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 amended complaint, filed with written permission of the trial court, alleged a cause of action not related to the \u201cimposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States,\u201d and hence not barred on the face of the complaint by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2680(f). Alleging as it did negligence in both the diagnosis and testing of appellants\u2019 hogs, the amended complaint claimed damage proximately resulting from negligent actions by Dr. Moffit. Damage proximately resulting from quarantine status was not alleged. These allegations of negligence of the amended complaint were not alluded to and apparently not considered by the trial judge when he dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The government did not raise the point below, but now contends that appellants\u2019 amended claim is barred by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2680(h), the misrepresentation exception to the Tort Claims Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">We think this exception bars appellants\u2019 restated claim. Reading the amended complaint in the fashion most favorable to plaintiffs, John Walker &amp; Sons v. Tampa Cigar Co., supra, it charges that Dr. Moffit negligently and erroneously notified plaintiffs that the hogs were infected with hog cholera, and that such negligent notification proxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>mately caused Rey to have administered the serum which caused the death of the hogs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The amended complaint centered its allegations upon negligent transmission of erroneous misinformation to plaintiffs-appellants. Whatever the additional allegations of negligence in the defendant United States\u2019 operations, the negligently erroneous transmission of misinformation is the crucial element in the chain of causation from defendant\u2019s negligence to plaintiffs\u2019 damages. It is the key fact to be established, the <em>sine qua non, </em>of the theory of the amended complaint. Barred by the quarantine exception, Section 2680(f), from proceeding with their original theory, appellants\u2019 change of direction leaves them still statutorily barred. Misrepresentation, although asserted in terms of negligence, is the tortious act now relied on for recovery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201cThe provisions of this chapter and section 1346(b) of this title shall not apply to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-19\">(h) Any claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, <em>misrepresentation, </em>deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>But Section 2680(h) bars claims arising out of <em>negligent </em>misrepresentation as well as claims arising out of intentional misrepresentation. United States v. Neustadt, 1961, 366 U.S. 696, 701-702, 81 S.Ct. 1294, 1298, 6 L.Ed.2d 614, 619. In a case bearing striking resemblance to the case at bar, Hall v. United States, 10 Cir. 1959, 274 F.2d 69, plaintiff cattleman sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The complaint alleged that employees of the Department of Agriculture tested plaintiff\u2019s cattle for Brucel-losis and told plaintiff that one or more of his cattle were suffering from the disease. This diagnosis was alleged to have been incorrect due to negligence and to have proximately resulted in plaintiff\u2019s having to sell his herd at less than the fair market price. The district court dismissed on the basis of the quarantine exception (Section 2680(f)) but the court of appeals affirmed on the basis of the misrepresentation exception (Section 2680(h)). Specifically the court said\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-13\">\u201cWe must then look beyond the literal meaning of the language to ascertain the real cause of complaint. Plaintiff\u2019s real claim is that because of the negligent manner in which these tests were made, the result showed that plaintiff\u2019s cattle were diseased; whereas, in fact, they were free from disease and that the Government misrepresented the true condition of these cattle. Plaintiff\u2019s loss came about when the Government agents misrepresented the condition of the cattle, telling him they were diseased when, in fact, they were free from disease. The claim is that this misrepresentation caused plaintiff to sell his cattle at a loss. This stated a cause of action predicated on a misrepresentation. Misrepresentation as used in the exclusionary provision of the Statute was meant to include negligent misrepresentation.\u201d 274 F.2d at 71.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Any doubt as to the precedential weight to be accorded to <em>Hall </em>disappears in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in United States v. Neustadt, supra. The Court there held that the misrepresentation exception barred an action by a person who purchased a home in reliance upon an FHA appraisal which negligently overstated the fair market value. The <em>Neustadt </em>court specifically foreclosed any attempt, similar to that of plaintiffs-appellants here, to avoid the bar of Section 2680(h) by alleging negligence in the generation of information which formed the basis of a misrepresentation rather than the actual misrepresentation itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201cThroughout this line of decisions, the argument has been made by plaintiffs, and consistently rejected by the courts, until this case [below], that the bar of \u00a7 2680(h) does not apply when the gist of the claim lies in <em>negligence </em>underlying the inaccurate representation, i. e., when the claim is phrased as one \u2018arising out of\u2019 negligence rather than \u2018misrepresentation.\u2019 But this argument, as was forcefully demonstrated by the Tenth Circuit in Hall v. United States, supra, is nothing more than an attempt to circumvent \u00a7 2680(h) by denying that it applies to negligent misrepresentation.\u201d (emphasis original) 366 U.S. at 703, 81 S.Ct. at 1298, 6 L.Ed.2d at 619.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Following this statement the Supreme Court quoted the same language from <em>Hall, </em>that we quote, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Inasmuch as the amended complaint charged no more than either negligent misrepresentation or the negligent preparation of information which was thereafter misrepresented to plaintiffs-appellants, the claim sought to be pleaded is barred by Title 28, U.S.C., Section 2680(h). Any claims based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining allegations (of the original complaint) dealing with the quarantine, are, as the district court held, barred by Title 28, U.S.C., Sec. 2680(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Assuming as true the facts as they emerge from the most favorable reading possible of either or both of appellants\u2019 pleadings of them, and as supplemented by Rey\u2019s affidavit, we think it is clear that no claim upon which relief may be granted has been stated or can conceivably be proved. In these unusual circumstances, the dismissal below on the pleadings <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> passes muster. Hoshman v. Esso Standard Oil Co., 5 Cir. 1959, 263 F.2d 499, 502, cert, denied, 361 U.S. 818, 80 S.Ct. 60, 4 L.Ed. 64; Feinberg v. Leach, 5 Cir. 1957, 243 F.2d 64, 67; Hilliard v.
