that the words \u201cComputer Communications\u201d form a significant part of appellant\u2019s trademark design and impression, especially since \u201cComputer Communications\u201d is also appellant\u2019s trade name; that appellant\u2019s goods are not closely related to those of the prior registrations; and that appellant\u2019s goods are sold to discriminating, technically-oriented purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-18\">The board found that \u201cwhile the goods of applicant and the goods set forth in the cited registrations are not identical, they are closely related products which could be sold to the same class of purchasers through the same channels of trade.\u201d The board properly considered both marks in their entireties, and was of the view that the design portion of appellant\u2019s mark was its most visually prominent feature. While it accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>appellant\u2019s contentions considering the discriminating purchasers, the board pointed out that \u201cbeing skilled in one\u2019s art does not necessarily preclude mistaking one trademark for another when the marks are as similar as those before us, and cover merchandise in the same general field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-4\">We agree with the reasoning and decision of the board. We do not think that the presence of appellant\u2019s \u201cComputer Communications\u201d sufficiently differentiates between the marks, considering appellant\u2019s prominent letter-design portion. Moreover, while the relationship between goods as well as between marks is almost always one of degree, we are not convinced that the respective goods under consideration are so diverse as to prevent a reasonable likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception when two such similar marks are applied to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1447-19\">.

I would reverse the refusal to register.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">This is the ex parte rejection of an application to register a trademark based on two prior registrations of a mark to Graphic Controls Corporation of the logotype consisting of a small letter \u201cC\u201d within a larger letter \u201cG\u201d, as depicted in the majority opinion. This logo or mark will unquestionably be associated, by those familiar with it, with the name of its owner, Graphic Controls. Neither the majority opinion nor the opinion of the board, of which it is a paraphrase, mentions this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-10\">It is further emphasized that the \u201cGC\u201d logo is the entire reference, -no words of any kind being associated therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-11\">As the examiner made clear, rejection is based on section 2(d) of the Trademark Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d)) which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-13\">No trade-mark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-14\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1448-15\">(d) Consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office * * * as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive * * * .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1448-16\">The question, therefore, is, strictly, whether there is a likelihood that the hypothetical concurrent use of the two marks would be likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-17\">Appellant\u2019s mark is not just the logo C-within-a-C. If it were, I would readily concede that concurrent use with the reference mark on the goods of the respective parties would be likely to cause confusion as to source of the goods. However, as appellant has continuously emphasized \u2014 in vain \u2014 an integral part of its mark is the two words prominently running out from the center of the smaller \u201cC\u201d: \u201cComputer Communications.\u201d Both the board and the majority have decided this case just as though they did not exist. The board decided that the \u201cCC\u201d design is the \u201cmost prominent feature of applicant\u2019s mark\u201d in view of which \u201cthere is substantial similarity\u201d to the reference mark, which of course there is. But a finding of substantial similarity does not justify a legal conclusion of likelihood of confusion. <em>All </em>of the facts must be considered. The board also said that \u201cComputer Communications\u201d is \u201cof little, if any, <em>trademark </em>significance\u201d (my emphasis), giving no reasons. Presumably, it is supposed to have some descriptive connotation, though no one has ever explained why or if that is so or what im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1395\">*1395</page-number>portance it has.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not concerned with the <em>trademark </em>significance of those words by themselves any more than we are concerned with the trademark significance of the big \u201cC\u201d or the little \u201cC\u201d by itself. The only thing we are concerned with is whether when the mark sought to be registered is used, including <em>each and every one of its elements combined in the way that they are, </em>it would be likely to cause confusion, mistake, or to deceive, assuming concurrent use of the Graphic Controls \u201cGC\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">I am unable to conceive of how confusion, mistake, or deception as to the origin of the goods could result from a mark having as <em>a </em>prominent feature the words \u201cComputer Communications,\u201d which happens to be appellant\u2019s trade name. To me that is more than enough to prevent confusion. It does not matter that the rest of the mark is also \u201cprominent,\u201d or even more eye-catching than the words. In short, appellant is not trying to register the \u201cCC\u201d portion of the mark but only the unitary whole which, in my view, cannot be brought within the prohibition of section 2(d). The mark carries within itself its own immunization from that statutory provision. Computer Communications, Inc., is the source of these goods is what it says to the beholder, not some company whose initials may be \u201cGC\u201d or \u201cCG\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">The board, in my view, did not view the marks in their entireties, as the majority says. It found the \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d in the \u201cdesign feature\u201d and disposed of the word portion of the mark (which is part of the design but apparently was not so regarded by the board) by saying it was without \u201ctrademark\u201d significance, \u201cconnotatively or visually.\u201d I can see no justification for this latter holding. The words actually connote the source of the goods and they are visually prominent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1449-17\">. In Ms first action, the examiner required these words to be disclaimed and applicant obligingly did so in these words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEh\">No registration rights are claimed for the words \u201cCOMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS\u201d apart from the mark shown in the drawing, but applicant waives none of its common law rights therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aoz-dedup-0\">At most, such a disclaimer means no more than that the applicant is not claiming any <em>registration </em>rights in the disclaimed words per se \u2014 i. e., <em>apart </em>from the mark as a whole. It has no bearing on the question of likelihood of confusion arising from the unitary mark which in-eludes the disclaimed words. The only reason the examiner gave for requiring the disclaimer was, \u201cthe same is not the subject of exclusive appropriation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
