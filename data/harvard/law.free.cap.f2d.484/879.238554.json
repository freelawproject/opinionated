United States, 164 U.S. 492, 501-02, 17 S.Ct. 154, 157, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and although no court has held that the' instruction itself is unconstitutional, it has had a stormy career.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-21\">From 1963 to 1969, the Allen charge, supplemented by a second paragraph advising the jury that the case \u201cmust be retried\u201d if the jury failed to reach a verdict, was generally given in this cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>cuit as part of the Manual on Jury Instructions in Federal Criminal Cases (La Buy Instructions), 33 F.R.D. 523, 611 (1963).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">In United States v.

In dealing with supplementary instructions, the primary task of an appellate court is to set the standards for the proper conduct of the trial judge faced with a hung jury. We have reconsidered not only the presently approved form of the Allen charge as set forth in the LaBuy Instructions, but the numerous judicial decisions and scholarly literature in this field critical of the Allen charge. We have concluded that it would serve the interests of justice to require under our supervisory power that, in the future, district courts within this Circuit when faced with deadlocked juries comply with the standards suggested by the American Bar Association\u2019s Trial By Jury publication. These standards specifically provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">5.4 Length of deliberations; deadlocked jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-10\">(a) Before the jury retires for deliberation, the court may give an instruction which informs the jury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">(i) that in order to return a verdict, each juror must agree thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-12\">(ii) that jurors have a duty to consult with one another and to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement, if it can he done without violence to individual judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">(iii) that each juror must decide the case for himself, but only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with his fellow jurors;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-14\">(iv) that in the course of deliberations, a juror should not hesitate to reexamine his own views and change his opinion if convinced it is erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-15\">(v) that no juror should surrender his honest conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion of his fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-16\">(b) If it appears to the court that the jury has been unable to agree, the court may require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>jury to continue their deliberations and may give or repeat an instruction as provided in subsection (a).

Silvern, No. 72-1133 (7th Cir. February 27, 1973). The majority also agrees with the panel\u2019s disposition of the other issues in the case and we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">However in the interest of judicial economy and uniformity, and under our supervisory power, district courts in this circuit are henceforth required to do the following in both civil and criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number> If a supplemental instruction is deemed necessary and provided that the following instruction has been given prior to the time the jury has retired, it may be repeated: <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-5\">The verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror.

Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but do so only after an impartial consideration of the evidence with your fellow jurors. In the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to reexamine your own views and change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous. But do not surrender your honest conviction as to the weight or effect of evidence solely because of the opinion of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b937-7\">You are not partisans.

I do so with some reluctance because of my respect for the good judgment of my brothers and because my opinion with regard to the LaBuy-modified <em>Allen </em>charge apparently runs counter to a considerable body of scholarly thought elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">In all candor, I do not find myself disturbed by the charge given by Judge Austin in the trial below. Apparently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>the majority of this court is really not too disturbed either because the charge was held not to violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights and not to be prejudicial. Nevertheless, apparently writing section one of a manual of instructions, the court states that deviation from the precise language of that instruction in the deadlocked jury situation is reversible error. I experience conceptual difficulty, even under our supervisory power, in establishing a standard from which no deviation may occur when we do so in the very case in which we hold that a deviation was neither constitutionally impermissible nor otherwise prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">My basic feeling is that the matter of writing instructions should remain in the hands of the trial judges. They are the ones at the battle site who are best in the position to judge which instructions are appropriate to the factual issues. Likewise they are best in the position to determine the nature, necessity, and verbiage of instructions to be given in connection with the functional aspects of jury deliberation, including those that may be necessary when it reasonably appears that a jury has reached the status of being deadlocked. If in any instruction the court misstates the law and the effect is prejudicial then, of course, a reversal would ordinarily follow. By prescribing the exact language in which a trial judge may instruct in the deadlocked situation we are, it seems to me, substantially circumscribing the discretionary flexibility needed by the trial judge for effective trial administration. It is one thing to find no error in an instruction which has been given in a trial, thereby putting our tacit approval on it, and an entirely different matter to engage in <em>a priori </em>processes of word fixation.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">In considering the desirability in our trial procedures of the giving of an instruction such as the one given by Judge Austin, we should look at it in the context of the occasion in which it is utilized. While we probably should not say as an absolute, <em>necessitas est lex tempor-is et loci, </em>because our system of justice does not mandatorily require that every jury should render a verdict, nevertheless it seems to me that it is desirable that a disposition should be reached if it can be without compromise of honest conviction or violence to individual judgment. I find nothing wrong in Judge Austin\u2019s admonition that \u201c[i]t is your duty to decide the case if you can conscientiously do so.\u201d Indeed, the ABA recommendations do not deny the desirability of giving an additional instruction to the deadlocked jury with regard to their duty to deliberate with a view to reaching an agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">In the context of the situation of the deadlocked jury it appears t\u00f3 me that three basic situations might be involved. The first of these is where the jury is evenly or approximately evenly divided. Here, if the deliberations have been of some substantial duration it appears to me that there is not sufficient \u201cdynamite\u201d in the challenged charge to cause the situation to change. As a matter of fact, the challenged charge is primarily concerned with the situation where there is a small minority holding out against a majority. The remaining two basic situations are found in the latter posture. While there may be subcategories, and at the risk of oversimplification, the minority jurors are either reasonable or unreasonable. If the obdurateness of the minority is of the latter type, whether flowing from corruption or from what some trial lawyers inelegantly refer to as pigheadedness, it seems unlikely that the challenged charge will have much blasting effect. If it did, I cannot say that this would necessarily be a bad result, at least as long as reason is to play some part in jury determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Ultimately then we are concerned with those jurors who are reasonable but are conscientiously unconvinced that the majority position is correct. We would all agree, I think, that no juror, but particularly not the type of juror just described, should feel that he is being' pressured by the trial judge to agree to a verdict just for the sake of closing out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>the case. I do not find such pressure in the challenged charge. It is axiomatic that no one instruction encompasses all of the law in a case. Likewise, each paragraph of a particular instruction should be considered as a part of the whole. Thus, even though the jurors in the challenged instruction are reminded that absolute certainty cannot be expected (which is probably a truism) and that the case will be left open and undecided if a verdict is not reached (also true), on balance the jurors are sufficiently instructed that they do not have to surrender their honest convictions merely for the purpose of returning a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Looking at the overall impact of the challenged instruction, it appears to me that it advises jurors that as reasonable persons they should take another look at whether their position is reasonable and correct. It also is to be noted that this admonition is directed at the majority as well as the minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">If we become embroiled in semantical niceties in looking at instructions, niceties which have arguably little impact upon the lay people composing juries,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 then I would tend to think that the ABA based instruction (which has been now laid down as the only instruction which can be given to a deadlocked jury) could be interpreted by the average juror as being a \u201cbugle call\u201d for a hung jury. That is no more to be desired than is an instruction which improperly pressures a unanimous decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">Further, I cannot agree with the majority decision in two other respects. The requirement that the deadlocked instruction can only be given when it is first given as a part of the regular charge exceeds the ABA standard \u201cmay give or repeat . . . . \u201d Secondly, and this follows from what I have already said, I would in any event include in the prescribed instruction the words which were <em>recommended, </em>by the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System of the Judicial Conference of the United States (footnote 7 of the majority opinion):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-17\">\u201c(v) that each juror who finds himself in the minority should reconsider his views in the light of the opinions of the majority, and each juror who finds himself in the majority should give equal consideration to the views of the minority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">The committee\u2019s comments are illuminating :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-19\">\u201cThis additional paragraph makes it perfectly clear that instructions to take the views of other jurors into account are not directed solely to minority jurors and also reflects the viewpoint of several leading jurists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-20\">I concur in the suggestion of the majority opinion that consideration be given to letting the jury have the instructions during its deliberation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-21\">. Although <em>obiter dieta, </em>in the context of the case being appealed, law is nevertheless declared, preumably under the supervisory power of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-8\">. Judge Arterburn, now Chief Judge, of the Indiana Supreme Court put the matter aptly in Hendrix v. Harbelis, 248 Ind. 619, 230 N.E.2d 315 (1967), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ai1-dedup-0\">\u201cInstructing a jury is a most difficult and complex process. It is generally conceded that there has been an overemphasis placed upon the wording and refined meaning of instructions which far exceed their actual effect upon the jury. When an instruction has to be read and reread by a legally trained mind to catch a slight variation or error in its meaning, it is difficult to believe that a jury of laymen could have been misled. Words are mere signs or symbols of meaning and thought, which are never exact. We strive with inexact tools to work out refinements and precise lines in statements of thoughts and ideas, but are never able to reach exact perfection. In the writing of instructions, we are eternally confronted with attempts and failures at exactitude, and we must keep this human frailty in mind when we examine the language of instructions.\u201d 230 N.E.2d at 319.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b939-21\">STEVENS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AVX-\">(concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">Recognizing the importance of an unambiguous statement of the rule to be applied in this circuit in the future, I concur in the clear, straight-forward opinion which Judge Sprecher has writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>ten. Candor, however, compels me to add two brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">1. In view of the references to United States v. DeStefano, 476 F.2d 324 (7th Cir. 1973), in both the majority and dissenting opinions, it may be of significance to record the fact that I cast one of the four votes in favor of granting the petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>in that case. The reason for my vote was my concern that the panel opinion had incorrectly decided that the failure of the district court to subpoena an occurrence witness violated the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process. <em>Id. </em>at 329-331.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">2. I have not yet been able satisfactorily to explain to myself how this circuit can lawfully announce that an instruction to a jury which the Supreme Court has specifically and squarely held is not reversible error in federal criminal trials shall in the future constitute reversible error when given in such trials conducted in the Seventh Circuit. Possibly the answer is confidence that Supreme Court review of a decision such as this would lead to an overruling of <em>Allen. </em>That confidence may well be misplaced, cf. Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S.356, 92 S.Ct. 1620, 32 L.Ed.2d 152; even if warranted, it does not provide a completely satisfactory answer to a difficult question.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">. That case, incidentally, suggests a difference between a mandate directing the trial court to take action \u201cconsistent with\u201d as opposed to \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d a given standard. In both <em>DeStefano </em>and <em>Silvern </em>instructions which were consistent with the ABA standards were given, as expressly required by <em>Brown. </em>The issue was whether additional instructions, not required by <em>Brown </em>but permitted by <em>Allen, </em>were inconsistent with a lawfully required standard, and if so, whether that inconsistency was reversible error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b940-6\">SWYGERT, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AZi\">(dissenting in part, concurring in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">I am in full agreement with the preservation of our decision in United States v. Brown, 411 F.2d 930 (7th Cir. 1969), and with the majority\u2019s decision that any deviation from it will henceforth result in a reversal. However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s failure to find reversible error by the district judge\u2019s refusal to follow our mandate in <em>Brown. </em>The majority seems to excuse the judge by an allegedly vague sentence in the <em>Brown </em>opinion: \u201cIn order to avoid the potential for prejudice and coercion to which we have referred, district courts in this Circuit are required henceforth to charge deadlocked juries in both criminal and civil cases in a manner consistent with the recommended standards.\u201d 411 F.2d at 934. After citing this sentence the majority says: \u201cAlthough our 1969 language was designed to produce uniform practices within the circuit, it has not had that result, possibly because of the final words that deadlocked juries be charged \u2018in a manner consistent with the recommended standards.\u2019 Widespread deviations from and substantial supplements to the ABA standards have been considered to be \u2018consistent with\u2019 them and \u2018complying\u2019 with them. United States v. DeStefano, 476 F.2d 324 (7th Cir. 1973).\u201d The citation of <em>DeStefano </em>is unfortunate. That case dealt with deviations from the <em>Brown </em>standards closely similar to those seen here and indulged in by the same judge. More important is the fact that a majority of this court agreed but were denied the opportunity to rehear it <em>en banc, </em>since the defendant DeStefano died prior to the rehearing. Therefore, I submit, the holding of the majority of the panel in <em>DeStefano </em>is a questionable precedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, if the reference to <em>DeStefano </em>should be interpreted as an assertion that \u201cwidespread deviations from and substantial supplements to the ABA standards\u201d have occurred throughout the Circuit since <em>Brown, </em>there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>scant support for such an interpretation, According to the appeals that have been heard, only two judges within the Circuit have deviated from the ABA standards mandated by <em>Brown.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">That the district judge was confused or had difficulty with the alleged vagueness of the language in <em>Brown </em>is belied by the record. Because the point is important I quote a large portion of the colloquy between the judge and counsel which preceded the jury\u2019s reception of the supplemental instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aac-dedup-0\">It is clear from the record that the trial judge \u2014 despite the lip service he paid to <em>Brown </em>and its requirement of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>jury \u201ccharge ... in a manner consistent with the recommended standards\u201d- \u2014 deliberately incorporated most of the <em>Allen </em>charge which had been condemned by this court in <em>Brown. </em>If it is true that our mandate in <em>Brown </em>of consistent adherence to the ABA standards is sufficiently ambiguous to authorize a range of equivalent jury charges, the broadest reasonable reading of <em>Brown </em>would not approve what the judge did here. To give, as the judge himself put it, \u201ca modified charge, <em>modified from the Allen charge,\u201d </em>was a clear violation of our direction in <em>Brown </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The majority\u2019s opinion on rehearing does not address itself to the coercive elements of the charge given in this case, nor to their likely prejudicial effect. Most of the coercive admonitions contained in the <em>Allen </em>charge were given. See note 5, majority opinion. Moreover, it does not deal with the untimeliness of the supplemental charge. After the jury had deliberated for fourteen hours on two successive days, the trial judge <em>sua sponte </em>advised counsel that he proposed to give the jury a supplemental charge. The jury, however, was deadlocked neither then nor after the judge and counsel had discussed the proposed supplemental charge, for the first opinion in this ease is in error in its assertion that the jury \u201chad informed the judge that they were in fact deadlocked.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Immediately before he put his proposal into effect, the judge asked the jury whether they had \u201cyet arrived at a verdict.\u201d He received a response of \u201cnot yet.\u201d This phrase may hardly be taken to justify the elaborate charge which followed. In <em>Brown </em>we repeatedly laid stress on the fact that the ABA recital was to be given to deadlocked juries. It may be true, I admit, that an instruction following <em>Brown </em>is appropriate even if a jury has not deliberated to the point of deadlock, provided it has consumed in unsuccessful deliberation an amount of time which is patently out of proportion to the difficulty of the issues in the case before it and the amount of testimony taken at trial. When the proper time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>has passed, the trial judge should then make discreet inquiry of the jurors as to the status of their deliberations. If they estimate that a verdict is close at hand, their instruction under <em>Brown </em>is clearly inappropriate. This case \u2014 broad in its issues, arguably close on its facts, and lengthy in its trial<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 fails to fit the first formula after fourteen hours of deliberation, see United States v. Flan-nery, 451 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1971), Burroughs v. United States, 365 F.2d 431 (10th Cir. 1966), <em>but cf. </em>Thaggard v. United States, 354 F.2d 735 (5th Cir. 1966), and the failure of the trial judge to ascertain the probable imminence of a verdict is unquestionably clear. The instruction modified from <em>Allen, </em>then, is not the only reason to reverse this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-11\">. Judge Fairchild dissented in the <em>De-Stefano </em>opinion and the order of this court dated April 20, 1973 reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-12\">It is ordered that the appeal is dismissed as moot and the district court is directed to enter an order vacating the judgment of conviction and dismissing the indictment as moot.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-6\">. The trial in Brandom v. United States, 431 F.2d 1391 (7th Cir. 1970), predated the <em>Brown </em>decision. <em>DeStefano </em>and the case at bar were tried by the same judge; one other deviation occurred in United States v. Baranski, No. 71-0-576, (N.D. Ill.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\">. MR. SULLIVAN: With regard to the last part about the \u2014 another jury, you should not think that some other group\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">MR. SULLIVAN: Now, that is not in the Brown case and I think it harkens back to the very kind of instruction that has been criticized and condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">THE COURT: No, the instruction that lias been criticized and condemned, and I have lifted this from that ease, the one that is condemned states that, \u201cIf you should fail to agree on a verdict, the case is left open \u2014 another jury must decide it.\u201d That is the way that reads.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">It has been suggested by the Court of Appeals that I use the phrase which I have, \u201cis left open and undecided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">MR. SULLIVAN: But all that follows that about other people and other \u2014 from the community, and you must not assume it is going to be tried differently or more evidence, in Brandom vs. United States, 431 Fed.2d 1391, decided last year\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">THE COURT: Seventh Circuit?</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">See, we have a special rule in the Seventh Circuit. You can give the old Allen Charge in every other Circuit but here but [Brown] says that we are going to be unique ... I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if no other Circuit follows the Seventh Circuit in regard to the Allen Charge. So I am conforming to the revised \u2014 you have the balance of this opinion ?</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">MR. SULLIVAN: It is all there, Judge. I tore off part of a page that deals with a different case.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-17\">THE COURT: This is the last sentence and this is what I was looking for, \u201cIn order to avoid the potential for prejudice and coercion, to which we have referred, the District Courts in this Circuit are required henceforth to charge deadlocked juries in both criminal and civil cases in a manner consistent with the recommended standard.\u201d I have made a determination that this is consistent with the recommended standards and here is your last sentence of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">MR. SULLIVAN: Well, in the Brandom case\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">THE COURT: From what Circuit?</p>\n<p id=\"b941-21\">MR. SULLIVAN: The Seventh. And as I understand this opinion, this was the original charge, not a recharge after the jury didn\u2019t agree, the court said many of the same things that you have said; \u201cIf you fail to agree on the verdict, the ease is left open and undecided, and like all cases it must be disposed of some time. If the case is retried a future jury must be selected in the same manner and from the same source as you have been chosen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-22\">THE COURT: Is that condemned in the Brandom case?</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">MR. SULLIVAN: No, not outright condemned. I would like to read it to you so that we can all make a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-25\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-26\">MR. SULLIVAN: (Continuing) and from the same source as you have been chosen, and there is no reason to believe that the case would ever be submitted to twelve men or women more competent to decide this case than those of you who compose the present jury. There is no reason to believe that there will be more or clearer evidence produced at a future trial, therefore, I urge you to deliberate in this case with the disposition to be convinced \u2014 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-28\">THE COURT: I am not going to say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-30\">MR. SULLIVAN: All right. \u201cTherefore, I urge you to deliberate in this case with the disposition to be convinced, at the same time directing you that your verdict must be a conscientious decision of each individual juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-31\"><em>% </em>if* s|! S\u00a1! 8\u00a1S</p>\n<p id=\"b941-32\">MR. LAPIDUS: The case was affirmed, your Honor. That instruction was affirmed, by the way, in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-34\">MR. SULLIVAN: Well, here is what they said \u2014 they affirmed in Brown, too, but\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b941-35\">THE COURT: But for the reason that the instruction had heretofore been approved by the Seventh Circuit and then they turned turtle in the Brown ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>MR. SULLIVAN: Right, but then as I say, this was not part of the supplemental charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">In Brown the court held that \u201cThe defendant failed to show that the supplemental court charge was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversal. In the instant case the instruction in question was part of the trial court\u2019s general instruction. Even more than in Brown the instruction here given before this court\u2019s decision in Brown contains insufficient interference with the jury\u2019s free deliberation so as to create a prejudicial atmosphere. We reaffirm the position taken in Brown that the Allen type charge may contain elements of potential coercion and is in conflict with the American Bar Association\u2019s recommended instruction. Accordingly, we reaffirm the future use by the District Courts of this Circuit of the standards and practices set out in Brown.\u201d End of Judge Will\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">THE COURT: The Court of Appeals, if necessary, will \u2014 the record will clearly demonstrate that I have been adequately warned by you of the consequences of the heinous thing that I am about to commit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b943-26\">.
