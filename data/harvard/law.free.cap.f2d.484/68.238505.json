Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 431 F.2d 409, Part I (5tlr Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">In this 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 action, petitioner alleges that he did not \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waive counsel. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). The District Court, relying on the record before it, held that the waiver was effective. Finding an unresolved conflict regarding petitioner\u2019s pre-trial hearing remarks, we vacate and remand for an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">Petitioner was convicted upon his trial by jury in a Florida court of two counts of breaking and entering. Aff\u2019d Salesky v. State, 256 So.2d 250 (Fla.App.1972). At trial, petitioner alleged that he could not be adequately represented by the public defender. He claims that he was misled by said attorney into believing that he had an absolute right to appointment of separate counsel even after severance of his co-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-16\">Petitioner was informed by the trial court that, if he would not accept court-appointed counsel, he must defend himself, a proposition which he did not favor. His response, when asked at trial if he was prepared to defend himself, was recorded as \u201cI am ready,\u201d but he alleges in his habeas petition that he said, \u201cI am not ready.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">In its response to a show cause order, the Government relied primarily on this contested statement, which petitioner says was inaccurately recorded. The District Court indicates that it relied on the statement as it appeared in the record. But a review of the record indicates that the recorded response as to his readiness for trial appears inconsistent with the position defendant maintained throughout the hearing and trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">Since the transcript in question has seemingly been relied upon by both the Government and the District Court and has been reasonably challenged by petitioner, we conclude that a hearing to determine its accuracy is necessary. Petitioner\u2019s argument can then be reconsidered by the District Court after the accurate facts have been determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
