It commenced operations there in September 1969, and not quite a year later, in August 1970, the Union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated its campaign to or-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>'^'\u00e1nize the Company\u2019s production and nihintenance employees. An open and vigorously contested campaign ensued. On-October 2, 1970, the Union claimed ' ter have been designated as the employees\u2019 exclusive bargaining representa\u2019tive on the basis of authorization cards arid offered to prove its majority status. Tt\u2018\"requested that the Company bargain with it, but the Company refused, preferring a Labor Board-supervised election to determine the true desires of the . employees. Thereafter the Union filed an election petition, and an election was .scheduled to be held on January 14, 4971, The election was postponed indefinitely because two days beforehand the \u00abUnion filed a charge principally asserting that the Company discriminatorily withheld overtime from employees be-\u2022cadse of union activities and that for the same reason the Company effectuated a layoff on December 18, 1970, substantially reducing its Effingham work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">\u2022 \u25a0 The Regional Director refused to issue a complaint because his investigation established, with respect to the first allegation, that the Company did not diminish employee opportunities for overtime after the commencement of the Union\u2019s organizational campaign and, with r^pect to the second, that (1) the layoff occurred after a marked decline in purchase orders without any anticipation of ah'increase in the foreseeable future; (2) a substantial inventory of manufactured goods was still on hand; and (3) the least senior employees were selected for layoff. However, on March 22, 1971, the Regional Director issued a cojnplaint after the filing of an amended Union charge asserting that between late August 1970 and the middle of the following December the Company committed various violations of Section 8(a),'(l) of the National Labor Relations Acti.(29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1)) and that it refused to bargain with the Union in violation of Section 8(a)(5) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5)) on and after October 2, 1970, the date when the Union demanded recognition while holding authorization cards of a majority of employees in the appropriate bargaining unit. No election was ever held.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-6\">The Trial Examiner found no violation in the majority of the alleged instances of conduct violative of Section 8(a) (1) but concluded that the Company had engaged in unfair labor practices defined in that Section and had refused to bargain with the Union in violation of Section 8(a)(5). In recommending that the Company be ordered to bargain with the Union, he stated without further elaboration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1164-7\">\u201cBefore and after the Union\u2019s demand for recognition the Company engaged in numerous unfair labor practices of a character inherently capable of affecting the results of any election procedures and requiring in the instant case a bargaining order as the only effective and appropriate remedial relief. I conclude on the basis of the facts herein and on the authority of Gibson Products Company, 185 NLRB No. 74, that the Company\u2019s refusal to bargain was unlawful and can only be remedied by an order to bargain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-8\">The Board disagreed with the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings of Section 8(a)(1) violations in two instances, dismissed several alleged violations concerning which the Trial Examiner made no findings, and found a violation in one instance where the Trial Examiner had not. With these exceptions the Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s Section 8(a)(1) findings. It likewise adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the Company had violated Section 8(a)(5). In this regard the Board agreed that the Union represented a majority of its employees when it sought recognition on October 2, 1970. It decided that the critical date for determining the majority status where no election has been held was the date the Union sought recognition. It held that the Union then had 24 clearly valid authorization cards out of a unit of 39 employees, so that the Union represented a majority of the employees when it sought recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>In support of its decision and order requiring the Company to bargain with the Union (198 NLRB No. 138), the Board stated simply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1165-8\">\u201cThe facts show that, as soon as the Union began to organize, Respondent began to undermine the Union. Thus Respondent [1] systematically polled union sentiment, [2] created the impression of union surveillance and [3] directed a supervisor in the presence of an employee to segregate a union supporter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [4] repeatedly interrogated employees about their own and others\u2019 union sympathies and about attendance at a union meeting, [5] made repeated efforts to have an employee persuade others to give up their support of the Union, [6] promised a change for the better in working conditions, [7] threatened worsened working conditions, and [8] threatened a plant shutdown and layoff \u2014 all in discouragement of union support. These unfair labor practices were directed at undermining union strength and impeding the election process. Applying the standards of N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., [395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547], we consider whether there is still a possibility of ensuring a ...fair election. We believe that possibility is slight because of the lingering coercive effect of the unfair labor practices. [Footnote omitted.] We therefore hold that the employees\u2019 majority designation of the Union as expressed in their authorization cards provides in this case a more reliable measure of the employees\u2019 true desires than would be provided by an election.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">The Company has requested us to set aside the Board\u2019s order, prompting the Board to file a cross-petition for enforcement. We deny enforcement of the bargaining order but, with three exceptions as to the Section 8(a)(1) unfair labor practices, enforce the remainder of the Board\u2019s order remedying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-14\">\n<em>Section 8(a)(1) Unfair Labor Practices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-15\">First of all, the Board found that the Company thrice violated Section 8(a)(1) when Plant Manager Richard W. Kritzer, Jr. conversed with other supervisors in the presence of his confidential secretary, Vicky Steele. In one conversation which occurred on about September 11, 1970, Kritzer inquired of supervisors Becton, Stigers, Embry and Hardiek<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>afo\u2019\u00f3M their knowledge of employees\u2019 Union sympathy and asked them to check probable sympathy against an employee check list. This conversation occurred iti'the privacy of Kritzer\u2019s office, but because his confidential secretary was then present, the Board found that \u201csuch systematic inquiry and tabulation\u201d coerced or restrained her in the exercise of her Section 7 rights. A few minutes after this conversation, Kritzer engaged in another conversation with Embry, who remained in Kritzer\u2019s office after the other supervisors had left. They conferred about who among the employees was the chief instigator of the Union movement and decided it was employee Benny Kessler. Again since Vicky Steele overheard this conversation \u2014She was seated at her desk during bbth\u2019conversations \u2014 the Board found it created the impression of surveillance, thus' violating her Section 7 rights. When Kritzer and Embry thereupon decided that Kessler should be segregated from the other employees,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the Board found still another Section 8(a)(1) violation because this coerced Vicky Steele.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay-d\">As the Board concedes, these three- violations are premised upon its view- that a confidential secretary is an \u2018\u2018employee\u201d within the meaning of the Act and therefore entitled to its protections. However, we cannot accept this premise. For the reasons persuasively Stated by Judge Craven in National Labor Relations Board v. Wheeling Electric Co., 444 F.2d 783 (4th Cir. 1971), we hold that Mrs. Steele\u2019s position as confidential secretary rendered her a supervisor excluded from the protection of the Act by Section 2(3) thereof (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) ).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the finding that the Company committed the foregoing three unfair labor practices is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-12\">The majority of the remaining unfair labor practices found by the Board consist of eight incidents of interrogation concerning Union sentiment; the others involve a promise of improved benefits and working conditions, three incidents of threats, and several anti-Union solicitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">Plant Manager Kritzer was found to have unlawfully interrogated employee Layton when on or shortly before September 4, 1970, he asked him if he was planning to attend a Union meeting scheduled for that evening, remarking that he should take a pad and pencil and jot down notes. Shortly thereafter Lay-ton signed a Union authorization card. Subsequent to the meeting Kritzer asked Layton how many employees had attended, to which Layton candidly responded, and Kritzer was again found to have made an unlawful interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">The Board found that supervisor Embry <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> made an unlawful interrogation when in the course of a mid-November conversation, which quite possibly occurred in a tavern over beer, he asked employee Shope, apparently a friend, what he thought about the Union. When Shope responded that he had not given it much thought, Embry added that \u201che didn\u2019t think we needed * * * [the Union and that] we would get laid off and they would cause a lot of trouble <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>and close the factory down.\u201d Embry was thus also found to have threatened Shope with the loss of his job. Similarly Embry was found to have engaged in unlawful interrogation of employee Fer-chow and to have threatened him when in the course of two or three talks with Ferchow during the last three months of 1970 he asked Ferchow what he thought he could gain from the Union and whether he thought it was a good idea to have one at Peerless and when on one occasion Embry stated \u201cOld man Kritzer [the plant manager\u2019s father] in Chicago would rather shut down the Effingham plant than let a union come in there.\u201d To Embry\u2019s query, Ferchow candidly responded, \u201c * * * yes, I did, I thought it [the Union] was a good idea.\u201d Although the Trial Examiner disagreed, Embry was also found to have unlawfully promised employee Dorothy Stevenson improved benefits and working conditions. The basis for this finding was Miss Stevenson\u2019s testimony that early in October 1970 Embry approached her, stating \u201cI don\u2019t believe we need a union.\u201d When she expressed her disagreement, he said, \u201che thought we could get the problems ironed out amongst ourselves, that they realized they made mistakes and they would try to do better from here on out, and that he thought we should give Mr. O\u2019Connor [the Company\u2019s president] enough time, maybe six months, I\u2019m sure he can get things patched up.\u201d In response Miss Stevenson told him, \u201cthey had had enough time and they should have thought about that sooner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">Extrusion Superintendent Julian Bec-ton was found to have made three illegal interrogations and a six-fold unlawful solicitation of employee Jack Stevenson. On one occasion, on November 21, 1970, Becton came over to employees Cassel-man, Broeringmeyer, Davidson and Schmoe and stated, \u201cI know how Ray [Casselman] and Ernie [Schmoe] feel about the union, I want to know how you other two feel.\u201d Broeringmeyer and Davidson \u201csort of grinned\u201d and did not respond, whereupon Becton walked away. On the second occasion a couple of weeks later, Becton asked employee McCormick if he knew an applicant for employment named Schultz and, receiving an affirmative reply, he asked what kind of a fellow he was, whether he worked hard, how he felt about the Union and whether he could be persuaded to \u201cswing\u201d their way. To the last two questions, McCormick responded that he didn\u2019t know. On the third occasion, occurring about the same time, at the outset of a conversation with employee Charlene Ricketts in which Becton pointed out the benefits the Company had conferred on its employees, Becton asked her what she \u201cfelt about this whole thing\u201d and whether given a second chance she didn\u2019t think the Company could \u201csolve these problems without an outsider.\u201d Miss Ricketts acknowledged the Company\u2019s good treatment in the past but told Becton she saw advantages in a third party. The conversation closed with Becton querying whether he could count her \u201con our side,\u201d Miss Ricketts telling him she did not wish to reveal her feelings, and Becton\u2019s expression of hope that he could count on her. In regard to the incidents of unlawful solicitation, between December 4 and 11, 1970, the Board found that Becton six times urged employee Jack Stevenson to change his mind about the Union and if he did, to talk with other employees in the plant and try to persuade them to change their minds. Stevenson testified to his reaction: \u201cI told him I would think it over, but, of course, you see, that went on a while. I would stop for a while and get him off my back. Later on I got disgusted and I told him I was for the union and that was it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">Finally, the Board found that Superintendent Stigers twice made an unlawful interrogation and once illegally threatened worsened working conditions. On or about November 14, 1970, Stigers came over to employee Ferchow\u2019s work station and after some preliminaries asked him what his attitude was towards the Union coming in to Peerless. Ferchow responded he was in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number><em>it;1 </em>and Stigers related several stories about unions\u2019 causing trouble in other plants and expressed his opinion that he th\u2019ought a union at Peerless would also d\u00e1us'e trouble, more than it was really 'worth. The second unlawful interrogation and the threat were found to have occurred when Stigers asked employee Dorothy Stevenson, in the presence of employee Musser, how she felt about the Union, and, when she told him she thought the employees needed a union, said \u201c[a] union don\u2019t do anything but take your dues\u201d and \u201c[i]f the union does get in, they will really crack down 'oh you.\u201d In the context of the conversation \u201cthey\u201d apparently meant the Company, for Miss Stevenson retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t know too much they can do except lay us off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">. The foregoing summary of the Section 8(a)(1) violations found by the Board reflects the events according to the Trial Examiner\u2019s credibility findings. In .many instances the supervisors involved denied or had different versions of the events, but substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports the, findings of fact. Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340. U.S. 474, 488, 489, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Whether the unfair labor practice findings predicated on these facts have a reasonable basis in law is a different and closer question. Viewed as discrete occurrences, each of these incidents is marginal at best and taken singly probably would not amount to a violation of Section 8(a)(1).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But althpugh the Board treated the incidents individually, it seems clear that its assessment was influenced by the continuing and repeated nature of the supervisors\u2019 prying queries and needless remarks and by the entire course of conduct revealed thereby. The Board could reasonably infer an intentional campaign subtly to induce a fear of reprisal for supporting or expectation of benefit for rejecting the Union. The supervisors\u2019 intention alone, of course, will not turn their interrogations and remarks into restraint or coercion unless their words in the circumstances in which they were uttered would reasonably induce such a fear of reprisal or expectation of reward. But on this score, the statement of Judge Learned Hand is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6j\">\u201cWords are not pebbles in alien juxtaposition; they have only a communal existence; and not only does the meaning of each interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their purport from the setting in which they are used. * * * \u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Feder-bush Co., 121 F.2d 954, 957 (2d Cir. 1941).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-11\">The setting in which the interrogations, purported threats and promise of benefits and solicitations were made includes the context of their repetition and continuation. Employees Dorothy Stevenson and Ferehow were found to be the subject of two violations, each perpetrated at the hands of different supervisors, and employee Jack Stevenson was six times solicited to abandon the Union and, if he did, persuade other employees to do likewise. And it could reasonably be expected that in view of the small size of the work force, the other employees found to have been restrained or coerced were aware of the supervisors\u2019 efforts directed at others. A continuous course of conduct may be a circumstance coloring employee perception of individual instances of seemingly innocuous conduct. National Labor Relations Board v. Kaiser Agricultural Chemicals, 473 F.2d 374, 381 (5th Cir. 1973); see National Labor Relations Board v. Kropp Forge Co., 178 F.2d 822, 828 (7th Cir. 1949). It should also be noted that in none of the encounters where unfair labor practices were found did the supervisors say anything to assure the employees involved that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>Company would respect their sentiment and not stoop to the level of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\"> It is true that the record contains no hint whatever that the employees involved were actually restrained or coerced. In fact, quite the contrary, for one cannot help but come away from the record with a strong sense that the employees involved in the incidents in question were resolute and unintimidated by the supervisors\u2019 queries, statements and solicitations. The foregoing summary of the incidents so indicates by the candid and uninhibited employee repartee. But while the indicated ineffectiveness of the supervisors\u2019 activities is pertinent to the propriety of a bargaining order and has some bearing on how the supervisors\u2019 words may reasonably be taken, it will not vitiate a Section 8(a)(1) finding if the conduct itself, viewed in context, may reasonably induce fear of reprisal or anticipation of reward. In sum, we find this a close question but think there is enough play in the joints to affirm the Board\u2019s conclusions as having a reasonable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">\n<em>The Bargaining Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">Initially we think it would serve no purpose in this case to analyze separately whether the Company violated Section 8(a)(5) and whether the bargaining order was properly issued. Analysis of the latter question under the framework of National Labor Relations Board v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547, covers all the essential ground. Because this is hardly one of those \u201c \u2018exceptional\u2019 cases marked by \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018pervasive\u2019 unfair labor practices,\u201d where a bargaining order could issue \u201cin the absence of a \u00a7 8(a)(5) violation\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 613-614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940), the authority to issue a bargaining order depends upon whether the Union had a valid card majority and whether the Company engaged in \u201cless pervasive practices which nonetheless still have the tendency to undermine majority strength and impede the election processes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. Since the Company was entitled to reject the Union\u2019s recognition demand regardless of its subjective motivation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> whether or not the Company violated Section 8(a)(5) likewise depends upon whether the Union had a valid card majority when it made its demand and upon whether the Company engaged in \u201c \u2018contemporaneous unfair labor practices likely to destroy the union\u2019s majority status and seriously impede the election.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 591, 603, 600, 89 S.Ct. at 1933. Thus it seems that in this case the determination of whether a Section 8(a)(5) violation has been committed involves the same inquiry as whether a bargaining order can properly issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-11\">In view of the basic rationale of <em>Gis-sel, </em>there is nothing logically inconsist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>ent here in treating the \u201cremedy\u201d analysis of whether a bargaining order should issue as dispositive of whether a Section 8(a)(5) violation has been committed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Contrary to the usual Section 8(a)(5) violations predicated simply on the employer\u2019s refusal to bargain with an elected or conceded representative or to do so in good faith, here the Section 8(a)(5) violation is not <em>per se </em>established by a refusal to accede to a card majority and' has nothing to do with the employer\u2019s subjective motivation for that refusal. Rather, it depends upon the effect of employer misconduct upon the preferred election processes, and should take into account possible divergence between union and employee interests, exactly the considerations involved in \u201cfashioning a remedy\u201d of a bargaining order. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 614; National Labor Relations Board v. Drives, Inc., 440 F.2d 354, 364-366 (7th Cir. 1971). Consequently, we shall directly address the question of whether the bargaining order is supportable under the <em>Gissel </em>criteria.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">The Company argues that the Union did not have a valid card majority as of the properly determinative date. First, it contends that January 14, 1971, the date of the scheduled Board election, rather than the date the Union sought recognition, is the appropriate date for determining the Union\u2019s majority status. As of January 14, by reason of the extensive but untainted December 18 permanent layoff and normal attrition, the unit which on the recognitional demand date held 39 employees was reduced to probably 16 employees.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But even as of January 14, the Company concedes that 9 of the 16 employees had executed Union authorization cards. The Company argues for the January 14 date, apparently thinking it has a better chance of invalidating enough of these cards on the basis of defective solicitation to destroy the Union\u2019s slim majority then than it has of destroying its more substantial, 24 out of 39 majority on the date the Union sought recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">Since we conclude the Company has no valid objections to the manner in which any of the cards were solicited, it is really unnecessary for the purpose of determining whether the Union had a valid card majority to decide between the October 2, 1970, and January 14, 1971, dates. Nevertheless, even if the Union had lost a valid card majority as of the later date and even though the loss was not attributable to any unfair labor practices, the later date would not be the determinative one. That is not to say that differences in the employee complement should not be considered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>the Board in deciding whether to issue a bargaining order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court made quite explicit in <em>Gissel </em>that where, as here, the Board seeks to impose a bargaining order on the basis of less than \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d unfair labor practices, the Board need only show \u201cthat at one point the union had a majority.\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S. Ct. at 1940. If the Union had a valid card majority status on the date it sought recognition, it satisfied this <em>Gis-sel </em>criterion, and it was not incumbent on the Board to show the Union retained that status at the time the election was scheduled. National Labor Relations Board v. Dixisteel Buildings, Inc., 445 F.2d 1260, 1265 (8th Cir. 1971). The Company\u2019s only supposedly supporting authority, Central Soya of Canton, Inc., 180 NLRB 546, 547 (1970), does not stand for the Company\u2019s proposition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Second, the Company argues that Union misrepresentations in soliciting the authorization cards rendered the Union\u2019s claimed majority status invalid. The cards involved here were single-purpose cards stating clearly and unambiguously on their face that the signer was designating the Union to represent him in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Gissel, supra, </em>the Supreme Court approved the Board\u2019s so-called Cumberland Shoe (144 NLRB 1268 (1963)) rule relating to such cards whereby \u201cif the card itself is unambiguous <em>(i. e., </em>states on its face that the signer authorizes the Union to represent the employee for collective bargaining purposes and not to seek an election), it will be counted unless it is proved that the employee was told that the card was to be used <em>solely </em>for the purpose of obtaining an election.\u201d 395 U.S. at 584, 606, 89 S.Ct. at 1925. Ohr review of the record discloses, in consonance with the Board\u2019s finding, that the Company did not carry its burden of proof. What the solicitors told the employees was in substance identical to those representations which the Supreme Court specifically found to be within (albeit at the limits of) the <em>Cumberland </em>rule\u2019s application. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 584-585 n. 5. According to the relied-on testimony of those who signed the challenged cards, they were told one or more of the following: that the cards were to be used to petition for an election; that the cards would be used to show interest in the Union and get a Union representative to come to talk about the Union; that a vote would come later. These rep- - resentations do not suffice to \u201cdeliberately and clearly cancel\u201d the language of the cards. <em>Id. </em>and 606; Texaco v.

But once again the Board has failed to give a satisfactory explanation of its decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Instead it has a proffered a list summarizing in general terms the employer\u2019s Section 8(a)(1) violations, as if any interrogations, threats, promise of benefit and solicitations of whatever intensity, whenever, however, and in whatever context made were the equivalent of all others imaginable. See National Labor Relations Board v.

National Labor Relations Board v. General Stencils, Inc., 438 F.2d 894, 902 (2d Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Furthermore, the Board also failed to attempt to reconcile the bargaining order in this ease with prior decisions in which no bargaining order was issued despite what certainly seem to have been equally serious if not far more serious threats to the election process.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Absent any self-evident basis for differentiation, we cannot responsibly guard-' against administrative arbitrariness unless the Board explains in what respects this case differs from the others.

We are mindful of the Supreme Courts admonition that \u201cit is for the Board and not the courts, however, to make [the bargaining order] determination, based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 612 n. 32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939.

General Stencils, Inc., <em>supra, </em>438 F.2d at 904. We conclude on analysis of the simple facts involved that we would be abdicating our judicial function and shirking our responsibilities if we ever enforced a bargaining order in this case. Consequently, in our desire to avoid needless and futile delay, we shall make the essential analysis and deny enforcement. National Labor Relations Board v.

That is, the reasonable capability of the interrogations, threats, promise of benefits and solicitations to induce a fear of reprisal or expectation of benefits was a very close question, resolved in favor of the Board only deferentially by viewing the incidents as parts of a course of conduct.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But because they might reasonably be thought to induce such fear or expectation hardly means the employees involved were actually coerced or that their voting sentiments would be affected. Were it otherwise the Supreme Court would not have required an inquiry into the effect of second category unfair labor practices on the election process<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor posited \u201ca third category of minor or less extensive unfair labor practices, which, because of their minimal impact on the election machinery, will not sustain a bargaining order.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra </em>395 U.S. at 615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. What may reasonably be thought capable of dampening the exercise of Section 7 rights may be far short of what it takes to change an employee\u2019s mind about the need for a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">It is difficult to comprehend how the sturdy and sophisticated American working man would be brought to the point of abandoning his pro-union voting intention by incidents like these. Employee reaction to the supervisors\u2019 queries and remarks affirmatively indicates that the employees involved in the incidents were actually undaunted by them. Typically, employee reaction to the supervisors\u2019 casual queries and threats was candid and uninhibited, as the earlier summary of the incidents shows. What clearly emerges is a picture of employees with enough hardiness and confidence in their Union and their rights as not to be cowed by these marginal indiscretions. See National Labor Relations Board v. General Stencils, Inc., 472 F.2d 170, 173 (2d Cir. 1972) and 438 F.2d 894, 903 (2d Cir. 1971). Indeed, the supervisors\u2019 efforts, at least in the ease of employee Jack Stevenson, were counterproductive. Cf. Getman and Goldberg, <em>supra </em>n. 19, at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">Moreover, the Union campaign continued at full tilt. Employees continued to hold meetings in the presence of supervisors on the plant premises. They spoke openly with the supervisors, including the Company\u2019s president and plant manager, about their Union allegiance and continued to make Union posters and paraphernalia at their work stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>With any immediate impact as dubious as it is here, it is unreasonable to expect a continuing effect which would preclude a fair election. Quite the contrary, for here not only is there no hint of any later misconduct which might reinforce earlier violations but the Company did make an affirmative effort to dissipate any possible employee apprehension. See National Labor Relations Board v. Drives, Inc., <em>supra, </em>440 F.2d at 362-363, 367. Shortly after the Union filed its amended charge, Company president O\u2019Connor came to the Effingham plant and addressed the employees. He told them that if any of the alleged wrongful conduct had occurred, although he did not think any had, it was against his express <em>instructions</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and would not recur, and he assured them that the Company respected and would not interfere with their decision on Union representation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although O\u2019Connor surely interjected his preference was not to have a union, this he had a right to do, and his words were hardly those of a corporate president contemplating a shutdown if the Union was adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">As far as the likelihood of recurrence of the misconduct is concerned, there is nothing on which reasonably to predict such an eventuality. The record shows no history of anti-Union animus. In addition to the O\u2019Connor speech, the Company offered \u201cto discuss with [the Board] any other action which [it] might believe necessary to assure the holding of a fair election, such as Union use of Company bulletin boards, a speech by Union representatives during working hours or any similar steps which [it] might deem appropriate.\u201d Aside from a predisposition to distrust, we see no reason to dismiss this as subterfuge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">The entry of the Section 8(a)(1) cease and desist order and notice we are sanctioning will itself be of considerable significance in connection with a possible fair election for two reasons. First, the order will provide added protection against the likelihood of the recurrence of misconduct, and second, the posting of the order finding the Company guilty of unfair labor practices will almost certainly have a favorable impact on the Union\u2019s chances for success in the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">Finally, we take note of the substantial reduction of the plant\u2019s work force. While there was no substantial employee turnover, nevertheless a marked decrease in the number of bargaining unit employees deserves some consideration, not only because the division of sentiment among the remaining employees may be different, but also because employees may view the benefits of unionization in a far different light when the economic plight of their employer has substantially diminished their ranks. To be sure the changed composition of a work force unrelated to any employer misconduct is not a fatal objection to the entry of a bargaining order (Franks Brothers Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 702, 703-705, 64 S.Ct. 817, 88 L.Ed. 1020; National Labor Relations Board v. Drives, Inc., 440 F.2d 354, 366 (7th Cir. 1971)), but it is equally true that \u201ceffectuating ascertainable employee free choice becomes as important a 'goal as deterring employer misbehavior.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra </em>395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940. Since it is the present work force that stands to be deprived of exercising its free choice in the preferred election process, the fact that it is substantially different from the one which existed at the time of the misconduct militates against issuance of a bargaining order where, as here, that drastic remedy is not otherwise clearly warranted. Here it simply reinforces our conclusions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>a bargaining order is clearly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">In summary, we do not think reasonable minds could help but conclude that on analysis the unusual remedy of a bargaining order is a wholly unnecessary encroachment on employee free choice in this case and that the concededly superi- or election process should take its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">In view of the foregoing, we deny enforcement of paragraphs 1(b), 1(f), and 2(a) of the Board\u2019s order and direct that the notice specified in paragraph 2(b) be modified accordingly. In all other respects the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1163-21\">.

The first three allegedly unfair labor practices must be disregarded because they involved Vicky Steele whom we hold to be a <em>supervisor </em>unprotected by the Act (see <em>infra). </em>By the systematic polling of Union sentiment, we understand the Board to have referred to the violation found to inhere in Plant Manager Krit-zer\u2019s meeting with four supervisors in the presence of his secretary, Vicky Steele, considered by the Board as an employee, wherein lie asked the supervisors to record the employees\u2019 probable Union sympathy against a check list.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">. For the purpose of counting the number of employees in the bargaining unit and in order to upset the Board\u2019s conclusion that Embry\u2019s unlawful interrogations, threats, and promise of improved benefits and working conditions should be charged against it, the Company disputes the Board\u2019s conclusion that Hardiek and Em-bry were supervisors. (Of course the Company must know that acceptance of its contention would make Kritzer\u2019s conversation with them and with Embry alone vulnerable to unfair labor practice findings on the basis of their employee status.) However, there was ample evidence for the Board to conclude that Hardiek and Embry satisfied one or more of the criteria for supervisory status as defined in Section 2(11) of the Act. See National Labor Relations Board v. Brown Specialty Co., 436 F.2d 372, 374-375 (7th Cir. 1970). In addition to evidence that they had authority within their respective departments to move employees to different jobs, to apportion work among employees, to direct them in the performance of their work and that they were in sole charge of their respective departments for substantial periods of time, the record shows they possessed many indicia of supervisory status, such as payment by salary rather than hourly wage, payment for illness ab-. sences, no payment for overtime, attendance at management meetings, and acceptance as supervisors by Company executives as well as by the rank and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>file.

Two exceptions are \u201chowever, (1) that an employer could not refuse to bargain if he <em>lenew, </em>through a personal poll for instance, that a majority of his employees supported the union, and (2) that an employer could not refuse recognition initially because of questions as to the appropriateness of the unit and then later claim, as an afterthought, that he doubted the union\u2019s strength.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v.

Arguably, in order to make out a Section 8(a)(5) violation a union would have to show that it had a card majority at the time it demanded recognition whereas a bargaining order could issue if the union, although it did not have a majority at the demand date, acquired one thereafter. See <em>Gissel, supra </em>at 614 and the discussion in text <em>infra. </em>Assuming this is a correct interpretation of <em>Gissel, </em>the distinction may have no practical difference, however, because the Board typically treats the Union\u2019s recognitional demand as \u201ccontinuing.\u201d See National Labor Relations Board v.

The figure 16 counts Austin as well as Hardiek, who by January 14 apparently ceased to have a supervisory status since there were no longer any employees in his department. It does not include Embry whom we have found to have been properly determined a supervisor and whose status was in no way shown to have been changed. By way of caveat we note that no Board determination of the bargaining unit complement on January 14 was made since the Board used the date the Union sought recognition as the critical date, and we suggest the figure 16 only as the maximum probable complement based on the testimony in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">.

Insofar as they can be discerned, it is beginning to appear that many of the Board\u2019s expert assumptions about the impact of employer misconduct on employee voting behavior are invalid. See Getman and Goldberg, The Myth of Labor Board Expertise, 39 U.Chi.L.Rev. 681 (1972). Nevertheless, until they are conclusively invalidated, we must accept plausible assumptions in this area, but require their articulation and particularized application to the facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-13\">We recognize that the determination of the immediate and residual impact of unfair labor practices may be a difficult task. <em>Id. </em>at 686-688.

We mean only that it estimate the impact, taking into account the factors in the particular case which are indicative of actual effect or which plausibly, in the light of existing knowledge, would contribute to or detract from an actual impact. This is, after all, what the courts which have made their own analyses have done. Similarly the \u201cdetailed analysis\u201d of the likelihood of recurring misconduct and of the potential curative effect of ordinary remedies only requires an appraisal of those factors which might reasonably have a bearing, such as whether the employer has a history of anti-\u00fanion animus and Labor Act violations, whether the employer has taken affirmative rectifying measures or otherwise indicated his cooperativeness in assuring a fair election, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1172-16\">.

Also if the union lost there was only a 1% possibility that trouble-makers (union organizers) would leave the company.
