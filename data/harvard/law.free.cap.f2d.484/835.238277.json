His contention that Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), imposes a constitutional bar to criminal conviction of an addict for possession of narcotics for his own use is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in United States v.

C. \u2014, 486 F.2d 1139 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">On October 24, 1969 appellant was sentenced to five years on count one (\u00a7 4704(a)) and ten years on count two (\u00a7 174), the mandatory minimum. The sentences were to run concurrently. At the sentencing proceeding the trial judge indicated his belief that Appellant was likely to be benefited by treatment. Sentencing Transcript at 4-6. The judge, however, did not commit appellant under the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 (NARA), apparently because he felt bound by the contrary recommendation made by the pertinent institution following an examination under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252. Sentencing Transcript at 4-5. But 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4253(a) makes NARA commitment mandatory after a finding by the sentencing judge that treatment will be beneficial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-16\">Following the examination provided for in section 4252, if the <em>court </em>determines that an eligible offender is an addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, it shall commit him to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment under this chapter, except that no offender shall be committed under this chapter if the Attorney General certifies that ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>quate facilities or personnel for treatment are unavailable. . . . 18 U.
