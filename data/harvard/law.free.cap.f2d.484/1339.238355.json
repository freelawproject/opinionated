After a witness came forward and told what she saw, the Company asked me to forget it and told me that the guard would be stationed somewhere where I would not see him. I was told that if anything else happens, I will be transferred from my department, after being there for one year. I do not want to transfer departments, but I am afraid that if I don\u2019t accept, I may be fired. I work in a department consisting of approximately 25 whites where I am the only black, and I do the hardest job in the department. Everyone in there has at least 10 years of experience. I have 3 years with the Company, and I have the highest production rate in the department. Also, I believe the company maintains segregated seniority lines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-9\">In accordance with Section 706(b) of Title VII (42 U.S.C. 2000e \u2014 5(b)), requiring charging parties to exhaust their remedies before state fair employment practices commissions, EEOC deferred the two charges until receiving notification on February 26, 1970, that Lillian Taggart\u2019s charge, and on March 30, 1970, that Christine Shannon\u2019s charge had been dismissed by the Illinois Fair Employment Practices Commission. The charges were considered filed with EEOC upon termination of state proceedings and upon receipt by EEOC of notification thereof pursuant to Section 1601.12(b) (IV) of EEOC Procedural Regulations (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.12b(4) (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">On September 29, 1970, an investigator from EEOC\u2019s Chicago office attempted to serve both charges on the petitioner, whose representatives on advice of counsel refused to receive service and refused to produce requested documents and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">On May 5, 1971, EEOC served petitioner with a Demand for Access to Evidence in both cases. On May 17, petitioner filed two separate actions in the district court pursuant to Section 710(c) of Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 9(c)) praying for modification of the demand as to certain of its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">On June 14, 1972, the district court, upon appeal from a magistrate who heard arguments by counsel for petitioner and EEOC, ordered in the Taggart case that the petitioner need not comply with the Demand and neither produce nor grant access to:</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-14\">1. The most recent E.E.O.-l form regarding the makeup of the work force in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>the plant located at 9401 West Grand Avenue, Franklin Park, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">2.

Home address and telephone number of Richard Brennan, if such person is employed by Motorola, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">6. A tour of the plant facilities located at 4545 West Augusta Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-14\">In the Shannon case, the district court ordered on June 14, 1972, that the petitioner need not comply with the Demand and neither produce nor grant access to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-15\">\u25a0 List of all incumbent employees hourly and salaried, designating race, sex, present labor grade, present job classification, present department, job code (or other applicable code), and all seniority dates for whatever purpose used by the company. If seniority is by job classification or department, such list shall be prepared by seniority date. If no such seniority date is maintained such list shall be furnished alphabetically by name of employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-16\">EEOC has appealed both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-18\">Section 709(a) of Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 8(a)) provides that \u201cthe Commission or its designated representative shall at all reasonable times have access to . \u25a0 . . and the right to copy <em>any evidence </em>of any person being investigated or proceeded against <em>that relates to </em>unlawful employment practices . <em>and is relevant to </em>the charge under investigation.\u201d At the time the charges were filed, Section 710(a) provided that \u201cthe Commission shall have authority to examine witnesses under oath and to require the production of documentary <em>evidence relevant or material to </em>the charge under investigation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 9(a) (1971) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-20\">In General Employment Enterprises, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 440 F.2d 783, 784 (7th Cir. 1971), we enforced the EEOC\u2019s Demand for Access to Evidence under Sections 709(a) and 710(a) as \u201cconsistent with the broad remedial purposes of the Act which could only be thwarted by sustaining technical defenses of alleged violators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-21\">Most of the courts which have considered the scope of the investigatory powers of EEOC have agreed that they are broad. Blue Bell Boots, Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 418 F.2d 355, 358 (6th Cir. 1969) (\u201cTitle VII . . . should not be construed narrowly . . .\u201d); Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., 433 F.2d 421, 425 (8th Cir. 1970) (\u201cTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is to be accorded a liberal construction in order to carry out the purpose of Congress to eliminate the inconvenience, unfairness and humiliation of racial discrimination\u201d). One district court which sought to find that \u201cCongress intended to deny the Commission the broad investigatory powers of other federal agencies .\u201d was expressly reversed by the Court of Appeals. Graniteville Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 316 F.Supp. 1177, 1185 (D.S. Car.1969), rev\u2019d, 438 F.2d 32, 39 (4th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-24\">The only voice arguing for a presumed narrower grant of authority is Georgia Power Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 412 F.2d 462, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>467-468 (5th Cir. 1969) and that view was based primarily on Senator Dirk-sen\u2019s question during debate in 1964: \u201cWhat protection is afforded to an employer from fishing expeditions by investigators, in their zeal to enforce Title VII?\u201d 2 Statutory History of the United States: Civil Rights 1176 (B. Schwartz ed. 1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201cfishing expedition\u201d language has been repeated occasionally (Parliament House Motor Hotel v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 444 F.2d 1335, 1339 (5th Cir. 1971)) and has been echoed by the petitioner in the present appeals. Brief for Appellee at 7, No. 72-1748.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">When the Supreme Court was considering Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1), which reads in part that discovery may be obtained \u201cregarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action,\u201d it said in Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-6\">\u201cWe agree, of course, that the deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment. No longer can the time-honored cry of \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 serve to preclude a party from inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent\u2019s case.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">In finding that Congress intended a broad interpretation of Sections 709(a) and 710(a), Judge Sobeloff in Granite-ville Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 438 F.2d at 39, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-8\">\u201cOur reading of legislative history . suggests . . . that the investigatory powers of the EEOC were intended to equal in scope those granted the National Labor Relations Board under the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>161.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-13\">In National Labor Relations Board v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. 759, 768, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 1431, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969), the Supreme Court, in upholding the power of the Board to require an employer to furnish a list of names and addresses of employees eligible to vote in a representation election as within the scope of Section 11 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the investigatory power extended to \u201cbooks and records and other papers which will be of assistance to the Board in conducting a particular investigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-14\">Judge Sobeloff proved to be prophetic when he equated Sections 709(a) and 710(a) with 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161 since Congress, in passing the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 which became effective on March 24, 1972, amended Section 710 to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-15\">\u201cFor the purpose of all hearings and investigations conducted by the Commission or its duly authorized agents or agencies, section 161 of Title 29 shall apply.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 9 (Supp.Pamphlet, 1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-16\">Although Congress was not entirely clear as to whether amended Section 710 was to apply to prior filed but pending charges,2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as those here, this is not significant inasmuch as Congress was clear that the change in that section was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>\u201ccomparable\u201d to the section prior to amendment (U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2164 (1972)) and we agree with Judge Sobeloff that the original language was \u201cequal in scope\u201d to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">If there was any doubt as to the Congressional intention that the original language of Title VII be construed and applied broadly, it was dissipated by the unequivocal intention expressed in the passing of the 1972 amendments to that title.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">House Report No. 92-238 (92d Cong., 2d Sess. 1972; reprinted in U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2141, 2143-44 (1972)) noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-7\">\u201cThe time has come to bring an end to job discrimination once and for all, and to insure every citizen the opportunity for the decent self-respect that accompanies a job commensurate with one\u2019s abilities. The hopeful prospects that Title VII offered millions of Americans in 1964 must be revived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-8\">-* * * * * -&gt;:\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-9\">\u201cDuring the preparation and presentation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employment discrimination tended to be viewed as a series of isolated and distinguishable events, due, for the most part, to ill-will on the part of some identifiable individual or organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-10\">\u2022X- * * -X- * -X*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-11\">\u201cEmployment discrimination, as we know today, is a far more complex and pervasive phenomenon. Experts familiar with the subject generally describe the problem in terms of \u2018systems\u2019 and \u2018effects\u2019 rather than simply intentional wrongs. The literature on the subject is replete with discussions of the mechanics of seniority and lines of progression, perpetuation of the present effects of earlier discriminatory practices through various institutional devices, and testing and validation requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-12\">-X- *X- * *X* -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-13\">\u201cIt is increasingly obvious that the entire area of employment discrimination is one whose resolution requires not only expert assistance, but also the technical perception that a problem exists in the first place, and that the system complained of is unlawful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">The Supreme Court has also shed additional light on Title VII in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1823, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), where Mr. Justice Powell said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-15\">\u201cThe language of Title VII makes plain the purpose of Congress to assure equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate those discriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially stratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority citizens. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1398-16\">\u201cThere are societal as well as personal interests on both sides of this equation. The broad, overriding interest, shared by employer, employee, and consumer, is efficient and trustworthy workmanship assured through fair and racially neutral employment and personnel decisions. In the implementation of such decisions, it is abundantly clear that Title VII tolerates no racial discrimination, subtle or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1398-17\">The Court held that a complainant establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination by showing (1) that he belongs to a racial minority, (2) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants, (3) that despite his qualifications, he was rejected, and (4) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications. The burden then shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the complainant\u2019s rejection. Obviously this will always be forthcoming, if on no other basis, for the non-racial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>reason that complainant lacked the necessary qualifications for the position. This results in a shift of the burden back to the complainant, who must be afforded a fair opportunity to show that [the employer\u2019s] stated reason for . . . [the employee\u2019s] rejection was in fact pretext. 411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. at 1825. Mr. Justice Powell then detailed the manner in which the complainant must be given an opportunity to establish pretextuality ' (411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1825-1826) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-6\">\u201cOther evidence that may be relevant to any showing of pretextuality includes facts as to the petitioner\u2019s treatment of respondent during his prior term of employment, petitioner\u2019s reaction, if any, to respondent\u2019s legitimate civil rights activities, and petitioner\u2019s general policy and practice with respect to minority employment. On the latter point, statistics as to petitioner\u2019s employment policy and practice may be helpful to a determination of whether petitioner\u2019s refusal to rehire respondent in this case conformed to a general pattern of discrimination against blacks. ... In short, on the retrial respondent must be given a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate by competent evidence that the presumptively valid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">In the Taggart case (No. 72-1748), the complainant established a prima facie case of racial discrimination by her charge and affidavit. The petitioner has not admitted racial discrimination and it can be presumed that it will proffer a non-racial reason for failing to promote complainant. Inasmuch as evidence is admissible to establish pretextuality, the investigatory powers of EEOC to determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe a violation of Title VII has occurred, obviously extend at least as far. As Chief Judge Swy-gert held in construing Section 11 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161) in N.L.R.B. v. Rohlen, 385 F.2d 52, 57 (7th Cir. 1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-10\">\u201cThus, if the material subpoenaed touches a matter under investigation, it is within the scope of section 11(2) even though the material may not be considered \u2018evidence\u2019 as the term is employed in the courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\"><em>Accord, </em>N.L.R.B. v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. at 768-769, 89 S.Ct. at 1430-1431.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">The pretextuality issue encompasses the employer\u2019s \u201cgeneral employment policy and practice,\u201d a search for \u201ca general pattern of discrimination against blacks,\u201d and a determination of whether \u201cvalid reasons for his rejection were in fact a coverup for a racially discriminatory decision.\u201d Congress has alerted EEOC to look for \u201csystems\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">In the Shannon case (No. 72-1749), the complainant\u2019s charge also sets forth a prima facie ease of racial discrimination, which will require investigation of the pretextuality issue. The complainant further charges that she believes \u201cthe company maintains segregated seniority lines.\u201d The Taggart charge referred to a test requirement that was not applied to white employees. Both complainants filed their charges in early 1970, long before Congress warned that \u201c[t]he literature on the subject is replete with discussions of the mechanics of seniority and lines of progression, perpetuation of the present effects of earlier discriminatory practices through various institutional devices, and testing and validation requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1399-14\">In view of the board investigatory powers intended to be given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>EEOC, all of the items to which the district court denied it access were properly sought under Section 709(a) and 710(a) of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">In the Taggart matter, all records relating to that charge, the personnel records for the employees specifically named in that charge, and the address and telephone numbers of two other employees expressly named in the charge, are so clearly required to be made available that the employer\u2019s refusal was not only \u201ctechnical\u201d but close to frivolous. The other two items sought \u2014 the EEOC form regarding the make-up of the work force in petitioner\u2019s plant in Franklin Park (a Chicago suburb) and a tour of the Chicago plant \u2014 both fall well within EEOC\u2019s responsibilities and powers. A plant tour may be extremely significant and relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">The only item sought in the Shannon matter \u2014 a list of all employees with information relating to seniority \u2014 is also well within'EEOC\u2019s powers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-6\">There is nothing unique about a requirement to compile and furnish lists, names, addresses and telephone numbers. N.L.R.B. v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 394 U.S. at 767-775, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709; Local No. 104 v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 439 F.2d 237, 243 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">A single charge may \u201claunch a full scale inquiry.\u201d Jenkins v.
