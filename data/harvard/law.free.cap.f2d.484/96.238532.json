On May 19, 1971, they were temporarily suspended from office by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania acting upon the recommendation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The apparent cause for the temporary suspensions was an alleged violation by appellants of Rule 2, subd. A of The Rules of Conduct, Office Standards and Civil Procedure for Justices of the Peace, which prohibits justices of the peace from, <em>inter alia, </em>being employed by the Commonwealth or a political subdivision or holding office in a political party or political organization.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">On June 1, 1971, appellants, together, with the Squires and Constables Association of Pennsylvania and other suspended justices of the peace, petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to revoke the suspension orders of May 19, 1971. This petition was denied by order of court dated July 14, 1971. Later, on August 23, 1971, the same group applied to Justice Brennan of the United States Supreme Court for a stay of the May 19th suspension orders pend-, ing the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Justice Brennan denied the application for a stay on September 19, 1971, and no petition for a writ of certiorari was ever filed seeking appellate review of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s May 19th orders and its refusal to revoke its suspension orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">Instead, appellants commenced this original action in the district court on December 30, 1971, alleging that their suspensions were effected without notice and without a hearing in violation of both the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cRules of Procedure Governing the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board\u201d and the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They urged the district court (1) to enjoin enforcement of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s suspension order, and (2) to enjoin the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board from conducting hearings and making further recommendations to the Pennsylvania <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Supreme Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In an opinion and order dated June 16, 1972, the district court, based on \u201cabstention\u201d principles, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the suit. 349 F.Supp. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Although we affirm the judgment of the district court, we do so on a ground other than that relied upon by the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">It is clear from a recitation of the facts of this case that the appellants have sought, through the vehicle of a section 1983 suit for injunctive relief, to have a lower federal court engage in what essentially constitutes relitigation of issues already decided by Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court. Having failed to pursue the only available course for federal review of the state court\u2019s determination \u2014 a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014 the appellants are now barred by the principles of <em>res judicata </em>from obtaining such review in the lower federal courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Guided by the decision in Angel v. Bullington, 330 U.S. 183, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947), the federal courts have held that litigants may not seek to have redetermined, by original actions in federal district courts, issues already settled in a prior state-court adjudication.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Illustrative of the prevailing view, and similar to the present case, is Coogan v. Cincinnati Bar Assoc.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Coogan, an attorney, was indefinitely suspended as a result of a recommendation of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline and the Cincinnati Bar Association. The Supreme Court of Ohio approved the findings and recommendations of the Board, and issued the suspension order. Coogan failed to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court for review of the Ohio court\u2019s action. Instead, he brought an original action under the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in the federal district court, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the suspension. He claimed that his suspension contravened certain constitutional guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">The district court dismissed the action and the Sixth Circuit affirmed. In so doing, it offered a succinct statement of the relevant principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">\u201cCoogan had an adequate remedy for review of his suspension by petitioning the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari. He chose not to resort to that remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">\u201cThe Civil Rights Act was not designed to be used as a substitute for the right of appeal, or to collaterally attack a final judgment of the highest court of a state and relitigate the issues which it decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-19\">\u201cThe final judgment of the Supreme Court is conclusive and Coogan is precluded by the doctrine of res ju-dicata from relitigating not only the issues which were actually involved in the disbarment proceeding, but also the issues which he might have presented.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">As noted above, on June 1, 1971, appellants petitioned the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to revoke the suspension orders of May 19, 1971. In addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>contentions based upon state law, the petition contains specific arguments that the suspension order violated the appellants\u2019 <em>federal </em>constitutional rights. In denying the petition, Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court necessarily rendered a decision rejecting on the merits the very federal claims asserted by appellants in their complaint filed in the district court. Having been content to forego the prescribed avenue for securing federal review \u2014 application for a writ of certiorari \u2014 the appellants are now barred from bringing what is, effectively, a collateral attack upon the state court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action ' must be affirmed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">The district court based its decision on \u201cabstention\u201d principles. There are several legal doctrines that have, at times, been employed under the \u201cabstention\u201d rubric.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the classical abstention principle, or Pullman doctrine,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the equitable concepts embodied in the <em>Younger </em>rule<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> address different, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>though similar, concerns. Whichever abstention doctrine is applicable, however, its invocation serves as an impediment to a decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In the present case, the district' court stated that \u201cplaintiffs have not suffered or are likely to suffer irreparable injury.\u201d As indicated earlier,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> a hearing before the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board has been scheduled. To the extent that this hearing may be considered a continuing proceeding, the philosophy underlying <em>Younger </em>would counsel that the federal court stay its hand. <em>01 </em>course, if there were no continuing procedure,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the doctrine of <em>Younger </em>has no application.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Moreover, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania having already construed the statute in question, <em>Pullman </em>abstention would not be apposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Our attention has been invited to England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> which provides an interesting comparison with the present case. In approaching <em>England, </em>it must be noted that the plaintiffs here chose to bring their action originally in state court. And, although <em>England </em>lends philosophical support to the result reached by us here, it embodies somewhat different legal issues and rests upon somewhat different doctrinal underpinnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">In <em>England, </em>a group of chiropractors brought suit in the first instance in the federal court, seeking an injunction and a declaration that, as applied to them, the Louisiana Medical Practice Act violated the fourteenth amendment. The district court invoked the doctrine of abstention, as set forth in <em>Pullman, supra, </em>on the ground that a state court might effectively end the controversy by determining that chiropractors were not governed by the state statute. Having thus been remitted to the state courts, the chiropractors there \u201csubmitted for decision, and briefed and argued\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> both their state and federal claims. These were rejected by the state courts. Thereafter, the chiropractors returned to the district court and sought to raise the same federal claims that had been turned down in the state court. The district court dismissed the federal action, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">\u201cSince the [state] courts have passed on all issues raised, including the claims of deprivation under the Federal Constitution, this court, having no power to review those proceedings, must dismiss the complaint. The proper remedy was by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">On appeal, the Supreme Court held that a litigant may avoid the result reached by the district court by \u201creserving\u201d his federal contentions during the course of the state litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-16\">It is apparent that the procedures outlined in <em>England </em>were engrafted onto the law of abstention to insure that implementation of the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine not run afoul of Congressional mandate. In Willcox v. Consolidated Gas Co., 212 U.S. 19, 29 S.Ct. 192, 53 L.Ed. 382 (1909), the Supreme Court stated unequivocally that \u201cthe right of a party plaintiff to choose a federal court where there is a choice cannot be properly denied.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Recalling its earlier pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>nouncement, and mindful of the fact that remitting to state courts litigants \u201e who have properly invoked the statutory jurisdiction of the federal courts might be deemed an \u201cabdication\u201d of legislated responsibility,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Court in <em>England </em>fashioned the procedure for \u201creservation\u201d of federal jurisdiction. The litigant who finds himself ordered into the state court against his will may specifically \u201creserve\u201d presentation of his federal claims to the federal court pending state determination of his state-law claims. Upon resolution of the state questions, he is admitted back into federal court for disposition of any federal issues that remain.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Thus, where <em>Pullman </em>abstention is ordered, there is avoided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cany conclusion that a litigant who has properly invoked the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court to consider federal constitutional claims can be compelled, without his consent and through no fault of his own, to accept a state court\u2019s determination of those claims.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Inasmuch as the genesis of <em>England </em>was the perceived need to insulate the <em>Pullman </em>doctrine from the taint of \u201cabdication,\u201d its application in a case where no <em>Pullman </em>problem is present is questionable. It would appear the power to \u201creserve\u201d federal claims when proceeding in a state court can arise <em>only </em>when a plaintiff is before the state tribunal because the federal court has refused, on abstention grounds, to proceed with his case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The plaintiffs here <em>elected </em>to proceed first in the state courts, and thus waived the opportunity to \u201creserve\u201d their federal claims. Having selected the state forum of their own accord, they msut abide by their choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\">.

There is a line of authority springing from the decision of the Supreme Court in Hooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), which holds that a federal district court is without <em>jurisdiction </em>to redetermine issues already litigated in a prior state action. Apparently, the Supreme Court felt that allowing re-litigation in the district courts of issues once adjudicated in the state courts would amount to a usurpation of the Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive power to review state determinations of federal questions. Thus the Court stated (263 U.S. at 415-416, 44 S.Ct. at 150) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">\u201cIt affirmatively appears from the bill that the judgment was rendered in a cause wherein the circuit court had jurisdiction of both the subject matter and the parties; that a full hearing was had therein; that the judgment was responsive to the issues, and that it was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the State on an appeal by the plaintiffs. If the Constitutional questions stated in the bill actually arose in the cause, it was the province and duty of the state courts- to decide them; and their decision whether right or wrong, was an exercise of jurisdiction. If the decision was wrong, that did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding. Unless and until so reversed or modified, it would be an effective and conclusive adjudication, [citing cases]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cUnder the legislation of Congress, no court of the United States other than this Court could entertain a proceeding to reverse or modify the judgment for errors of that character. [citing statute] To do so would be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. The jurisdiction possessed by the District Courts is strictly original.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In Daniel B. Frazier Co. v. Long Beach Twp., 77 F.2d 764, 765 (3d Cir. 1935), this court, by application of the <em>Roolcer </em>principle, reached substantially the same result that we by resort to the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>reach here. Other courts have also taken the <em>Rooker </em>approach. <em>See, e. g., </em>Paul v. Dade County, 419 F.2d 10, 12-13 (5th Cir. 1969), cert, denied, 397 U.S. 1065, 90 S.Ct. 1504, 25 L.Ed.2d 686 (1970) ; Mackay v. Nesbitt, 412 F.2d 846 (9th Cir.), cert, denied, 396 U.S. 960, 90 S.Ct. 435, 24 L.Ed.2d 425 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b153-15\">. <em>See </em>Conover v.

Pullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 61 S.Ct. 643, 85 L.Ed. 971 (1941). \u201cPullman\u201d abstention involves, typically, deference by a federal court to state-court determinations of state law, with a view to obviating the need to reach questions of constitutional dimension. Several cases, however, have upheld abstention by the federal courts where federal jurisdiction was based entirely on diversity of citizenship, and where there thus existed no con-,, stitutional question to be avoided. <em>See, e. g., </em>Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 79 S.Ct. 1070, 3 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1959) ; Hawks v. Hamill, 288 U.S. 52, 53 S.Ct. 240, 77 L.Ed. 610 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-19\">In other cases the Supreme Court has ordered abstention where a state has provided a special review mechanism for the determination of questions of state administrative law. <em>See, e. g., </em>Alabama Public Service Comm. v. Southern Ry., 341 U.S. 341, 71 S.Ct. 762, 95 L.Ed. 1002 (1951) ; Burford v.

The district court dismissed the complaint on abstention principles. The majority affirms on <em>res judicata, </em>what they describe as \u201ca ground other than that relied upon by the district court.\u201d I am not persuaded that the abstention doctrine, relied upon by the district court, is divorced from <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Abstention is a judicially developed doctrine limiting district court action under certain circumstances. I perceive it to be a shorthand expression encompassing several aspects of federal restraint. (1) In a Pullman-type abstention,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court stays its hand and retains jurisdiction until the state court acts. (2) In a Burford-type abstention,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court dismisses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>complaint and flatly declares that the subject matter is for state court determination. (3) An England-type abstention envisions two stages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where the case is filed in federal court before a state court decision, a Pullman-type abstention comes into being, the federal court staying its hand until the state court acts. If, after the state proceedings terminate, the plaintiff returns, the federal court must make a factual determination. It must decide whether the federal questions were presented to the state court. If they were, and were not reserved, then, on the theory of <em>res ju-dicata, </em>the court may properly dismiss the federal action. It is this second stage which gives the label <em>\u201cEngland-type\u201d </em>to this category of abstention; the first stage is purely and simply a <em>Pullman-type </em>abstention.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In the case before us, we had only the second stage. The appellants came to the federal court after the state court proceedings. There was thus no need for a first stage Pullman-type abstention. Call it <em>England-type </em>abstention or garden variety <em>res </em>judicata,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is the same to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I do not believe it is necessary to cut terminology so fine as to suggest that <em>England </em>only applies where the filing of the federal action precedes the state action. I find no magic in the \u201cright to return\u201d expression in the opinion. The essence of the doctrine is as stated by Mr. Justice Brennan: \u201c[W]e see no reason why a party, after unreservedly litigating his federal claims in the state courts although not required to do so, should be allowed to ignore the adverse state decision and start all over again in the District Court.\u201d 375 U.S. at 419, 84 S.Ct. at 466. See Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Levin, 359 F.Supp. 12 (E.D. Pa., three-judge court, 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Abstention takes even other forms. Professor Charles Alan Wright lists the Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), sextet as one of \u201cThe Abstention Doctrines.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The editors of Hart and Wechsler\u2019s the Federal Courts and the Federal System, 2d Ed., prefer a general category of \u201cJudicially Developed Limitations on Entertaining Actions Against State Officers\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in which they include \u201cB. Abstention: The Pullman Doctrine\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201cC. Equitable Restraint: The Doctrine of Douglas v. City of Jeanette.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is under \u201cequitable restraint\u201d rather than \u201cabstention\u201d that they place Younger<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mechanical dependence upon labels leads to difficulties. The separate nomenclature used by America\u2019s foremost federal court commentators emphasizes the importance of the conceptual and factual underpinnings of a case rather than reliance upon a neat label attached to its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">Although the majority\u2019s discussion of <em>Younger </em>appears to be dictum, I find it necessary to add these observations. <em>Younger </em>held that federal courts will not entertain an action to restrain an ongoing state proceeding if the federal plaintiff has the opportunity of asserting his constitutional contentions in a single state action. I perceive nothing in this notion that limits the application of the conceptual basis of <em>Younger </em>to criminal cases. In Berryhill v. Gibson, 411 U.S. 564, 93 S.Ct. 1689, 36 L.Ed.2d 488 (1973), the Supreme Court had an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>cluttered opportunity to say that the rationale of <em>Younger </em>was inapplicable to civil actions. But this, the court did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">I have found Lynch v. Snepp, 472 F.2d 769, 773 (4th Cir. 1973), to be the most scholarly discussion of this point. There, the Fourth Circuit, speaking through Judge Craven, applied <em>Younger </em>to a state civil action arising from a school disturbance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">These general notions of comity, equity, and federalism, applied since the early days of our Union of States and most recently restated in <em>Younger </em>and its companion cases, occupy a highly important place in our history and our future. Their application should never be made to turn on such labels as \u201ccivil\u201d or \u201ccriminal\u201d but rather upon an analysis of the competing interests in each case. Palaio v. McAuliffe, 466 F.2d 1230, 1232-1233 (5th Gir. 1972); Cousins v. Wigoda, 463 F.2d 603 (7th Cir.) application for stay denied, 409 U.S. 1201, 92 S.Ct. 2610, 34 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (Rehnquist, Circuit Justice) .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">A fair reading of the district court\u2019s opinion in the case before us discloses that Judge Scalera approached the problem much the same as Judge Craven in <em>Snepp. </em>Judge Scalera emphasized the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d test, citing De Vita v. Sills, 422 F.2d 1172 (3d Cir. 1970); <em>Younger </em>said that irreparable injury must be \u201cboth immediate and great.\u201d 401 U.S. at 46, 91 S.Ct. 746 <em>Snepp </em>reversed the grant of a preliminary injunction because plaintiffs \u201cfailed to show great and immediate irreparable injury [and] that their rights would not be protected in the state proceedings. . . . \u201d 472 F.2d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The fundamental equitable concepts of <em>Younger </em>must never be subordinated. Thus, one piece of the <em>Younger </em>factual complex must not become the subject of controlling emphasis to the exclusion of the important legal principles constituting the rationale of the case. An example of this is the suggestion that the root premises of <em>Younger </em>do not lie where there is no ongoing state proceeding. While the contemporaneity of the state action may indeed be extremely important, this is but one factor, and this one factor must not be considered <em>in vacuo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\"><em>Younger </em>is a jurisprudential brew of many interdependent principles and traditions, which Judge Craven described as \u201cgeneral notions of comity, equity, and federalism applied since the early days of our Union of States.\u201d And I find it difficult if not impossible, to lift one particular ingredient from the brew and then isolate it. And if I could, I dare say it would be impossible to divest it from the flavor of the other ingredients. Thus, if the presence of ah ongoing state proceeding is critical, so is the necessity of proving entitlement to an immediate injunction. So understood, there is a delightful Catch-22 quality about it all:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">Plaintiff: Aha, you can\u2019t apply <em>Younger, </em>because there is no ongoing state proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">Defendant: Aha to you, sir. If there is no ongoing state proceeding, then why do you need an injunction? What\u2019s there to enjoin?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">On balance, while I agree that perhaps the neatest way of affirming the district court is via the <em>England-res judicata </em>route, I am also prepared to affirm Judge Scalera on the strength of his \u201cirreparable harm\u201d discussion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b155-16\">.
