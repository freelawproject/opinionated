Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 431 F.2d 409, Part I, (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">In this suit based upon 28 U.S.C.A.. \u00a7 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983, plaintiff alleges that he suffered personal injuries at the hands of members of the New Orleans Police Department. After much contradictory testimony, the District Court found that defendant-officer Pellegrin\u2019s initial actions in attempting to arrest plaintiff were reasonably performed, with good cause, but that the subsequent behavior of three of the defendant-officers was excessive. Plaintiff was awarded, consequently, five hundred dollars in damages. On appeal, plaintiff argues that (1) the damages were inadequate, (2) all of the defendants should have, been held liable; and (3) attorneys fees, costs, and punitive damages should have been awarded. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">Plaintiff\u2019s depiction of his Bourbon Street encounter in the early morning hours of June 13, 1970, is generally irreconcilable with defendants\u2019 testimony. The trial judge concluded that the fracas</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-18\">arose out of officer Pellegrin\u2019s belief that plaintiff was molesting a pedestrian, and that initially, under the circumstances extant in the French Quarter [a recent similar brawl had resulted in an attorney\u2019s death], Pelle-grin acted reasonably. However, the attempted arrest soon erupted into an uneven brawl, caused by the officers\u2019 anger with the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">In light of the tension-ridden atmosphere, the officers\u2019 reaction, in the District Court\u2019s opinion, \u201cmight be quite understandable . . . [but] cannot excuse their use of excessive force</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-21\">While there is no doubt that he resisted vigorously, the police could or should have been able to exercise control over plaintiff without inflicting upon him the amount of physical punishment that was in fact inflicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">Of the eight policemen \u25a0 involved, only three were found to have overreacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-23\">Plaintiff\u2019s appeal stems basically from his disagreement with the trial court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>First, </em>the adequacy of the damages can be determined only in the context of evidence presented, and findings of fact cannot be set aside unless \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P. Confronted with entirely contradictory testimony, the trial judge observed the witnesses, determined their credibility, and concluded that, since plaintiff incurred medical expenses of $173, lost no wages, and suffered no permanent injuries, damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the amount of five hundred dollars were warranted. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate either that the Distinct Court reconstructed the events inaccurately or that the injuries required a more substantial award.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>Second, </em>the District Court limited the recovery to the three defendants he found to have \u201cactually used excessive physical force in making the arrest.\u201d The other defendants, he concluded, merely acted in good faith on the assumption that Jacobs was under arrest and was attempting to escape. Plaintiff fails to carry his burden to show us that the trial judge\u2019s findings were \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>Third, </em>it was not error to fail to award attorneys fees, costs or punitive damages where, as the trial court here found, \u201c[t]he actions of defendants in the context of the situation while not justified, were not done with . such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
