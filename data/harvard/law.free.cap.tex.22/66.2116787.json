Tried below before tbe Hon. Ed. H. Yon-tress. Appellee, as the administrator of Thomas O. Rucker, deceased, brought suit, on the <em>24th </em>of Sept. 1866, against appellant, upon an open account, for the recovery of the sum of $430; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the bill of particulars of which, attached to the petition, was as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">\u201c\u00a5m.

He also pleaded, that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Thomas O. Rucker, \u201cin his lifetime, to wit, during the year 1854, the precise date \u201che does not remember, became and was justly indebted to \u201cdefendant, in the sum of two hundred and ninety-eight dollars, \u201cfor various articles and services furnished to, and performed \u201cfor said intestate, at his special instance and request, which said \u201carticles and services are more fully described in the bill of particulars, herewith filed, marked Exhibit \u2018W,\u2019 and prayed to be \u201ctaken as a part of this answer; and was so justly indebted in \u201csaid sum of $290, at the time of his death, and his estate is \u201c still justly indebted to defendant in said sum of money. \u201d It was also averred in the said plea, \u201cthat plaintiff\u2019s intestate is justly \u201cindebted to defendant, in the further sum of $163 35, as will \u201cappear by a certain promissory note, payable to David S. \u201cFiles, or bearer, and executed by the said Thomas O. Rucker, \u201cby the name of Thomas Rucker, on the 12th day of September, 1854, and due one day after date ; and defendant says \u201cthat he is the owner of said note, for a valuable consideration, \u201cand was the owner and holder of the same, at the commence\u201cment of this suit, which said note is herewith filed, marked \u201c Y, and prayed to be taken as a part of this answer; the defend\u201cant pleads his debt aforesaid against said Thomas O.

There is no averment that said claim has been proven \u201cup and authenticated, as the law requires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-15\">\u201c 2d.

The answer does not show, that said claim was ever \u201cpresented to said administrator, for his approval or acceptance, \u201cand that the same was rejected by said administrator, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-17\">These exceptions were sustained by the court. The case proceeded to trial upon the other issues, and there was a verdict and judgment for the appellee, for the sum of $85.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-18\"><em>John W. </em>Berry, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apt\">The court manifestly erred in sustaining appellee\u2019s exceptions. (See Smalley v. Trammell, 11 Tex. Rep. 10.) There is no essential difference in the nature and character of the pleas of set-off, and re-convention ; (Burrill\u2019s Law Dictionary, 868, 928;) both are in the nature of cross-actions, and are so defined by the books; and a plaintiff cannot take a nonsuit after either have been filed. (Egery v. Power, 5 Tex. Rep. 501; Wallcott v. Hendrick, 6 Tex. Rep. 406 Bradford v. Hamilton, 7 Tex. Rep. 55.) The appellant was not to blame for troubling the court with this suit; and if he did not see proper to authenticate and present his claim to the administrator, as he was the creditor on a settlement, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>was not permitted by the court to prove all his debts, even then the appellee certainly has no right to complain of it; and after being sued, the appellee had surely the right to defend himself, as other persons, without being compelled to hunt up the administrator in a distant county. The statute of March 20th, 1848, does not require the defence to a suit by an administrator, to be sworn to and presented, (Hart. Dig. Art. 1158, 1159,) and the statute (Hart. Dig. 222, 223,) gives the right to set-off and re-convene in general. A plea of re-convention, it is true, may sometimes reach what a set-off would not, (see Egery v. Power, <em>supra,) </em>but the plea in this case has all the elements of a genuine plea of set-off, under our statute of discounts and set-off.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b77-4\"><em>J. W. Ferris, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASq\">The exceptions of plaintiff to defendant\u2019s plea in re-convention, were properly sustained. The defendant denied the allegation of plaintiff\u2019s petition, and averred that he never was indebted at all to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and brought a cross-action for an alleged indebtedness due him from the deceased. The ground on which a set-off is admitted, is, that to the extent of the discount, there is a mutual extinguishment of the demands of the parties: (Smalley v. Trammell, 11 Tex. Rep. 10.) The defendant\u2019s plea repudiates all idea of a mutual extinguishment, and sets up an independent action against plaintiff, as administrator. In the case of Coles v. Portis, 18 Tex. Rep. 155, there is an intimation, that it is unnecessary to aver in the pleadings, an authentication and presentment of the claim for approval. The reason for that intimation is given, in that, the refusal of the administrator to allow and pay the account, though often requested, is alleged. There is no such allegation in defendant\u2019s plea. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s claim is not a part of his plea, and shows no authentication, and no evidence of being rejected by the administrator. The plea must contain sufficient averment to show a right to sue. (Benton v. Williams, Dal. Dig. 496.) In Dean v. Duffield, 8 Tex. Rep. 235, the averment of the presentation of the claim was sufficient, and such an averment appears to be material in showing a right to sue. There is no such aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ment in this ease. The exceptions were specially set forth; they were properly sustained by the court; and the defendant declined to amend.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b78-5\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ade\">The account pleaded in set-off, in this case, consisting of items similar in their nature to those of plaintiff\u2019s account, upon which the suit was brought, constituted a good defence to the action. It is true, that defendant had not placed his claim in condition, to authorize him to recover a judgment against the administrator, should his (defendant\u2019s,) claim prove to be the largest. Such excess he had no right to recover under the pleadings. It was not necessary for defendant to have presented his account duly authenticated; but, without that, it operated as an extinguishment of plaintiff\u2019s debt to the extent that might be established, even to the full amount of plaintiff\u2019s demand. (Smalley v. Trammell, 11 Tex. Rep. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The allegations of the plea, in connection with the note set out in set-off, do not make it a valid defence ; because it is not shown, that defendant acquired the note before the death of Rucker. As to this part of the answer, the exception was properly sustained; as to the balance of the answer, (to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s demand,) the exception should have been overruled. Judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
