(Hart. Dig. Art. 766.) There is no evidence, in the record, that any motion in writing was filed; if it was, there is no evidence when it was filed, or what grounds were set out in the motion for new trial; and this court has repeatedly said, that it would not reverse for any error not set out in the motion. (Sweeney v. Jarvis, 6 Tex. Rep. 36; Hart v. Ware, 8 Id. 45; Hart. Dig. Art. 766.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-8\">Is the judgment of the court below <em>erroneous ? </em>We think not, for the following reasons: 1st. Because the language in the will or codicil, does not pass the fee in the land, except that portion of the will, which gives and bequeaths one fourth of his land to the counties in which it is located or situated, for the benefit of the suffering poor. While the words, \u201cI wish,\u201d might be sufficient to pass the title, or the right to property to the kindred in blood of the testator, yet it is not enough to pass the fee in land to a stranger, more particularly is that the case under our statute. (Hart. Dig. Art. 1221.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-9\">The codicil seeks to bequeath two thirds of the land in the county in which he died and was buried, for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>public schools. A county is not a corporation, and therefore cannot take the land thus bequeathed. It is clear, that the title to the land cannot be vested in the county; if a county is a corporation at all, it is, at most, a <em>quasi </em>corporation, for certain and special purposes. (Jackson v. Cory, 8 Johns. Rep. 385; Jackson v. Hartwell, Id. 422; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 266; Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. Rep. 1.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-5\">If the fee did not vest in the county, either because the words \u201cI wish the county in which I die and am buried,\u201d &amp;c., is not sufficient to pass the title, or because the county could not take for charitable purposes, surely there is no language in the will, that vests the title in the county commissioners, or Henry J. Jewett, as trustees, for the use of public schools.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">The bequest is not capable of any definite application. To what public schools in the county where the testator died, are to be applied the two thirds of the land lying in that county ? What is meant, or what is to be understood, by the term \u201cpublic schools?\u201d In what manner is the property to be vested in the county ? There is no provision for a sale of the two thirds of the land, and an appropriation of the proceeds either to the county, or the commissioners, or any one else. (1 Jarm. on Wills, pp. 194, 231; Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. Rep. 1; 2 Rep. on Leg., pp. 1237 to 1245; 1 Jarm. on Wills, pp. 58, 59, and 99, 100, and the cases cited in the note; Jackson v.

Rep. 55.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-8\">The land was not given to the county in fee, but only in trust, and the county cannot hold for itself; and the purposes of the trust are so general that they must all fail.

Rep. 222; Jackson v. Bull, 10 Id. 148; Jackson v. Embler, 14 Id. 198; Wright v. Denn, 10 Wheat. Rep. 204; Clayton v. Clayton, 3 Binn. Rep. 476; Seymour v. Ellison, 2 Wend. Rep. 13.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-6\">There are no words of limitation, or perpetuity, in the <em>will. </em>(Wheaton v. Andress, 28 Wend. Rep. 452; Olmsted v. Harvey, 1 Barb. 102; Vanderwerker v. Vanderwerker, 7 Id. 221; Harvey v. Olmsted, 1 Comst. Eep. 483; Roe v. Daw, 3 Maule &amp; S. Rep. 518.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-7\">If it should be determined that we are wrong, in the former positions assigned, then we say, that the title could only pass to the county of Bell, upon the condition, that the county commissioners paid the taxes on the land appropriated to school purposes, in case the commissioners failed to pay the taxes. The testator says, that \u201cin case the commissioners should fail \u201cto pay the taxes on the land, as directed, I wish all my property put in the possession of my nearest relations, provided \u201cthey call for it,\u201d &amp;c. He died in April, 1854, and the cause was tried in March, 1857. The plaintiffs allege that the taxes were not paid by the commissioners; and defendant admitted, upon the trial, that plaintiff had paid the taxes, and made n'o proof that the commissioners had paid the taxes, or had offered to pay them. The commissioners having failed to pay them, notwithstanding it was a condition subsequent, it forfeited the right to the land. (2 Williams on Ex. pp. 1081, 1082, and the notes on each page.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b364-8\">This case is different from the case of Finley et al v. King, 3 Pet. Rep. 346. In that case, King bequeathed a certain portion of his estate to William King, on condition of his marrying a daughter of William Triggs, but made another disposition of the property, in case he failed to do so; and the court decided, that the title passed to William King, at the death of the testator\u2019s widow, upon the ground that he made no other disposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the property, in case he failed to marry the daughter of Triggs, hut clearly intimated, that, if the testator had made any other disposition of the property, upon his failing to marry as directed, they would have held differently. In this case, the testator gave his land to his relations, in case the commissioners failed to pay the taxes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\">We are unable to see the application of the law, cited by appellant, from Hart. Dig. pp. 290 to 295; for the acts of the 26th of July, 1889, and the 5th of February, 1840, were repealed, by implication, in the change of government; and especially so, in regard to the last named act, from the fact, that, under that law, the chief justice, and two associate justices, were constituted a board of school commissioners of their respective counties, while under the law of the State, there are no such officers, as associate justices, belonging to the county court. (Const. Art. 10, Hart. Dig. pp. 77, 78.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b365-6\">Wheeler, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A43\">There is nothing in the objecton, that no motion for a new trial appears to have been filed. A jury having been waived, and the case submitted to the court, a motion for a new trial was not necessary, to entitle the plaintiff in error to a revision of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The grounds of objection urged, to the validity of the will, which require notice, are, 1st. That the words of the will are not sufficient to pass the title; and that the county is not capable of taking under the will, the title to the property devised. 2d. That the purposes of the trust are too uncertain and indefinite to be capable of being carried into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">It is a familiar doctrine, that in the construction of a will, the intention of the testator is the first and great object of inquiry; and the law will not suffer the intention to be defeated, merely because the testator has not clothed his ideas in technical language. Our statute, like that of New York, and many of the other States, has swept away, as Chancellor Kent has expressed it, (4 Kent\u2019s Com. 537) all the established rules of construction of wills, in respect to the quantity of interest con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>veyed, by declaring, that \u201cevery estate in lands which shall \u201chereafter be granted, conveyed, or devised to one, although \u201c other words heretofore necessary at common law to transfer \u201can estate, in fee simple, be not added, shall be deemed a fee \u201csimple, if a less estate be not limited by express words, or do \u201cnot appear to have been granted, conveyed or devised, by \u201c construction, or operation of law.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">It cannot be doubted, that by employing the words, \u201cI wish \u201cthe county in which I die and am buried, to have and enjoy, \u201cfor the benefit of public schools, two-thirds of the land in the \u201ccounty I am buried in,\u201d taken in connection with the words \u201cmy land,\u201d and \u201cthe land I own,\u201d used in other parts of the will, and in the context, the testator meant to devise an estate in lands; and as there are no words in the will, indicative of an intention to devise a less estate, the devise must be held to pass an estate in fee, or the whole estate of the grantor. (Hart. Dig. Art. 168.) Indeed, it is plain, that a less estate could not have been intended, because the trusts with which the testator has sought to charge his lands, and the acts which, by his will, he has required to be done, could not be performed, unless an estate in fee simple be taken by the devisee. It is a rule of construction of the common law, independently of the statute, that in every case, where land is charged with a trust which cannot be performed, or where the will directs an act to be done, which cannot be accomplished, unless a greater estate than one for life be taken, it becomes necessary that the devise be enlarged to a fee. (4 Kent\u2019s Com. 540; Collier v. Walker, 6 Co. Rep. 16; Doe v. Woodhouse, 4 Term Rep. 89.) But the necessity of resorting to this rule of the common law no longer exists. It is clear, that the testator intended to devise an estate in lands; and as a less estate is not limited, by express words, and does not appear to have been devised by construction, or operation of law, it must be deemed to be an estate in fee. Indeed, the intention of the testator, to be collect\u00e9d from the whole will, to devise an estate in fee simple, is too clear for doubt or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>There is as little doubt of the capacity of the county to take an estate in lands, by grant or devise. The statute declares that \u201c each county which now exists, or which may be hereafter established in this State, shall be a body corporate and politic.\u201d (Hart. Dig. Art. 206.) They may sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded. (Id. Art. 207.) They may take and hold, and dispose of, private property for municipal uses; (Id. Art. 213, et seq.) or such uses and purposes as subserve the public good, and the exercise of the local and subordinate legislative powers, with which they may be invested by the public law of the State, or by private legislative acts. (Angell &amp; Ames on Corp. 30; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 275, and notes.) Though public corporations, they have the same capacity in this respect and to this extent, as a private corporation, to take and hold property in trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In the great case upon the construction of Girard\u2019s will, Judge Story says : \u201cAlthough it was, in early times, held that a corporation could not take and hold real or personal estate in trust, \u201cupon the ground that there was a defect of one of the requisites to create a good trustee, viz., the want of confidence in \u201c the person; yet that doctrine has been long since exploded as \u201cunsound, and too artificial; and it is now held, that where the \u201ccorporation has a legal capacity to take real or personal \u201cestate, it may take and hold it upon trust, in the same man\u201cner and to the same extent, as a private person may do. \u201cIt is true that, if the trust be repugnant to, or inconsistent \u201cwith the proper purposes for which the corporation was crested, that may furnish a ground why it may not be compelled \u201cto execute\u2018it. But that will furnish no ground to declare the \u201ctrust itself void, if otherwise unexceptionable, but it will sim\u201cply require a new trustee to be substituted by the proper \u201ccourt possessing equity jurisdiction, to enforce and perfect \u201cthe objects of the trust.\u201d (Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 2 How. Rep. 187-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">It is unnecessary to examine the cases cited by counsel for the appellee, to show that devises or bequests to unincorporated societies, for charitable uses, where the objects or beneficiaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>were indefinite or uncertain; or that charities, where no trust is interposed, and no legal interest is vested, and where the charity is general and indefinite, both as to persons and objects, and too vague to be claimed by those for Avhom the beneficial interest was intended; cannot be upheld and enforced by a court of equity in this country, where the statute of 43 Elizabeth, called the statute of charitable uses, is not in force. It might suffice to say, that the present is not such a case. Rut the case mainly relied on, and perhaps the best considered and most authoritative case cited by counsel, in support of the objection that the beneficiaries, or objects of the trust, in the present case, are too indefinite and uncertain to enable a court of equity to uphold the devise, is the case of The Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. Rep. 1. Rut that decision would not be an authority for the doctrine contended for, as applied to the present case. That was a bequest of personal property, to an unincorporated society, \u201cThe Baptist Association that, for \u201c ordinary, meets at Philadelphia annually, which I allow to be \u201c a perpetual fund for the education'of youths of the Raptist \u201c denomination, who shall appear promising for the ministry, \u201calways giving a preference to the descendants of my father\u2019s \u201cfamily.\u201d The court held, that the association, not being incorporated, could not take this trust, as a society; that the individual associates could not take, as trustees, they being a body vague and uncertain; and that no legal interest vested; and that legacies, to charities, were sustained in England, under the statute of Elizabeth only. The devise, in the present case, is to a corporation, capable, as we have seen, of taking the legal estate in trust; and the objects of the charity are certain and definite. The case of the Raptist Association v. Hart, therefore, clearly is not a case in point. Rut, if that were a case in point, the decision has been greatly modified, if its authority has not been entirely overthrown, by subsequent investigations and decisions; and particularly by the great case of Vidal v. Girard\u2019s Executors, decided by the same learned court. (2 How. Rep. 127.) In distinguishing this latter case from the former, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Mr. Justice Story, delivering the unanimous opinion of the court, observed that, in the former case, \u201cthe donees were an \u201cunincorporated association, which had no legal capacity to \u201ctake and hold the donation, in succession, for the purposes of \u201cthe trust, and the beneficiaries were also uncertain and indefinite.\u201d Both circumstances, therefore, concurred; a donation \u2022to trustees incapable of taking, and beneficiaries uncertain and indefinite; and he observes that the court came to the conclusion, that at the common law, antecedent to and independent of the statute of 43 Elizabeth, ch. 4, no donation to charity could he enforced in chancery where both of these circumstances, or rather, where both of these defects occurred. He further observes, that the authorities and lights upon which the court decided, were in no small degree shadowy, obscure and flickering. The court review the additional authorities, now brought to their attention; and, observing that very strong additional light has been thrown upon the subject, conclude, that these new sources of information \u201cestablish, in the most satisfactory \u201cand conclusive manner, that cases of charities, where there \u201c were trustees appointed for general and indefinite charities, \u201cas well as for specific charities, were familiarly known to, \u201cand acted upon, and enforced in the Court of Chancery.\u201d \u201cWhatever doubts, therefore, (they say) might properly be entertained upon the subject, when the case of the Trustees of \u201cthe Philadelphia Baptist Association v. Hart, (4 Wheat. Rep. \u201c1,) was before this court, (1819,) those doubts are entirely \u201cremoved by the late and more satisfactory sources of information to which we have alluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">And in the later editions of his Commentaries, Judge Story, upon a review of the authorities, attains a conclusion the contrary of that expressed in his first publication, and says: \u201c Upon \u201cthe whole, it seems now to he the better opinion, that the \u201cjurisdiction of the Court of Chancery over charities, where no \u201ctrust is interposed; or, where there is no person <em>in esse, </em>\u201ccapable of taking; or, where the charity is of an indefinite \u201cnature; is to be referred to the general jurisdiction of that \u201ccourt, anterior to the statute of Elizabeth.\u201d (2 Story\u2019s Eq. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Jur. \u00a7 1162.) Chancellor Kent, in a learned note to his Commentaries, where he examines this subject, quotes the observation of Chancellor Walworth, \u201cthat the decision in the case of \u201cthe Baptist Association v. Hart, 4 Wheat. Rep. 1, is generally admitted to be wrongand after reviewing the authorities, says, \u201cthe fact, I think, may be considered indisputable, \u201cthat chancery uses are lawful uses by the common law, and \u201cthat the statute of Elizabeth was only an ancillary remedy, \u201cnow supplied by chancery, as the rightful original tribunal for \u201csuch trusts.\u201d (2 Kent\u2019s Com. 288, note, 8th edit.) Similar opinions appear to have been held in Massachusetts, New York, (McCartee v. Orphans\u2019 Asylum Society, 9 Cow. Rep. 437; Van Duzer v. Van Duzer, 6 Paige\u2019s Rep. 367;) Pennsylvania, (Whitman v. Lex, 17 Serg. &amp; R. Rep. 88;) Kentucky, (Moore v. Moore, 4 Dana\u2019s Rep. 357;) Tennessee, (Dickson v. Montgomery, 1 Swan\u2019s Rep. 348;) Mississippi, (Wade v. American Colonization Society, 7 Sm. &amp; Marsh. Rep. 663;) and in many, if not most of the other States; and see cases cited in notes to Perkins\u2019 Ed. of Jarm. on Wills, vol. 1, p. 194; Am. notes to Rop. on Leg. vol. 2, p. 1115; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 8th ed. 508, and notes; 2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">But it is unnecessary, in the present case, to decide whether equity will enforce a donation to charitable uses, where the donees are uncertain, or where the beneficiaries, and objects of the trust, are uncertain and indefinite. There is no such uncertainty in the present case. We have seen that the trustee is capable of taking and holding the estate in trust. The purposes of the trust are definite and certain. And if those purposes are germain to the objects of the incorporation; if they relate to matters which will promote, and aid, and perfect those objects; there can be no legal impediment to the corporation taking the devise upon trust. (2 How. Rep. p. 189, and see the case of Inglis v. The Sailor\u2019s Snug Harbor, 3 Pet. Rep. 99.) That such are the purposes of the trust, is sufficiently apparent, by reference to the subjects, confided by law, to the management and local government of the counties, and particularly the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>laws which enjoin upon them the duty of executing the identical trusts, which this devise was intended to aid in advancing and perfecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">By the constitution of the State, the Legislature is required \u201cto make suitable provision for the support and maintenance of public schoolsto \u201c establish free schools throughout the State,\u201d and \u201cfurnish means for their support, by taxation on property;\u201d \u201cto set apart not less than one tenth of the revenue \u201cof the State, derivable from taxation, as a perpetual fund, \u201cwhich fund shall be appropriated to the support of free public \u201cschools.\u201d (Const. Art. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2.) The establishment of public schools throughout the State, is thus provided for and enjoined by the paramount law. And the grants of public land, heretofore made for public schools, are recognized and confirmed to the counties. (Id. \u00a7 3, 4; Acts of 26 Jan. 1839, and 5 Feb. 1840, Hart. Dig. p. 290, 292.) And by act of the 16th of January, 1850, it is provided, that every county which has been, or may hereafter be established, shall have surveyed and set apart four leagues of land, for the purposes of education, in conformity to the act of the 26th of January, 1839. (Hart. Dig. Art. 896.) The act of the 21st of January, 1854, \u201cto establish a system of schools, (Laws of 5th Leg. ch. 18,) sets apart two millions of dollars, in the treasury of the State, \u201cas a school fund, for the support and maintenance of public schools;\u201d and constitutes the chief justices and county commissioners of the several counties, a board of school commissioners for their respective counties, to form their respective counties into school districts, and order an election of trustees for each district. (Id. \u00a7 2.) The trustees, so elected, are constituted a body corporate and politic, with the capacity to sue and be sued, to hold and dispose of property, and \u201cdo such acts and things \u201c as are incidental and necessary to the performance of their \u201cduties,\u201d as prescribed by the law. (Id. \u00a7 15.) This, and the subsequent Acts of the 29th of August, 1856, and the 5th of February, 1858, (Laws 6th Leg. p. 107; Id. 7th Leg. 124,) contain further provisions for the establishment and support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>public schools, which it is not necessary to our present purpose to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">It is thus seen, that the counties are empowered, by law, to take and hold land in trust, for the uses and purposes of the donation here in que'stion; and that they are provided, by law, with the requisite machinery and means, and entrusted with the duty of executing the trust, in the manner, and for the identical objects and purposes, contemplated by the donor. There is, therefore, no foundation for the objection, that the county is incompetent to take, as trustee; or, that the objects of the trust are indefinite; or, that the county is incompetent to take and administer the trust. It is true, the individual beneficiaries, who shall be recipients of the donor\u2019s bounty, are not known; if they were, it would not be a charity. The counties are entrusted with the duty, to provide for the support of indigent persons, resident in the county, (Hart. Dig. Art. 309;) and if cannot be doubted, they are competent to take and administer a charitable bequest for that purpose. . \\</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">There is nothing in the objection, that the county had not paid the taxes upon the land. If the true construction of the whole will and codicil be, that the payment of taxes, by the county commissioners, was a condition annexed to the devise, it cannot be supposed that the payment was intended to precede the vesting of the estate; it must have been intended to follow it. And it is well settled, that, if the act does not necessarily precede the vesting of the estate, but may accompany or follow it; if this is to be collected from the whole will, the condition is subsequent. (Finlay v. King, 3 Pet. Rep. 346.) The will and codicil contain a general devise, in words importing a present interest, and the effect manifestly was, to vest the estate in the trustee, upon the death of the devisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Our opinion, therefore, is, that the will contains a legal and valid devise of the property in question, to the county, in trust, for the uses and purposes therein expressed. To hold otherwise, would be to deny to the courts of this State, the power to uphold or enforce a charitable bequest, in any case. Such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>determination, it is believed, would not find countenance in any well considered decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the judgment be reversed, and such judgment be here rendered, as the court below ought to have rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Reversed and reformed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
