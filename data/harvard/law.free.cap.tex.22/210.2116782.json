F. H. Lutterloh.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b218-9\">An indictment, charging that the defendant did make \u201ca violent and aggravated assault, with a pistol; and did then present the said pistol at said Gf. W. T.; and did then and there shoot at said Gr. W. T., with intent to kill;\u201d is a good indictment for an aggravated assault.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b218-10\">In an indictment for an assault, it is not necessary to state that it was unlawfully committed. Any assault, committed on a freeman, is regarded as unlawful, until an excuse or justification he shown.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-11\">Appeal from Coryell.

Taylor. The body of the charge in the indictment, is set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">A motion to quash the indictment was sustained, and the case dismissed; to which ruling and judgment, the district attorney excepted, and prayed an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-7\"><em>Attorney-General, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A02n\">The indictment is sufficient, as it contains venue, and all the material allegations, to constitute the offence. The word, \u201cviolent,\u201d in connection with aggravated assault, may be regarded as surplusage. That the indictment did not aver an ability to do an injury, was matter of defence. See Caldwell v. The State, 5 Tex. Rep. 18, where it was held, that if defendant was not within shooting distance, it was matter of defence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-8\"><em>X. B. Saunders, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acm\">The court did not err, in quashing the indictment, as there is no such offence known to our law, as a violent and aggravated assault. (See Assaults, Penal Code, \u00a7\u00a7 475-9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-9\">An indictment must contain a definite description: of' the crime charged, and a statement of facts which constitute'it, or judgment will be arrested. (Mart. &amp; Yerg. 187.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-10\">The indictment is bad, for that it does not charge any criminal intent. An assault and battery is defined to be, the use of any unlawful violence upon the person of another, with the intent to injure him; and an assault, is any attempt to commit a battery, coupled with the ability to do so, (Penal Code, \u00a7 475,) which means, among other things, that the person making the assault, must be within such distance of the person assailed, as to make it within his power to commit the battery, by the use of the means with which he attempts it. (Penal Code, \u00a7 482.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-11\">An indictment, under a statute, must follow the words of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the statute, and nothing is to be taken by intendment. (The State v. O\u2019Bannon, 1 Bailey\u2019s Rep. 144; The State v. Brown, 4 Port. Ala. Rep. 410; The State v. Delue, 1 Chand. Wis. Rep. 166; Hamilton v. Commonwealth, 3 Penn. Rep. 146.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-6\">This indictment does not charge the act to have been <em>unlawfully </em>done, or within <em>shooting </em>distance. (Penal Code, Art. 483, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-7\">The offence should be/ stated, with such distinctness and precision, as to leave no room for doubt on the mind of either defendant or court. (The State v. Johnston, 11 Tex. Rep. 22.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-8\">An indictment, upon a statute, must state all the facts and circumstances which constitute the statutory offence, so as to bring the party indicted, <em>precisely </em>within the provisions of the statute. (People v. Allen, 5 Denio\u2019s Rep. 76; Howel v. Commonwealth, 5 Gratt. Rep. <em>664.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-10\">In an accusation, which sets forth a charge that is criminal only under certain circumstances, which are defined by law, the omission to set forth or aver the existence of such circumstances, is fatal to the indictment. (Commonwealth v. Clark, 2 Ashm. Rep. 105.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-11\">The venue must be specially laid, which is not done in this case, except by a mere marginal reference. (Kennedy v. Commonwealth, 3 Bibb\u2019s Rep. 499.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-12\">Roberts, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHr\">The exceptions taken to the indictment, are, that it is vague and uncertain, and that the facts stated therein do not constitute an offence. The body of the charge is as follows: \u201c In and upon one George <em>W. </em>Taylor, in the peace of \u201c God, and said State of Texas, then and there being, did make a \u201cviolent and aggravated assault, with a pistol; and did then \u201cpresent the said pistol, at said George <em>W. </em>Taylor; and did \u201cthen and there shoot at said George <em>W. </em>Taylor, with intent to \u201ckill; contrary to the form of the statute,\u201d &amp;c. This indictment laid the charge at a time antecedent to the adoption of the Penal Code, though it was found and presented afterwards. The prosecution, in the mode of procedure, should conform to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the rules prescribed in the Code, being the law in force at the time, during which it was instituted and carried on. Our laws, previous to the adoption of the Code, recognized the grades of common, and of aggravated assault, but never before attempted to draw, so precisely, the distinction between them. The latter always included the former. (Cotton v. The State, 4 Tex. Rep. 264; Gardenheir v. The State, 6 Id. 348.) In the case of Norton v. The State, 14 Tex. Rep. 394, it is said, \u201cwherever there are such aggravations attending the eommis- \u201c sion of the offence, as the use of bludgeons, missiles, or instru\u201cments or weapons of any kind, capable of inflicting injury \u201c beyond what may ordinarily be inflicted by a blow with the fist, \u201cand used in such manner as to be likely to inflict injury, and \u201cespecially when so used as to cause a wounding, the offence \u201cmust be deemed to be of an aggravated nature, within the \u201cmeaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In the indictment now under consideration, the assault is sufficiently well stated, and must amount, at least, to a common assault, rejecting, as surplusage, the allegations in relation to its being \u201cviolent and aggravated,\u201d and being made with a \u201cpistol.\u201d These words could not vitiate the indictment, as a charge of a common assault. It is not necessary, however, to take this view of it, to sustain the indictment; for it is obvious, that something more was intended, by using them in connection with the assault charged. Under the description of what may constitute an aggravated assault, as above quoted from the case of Norton v. The State, these words were used to indicate the facts of aggravation, necessary to describe that offence. Their object is to show, that the assault was not common, but violent and aggravated, by the use of a pistol; and that such deadly weapon was used, in a manner likely to inflict serious injury, by shooting at said Taylor, with intent to kill him. This surely fills the full measure of an aggravated assault, as contemplated by the statute. Indeed, it states more than -is necessary to constitute such offence. What is stated about the pistol, is intended as descriptive of the facts of aggravation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>merely, to raise the grade of the assault charged, from common to aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">It is not necessary to state that the assault was unlawfully committed. The transaction imports illegality, on its face; and if there were circumstances that made it lawful, the burden rests on the defendant to show them. It is not necessary for the State to prove, as a distinct fact, that the assault was unlawful. All assaults committed on freemen are regarded as unlawful, until they who commit them establish an excuse or justification. It is therefore not necessary to allege that it was unlawfully done. (2 Arch. Crim. Pl. 282; Code of Crim. Proced. (Texas) Art. 396.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On both these grounds, we think the court erred'in sustaining <em>the exceptions to the </em>indictment. Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
