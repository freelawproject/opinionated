Tried below before the Hon. A. W. Terrell. Suit by appellee, for damages sustained from loss of horses in consequence of a contagious disease taken by appellee\u2019s horses, from those of appellant; and which were brought by appellant into the range where appellee\u2019s had previously been kept.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-11\">Each of the parties had stock-pens upon their own lands, which were in the same stock-range. Appellee\u2019s horses were in the range, at the time appellant brought his stock home. Appellant\u2019s horses, at that time, appeared well, but in about ten days, the disease broke out among them. There was testimony on the part of appellant, that he had given warning to his neighbors, and to the appellee, among others, to keep their horses away from his, on account of the disease among them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">As the case turned entirely upon the charge of the court to the jury, which is quoted in the opinion, it is unnecessary to state the facts more fully.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Jno.

And on this point, the verdict is against the evidence: see testimony of Await, Hodges, Gillespie, and Hamilton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">Wood v. Waterville, 5 Mass.

Thornton, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amx\">The first error assigned relates to the inquiry of the jury as to whether, if the defendant suffered his stock to run at large, at night, if it would be such negligence on the part of the plaintiff, to suffer his own to run at large, at night, as would preclude his recovery, to which the court answered, <em>\u201c </em>it would not.\u201d The court in its general charge, (record, page 13,) added a proviso to the charge, that caused the jury to make the inquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-10\">This answer was clearly right, because in our State all lands not enclosed are common; and the defendant could only be required to control and pen his stock, because of the infectious disease which rendered them dangerous and a public nuisance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The right of the\u2019 plaintiff depends upon the rule of law which declares, that no man shall use his own property in a manner that causes injury to another, without being liable. We admit the defendant\u2019s right to keep horses, and to graze them on any unenclosed lands; but we do not admit that he has a right to keep horses that are a nuisance, and that have a contagious and fatal disease, when others will suffer thereby; and not be responsible to the persons injured.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">This principle is found, wherever the question has been made, and so universal is the rule, that it has become a legal maxim. (Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 25; Scott v. Bay, 3 Md. Rep., the closing paragraphs, pages 445, 446 ; Fish v. Dodge, 4 Denio Rep. 311; Boughton v. Carter, 18 Johns. Rep. 405.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">The only exception to this rule is, where the act complained of is done by public authority, and for the public good. This doctrine is reviewed in the case of Hooker v. The New Haven &amp; North. Co. 14 Conn. Rep. 146 ; also 1 Eng. C. L. Rep. 500.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-7\">Wheeler, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsQ\">The exception to the third instruction of the court, and the response of the court to the question propounded by the jury, we think well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The instruction is as follows: \u201cThe plaintiff would not be \u201cguilty of such negligence as would preclude him, in a proper \u201ccase, from recovering, if he was guilty of no other negligence \u201cthan permitting his stock to remain in the range, which he \u201cused with others as public range, before the diseased stock of \u201cdefendant made its appearance. If, however, plaintiff, or his \u201cagent, knowingly permitted his stock to mix with the diseased \u201cstock of defendant, on that portion of defendant\u2019s own land, \u201cwhere defendant\u2019s stock were kept and herded, after having \u201cknowledge of the disease, and thereby his stock became \u201cdiseased, and his loss resulted, he would not, in that event, be \u201centitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The proof is, that after the defendant bought his stock, and brought it upon his premises, the disease made its appearance. There is no pretence, that he knew that the stock was diseased, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>when he brought it there. He then, undoubtedly, had the right to keep it there, upon his own premises, warning his neighbors to keep their stock away, and using all the means reasonably within his power to prevent the communication of the disease. If, as soon as he discovered, or had reason to believe, his stock were infected with a contagious disease, he gave such warning, and used such means, to prevent injury to them, and they negligently suffered their stock to remain exposed to the contagion, and injury resulted to them, he clearly could not be held liable therefor. But the first \u00a1Dart of the charge would leave the impression, that, if the plaintiff\u2019s stock were in that range, he having before that time, used it in common with others, it was not negligence in him, to let them remain there as before; and if loss resulted to the plaintiff, the defendant would be responsible. This is not correct. It was as much the duty of the plaintiff, as it was of the defendant, when the disease was discovered, to use all the care and diligence reasonably within his power, to prevent the communication of the disease. When warned of the danger, it was equally incumbent on him to keep his stock away from the defendant\u2019s, as it was upon the defendant, to keep his upon his own premises, and prevent their running at large and communicating the disease to the plaintiff\u2019s stock. It was not correct to say, in effect, that because the plaintiff\u2019s stock had previously run at large, in the range where the defendant\u2019s now were, it was not negligence in the plaintiff to suffer his to remain there as before. If there was danger, and he was apprised of it, and by the use of ordinary care and diligence, could have avoided the injury to his own stock, his failure to do so, was negligence, and he cannot hold the defendant responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The last part of the charge, in some measure, qualifies the first part; but it conveys the idea, by clear implication, that to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to a recovery, the jury must be satisfied that the plaintiff, having knowledge of the disease, knowingly permitted his stock to mix with the defendant\u2019s, upon the defendant\u2019s premises, and that <em>thereby </em>the injury resulted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>If the plaintiff negligently suffered his stock to mix with the defendant\u2019s, upon the defendant\u2019s premises, or elsewhere, having been apprised of the danger, the consequence, upon his right to recover for any injury he may have sustained thereby, would be the same as if he knowingly permitted it. But the principal objection to this part of the charge is, that it implies that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, unless the injury was occasioned by his own negligence, in permitting his stock to mix with the defendant\u2019s, on the defendant\u2019s land; leaving the inference, that to prevent a recovery, the injury must have Peen occasioned solely by the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, suffered in a particular manner. It would, perhaps, be impossible for the jury to decide, that the injury resulted from the mingling of the stock upon the defendant\u2019s land, rather than elsewhere ; or where, or how it was, that the disease was communicated from the one stock to the other. Yet, under this charge, if the evidence did not satisfy them, that the injury resulted from the particular act of negligence, and under the particular circumstances' mentioned in the charge, they would naturally conclude that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. But this would not be correct. To entitle the plaintiff to maintain the action, he must satisfy the jury that he had used ordinary care. Otherwise, it cannot be certain, that he was not himself the cause of his own injury. If he was negligent, it cannot be known, whether the injury was wholly imputable to the defendant, or to the fault of the plaintiff himself. If both were negligent, and thereby injury ensued to the plaintiff, though it could not certainly be known, whether the injury Avas caused at one time or another, or in what particular manner it Avas occasioned, the plaintiff was not entitled to maintain the action. To entitle the plaintiff to recover, he must have satisfied the jury, that he had used ordinary care, or that the injury was wholly attributable to the defendant\u2019s fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It does not distinctly appear by the record, that the question to which the court responded, was propounded by the jury. But it is conceded in argument, that it was; and that is certainly more probable, than that it was propounded and answered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tlie court. In its bearing upon tlie case, it is not very material, whether it occurred in the one way or the other, as it was made to constitute a part of the instructions to the jury. It is thus: \u201cWould Walker\u2019s unenclosed lands be considered his premises ? \u201c If yea, and Walker, or agent, permitted his stock to run at large, \u201c at night, would it be negligence on the part of Herron, or agent, \u201cto suffer his stock to do the same ?\u201d To which the court answered: \u201cIt would not.\u201d This answer was objectionable, as being a charge upon the weight of evidence. It was telling the jury that a particular act of the plaintiff was not negligence. But it was erroneous in point of law. It was making the defendant\u2019s negligence, an excuse for the plaintiff\u2019s ; and so it was doubtless understood by the jury. The idea conveyed to their minds must have been, that if the defendant was careless in letting his stock run at large at night, the plaintiff might do the same thing, and the defendant alone would be responsible for the consequence of their mutual negligence. Whereas, the law is otherwise; and holds that, if the fault was mutual, the plaintiff cannot recover. If the defendant was negligent, and suffered his stock to run at large, that was no reason why the plaintiff should be negligent also, but rather the reverse. It would seem to suggest the necessity of greater care and diligence on his part to prevent injury; of which there would be more danger, certainly, than if the defendant had kept his stock closely confined. It would seem, that the instruction was not correct, either as matter of law or fact. The rule of law in this class of cases, is, that if by ordinary care the plaintiff might have avoided the consequences of the defendant\u2019s negligence, he is not entitled to recover. It is said by Mr. Green-leaf, that \u201cThe case of faults on both sides is one of great \u201c embarrassment; but the result of the authorities seems to be \u201cthis, that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, to show that, \u201cnotwithstanding any neglect or fault on his part, the injury \u201cis in no respect attributable to himself, but is wholly attributable to the misconduct on the part of the defendant, as the '\u201cproximate cause.\u201d \u201cIf the fault was mutual, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201ccannot recover.\u201d (2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 473 and cases cited; 2 Robinson\u2019s Prac. 659, 660, 661 and cases cited.) It is to be observed, that the counsel for the defendant does not appear to have called the attention of the court to these principles of the law, as applicable to the case, by asking proper instruction; and this accounts, doubtless, for what we consider to be the error in the charge. Had the view we have taken been suggested, it would, doubtless, have been adopted by the court. But, as it is apprehended, the error in the charge may have misled the jury, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
