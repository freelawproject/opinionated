Sale confirmed, and proceeds paid to them. In a suit against them, by the purchaser, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>land, as described in the bond, and order and confirmation of sale, in the absence of fraud, or concealment by the purchaser: Held, that the defendants were estopped from questioning the sale or conveyance, by virtue thereof, of all the land embraced within the boundaries set forth in the bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-5\">Under such state of facts: Held, that the defendants were estopped from setting up as a defence, that during the lifetime of the obligee of the bond, there had been a survey of the land, to which he had assented, changing the boundaries from those contained in the bond ; that they never intended to ask the County Court for a sale of the land actually described in the bond, bu*' that their attorney made a mistake in asking a sale according to the bond; that the obligee, in his lifetime, only claimed, according to the said survey, (varying the original contract as to boundaries,) 1,780 acres ; that the administrator intended to, and did sell, only 1,780 acres ; and that the purchaser supposed she was buying that number of acres.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-6\">One of the defendants, setting up as a defence, that at the time of the making of such bond for title, which she signed, she was a joint owner of the land described therein, as her separate property, and was then, and still continued, a married woman, and had never acknowledged the execution thereof, in the manner required by law, in cases of sales of separate property by married women: Held, that she was estopped by her action in the County Court, and by the fact that she afterwards received the purchase money, from setting up any defect in the bond.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-7\">Where such sale is made, as aforesaid, on such petition and order of sale, and the entire tract, is sold to the highest bidder, notwithstanding it may have been advertised as containing a specific number of acres, and all parties may have adopted the idea, that the obligee of the bond had purchased but that number of acres, and the purchaser may have supposed she was purchasing no more; in the absence of iraud, concealment, or of proof that the purchaser had any better means of ascertaining the true number of acres included in the description contained in the bond, than any other person ; such purchaser acquired a good title to the whole, though the tract contained a a greater quantity of land than was supposed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-8\">It is a well settled principle, that where land is sold by metes and bounds, the recital of the number of acres is mere matter of description, and is not supposed to influence the contract of the parties ; inasmuch as men may easily err in their estimate of the number of acres, within certain lines, but cannot err as to where marks, or monuments, or natural objects, are on the earth\u2019s surface.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-9\">It is equally well settled, that courts of equity cannot relieve against a mistake, as to the number of acres contained in a tract or parcel of land, sold by metes and bounds, where there is no element of fraud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b142-10\">The purchaser, at such administrator\u2019s sale, would not be responsible to the obligors of such bond, for the payment of the value of the excess in the number of acres contained in such tract, over and above the amount supposed to have been contained therein by the obligee.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJ5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Error from Guadalupe.

Did Matthew Lindsay, during his lifetime, claim but \u201cseventeen hundred and eighty acres, under his contract with \u201cthe defendants? And do you believe, from the testimony, \u201cthat the plaintiff, Mrs. Dalton, was aware that he had claimed \u201cno more, at the date of her purchase at the probate sale?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-15\">Answer. \u201cHe did not, according to the testimony of Col.

And was Mrs. Virginia Dalton aware \u201cof said mistake, at the date of the purchase at probate sale?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">Answer. \u201cAll the parties to this cause were ignorant of the \u201ctrue quantity of land, contained in the limits laid down in the \u201c title bond, at the time of its execution. Mrs. Dalton believed, \u201cat the administrator\u2019s sale, that the tract-contained seventeen \u201chundred and eighty acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">\u201c8th. If the jury believe that a contract was made between \u201cLindsay and Mr. Rust, to change the survey, were Mrs. Stuart \u201cand Mrs. Rust parties to such change of contract, and which \u201c of them had knowledge of such contract, if either of them ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">Answer. \u201cIt is not our opinion, that either Mrs. Rust or Mrs. \u201c Stuart were acquainted with the change of survey by contract; \u201cbut that Mr. Rust was acquainted with the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">\u201c9th.

Lindsay, owner of the one-half of the tract sold; she was at \u201cthat time, and is yet, a married woman. Was not examined \u201capart from her husband,but affixed her signature to the bond?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-10\">\u201c10th. Is there any evidence that the defendants ever made \u201c any conveyance, in fee simple, to M. W.

Because the judgment of the court is contrary to the \u201claw and facts of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">\u201c 7th. Because the judgment ought to have been only in favor \u201cof the plaintiffs, for the land and the costs of the suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">It appeared from the record, that the court overruled the motions of both parties for new trials. (The motion of the plaintiff alone appeared in the transcript.) The plaintiffs prosecuted this writ of error. Assignments of error were filed by both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">The other facts of the case appear from the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b149-13\"><em>J.

W. Lindsay, deceased ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-14\">I. The defendants, of their own volition, came into the Probate Court, and set up that they had sold all the land, included in the boundaries set out in their bond, to Matthew W. Lindsay, deceased, and pray that it be sold to pay them the purchase money therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b149-15\">II. The Probate Court ordered a sale of the same land, described in the bond to Lindsay; not any other or different land, nor any greater or less quantity of land, but the same identical land, which defendants had petitioned to be sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>. III. The Probate Court confirmed the sale made by Greenwood, under that order, to Mrs. Lindsay, and directed him, as administrator, to convey the land by the description contained in the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">So far we have no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, as to what precise tract of land, both the defendants and the Probate Court intended to be sold. But if .there is any doubt or difficulty about the matter, at all, it must arise \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-6\">1. From the entry of the words, \u201cMrs. Lindsay, 1780 acres-\u201cof land, $2,700 00,\u201d made by the administator at the bottom of the sale bill of the law books, in connection with which the sale of the land is reported; or \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">2. From the words, \u201ca tract of land about 1780 acres, lying \u201cin Guadalupe county,\u201d &amp;c., which are contained in Greenwood\u2019s advertisement of the sale of the land; or \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">3. From the words, \u201csupposed to contain, by estimation,' \u201c seventeen hundred and- eighty acres,\u201d which, in the deed by Greenwood to Mrs. Lindsay, is added to the description of land contained in the bond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-9\">Flow, what is the true legal meaning and effect of these terms ? If they be mere surplusage, and wholly immaterial; or, if they be only words of description; and if it be the law, that the conveyance of a tract of land, by metes and bounds, or by other certain description, will control the quantity, although not correctly stated; then was not Mrs. Lindsay a purchaser of the land in gross, for a sum in gross ? and does she not take the tract by its boundaries, without any reference to the number of acres ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-10\">If the tract contains a greater quantity of acres than was estimated, and if the defendants had it fully in their power, to ascertain the exact quantity of acres; but choose rather to rely on an estimate of the quantity, and Mrs. Dalton has committed no fraud in the transaction, have the defendants any right to complain ? Can they compel her to pay for the excess ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-11\">Does she not rather take the whole tract, under her purchase, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>for the sum in gross which she has paid ? How stands the law in this matter ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abk\">Chancellor Kent, in his Commentaries, vol. 4, pages 467-8, says, \u201cThe mention of the quantity of acres, after a description-\u201cof the subject by metes and bounds, or by other known spc- \u201c cification, is but matter of description, and does not amount to \u201cany covenant, or afford ground for the breach of any of the \u201cusual covenants, although the quantity of acres should fall \u201cshort of the given amount. Whenever it appears, by different \u201c boundaries, or by words of qualification, as, more or less, or as, \u201c containing by estimation, or the like, that the statement of the \u201cquantity of acres is mere matter of description, and is not of \u201cthe essence of the contract, the buyer takes the risk of the \u25a0\u201cquantity, if there be no intermixture of fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-7\">In the case of Mann v.

The same doctrine has been hold by the other States of the Union, where they have been called upon to decide it, without a single case of dissent, so far as I have been able to find. (Jolliffe v. Hite, 1 Call\u2019s Rep. 301; Grantland v. Wight, 2 Munf. Rep. 179; Jackson v. Moore, 6 Cow. Rep. 706 ; and Allison v. Allison, 1 Yerg. Rep. 16.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-9\">The case of Powell v. Clark, 5 Mass. Rep. 355, was an action for covenant broken. The plaintiff declared upon a deed, by which the defendant had conveyed to him, two several tracts of land. Both tracts were described in the deed, by certain designations, and by motes and bounds ; and after this description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>one of the tracts, immediately followed the words \u201c containing \u201ctwenty-nine acres and twelve rods of ground;\u201d and immediately after the description of the other tract, followed the- words, \u201ccontaining six acres and one hundred and thirty rods of \u201cground;\u201d and claimed compensation for an alleged deficiency in the quantity of land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2v\">In delivering the opinion of the court, in that case, Ch. J. Parsons said, \u201cIf the boundaries of the tract here had included \u201cmore than the quantity expressed, yet all within those boun- \u201c daries, which the defendant had a right to convey, would have \u201c passed by the deed. So, if less was contained, the plaintiff \u201c has title only to what was in fact included. In his purchase, he \u201cmust therefore be considered as relying on the boundaries de\u201cscribed, and not on the contents mentioned.\u201d\u2014\u201cIn a convey- \u201c anee of land by deed, in which the land is certainly bounded, \u201cit is very immaterial whether any or what quantity is expressed; for the description by the boundaries is conclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-7\">In the case of Stebbins v. Eddy, 4 Mas. Rep. 414, it is held, that if land be sold by certain boundaries, or for so much, by the entire parcel, or by the lump, <em>per aversionem, </em>in the language of the civilians, as for a field inclosed, or an island in a river, which is a distinct and entire object, any surplus of land over the quantity specified, belongs to the vendee, and the price cannot be increased or diminished, on account of a disagreement in measure or quantity. Also, see Smith v. Ware, 13 Johns. Rep. 257. In this last case, the court say that, even an express promise to make compensation for a deficiency, in such a case, is void, for the want of consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-8\">In the case of Voorhees v. De Meyer, 2 Barb.

Now, it is true, as a general rule, that equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>will relieve against mistakes. But it is not against a wrong guess, or a careless supposition, that equity will relieve. Where all the essential facts of a case, may be easily ascertained by a party, if, instead of availing himself of the means of knowledge in his power, he chooses to act upon a guess, or supposition, he cannot afterwards be permitted to set up his wilful negligence or ignorance, and claim relief from the consequences of his acts, on the ground of mistake; the law favors the vigilant, but not those who slumber over, or act careless of, their rights. And it is not sufficient to entitle a party to relief, that the fact about which he was mistaken, is a material one; but it must be such an one, as he could not, by reasonable diligence, get a knowledge of, when put upon inquiry; for if, by such reasonable diligence, he could have obtained a true knowledge of the fact, equity will not relieve him; since that would be to encourage culpable negligence.

Scott, 2 Watts\u2019s Rep. 318.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-5\">Now, in this case, the parties committed no mistake in regard to the tract of land they desired to have sold. The jury have expressly found that their attorney did not commit any mistake, in the petition to the Probate Court, for the sale of the land, but that he petitioned for the sale of the identical land which they had instructed him to do; and that was, all the land contained within the boundaries described in their bond to Matthew W. Lindsay, deceased. Mrs. Lindsay became a purchaser of the land, on the faith of their own estimate; she is a purchaser in good faith, for a valuable consideration: and even admitting that the defendants acted under a misapprehension of their rights in the premises, still they would not be entitled to relief. (1 Mad. Ch. Rep. 62.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">Again, if it be a fact, that Mrs. Lindsay only bought 1780 acres of the land, then the defendants could not have sold her the surplus, over that amount, which is contained in the tract. Then, by what authority can the court assume to make a contract for the parties, to which neither have assented ? By the decree of the court, Mrs. Lindsay is compelled to take and pay for land which it is asserted she never bought, and the defendants are made to part with the title to land, winch it is also asserted they never sold. The hypothesis of the court, founded on the finding of the jury, is, that Mrs. Lindsay never bought, and the defendants never sold, more than 1780 acres of the tract. But, assuming that hypothesis to be true, do they not most clearly err <em>? </em>It is not competent for the court to make contracts for parties,\u2014it can only enforce such as the parties themselves have made; and if Mrs. Lindsay only bought 1780 acres, and the defendants only sold 1780 acres of the tract, then the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ment of the court ought to have been for the plaintiffs, for 1780 acres only, and for the costs of court. Either the finding of the jury is wrong, or the judgment of the court is wrong, <em>or else </em>both are wrong, and we insist it is the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-5\">We therefore conclude, that both the finding of the jury and the judgment of the court, are wrong; and if we are correct in that conclusion, the cause will be reversed and reformed, giving to the plaintiffs all the land included in the bond of the defendants to M. W. Lindsay, deceased, and the costs of suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">To the first and third assignments of error, made by the defendants, it is perhaps sufficient to say, they are estopped by their own acts. The maxim is, <em>allegans contraria non est audiendus. </em>It is the rule, both of law and equity, that a man shall not be permitted, himself, to substantiate a claim, or to enforce a defence, by reason of representations or acts which proceed from himself, but that every one is held to the consequences of his own acts. The defendants cannot be permitted to blow hot and cold; by obtaining a sale of the land, through the Probate Court, they impliedly declared to the world that, so far at least as they were concerned, a good title could be made to the purchaser under that order of sale. It was in fact their own title which they procured to be put up for sale; and to permit them to come in now, after they have received payment for the land, and successfully resist the purchaser\u2019s right to it, would, we think, be a palpable violation of the rule, that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong; and this never can be done while laws are administered by fixed rules, founded in the spirit of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-7\">If it was incompetent to pass the title out of Mrs. Rust, in this way, then their receipt of the purchase money, from a purchaser in good faith, and their present attempt to retain both the land and the money, is an act of venality, we feel sure no court can ever tolerate, or sanction with its approval.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-8\">But the statutory mode, by which married women may dispose of their separate property, is not the only one by which such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>a disposition may be made. (Womack v. Womack, 8 Tex. Rep. 397.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-5\">To the second assignment of error by the defendants, it is perhaps sufficient to say, that the finding of the jury has settled the fact, that Mrs. Lindsay bought by the western boundary line, as described in the bond of defendants to Matthew W. Lindsay, deceased; and there can he no pretense, that the finding of the jury, in that respect, is wrong. We conclude, therefore, that there is no error in the record, which affects the defendants adversely; that the errors on the record, are all against the interest of the plaintiffs; that the defendants have\u2019 no cause of complaint; and that the judgment of the District Court, cannot he affected by anything they have alleged against it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-6\"><em>W. E. Goodrich, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aae\">There is no error in the proceedings in the court below, of which the plaintiffs hate a right to complain. If there he any error in the decree of the court below, it is this,\u2014that the plaintiffs should have been dismissed, at their costs; or the land, as surveyed by Cummings, should only have been decreed them; or only one half of the land purchased, the interest of Caroline Stuart; Phoebe Rust never having conveyed her interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-7\">The administrator, Greenwood, under order of the Probate Court, conveyed a greater interest than he himself possessed. The defendants had only given their bond to make title, and Greenwood assumed to convey the fee. This contravenes the well established principle of law, \u201cthat no one can \u201cconvey a greater interest than he himself possesses.\u201d The Probate Court is not a court of equity jurisdiction, and consequently could not decree title to Yirginia Lindsay. The only tribunal, in which they could get relief, was the District Court; and before a decree should have been rendered for the plaintiffs, the balance of the purchase money due upon the land claimed, should have been tendered to the defendants. \u201cA party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>seeking equity must d\u00a9 equity,\u201d <em>'is </em>a well established rule is equity jurisprudence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-4\">The western line of the Cummings survey, should have been the western line of the land decreed to plaintiffs, if any should have been decreed to them. The jury find that this line was ccepted by Matthew W. Lindsay. The plaintiff, Virginia Dalton, could only have purchased the interest of M. W. Lindsay, which was sold by order of the Probate Court; and if this line was accepted by him, and binding upon him, it must also he binding upon the purchaser of his interest. \u201c A parol partition \u201cof land, is not obnoxious to our statute of frauds, hut is valid \u201cand binding.\u201d (Stuart v. Baker, 17 Tex. Rep. 417.) It is believed, that the settlement of a division line, would he as little obnoxious. The jury say, that they are not of the opinion, that either Mrs. Rust, or Mrs. Stuart, were acquainted with the change of survey; hut this avails the plaintiffs nothing, for it is held in the ease referred to, (Stuart v. Baker,) that the purchaser &lt;sf a married woman\u2019s interest in an estate, cannot object to a parol partition of a tract of land purchased, on the ground that she was not hound by such partition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">The third error assigned by defendants, is, that Phoebe Rust had never conveyed her interest in the land, in such a manner as to bind her; and, therefore, the decree for her half interest in it, was not sanctioned by law, she never having been examined privily and apart from her husband. (Hart. Dig. Art. 174.) Had Phoebe Rust\u2019s name not been joined with the other defendants in this suit, in the petition to the Probate Court for an order to sell the land, to enforee the vendor\u2019s lien, there\" could he uo possible question of her right to judgment under this plea. Nor does it admit of much doubt, as it is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-8\">The restriction upon the right of a married woman to dispose of her separate property, is for her benefit; otherwise, there might he danger that her act, in executing the conveyance, might not he voluntary, hut coerced by the husband. (Womack v. Womack, 8 Tex. Rep. 397.) What is there to take this case out of the operation of this rule? Nothing, save the sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>land, under the order of the Probate Court, upon the petition of this defendant, with others. This provision of our statutes, (Hart. Dig. Art. 174,) is certainly very lame, if the facts in \u25a0this case he sufficient to take it out of the operation of the rule. It is an every day occurrence, that suits are brought for married women, without their having any knowledge of the matter; the husbands alone having given the authority to the lawyers to institute suit. And if a judgment of this character he sufficient to estop a married woman from setting up a claim to land, in the conveyance of which, she has made no separate acknowledgment, the very object of the law\u2014her protection from the undue influence of the husband\u2014will he destroyed. Let a husband coerce his wife to sign a bond for title; the purchaser dies, and the husband employs a lawyer to bring suit for himself and wife, for the purchase moneys the land is sold by order of court; and the wife, having no knowledge of the matter, is divested of her estate, notwithstanding the law, .made for her benefit, requiring her separate acknowledgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-5\">In Rhea v.

Hays, 10 Tex. Rep. 130, our court has established an exception to this rule; hut it was done expressly in consequence of the desertion of the wife by the husband, he having been absent from her, from 1886 to 1841, the time of her executing the conveyance; the land conveyed, too, had been conveyed to her after her desertion by the husband. In Womack v. Womack, 8 Tex. Rep. 397, it is held, that the statute, which prescribes the mode of conveying the wife\u2019s separate property, does not expressly declare any other mode of conveyance to he absolutely void, hut it shows every equity to have been on the side of sustaining the conveyance. Perhaps no single exception to this rule can he found. In this case, however, every equity is in favor of the defendant, Phoebe Rust. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>She never acquiesced in the conveyance, but retained possession of the land. This is evidenced by the fact, that suit was instituted against her, by the plaintiffs, for the land in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">The jury find that only 1780 acres of land were sold; that Mrs. Dalton was aware, at the time of the sale of the land, that her former husband only claimed 1780 acres; that she only believed herself to be purchasing that amount of land; and that the defendants had only been paid for 1780 acres, or perhaps a fraction over; yet the plaintiffs now set up claim for 2159\u00a3 acres of land: so that, in point of equity, the claim of the plaintiffs does not commend itself to the conscience of the court. Had this appeal been prosecuted by the plaintiffs, the defendants would have remained perfectly satisfied with the decision of the court below, as it gave them their just rights, and no more, the two dollars per acre for the land claimed to have been purchased.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b159-6\">Bell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AUY\">On the trial of this cause in the court below, special issues wore submitted to the jury, and the court rendered its judgment upon the responses of the jury to the issues submitted to them.

The sixth and seventh errors assigned by the plaintiff, involve the whole merits of the case; and we do not think it necessary separately to consider all the errors assigned, inasmuch as the decision of the cause will turn upon a few general considerations presented by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">The record discloses the fact, that the defendants in error, Bust and wife, and Caroline Stuart, sold to one Matthew W. Lindsay, a tract of land, and executed bond for title to said Lindsay, who was the former husband of Yirginia Dalton, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of the plaintiffs. The title bond to Lindsay was executed in June, 1853. Lindsay paid a portion of the purchase money, and died some time in the year 1854. At the January term of the County Court, for the year 1855, Edwin Eust and his wife Phoebe, and Caroline Stuart, filed their petition in said court, representing that the estate of Lindsay was indebted to them for the balance of the purchase money of the land described in their bond. They made their bond to Lindsay a part of their petition, represented that they had sold to Lindsay the land described in the bond, and prayed that the same might be sold by the administrator, Greenwood, in satisfaction of their claim. They mentioned the land as containing about 1780 acres. The County Court ordered the administrator to sell the land. The administrator advertised the land, giving a general description of it, as situated on York\u2019s creek, about fifteen miles north of Seguin, and containing about seventeen hundred and eighty acres. In pursuance of the order of court, the administrator sold the land, and Mrs. Yirginia Dalton became the purchaser, for the round sum of twenty-seven hundred dollars, the land being offered in bulk by the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The administrator received the $2,700 from Mrs. Dalton, and paid off the claim of Eust and wife, and Caroline Stuart, out of the money. The administrator made due return of the sale to the County Court, and that court confirmed the sale, and ordered the administrator t8 make title to Mrs. Dalton, describing the land according to the bond of Eust and wife, and Caroline Stuart, to M. W. Lindsay. On the 30th of April, 1857, Mrs. Dalton, and her husband, E. II. Dalton, brought suit to recover the land, according to the description contained in the original title bond to Lindsay, and in the deed of the administrator, Greenwood, to Mrs. Yirginia Dalton. The defendants resisted the suit, on the ground that Phoebe Eust, the wife of Edwin Eust, had never acknowledged the execution of the title bond to Lindsay, in the manner required by law, in cases of sales of separate property by married women; and on the further ground, that, during Lindsay\u2019s lifetime, there had been a sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>vey of the land, to which he had assented, changing the boundaries from those contained in the bond. Defendants alleged that they never intended to ask the County Court for the sale of the land actually described in the bond, and that their attorney made a mistake in asking for the sale according to the bond. They alleged that Lindsay, in his lifetime, only claimed 1780 acres, according to a survey made by one J. W. Cummings; that the administrator, Greenwood, only sold, or intended to sell, 1780 acres; and that Mrs. Dalton supposed that she was purchasing only 1780 acres. There was evidence that, in Lindsay\u2019s lifetime, a survey was made by Cummings, though not in accordance with the bond, and at the request, and according to the instructions of Rust. Lindsay was not present when this survey was made. There was no proof that a plot of the survey, by Cummings, was ever exhibited to Lindsay; and there was no proof that Lindsay, and either of his vendors, had ever made any agreement, or had ever had any conversation, about the survey made by Cummings., One witness stated that he had been with Lindsay, on the principal line of the survey made by Cummings, had shown him where the line ran, and that Lindsay said he was satisfied with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">It is proper to state, also, that the original title bond, from the defendants to Lindsay, stipulated for the sale of the land described, at the price of two dollars per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The jury found, by their verdict, that the attorney of the defendants, Rust and wife, and Caroline Stuart, did not commit any mistake in asking the County Court for the sale of the land, according to the title bond. The jury found also, that the land, described in the bond, contained twenty-three hundred and ten and a half acres, less one hundred and fifty acres, known as the Ward survey, which had been excepted out of the sale, by the terms of the bond. They found the other principal facts as herein before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The court gave judgment for all the land described in the bond, less the Ward tract, in favor of Mrs. Dalton and her husband; and further judgment, that Mrs. Dalton and husband should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>pay to the defendants two dollars per acre, for the excess of the land over and above 1780 acres, which was ascertained to amount to the sum of nine hundred and fifty-six dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"AAB\">We are of opinion that there was error in the judgment, in requiring the plaintiffs to pay to the defendants the value of the excess of the land described in the bond, over and above 1780 acres, at the rate of two dollars per acre. Without inquiring into the sufficiency or competency of the evidence to establish the fact that Lindsay, in his lifetime, ever assented to any other boundaries than those contained in the bond, we think the defendants are estopped, by their own acts, from asserting any claim against the plaintiffs for any portion of the land described in the bond. The defendants themselves asserted in the County Court, that they had sold the land described in the bond, to Lindsay. They procured the sale of the same land by the administrator, Greenwood, and received payment out of the money paid by Mrs. Dalton for the land. The whole controversy relative to the number of acres contained in the description given in the bond, seems to have arisen subsequent to the administrator\u2019s sale. There is no pretence of any fraud or concealment on the part of Mrs. Dalton, or that she- had any better means of ascertaining how many acres of land were included in the description contained in the bond, than the defendants, or any other person, had. All parties seem to have adopted the idea, that Lindsay had purchased 1780 acres of land, and that his administrator sold 1780 acres. It is a well settled principle, that where land is sold by metes and bounds, the recital of the number of acres is mere matter of description, and is not supposed to influence the contract of the parties ; inasmuch as men may easily err in the irestimate of the number of. acres within certain lines, but cannot err as to where marks or monuments, or natural objects, are on the earth\u2019s surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It is also equally well settled, that courts of equity cannot relieve against a mistake as to the number of acres contained in a tract or parcel of land, sold by metes and bounds, where there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>is no element of fraud. (1 Story\u2019s Eq.
