B. Jones, and the plaintiff to pay the \u201ccosts of suit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>'The petition for certiorari alleged, that the plaintiff moved for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the law and evidence; which motion was overruled by the justice. The petition also alleged, \u201cthat said verdict \u201cwas manifestly contrary to law; in that, it, gave judgment \u201cfor the plaintiff for $20, and yet taxed him with the costs of \u201csuit.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">The appellee brought the case to the District Court, by certiorari.

The petition for certiorari was properly sustained. It was not necessary to incumber the record with all the testimony. The verdict of the jury, finding for plaintiff twenty dollars, and yet taxing him with costs, was contrary to law, and sufficient, <em>prim\u00e1 facie, </em>to sustain the petition, on motion to quash; which admits the truth of the matters set up in petition. (Crawford v. Crain, 19 Tex. Rep. 145; McKensie v. Pitner, Id. 135.) It was the intention of petitioner to give, in substance, all the facts in evidence, from which it appeared that injustice was done him before the justice. This is sufficient. (King v. Longcope, 7 Tex. Rep. 236; Hooks v. Lewis, 16 Id. 551; Connally v. Renn, 17 Id. 125.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-9\">2d. The <em>transcript of the </em>court below shows no legal tender ' was made. Defendant ruled plaintiff for costs, but on trial, after plea in reconvention, he brought twenty dollars into court, and submitted it to the jury to say, whether plaintiff was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>titled to it or not. A tender to save costs must be absolute; not conditional. (Brock v. Jones, 16 Tex. Rep. 461.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-5\">Bell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxM\">The error relied on is, that the District Court erred in overruling the motion to dismiss the petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">A petition for certiorari, ordinarily, should state substantially the whole of the evidence introduced on the trial before the justice of the peace, so that the district judge, to whom the application for certiorari is presented, may see the whole case, as it was developed before the inferior court. The petition, in the present case, does not purport to state the whole of the evidence on the trial before the Justice\u2019s Court. It does not state what evidence was introduced by the defendant; nor does it state that the defendant introduced no evidence before the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">This petition would therefore be insufficient, but for the fact that it contains the averment, that the justice rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, for a portion of his demand, and at the same, time rendered judgment in favor of the defendant for the costs. This judgment would not be authorized, but in the single case of a tender, made before the institution of suit, and the payment of the money into court. The transcript from the Justice\u2019s Court, which was before the District Court, when the motion to dismiss the petition for certiorari was made, did not disclose the fact, that the defendant had made a tender, before the institution of suit by the plaintiff, and had paid the money into court. The transcript from the Justice\u2019s Court, therefore, did not afford any explanation of the judgment rendered by the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The District Court will always look to the transcript from the Justice\u2019s Court, when considering a motion to dismiss a petition for certiorari. (Aycock v. Williams, 18 Tex. Rep. 393; Spivy v. Latham, 8 Humph. Rep. 703; Edde v. Cowan, 1 Sneed\u2019s Rep. 290; Crawford v. Crain, 19 Tex. Rep. 145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">This petition, then, presented to the District Court the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>of a judgment necessarily erroneous, except upon the supposition that there had been a tender, before the institution of suit, and the payment of the money into the Justice\u2019s Court, at least before verdict. The question of the sufficiency of the petition for certiorari, is, therefore, narrowed down to the single question, whether or not the petitioner ought to have stated that there had been no tender, before institution of suit, &amp;c. We do not think such strictness ought to be required. In the case of McKensie v. Pitner, 19 Tex. Rep. 135, this court said, <em>\u201c </em>There should be a reasonable degree of certainty in a petition \u201cfor certiorari, but not that extreme degree, which is described \u201cin law as certainty to a certain intent in every particular, \u201cand which rebuts every conclusion to the contrary.\u201d In the case of King v. Longcope, 7 Tex. Rep. 236, it was said, that \u201ca certiorari ought to be granted, where, from the averments \u201cof the petition, if true, it appears that the party has merits, \u201cand there is reason to apprehend that injustice may have been \u201cdone him, without any fault of his.\u201d The same was said, in the case of Hooks v. Lewis, 16 Tex. Rep. 551, and in Connally v. Renn, 17 Id. 123. Tested by these rules, we think the petition for certiorari, in this case, was sufficient; and that the court did not err in overruling the motion to dismiss it. Another consideration is, that the trial, in the District Court, seems very clearly to have attained the ends of justice. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
