The petition for the writ alleged in effect that the petitioner was a citizen and tax-payer residing in the county on the line of the highway, and that he, in common with the citizens generally who live along the highway, would be damaged by reason of the maintenance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>railroad. The court issued the writ, whereupon the respondent made a motion to quash it, on the ground that the affidavit for the writ was not made by a party beneficially interested. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-4\"><em>A. L.

It does not appear that the application for the writ was made on the affidavit of <em>the party beneficially interested. </em>The Code requires that \u201cthe application must be made on affidavit by the person beneficially interested. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1069.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">It does not appear by the petition in this case that the petitioner has any other or greater right in the public highway mentioned therein than any other citizen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>of the state. The requirement that the application must be made by \u201cthe party beneficially interested\u201d has been construed to mean \u201cthat in an application made by a private party, his interest must be of a nature which is distinguishable from that of the mass of the community. <em>(Linden </em>v. <em>Alameda Co., </em>45 Cal. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Writ quashed and proceeding dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Myrick, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
