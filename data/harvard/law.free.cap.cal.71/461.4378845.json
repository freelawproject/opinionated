On the 5th of February, 1884, the attorney for the plaintiff wrote a letter to one of the officers of the defendant, in which the time to answer was extended to the 11th of February. On the 9th of the same month, the attorney of the defendant, by an indorsement on the back of the letter, again extended the time to answer to and including the 17th of February, which was Sunday. This letter the defendant neglected to file. On the 18th of February the default of the defendant was entered, and a judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff. On tibe same day the defendant made a motion to set aside the default and judgment, based upon affidavits of merit setting forth the foregoing facte, and upon the hearing of the motion asked permission to file an answer. The court denied the motion. <em>Held, </em>that the ruling of the court was an abuse of discretion, notwithstanding the stipulation extending the time to answer was not filed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b491-5\">Id. \u2014 Stipulation Extending Time to Answer\u2014Last Day Falling on Sunday. \u2014 A stipulation extending the time within which to answer to and including a specified day which falls on Sunday entitles the defendant to answer at any time during the succeeding Monday.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County, and from an order refusing to vacate the judgment and set aside a default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">The facts are- stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-8\"><em>Chickering &amp; Thomas, and Warren Olney, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-9\">The court abused its discretion in denying the motion. <em>(Watson </em>v. <em>S.

The vice-president of the said defendant has fully and fairly stated to me the facts of the said case, and I have advised him, and believe, that said defendant has a good defense thereto, on the merits. We were retained in the case on the 15th of February, 1884. As there was but little time to prepare the papers, I at once prepared a stipulation, allowing us a few more days within which to answer, and sent it to Oakland by B. Noyes, Esq., a member of the bar employed in our office, requesting him to see one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and ask for such time. I am informed by said Noyes, and therefore believe, that he called at the office of said plaintiff\u2019s attorneys on the afternoon of the 16th inst., but could not find said attorneys, both of them being absent; that said Noyes believed and understood that defendant\u2019s time to answer did not expire until the close of the eighteenth day of February, 1884. I have always understood the terms of the stipulation set out in the affidavit of Francis Cutting, filed herewith, to give the whole of the succeeding day, when the last day expressed therein falls on a Sunday, and such, I am informed, is the general belief of the members of the bar of this city and county.

D. Cutler is an employee of said corporation, and was such employee on February 5, 1884; that on said last date, George W.

Proc., secs. 10, 12,13), since the seventeenth day of February, 1884, fell on Sunday, which was a holiday, and that which was fixed in the stipulation to be performed on that day (viz., the filing of the answer) could have been done on the next day, which was Monday, the eighteenth day of February, 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">It was not filed or entered, and was not, therefore, legally binding upon the trial court. Nevertheless, the parties defendant seem to have relied upon it in good faith as a stipulation, which gave them the right to answer the complaint on the said eighteenth day of February. .</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">They appeared at once in court on the same day that default was taken, and offered to file an answer then and there if permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Under all the circumstances of this case, it would seem that it was one in which a wise discretion might have been exercised in granting the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Therefore, we think that the judgment and order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>should be reversed, and the defendant given a reasonable time in which to answer the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Belcher, C. C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b496-5\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ApY\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment and order are reversed, and cause remanded, with leave to defendant to answer within a reasonable time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
