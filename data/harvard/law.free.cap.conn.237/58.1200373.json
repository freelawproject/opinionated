Zaporta, was convicted after a jury trial of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. He appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaporta, </em>36 Conn. App. 250, 650 A.2d 582 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: (1) whether the Appellate Court properly upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the defendant to depose a witness pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 791 (3);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) if the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ruling was improper, whether the error was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaporta, </em>232 Conn. 906, 653 A.2d 194 (1995). Although we conclude that the Appellate Court adopted an unduly stringent standard for determining whether the judicial authority in a criminal case should order the appearance and deposition of a prospective witness prior to trial because of that witness\u2019 potential unavailability at trial, we nevertheless affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The essential facts underlying the jury\u2019s verdict are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn the night of August 30, 1991, the victim, Ricardo Figueroa, and his girlfriend, Frances Carrasquillo, stood outdoors [on the steps of the residence at 200 South Marshall Street in Hartford] talking with several people. The area was illuminated primarily by streetlights. Around 11 p.m., the defendant, with his hands in his pockets, swiftly approached the victim. When the defendant was about three feet away from the victim, he pulled out a gun and shot the victim in the head and the leg. The victim died as a result of his injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaporta, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 251. On the basis of information provided to the police by three eyewitnesses to the crime, Vannon Shelton, Jessica Luna and Reggie Thomas, each of whom identified the defendant as the shooter, the defendant was arrested and charged with murder. The defendant was convicted as charged and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sentenced to a term of imprisonment of thirty-three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court had improperly denied his motion to depose Carrasquillo, a witness to the shooting, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 791 (3). The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention, concluding that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion because \u201c[t]he reasons provided by the [defendant for the deposition] were not sufficient to demonstrate any likelihood that Carrasquillo would be unable to testify at trial.\u201d Id., 257. The Appellate Court further concluded that \u00a7 791 (3) \u201crequires the moving party to convince the court that the witness will be unable to testify at trial. The section does not require absolute certainty, but it requires a strong likelihood that the witness will be unable to testify. . . . The trial court must look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the moving party has met its burden.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">On appeal to this court, the defendant claims, first, that the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d standard adopted by the Appellate Court is unreasonably exacting and, second, that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to depose Carrasquillo constituted an abuse of discretion. We agree with the defendant that the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d test enunciated by the Appellate Court is too stringent. We need not determine whether the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 791 (3) motion, however, because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant his request to depose Carrasquillo was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the certified issues. \u201cShortly after the murder, the police interviewed Carrasquillo, showing her three arrays of photographs, including one that contained a [photograph] of the defendant. When Carras<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>quillo saw the defendant\u2019s photograph, she paused for a second or two before moving on to the next photograph. Carrasquillo did not identify the defendant, or anyone else, as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cAt the time of the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing in October and November, 1991, Carrasquillo had moved from where she lived at the time of the shooting to a different location in Hartford. Although the state had difficulty locating her, the defendant, with the help of a private investigator, was able to discover Carrasquillo\u2019s whereabouts. Carrasquillo voluntarily attended the probable cause hearing. Because the trial court determined that her proposed testimony concerning her failure to identify a photograph of the defendant as the assailant would not be sufficient to rebut probable cause, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request to call Carrasquillo as a witness at the probable cause hearing in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u201c[On] December [18,] 1991, the defendant filed a motion to preserve testimony of a material witness by means of a deposition. The defendant claimed that it was necessary to depose Carrasquillo because (1) she was a material witness who [had] failed to identify the defendant\u2019s [photograph] as the assailant\u2019s in a photographic array shown to her by the police and who, at the probable cause hearing, [had] told the defendant\u2019s counsel that the defendant was not the man who had shot the victim, (2) at the time of the probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>hearing the state had difficulty locating her, (3) the defense found it necessary to hire a private investigator to locate her for the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing, (4) she was a nervous fifteen year old, (5) she was two years older than the state\u2019s witnesses, (6) one state\u2019s witness had to be summoned by capias to appear at the probable cause hearing, (7) it was difficult to predict when the trial would take place, (8) it was generally difficult to find witnesses for this trial, and (9) unlike the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses, there was no opportunity to preserve her testimony at the probable cause hearing.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Zaporta, supra, 36 Conn. App. 252-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to depose Carrasquillo, concluding that the defendant had not produced evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that Carrasquillo would be unavailable to testify at trial. In denying the motion, the trial court noted that the defendant\u2019s concerns regarding Carrasquillo\u2019s availability for trial \u201ccould be applied to every witness in a murder case and could turn every criminal trial into a series of minitrials.\u201d Id., 253. The trial court, however, expressed its willingness to reconsider its ruling if the defendant were able to provide additional support for his claim that Carrasquillo would be unavailable at the time of trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u201cThe trial took place almost a year after the motion to preserve testimony was filed. Carrasquillo did not testify. The state and the defendant stipulated to certain facts concerning Carrasquillo, which were reported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the jury. These were the detailed description of the assailant that Carrasquillo had provided to the police, and the facts that she did not know the defendant before the shooting, that a failed attempt to issue a subpoena to her had been made on the day before trial, that at the time of trial her whereabouts were unknown, and that neither the state nor the defendant was capable of producing her for trial. Further, the court gave the defendant leeway in questioning a police witness about Carrasquillo\u2019s statements and the state discussed in its closing argument Carrasquillo\u2019s failure to select the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array.\u201d Id., 253-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We first turn to the defendant\u2019s claim regarding his burden of presenting sufficient evidence to satisfy the unavailability requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 791 (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the party seeking to invoke \u00a7 791 (3) to preserve testimony must establish to the trial court\u2019s satisfaction that it is more likely than not that the witness will be unavailable at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">At common law, a party in a criminal case had no right to depose a prospective witness, even upon proof that the witness was not likely to be available for trial. See, e.g., <em>Minder </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>183 U.S. 559, 562, 22 S. Ct. 224, 46 L. Ed. 328 (1902); <em>State ex rel. Hanagan </em>v. <em>Armijo, </em>72 N.M. 50, 53, 380 P.2d 196 (1963); <em>Westry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 508, 512, 144 S.E.2d 427 (1965). A majority of states, however, has promulgated statutes or rules providing for depositions in criminal cases upon a showing by the moving party that the deposition is necessary to preserve the testimony of a material wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>ness who will be unavailable at the time of trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In Connecticut, \u00a7 791 (3) authorizes the judicial authority, upon request of any party in a felony case, to \u201cissue a subpoena for the appearance of any person at a designated time and place to give his or her deposition if such person\u2019s testimony may be required at trial and it appears to the judicial authority that such person . . . [w]ill ... be unable to be present to testily at any trial or hearing.\u201d The issue before us is what standard of proof the moving party must satisfy to establish for purposes of \u00a7 791 (3) that the witness \u201c[w]ill ... be unable to be present to testily\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The defendant asserts that the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d standard adopted by the Appellate Court places too great a burden on the party seeking to depose a witness under \u00a7 791 (3) because, as a practical matter, it would preclude the preservation of testimony in many cases in which the moving party has reasonable grounds to believe that the witness will not appear at trial. The defendant further argues that because deposition testimony is not admissible in lieu of live testimony unless, at the time of trial, the moving party is able to establish that the witness is, in fact, unavailable, it is appropriate to set a less stringent standard for allowing depositions under \u00a7 791 (3) than that adopted by the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant urges a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>of \u00a7 791 (3) that would allow a party to depose a material witness upon a showing of a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the witness will be unavailable to testify at trial. The state, on the other hand, maintains that any standard other than the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d test adopted by the Appellate Court would permit a defendant to use \u00a7 791 (3) as a discovery tool,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which, the state claims, would add to the length and cost of pretrial proceedings and result in the harassment of prospective witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Both parties raise important policy considerations. As the defendant points out, \u201c \u2018[i]t would be unreasonable and undesirable to require [the moving party] to assert with certainty that a witness will be unavailable for trial months ahead of time, simply to obtain authorization to take his deposition.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drogoul, </em>1 F.3d 1546, 1553 (11th Cir. 1993), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sines, </em>761 F.2d 1434, 1439 (9th Cir. 1985). Indeed, \u201cthe denial of a deposition may lead to the denial altogether of the testimony of a material witness, [which results in] a limitation on the trial\u2019s truthfinding function . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ismaili, </em>828 F.2d 153, 170 (3d Cir. 1987) (Becker, J., concurring and dissenting). We also recognize, however, the legitimacy of the state\u2019s concern that \u201c[a]llowing depositions too freely would create the [risk] that parties would seek to use depositions as a discovery device in criminal cases . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>590 F.2d 361, 365 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>In re United States, </em>348 F.2d 624, 625 (1st Cir. 1965). This concern, moreover, is not totally alleviated by the fact that the prospective witness\u2019 deposition testimony is not admissible at trial unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>moving party can also demonstrate that he or she cannot secure the witness\u2019 trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We are persuaded that a standard requiring the moving party to establish that it is more likely than not that the prospective witness will be unavailable at the time of trial strikes an appropriate balance between these competing considerations. This standard is not unduly burdensome because it does not require the moving party to demonstrate with certainty that the witness will be unavailable to testify at the time of trial. \u201cWhen a prospective witness is unlikely to appear at trial and his or her testimony is critical to the case, simple fairness requires permitting the moving party to preserve that testimony .... In that situation, justice usually will be served by allowing the moving party to take the deposition, thereby preserving the party\u2019s ability to utilize the testimony at trial, if necessary.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drogoul, </em>supra, 1 F.3d 1552-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">A less stringent test, however, would be incompatible with the mandate of \u00a7 791 (3) that the party seeking to take a deposition thereunder demonstrate that the witness \u201c[w]ill ... be unable to be present to testify at any trial or hearing.\u201d Moreover, because the moving party will be required to make a showing sufficient to establish that the witness is unlikely to be available at the time of trial, we are confident that trial courts will be able to ferret out any improper attempts to transform \u00a7 791 (3) into a tool for pretrial discovery. Accordingly, we conclude that a party seeking to depose a prospective witness under \u00a7 791 (3) must adduce evidence sufficient to satisfy the trial court that, in light of all of the relevant circumstances, it is more probable than not that the witness will not be available at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to depose Carrasquillo constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>abuse of discretion entitling him to a new trial. The defendant also asserts that the trial court\u2019s alleged impropriety was so harmful that it deprived him of his constitutional right to present a defense. We need not reach the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his request pursuant to \u00a7 791 (3) because we conclude that the defendant suffered no harm as a result of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">As previously noted, the defendant and the state entered into two stipulations regarding Carrasquillo, each of which was read to the jury. The first stipulation provided in relevant part that Carrasquillo had told Hartford police detective James Rovella that \u201cthe assailant, or the assailing person, was a Hispanic male, five foot nine to five foot eleven inches, thin build, long black curly hair, mustache, beard, in his thirties, [who] wore a black baseball cap, white tee shirt, black nylon jacket, black jeans, and black sneakers.\u201d The second stipulation provided that Carrasquillo \u201cdid not know [the defendant] either before or after the incident. . . . [D] espite the issuance of subpoenas to produce her whereabouts here at trial . . . [Carrasquillo\u2019s] present whereabouts are unknown, and . . . both sides have been incapable of producing her physical appearance.\u201d In addition, Rovella testified that Carrasquillo had viewed a photographic array that included a photograph of the defendant, and that she had been unable to iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tify any of the photographs as that of the shooter. Rovella also testified that Carrasquillo had told him that she had gotten a good look at the shooter as he approached and shot the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Furthermore, the state, during closing argument, reviewed the stipulations and Rovella\u2019s account of his interview with Carrasquillo and expressly acknowledged that Carrasquillo had \u201cin no uncertain words [stated] that she did not see or recognize the man who shot [the victim] in . . . [the photographic] array [shown to her by the police].\u201d The defendant, in his closing argument, emphasized the importance of the stipulations: the fact that the perpetrator\u2019s identity was the key issue in the case; Carrasquillo\u2019s description of the shooter; and Carrasquillo\u2019s failure to select the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The defendant contends that this evidence did not eliminate the harm that, he asserts, resulted from the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to depose Carrasquillo. In support of this contention, he maintains, first, that the jury might have found Carrasquillo\u2019s deposition testimony more credible or more persuasive than the statements contained in the stipulations. The defendant, however, has provided nothing to substantiate this assertion, and we are not aware of anything in the record to support it. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The defendant further argues that the stipulations were not an adequate substitute for the testimony that he claims he would have elicited from Carrasquillo had he been permitted to depose her. Specifically, the defendant points to Carrasquillo\u2019s statement to defense counsel, allegedly made after she had observed the defendant in court on the day of the probable cause hearing, that the defendant was not the shooter. There is no indication in the record, however, that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>sought to obtain the state\u2019s agreement to stipulate to this alleged statement by Carrasquillo. Furthermore, the defendant did not raise a claim in the trial court that the stipulation was in any way incomplete or inadequate. Indeed, as far as can be gleaned from the record, the state agreed to stipulate to everything to which the defendant asked it to stipulate. Having failed to request that the state agree to the admission into evidence of Carrasquillo\u2019s alleged statement to defense counsel, the defendant cannot now be heard to complain that the stipulations were insufficient. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he was harmed by the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to depose Carrasquillo under \u00a7 791 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">In this opinion PETERS, C. J., and CALLAHAN and BORDEN, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 791 provides: \u201cIn any case involving an offense for which the punishment may be imprisonment for more than one year, the judicial authority, upon request of any party, may issue a subpoena for the appearance of any person at a designated time and place to give his or her deposition if such person\u2019s testimony may be required at trial and it appears to the judicial authority that such person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-10\">\u201c(1) Will, because of physical or mental illness or infirmity, be unable to be present to testify at any trial or hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnU\">\u201c(2) Resides outside of this state, and his presence cannot be compelled under the provisions of Gen.

As the Appellate Court noted, \u201c[o]ne month earlier, the defendant, the victim, and a third person, Raymond Zukowski, had engaged in a fight outside the defendant\u2019s house. During this altercation, the defendant sliced Zukowski\u2019s temple with a knife. The victim and Zukowski retaliated by beating the defendant with golf clubs. As a result of this beating, the defendant was taken to the hospital. The defendant threatened to avenge his injuries.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zaporta, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 251-52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Unless waived by the accused person or extended by the court for good cause shown, such [probable cause] hearing shall be conducted within sixty days of the filing of the complaint or information in superior court. ... At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, if the court finds that, based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, probable cause exists, the accused person may make a specific offer of proof, including the names of witnesses who would testify or produce the evidence offered.

If a witness is detained pursuant to section 3144 of title 18, United States Code, the courl on written motion of the witness and upon notice to the parties may direct that the witness\u2019 deposition be taken.

In this case, however, the state and the defendant stipulated to the facts to which Carrasquillo would have testified. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit the defendant to depose Carrasquillo, even if wrongful, did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Because we find that any error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion was nonconstitutional in nature, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the harmfulness of the court\u2019s alleged error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkes, </em>236 Conn. 176, 188, 671 A.2d 1296 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b90-8\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARY\">concurring.

For the sake of providing guidance to our trial courts, I believe it is important to apply that standard to the facts before us today. In this case, I would conclude that it was \u201cmore likely than not that [Frances Carrasquillo would] be unavailable at the time of trial.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to depose Carrasquillo. I also conclude, however, that that denial was harmless error for the reasons set forth in the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
