Fuessenich, constituted a final judgment for purposes of appeal. During the pendency of the criminal prosecution, the plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against the defendant<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for causing the death of James B. Irwin, Jr. (decedent), by shooting him with a .357 caliber magnum revolver. Subsequently, the defendant was acquitted by a jury of murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree after the jury found that the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had not acted in self-defense. The defendant thereafter pleaded guilty to three related counts of tampering with physical evidence. The plaintiffs then filed a petition for the disclosure and release of the records pertaining to the defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution and trial. The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition. The plaintiffs appealed from the decision of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We conclude that the decision of the trial court is not a final judgment and, therefore, dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The following facts are undisputed. On June 19, 1991, the defendant was arrested and charged with the murder of the decedent in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. At the defendant\u2019s first criminal trial in 1992, the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the trial court declared a mistrial, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Thereafter, in a substitute information, the state refiled the murder charge against the defendant and filed five additional charges of tampering with physical evidence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-155 (a). Prior to the defendant\u2019s second criminal trial, he filed a motion to sever the murder count from the five counts of tampering with physical evidence. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion and he proceeded to trial only on the charge of murder. Following the defendant\u2019s second trial in 1995, the jury found him not guilty of murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. Shortly thereafter, the defendant pleaded guilty to three counts of tampering with physical evidence, and, in return, the state entered a nolle prosequi on the remaining two tampering counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In March, 1993, during the pendency of the criminal prosecution, the plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action against the defendant, seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorney\u2019s fees. In their action, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant had intentionally assaulted the decedent, had engaged in reckless and/or negligent conduct that had resulted in the decedent\u2019s death and thereby had caused the decedent\u2019s parents and son to suffer damages. Prior to the trial in their wrongful death action and following the resolution of the criminal charges pending against the defendant, the plaintiffs filed a petition for the disclosure and release of all criminal records pertaining to the defendant\u2019s prosecution and trial for murder. Their petition requested the disclosure of the entire record of <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuessenich, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Litchfield, Docket No. CR91-0073111, \u201cincluding the trial transcript and all police and prosecutorial authority investigative materials prepared in the criminal mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ter.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 petition and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">As a general matter, if a defendant is found not guilty of a particular criminal charge or the charge against him is dismissed, General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (a) requires that \u201call police and court records and records of any state\u2019s attorney pertaining to such charge shall be erased upon the expiration of the time to file a writ of error or take an appeal . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To give effect to this provision, \u00a7 54-142a (e) prohibits any person charged with the retention of the erased records from disclosing any information contained in such records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tiffs claimed, however, that they were entitled to the requested records because: (1) subsection (g) of \u00a7 54-142a is an exception to subsection (a) that prevents the erasure of records relating to a criminal prosecution if a defendant is found guilty under one count of an information or indictment and the state has entered a nolle prosequi to the remaining counts; (2) General Statutes \u00a7 54-142c (b) permits disclosure to the plaintiff administrator, the decedent\u2019s legal representative, who has established that a civil action has been filed; and (3) General Statutes \u00a7 51-61 (c) permits disclosure of the records to any person who requests such records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court disagreed with the plaintiffs and denied their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>On appeal, the defendant argues that, in view of the fact that a final judgment has not yet been rendered in the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death action, the trial court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiffs\u2019 petition is an interlocutory order and, as such, does not satisfy the test permitting the appeal of such orders set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31-34, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). We agree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that, except insofar as the constitution bestows upon this court jurisdiction to hear certain cases; see <em>Fonfara </em>v. <em>Reapportionment Commission, </em>222 Conn. 166, 610 A.2d 153 (1992); the subject matter jurisdiction of the Appellate Court and of this court is governed by statute. <em>Grieco </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>226 Conn. 230, 231, 627 A.2d 432 (1993). It is equally axiomatic that, except insofar as the legislature has specifically provided for an interlocutory appeal or other form of interlocutory appellate review; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>(prejudgment remedies); General Statutes \u00a7 54-63g (petition for review of bail); General Statutes \u00a7 51-164x (court closure orders); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 340, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992); [our] appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7 52-263;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>[supra, 191 Conn. 30]; <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>230 Conn. 441, 447, 645 A.2d 978 (1994). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u201cWe have recognized, however, in both criminal and civil cases, that certain otherwise interlocutory orders may be final judgments for appeal purposes. . . . An otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, [191 Conn.] 31, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 99, 425 A.2d 574 (1979). <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>[191 Conn. 506, 509-10, 467 A.2d 920 (1983)]. Unless the appeal is authorized under the <em>Curcio </em>criteria, absence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that [necessarily] results in a dismissal of the appeal. <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 283, 355 A.2d 255 (1974). <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>210 Conn. 110, 119, 554 A.2d 702 (1989).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>233 Conn. 44, 62-65, 658 A.2d 947 (1995), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 671, 669 A.2d 573 (1996). We conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal does not satisfy either prong of <em>Curcio. </em>We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition did not terminate a proceeding that was separate and distinct from the plaintiffs\u2019 civil action. The petition for the release and disclosure of the records pertaining to the defendant\u2019s criminal prosecution was filed as part of the plaintiffs\u2019 civil wrongful death action and was an attempt by the plaintiffs to secure disclosure of information that would assist them in the preparation and prosecution of that action. A party to a pending case does not institute a separate and distinct proceeding merely by filing a petition for discovery or other relief that will be helpful in the preparation and prosecution of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 65 (trial court order granting motion to permit forced medication of criminal defendant does not terminate proceeding separate and distinct from criminal trial itself); <em>Ackerson </em>v. <em>Stramaglia, </em>225 Conn. 102, 104-105, 621 A.2d 1315 (1993) (denial of motion to dissolve judgment lien does not terminate separate and distinct proceeding); <em>Success Centers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Huntington Learning Centers, Inc., </em>223 Conn. 761, 770-71, 613 A.2d 1320 (1992) (interlocutory order compelling arbitration as required by franchise agreement between parties does not terminate separate and distinct proceeding); <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 Conn. 252, 254, 520 A.2d 605 (1987) (trial court order that defendant produce its claim file for inspection by plaintiff does not terminate proceeding separate and distinct from pending suit). Here, the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery petition was filed solely in aid of their pending wrongful death action against the defendant and the trial court\u2019s decision denying that petition was rendered in the context of that action and did not terminate that action. The trial court\u2019s decision, therefore, does not meet the first prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test permitting the appeal of interlocutory trial court orders. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendant also correctly argues that the trial court\u2019s order is not appealable under <em>Curdo </em>because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>it does not \u201cso conclude the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d Id., 33. \u201cThe second test for finality . . . focuses not on the proceedings involved, but on the potential harm to the appellant\u2019s rights. [An interlocutory order] will be deemed final for purposes of appeal only if it involves a claimed right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 33-34. The second prong of <em>Curdo </em>requires, therefore, the plaintiffs to prove that the trial court\u2019s order threatens the preservation of a right already secured to them and that that right will be irretrievably lost and the plaintiffs irreparably harmed unless they may immediately appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 65-66; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>202 Conn. 86, 90-92, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 92-93. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiffs\u2019 petition can adequately be reviewed after a trial on the merits without causing irretrievable loss or irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that the denial of the plaintiffs\u2019 petition did not foreclose their wrongful death action, but merely limited their ability to present relevant and probative evidence. The trial court\u2019s decision, therefore, does not prevent the plaintiffs from pursuing their action against the defendant. The plaintiffs\u2019 petition was, for all intents and purposes, merely a discovery motion, the denial of which did not cause the plaintiffs to suffer an irretrievable loss of a right or an irreparable harm, and which can be rectified on appeal after a final judgment on the merits of the wrongful death action if it is incorrect. <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 255-58; <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 92; <em>Barboto </em>v. <em>J. &amp; M. Corp., </em>194 Conn. 245, 249-50, 478 A.2d 1020 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Our review of the record and of counsel\u2019s oral argument reveals that, although the records sought by the plaintiffs have been erased pursuant to \u00a7 54-142a, they have not been physically destroyed, nor has the defendant made a request for their physical destruction. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 185, 438 A.2d 859 (1981) (for purposes of \u00a7 54-142a, \u201c[e]rasure alone does not mean the physical destruction of the documents\u201d). We have no reason to believe that the defendant will request physical destruction of the records sought by the plaintiffs or that such a request would be granted during the pendency of the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death action. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (e). Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs stated that the trial court had issued an order directing that any records relating to the criminal prosecution of the defendant not be destroyed. That order should remain in effect until the completion of a trial of the plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful death action and any subsequent appeal from a final judgment in that action. The plaintiffs\u2019 fear, therefore, that the sought after records might be physically destroyed is unsubstantiated and does not justify a deviation from our policy \u201cof minimizing interference with and delay in the resolution of trial court proceedings.\u201d <em>Madigan </em>v. Madigan, 224 Conn. 749, 752-53, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993); see <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> The plaintiffs in the wrongful death action are Joseph Ruggiero, the administrator of the estate of James B.

If such disclosure contains information from erased records, the identity of the defendant or defendants shall not be released, except that any information contained in such records, including the identity of the person charged may be released to the victim of the crime or his representative upon written application by such victim or representative to the court stating (1) that a civil action has been commenced for loss or damage resulting from such act or (2) the intent to bring a civil action for such loss or damage.

This argument is without merit. The plaintiffs were not parties to the criminal case and the trial court\u2019s order to incorporate the docket number from the defendant\u2019s criminal case into the caption of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended petition did not make the plaintiffs parties to the criminal action. The plaintiffs therefore do not have standing to appeal from any decision rendered in the criminal trial of the defendant. Moreover, the criminal case was terminated by a final judgment when the defendant was sentenced by the court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>202 Conn. 86, 89, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>198 Conn. 369, 374 n.5, 503 A.2d 557 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 682, 474 A.2d 760 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
