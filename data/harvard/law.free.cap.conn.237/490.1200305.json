On March 5,1996, this court granted the motions for reargument that were filed after our decision in <em>Williams I </em>was rendered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Today, we conclude that we incorrectly decided <em>Williams I. For </em>purposes of \u00a7 31-349, a claimant\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d is to be evaluated, not in terms of loss of earning capacity, but, rather, in terms of the claimant\u2019s medical impairment. Consequently, to the extent that dicta in cases such as <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>231 Conn. 529, 541, 651 A.2d 254 (1994) (\u201c[cjompensation under our [workers\u2019 compensation statute] is based upon incapacity, total or partial, and hence is based upon earning power\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Levanti </em>v. <em>Dow Chemical Co., </em>218 Conn. 9, 14-15, 587 A.2d 1023 (1991) (legislature \u201cpresumed that the losses [in the schedule of compensation] affected earning capacity\u201d), suggest otherwise, we disavow that language. Although this case has traveled a long and tortuous path through the appellate process,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we now take this opportunity to restate our opinion ab initio.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The claimant, Peter Williams, who is not a party to this appeal, originally brought a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits against several of his former employers, their insurers and the fund. The defendant employers are Best Cleaners, Inc., Windsor Dry Cleaners, Broadbrook Cleaners and Nu-Life Cleaners<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (collectively referred to as the employers).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (commissioner) awarded compensation to the claimant for his permanent disabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ity and ordered that liability for the claim be transferred to the fund in accordance with \u00a7 31-349. The workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirmed the decision of the commissioner. We now affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The underlying facts are undisputed. From 1963 to 1983, the claimant worked in various dry cleaning businesses. At each place of employment, the claimant\u2019s responsibilities included removing items of wet clothing from a cleaning tank and placing them in a dryer. In discharging this task, the claimant was exposed to perchloroethylene, a volatile chemical commonly used in the industry as a cleaning agent, in both its liquid and vapor form.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In the late 1970s, the claimant began to experience difficulty breathing, and, in 1977, he was diagnosed as suffering from asthma. In 1982, when the claimant\u2019s asthma symptoms became persistent, he was referred to Thomas J. Godar, a pulmonary specialist. The claimant furnished Godar wdth the following history. He was fifty-nine <em>years </em>old, and had smoked cigarettes from age ten until he was forty-eight. He had worked in the dry cleaning business, where he was exposed on a regular basis to perchloroethylene and other cleaning solutions. Due to this history, Godar performed various pulmonary function tests on the claimant, which revealed that the claimant was suffering from obstructive airway disease with an asthmatic component. The claimant left his last employer in May, 1983, and subsequently sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">During the hearing before the commissioner, Godar testified extensively about the claimant\u2019s medical condition. No other expert medical testimony was presented. Godar explained that the claimant had a 50 percent impairment of his respiratory capacity, which represented the median percentage of impairment even when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the claimant was under a full regimen of medication. Godar- estimated that \u201csomething in the range of a 10 to 20 percent loss in function . . . was probably related to his smoking . . . .\u201d More precisely, he explained that 10 to 20 percent of the claimant\u2019s 50 percent loss of respiratory capacity, or 5 to 10 percent of his original capacity, was due to smoking. The remainder \u2014 80 to 90 percent of the percentage loss, or 40 to 45 percent of the claimant\u2019s original capacity \u2014 was due to the claimant\u2019s exposure to perchloroethylene throughout his career in the dry cleaning industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Godar also testified on the issue of whether the claimant could function in a work environment. In Godar\u2019s opinion, the claimant\u2019s exposure to perchloroethylene had sensitized his lungs and respiratory system to such an extent that even common irritants, such as cold air and perfume, could induce serious breathing problems. Godar suggested that the claimant \u201ccould do probably sedentary work under conditions where there was no smoking, no significant volatile chemicals or fumes involved in the process, and with reasonable environmental control, which would include air conditioning for the summer months . . . .\u201d Godar opined, however, that \u201c[i]n the real world I\u2019m not of the opinion that he is employable. I think if you look at his lung function under ideal circumstances you would say, well, he could do something, yes, he could. The question is, who would hire him, and how long would he hold that job? And under those circumstances it\u2019s been my experience that [he is] not employable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The commissioner concluded that the claimant was totally disabled and that his labor had become unmarketable. Implicit in the commissioner\u2019s finding was that the claimant\u2019s disability was due to his exposure to perchloroethylene while working in various dry cleaning businesses. The commissioner further found that the claimant had smoked for more than thirty-five years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>which had caused \u201cpre-existing lung disease\u201d that \u201ccaused his airway disease to be materially and substantially worse than it otherwise would have been.\u201d In other words, the commissioner found that the claimant\u2019s first injury to his lungs, caused by the smoking, and his second injury to his lungs, caused by exposure to perchloroethylene, resulted in a permanent disability, which was materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone. The commissioner subsequently ordered liability for the compensation claim to be transferred from the employers to the fund after the employers had paid the requisite 104 weeks of benefits. The fund appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the board, which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision with respect to the transfer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On appeal to this court, the fund renews its claim that the commissioner should not have ordered the transfer of liability for the claimant\u2019s compensation ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>efits pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, because the claimant\u2019s first injury did not materially and substantially contribute to his permanent disability. Section 31-349 (a) provides for a transfer of liability to the fund \u201c[i]f an employee having a previous disability incurs a second disability from a second injury resulting in a permanent disability caused by both the previous disability and the second injury which is materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injuiy alone . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The fund does not contest either the commissioner\u2019s explicit finding that the claimant has a \u201cpre-existing lung disease as a result of his smoking for 35 years,\u201d or his implicit finding that this injury constitutes a permanent physical impairment within the meaning of the statute. Similarly, the fund does not challenge the commissioner\u2019s finding that, as a result of his employment, the claimant sustained a second injury to his lungs. Therefore, it is undisputed that the claimant suffers from both a previous disability and compensable second, work-related injury. Nevertheless, to ascertain whether a transfer of liability to the fund is appropriate, it must be determined whether the claimant\u2019s first and second injuries resulted in a \u201cpermanent disability caused by both [conditions] which is materially and substantially greater than [that which] would have resulted from the second injury alone . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (a). This question requires that we first define the term \u201cdisability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The parties have asserted several alternative definitions of \u201cdisability.\u201d The fund takes the position that, in the context of \u00a7 31-349, \u201cdisability refers to the claimant\u2019s inability to work and loss of earning capacity and not to his degree of medical impairment.\u201d The named defendant, Best Cleaners, Inc., on the other hand, argues that \u201cdisability\u201d refers to the claimant\u2019s degree of medical impairment. The defendants Broadbrook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Cleaners and Windsor Dry Cleaners amalgamate those two positions and argue that \u201cdisability\u201d refers either to a claimant\u2019s inability to work or to his medical impairment, i.e., disability refers to either an inability or limitation in a claimant\u2019s ability to work, or simply to his degree of physical impairment. We conclude that, for purposes of \u00a7 31-349, \u201cdisability\u201d refers to a claimant\u2019s degree of medical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In the context of \u00a7 31-349, the term \u201cdisability\u201d is susceptible of two meanings \u2014 physical impairment and loss of earning capacity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1C A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1995) \u00a7 57.11. As Larson observes, these two \u201cingredients\u201d generally occur concurrently. There are instances, however, such as the present case, in which they do not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u201cPermanent disability\u201d is not defined within Connecticut\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq. \u201cPrevious disability,\u201d however, is defined within \u00a7 31-275 (20) as \u201can employee\u2019s preexisting condition caused by the total or partial loss of, or loss of use of, one hand, one arm, one foot or one eye resulting from accidental injury, disease or congenital causes, or other <em>permanent physical impairment.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(Emphasis added.) \u201cIn construing the act . . . this court makes every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992). \u201cIn addition, the statute must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987). Thus, the meaning of the term \u201cdisability\u201d should not vary simply because it is modified by \u201cpermanent\u201d rather than \u201cprevious.\u201d Accordingly, we define \u201cdisability,\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 31-349 (a), to refer to a claimant\u2019s physical impairment. Moreover, this definition is consistent with our case law. <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 800-801, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996) (medical records admitted to demonstrate disability); <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H. O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>166 Conn. 352, 359, 349 A.2d 847 (1974) (claimant\u2019s heart disease considered \u201cpreexisting permanent physical impairment\u201d despite fact that it \u201chad neither manifested itself so as to be a hinderance to obtaining employment nor come to the attention of the employer\u201d); <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Plastic Design, Inc., </em>37 Conn. App. 131, 135, 655 A.2d 270 (1995) (prior injury not \u201ca first injury because it did not result in a permanent physical impairment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We next address the issue of whether the commissioner, in transferring liability to the fund, reasonably concluded that the claimant\u2019s permanent disability was materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone. After hearing all of the evidence, the commissioner found, and the board affirmed, that the \u201c[claimant's preexisting lung disease caused his airway disease to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>materially and substantially worse than it otherwise would have been.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Because \u201cmaterially\u201d and \u201csubstantially\u201d are not defined within the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we refer to their commonly approved usage for guidance in our determination. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>Police Dept. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>225 Conn. 297, 301 n.6, 622 A.2d 1005 (1993) (\u201c \u2018[w]here a statute does not define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries\u2019 \u201d). A first injury will be considered to have materially<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and substantially<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> worsened a claimant\u2019s permanent disability, if it makes a significant, though not necessarily a primary, contribution to the claimant\u2019s disabled condition, such that an absence of the preexisting injury would result in a measurable lessening of the degree of disability, i.e., physical impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Our standard of review of the board\u2019s determination is clear. \u201c[T]he [board\u2019s] hearing of an appeal from the commissioner is not a de novo hearing of the facts. Although the [board] may take additional material evidence, this is proper only if it is shown to its satisfaction that good reasons exist as to why the evidence was not presented to the commissioner. Otherwise, it is obliged to hear the appeal on the record and not retry the facts. . . . [T]he power and duty of determining the facts rests on the commissioner, the trier of facts. . . . The conclusions drawn by him from the facts found must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>supra, 235 Conn. 798-99. Therefore, our review is limited to whether there was sufficient evidence in the record from which the commissioner could reasonably have concluded that the claimant\u2019s first injury \u201cmaterially and substantially\u201d contributed to his permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the present case, all the parties relied upon the medical expert testimony of Godar. As previously mentioned, Godar testified that 10 to 20 percent of the claimant\u2019s 50 percent loss of respiratory capacity was due to his thirty-five years of smoking. Godar\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s determination that the preexisting lung injury related to the claimant\u2019s smoking history was a material and substantial factor in the claimant\u2019s permanent physical impairment. Accordingly, we conclude that the board did not abuse its discretion in affirming the commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-5\"> For the purposes of this appeal, there is no substantive difference between \u00a7 31-349 as it provides today and the provisions as they existed in 1983 when this cause of action arose. Therefore, we refer to the present language of \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe fact that an employee has suffered a previous disability, shall not preclude him from compensation for a second injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting from the second injury. If an employee having a previous disability incurs a second disability from a second injury resulting in a permanent disability caused by both the previous disability and the second injury which is materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second ii\\jury alone, he shall receive compensation for (1) the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and (2) necessary medical care, as provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of the disability was due to aprevious disability. Forpurposes of this subsection, \u2018compensationpayableorpaidwithrespecttothepreviousdisability\u2019includes compensation payable or paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, as well as any other compensation payable or paid in connection with the previous disability, regardless of the source of such compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> Two separate motions for reargument were filed, one by the named defendant, Best Cleaners, Inc., and another by the defendants Broadbrook Gleaners, Hartford Insurance Group, Windsor Dry Cleaners and Aetna Casualty and Surety Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> The fund appealed from the judgment of the compensation review board to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We initially heard oral argument on March 17, 1995. On July 24, 1995, we ordered rebriefing on two issues: (1) \u201cIn the context of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349, does \u2018disability' refer to the claimant\u2019s inability to work and loss of earning capacity, or to his degree of medical impairment,?\u201d; and (2) \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, was the claimant\u2019s permanent disability \u2018materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone,\u2019 within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 31-349?\u201d Our decision in <em>Williams I </em>was rendered on January 28, 199G. Subsequently, on March 5,1996, the motions for reargument were granted and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Section of the Connecticut Bar Association and the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association were granted permission to file an amicus brief. All parties, including the amici, argued orally before this court on April 26,1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> The defendant Nu-Life Cleaners did not file a brief in this appeal.

References to the commissioner are to Spain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> The fund raised nine issues in its appeal from the commissioner to the board, which were consolidated into four issues by the board: (1) liability for the claimant\u2019s compensation benefits should not have been transferred to the fund because there was no evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s finding that there was permanent physical impairment resulting from the claimant\u2019s many years of smoking; (2) liability should not have been transferred because the commissioner found no subordinate facts that supported his conclusion that the claimant\u2019s airway disease had been made materially and substantially worse by the preexisting lung disease; (3) the commissioner had miscalculated the amount of the award due the claimant; and (4) because there were two lungs involved, the commissioner should have ordered the employer to pay 104 weeks of liability for each, or 208 weeks total, before transferring liability to the fund. In consolidating the issues, the board eliminated the fund\u2019s sixth ground, which has become the substantive issue in this appeal. The fund\u2019s sixth ground is that \u201c[t]he commissioner erred by failing to find that the claimant\u2019s permanent disability was not made materially and substantially worse due to pre-existing lung disease.\u201d The board affirmed the decision of the commissioner on the first, second and fourth issues, but remanded the case to the commissioner for further consideration as to the amount of the award due the claimant. That issue was subsequently resolved by the commissioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> In Ms treatise, Professor Larson notes that the concept of disability is \u201ca blend of two ingredients ....
