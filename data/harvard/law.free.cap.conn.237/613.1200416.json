In construing \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) to proscribe only physical conduct,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Appellate Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish a violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) because the conduct for which the defendant was prosecuted consisted only of speech. Id., 629. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issues: (1) \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) does not include speech that constitutes \u2018fighting words\u2019?\u201d and (2) \u201cIf the answer to question (1) is \u2018no,\u2019 was the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>sufficient for conviction of a violation of that statute?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>233 Conn. 903, 657 A.2d 644 (1995). We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Appellate Court deemed the following facts relevant. \u201cThe genesis of this case was the defendant\u2019s shopping trip to the Waterford Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket [on November 24, 1991]. At the checkout counter, Kim Montigny, a store detective, asked the defendant to accompany her to the store manager\u2019s office on the mezzanine. Once there, Montigny accused the defendant of shoplifting two bags of seafood and a container of cocktail sauce. While in the manager\u2019s office, the defendant became loud and abusive, resulting in a call to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">\u201cWaterford police officer Mark Willard responded and, after [conducting a brief investigation and] observing the defendant\u2019s behavior, arrested her for shoplifting [in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] .... He handcuffed the defendant, and he and Montigny led the defendant down the stairs [which ended at the middle of the register line of a nearby checkout counter] and out of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\u201cWhen asked to cooperate and quiet down, [while being detained in the manager\u2019s office and later while being led out of the store] the defendant responded, \u2018Fuclc you,\u2019 several times.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201c[In addition, wjhile being led down the stairs from the manager\u2019s office, the defendant addressed Montigny, saying, \u2018You fucking bitch. I hope you bum in hell for all eternity.\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\u201cMontigny also testified that while they were descending the stairs the defendant made a threatening remark to her. The record does not disclose the nature of the threat.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 626-27. Montigny further stated that the defendant\u2019s comments and behavior while descending the stairs drew the attention of the other store customers and caused a commotion among those who were present at the bottom of the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">While descending the stairs and in the view of the store customers, Willard told the defendant that if she refused to calm down, she would also be charged with breach of the peace. To this, the defendant responded, \u201cFuck you.\u201d The defendant was thereafter charged with breach of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Following the trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of breach of the peace in violation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1). The trial court sentenced the defendant to six months imprisonment, execution suspended after thirty days, and imposed a $500 fine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of breach of the peace. Specifically, the defendant maintained that her conduct consisted solely of speech and, therefore, was not within the ambit of subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a), which, according to the defendant, proscribes physical conduct only. Id., 627. The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that there was insufficient evidence of \u201cphysical conduct\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>sustain her conviction of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) and reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 640 A.2d 986 (1994), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>12 Conn. App. 481, 531 A.2d 184, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 814, 533 A.2d 568 (1987), the Appellate Court concluded that proof of physically violent conduct is required before criminal liability can be imposed pursuant to subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a). Because it determined from the testimony at trial that the defendant\u2019s actions consisted only of words, unaccompanied by physically violent conduct, the court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support her conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>supra, 36 Conn. App. 627-30.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Section 53a-181 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he [or she]: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior in a public place . . . .\u201d The state contends, contrary to the conclusion of the Appellate Court, that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) proscribes speech as well as conduct, provided that the speech rises to the level of \u201cfighting words,\u201d as defined in the first amendment context, at least when the words used portend imminent physical violence, as the state claims they did here. The state argues, consequently, that the defendant\u2019s words and the circumstances under which they were used were sufficient to support her conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In order to determine whether \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) proscribes speech that can be characterized as \u201cfighting words,\u201d we look for guidance to the construction given by this court to identical language contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182, the disorderly conduct statute. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 795, we were called upon to interpret the parallel provision of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The elements of the two statutes are identical, except that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1), the breach of the peace statute, concerns behavior in a public place. In construing subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a), we stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018fighting,\u2019 by its plain meaning, involves physical force. The phrase \u2018violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u2019 also refers to physical action. If two or more words are grouped together, it is possible to ascertain the meaning of a particular word by reference to its relationship with other associated words and phrases under the doctrine ofnoscitur asociis. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. Sands 1992) \u00a7 47-16; <em>State v. Roque, </em>[190 Conn. 143, 152, 460 A.2d 26 (1983)]. Applying this doctrine, the Appellate Court, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Lo Sacco, </em>supra, [12 Conn. App. 481,] construed \u2018violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u2019; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181a (a);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to mean \u2018conduct which actually involves physical violence or <em>portends imminent physical violence.' </em>Id., 491. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 665, 668, 460 A.2d 496 (1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 194 Conn. 347, 481 A.2d 48 (1984), the Appellate Session of the Superior Court read the term \u2018tumul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tuous\u2019 in connection with its surrounding words, \u2018violent\u2019 and \u2018threatening,\u2019 and held that, because its meaning should be ascertained by reference to those associated words, \u2018yelling and cursing unaccompanied by violent behavior is not prohibited by\u2019 \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In accordance with these decisions, we conclude that the terms \u2018fighting\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 lend an aspect of physicality to the more nebulous terms \u2018tumultuous\u2019 and \u2018threatening.\u2019 Thus, we conclude that subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) prohibits <em>physical </em>fighting, and <em>physically </em>violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 811-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We further noted, however, that \u201c[t]his conclusion is consistent with the \u2018fighting words\u2019 limitation that must be applied when the conduct sought to be proscribed consists purely of speech. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 573, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1978-4), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 689, 695, 389 A.2d 1270 (1978). The <em>Chaplinsky </em>doctrine permits the state to prohibit speech that has a <em>direct tendency </em>to inflict injury or to cause acts of violence or a breach of the peace by the persons to whom it is directed. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 316, 559 A.2d 220 (1989).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">In noting that our holding was consistent with <em>Chaplinsky, </em>we recognized that \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) could constitutionally proscribe speech that, under a given set of circumstances, could fairly be characterized as fighting words that portend imminent physical violence. Moreover, we recognized that fighting words, because they do portend imminent physical violence or are likely to prompt imminent physical retaliation, have a sufl'i<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>cient aspect of physicality such that they can constitute a violation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1). Id. Accordingly, a fair reading of <em>Indrisano </em>indicates that speech can be proscribed not only when accompanied by actual physical conduct, but also when it can be identified as fighting words that portend physical violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Consequently, we conclude that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) does not require proof of actual physical contact on the part of the defendant with a victim as in fact occurred in <em>Indrisano, </em>but rather that, when applied to speech, the parameters of the violent, threatening or tumultuous behavior prohibited by '\u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) are consistent with \u201cfighting words\u201d \u2014 i.e., speech that has a direct tendency to cause imminent acts of violence or an immediate breach of the peace. Such speech must be of such a nature that it is \u201c \u2018likely to provoke the average person to retaliation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1989). We conclude, moreover, that the words used by the defendant here and the circumstances in which they were used classify them as \u201cfighting words\u201d that had the tendency to provoke imminent retaliation from the store detective<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or violence from the store\u2019s customers who heard them. See Lamar v. <em>Banks, </em>684 F.2d 714, 718 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>1982) (no requirement under fighting words doctrine for hearer of words actually to engage in violent conduct); <em>DiGiambattista </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>897 F. Sup. 649, 659 (D. Mass. 1995) (same); see also <em>Stults </em>v. <em>State, </em>166 Ind. App. 461, 467, 336 N.E.2d 669 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>James M., </em>111 N.M. 473, 476, 806 P.2d 1063 (N.M. App. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The defendant claims, however, that such an application of the fighting words gloss to \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) would render subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a), which prohibits \u201cabusive or obscene language\u201d in a public place, mere surplusage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>[219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d 297 (1991)]. Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute. See <em>Pintavalle </em>v. <em>Valkanos, </em>216 Conn. 412, 418, 581 A.2d 1050 (1990) ([a] statute should be read as a whole and interpreted so as to give effect to all of its provisions) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 93, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995). Moreover, \u201cstatutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>180 Conn. 474, 476, 429 A.2d 952 (1980); see also <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 100-101, 653 A.2d 782 (1995). In addition, \u201c \u2018[i]n construing a statute . . . we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 692, 705-706, 553 A.2d 596 (1989).\u2019 <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 675-76, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991).\u201d <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 88, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) proscribes speech that properly can be characterized as fighting words when, under the totality of the circumstances, that speech amounts to \u201cviolent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d that portends violence, while subdivision (5) proscribes \u201cabusive or obscene language.\u201d We are not persuaded that all forms of fighting words are necessarily abusive or obscene. When and if a case arises in which the prosecution proceeds under subdivision (5) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a), we will construe \u201cabusive\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d under the particular facts of that case, taking into account, of course, the principle that the legislative language may not be considered as mere surplusage. See <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 100-101; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Pac, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 476.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">We next turn to whether there was sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1). The standard of review employed when a defendant claims the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction is well settled. \u201c[W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 76, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>233 Conn. 215, 223, 658 A.2d 571 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 538-39, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). Moreover, \u201c[t]his court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier of fact if it is reasonably supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>evidence and logical inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>229 Conn. 328, 339, 641 A.2d 123 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 378-79, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Applying those principles, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant\u2019s language constituted \u201cfighting words\u201d that had a tendency to incite imminent violence and, therefore, that the jury could reasonably have concluded that she engaged in conduct that was tumultuous, threatening or violent. The state presented evidence that the defendant had a heated exchange with Montigny while descending the stairs in the supermarket, during which she swore at Montigny and cursed Montigny to spend an eternity in hell. The state established, moreover, that the defendant\u2019s behavior was exhibited in plain view of the store customers and caused a commotion, resulting in an audience congregating at the bottom of the stairs. In addition, the evidence reveals that the defendant shouted an epithet at the police officer, Willard, in response to his request that she restrain herself. Lastly, the evidence establishes that the defendant issued a verbal threat to Montigny while descending the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The cumulative force of this evidence leads to the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s language could have aroused a violent reaction by not only Montigny, but also the crowd and, therefore, was violative of subdivision (1) of \u00a7 53a-181 (a). See, e.g., <em>Lamar </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>supra, 864 F.2d 719 <em>(Chaplinsky </em>does not require actual physical violence to occur; touchstone is tendency or likelihood of words to provoke violent reaction). The combination of the heated exchange between Montigny and the defendant and the defendant\u2019s threatening her, all of which occurred in front of a number of store customers, provided ample impetus for a potentially explosive situation. In sum, the defendant\u2019s language, which could have led to imminent retaliation or vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>lence, contained a sufficient aspect of physicality to be punishable pursuant to \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In this opinion BORDEN and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior in a public place; or (2) assaults or strikes another; or (3) threatens to commit any crime against another person or his property; or (4) publicly exhibits, distributes, posts up or advertises any offensive, indecent or abusive matter concerning any person; or (5) in a public place, uses abusive or obscene language or makes an obscene gesture; or (6) creates a public and hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which he is not licensed or privileged to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">\u201c(b) Breach of the peace is a class B misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-11\"> The Appellate Court appears to have equated physical conduct with physical contact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the sixth degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and the value of the property or service is two hundred fifty dollars or less. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to this charge and that decision is not an issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\"> The Appellate Court stated that the record was unclear as to the defendant\u2019s exact location at any of the various times that she used the foul language.

In this case, however, the defendant does not claim and the record does not indicate that Montigny received the same level of training as that received by a police officer. Moreover, Montigny testified that her training consisted of a review of written materials provided by the store and a two week apprenticeship with an experienced store detective. Because Montigny cannot be classified in the same category as a police officer, we need not decide whether to apply the \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine narrowly to Montigny.

The majority upholds the defendant Deborah Szymkiewicz\u2019s conviction for breach of the peace and her sentence of six months incarceration suspended after thirty days simply because of something she said. After what she considered to be a wrongful arrest for shoplifting, which may not have been an unreasonable belief in light of the jury finding her not guilty of that charge, while handcuffed, the defendant, in response to being told that she had to calm down or she would be charged with breach of the peace, said to the arresting officer, \u201cFuck you.\u201d Although those words may be vulgar, crude and repulsive, they are not \u201cfighting words,\u201d especially when they are uttered to a police officer. Indeed, if uniformly enforced, today\u2019s decision could subject governors, legislators, judges and thousands of citizens to criminal sanctions simply because of their verbal expressions. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s opinion is contrary to the clear precedent of this court set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 640 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">A review of the factual scenario is necessary to place this case in its proper context. On November 24, 1991, a store detective for the Waterford Stop &amp; Shop observed the defendant and a companion place two plastic bags containing various seafood items and a bottle of cocktail sauce into a larger bag containing lobsters. The defendant testified that this was done so that the smaller bags would not leak upon the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>groceries in her shopping carriage. Upon arriving at the cash register, the bag containing all of the seafood items was placed on the cashier\u2019s belt. The smaller bags, however, were not removed and were not noticed by the cashier. Consequently, the goods, valued at $12.44, were not included in the total amount due, which was approximately $80. After paying the requested amount, the store detective approached the defendant and her companion at the register, accused them of shoplifting, and asked them to accompany her to the store manager\u2019s office. Both the defendant and her companion complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">A police officer was eventually summoned to the store. Upon arriving, the officer found the store detective and the defendant engaged in an exchange of words. The officer testified that during his interview with the defendant, \u201c[s]he was . . . somewhat upset about what was going on. Her voice was raised a little bit. She wasn\u2019t combative . . . .\u201d Because a complaint was being lodged against her and she did not have any identification on her person, the officer was required to bring the defendant to the police station under arrest. Consequently, the defendant was handcuffed and escorted out of the store. The officer testified that while descending the stairs from the manager\u2019s office, the defendant \u201cgot into another heated shouting match with the store detective.\u201d At that point, the police officer told her that if she did not calm down she would also be charged with breach of the peace. To that warning the defendant replied, \u201cFuck you.\u201d In response, the officer said, \u201cokay, it\u2019s breach of peace.\u201d Thus, the only reason the defendant was charged with a breach of the peace, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1), was because of her statement to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The majority opinion is flawed for several reasons. To begin, two years ago, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>228 Conn. 795, this court construed General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1), which contains the <em>identical language </em>of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201c[e]ngages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior\u201d), as not involving speech in order to save it from being unconstitutionally vague on its face. The court held that this provision, \u201cas gleaned from the statutory language and its authoritative judicial gloss, [prohibited] <em>physically </em>violent and <em>physically </em>tumultuous or threatening behavior.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 811. The court explained that \u201cwe conclude that the terms \u2018fighting\u2019 and \u2018violent\u2019 lend an aspect of physicality to the more nebulous terms \u2018tumultuous\u2019 and \u2018threatening.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Id., 812. The same language is before the court today. Accordingly, \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) should also be interpreted in accordance with the majority opinion in <em>Indrisano </em>as referring to physical conduct and not speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Furthermore, to construe \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) as circumscribing \u201cfighting words\u201d would render \u00a7 53a-181 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>(5), which specifically refers to speech, partially superfluous. Section 53a-181 (a) (5) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he ... in a public place, uses abusive or obscene language . . . .\u201d The majority halfheartedly attempts to distinguish subdivisions (1) and (5), so as to include \u201cfighting words\u201d in the former rather than the latter, by stating: \u201cWe are not persuaded that all forms of fighting words are necessarily abusive or obscene.\u201d I agree with the majority that \u201cfighting words\u201d are not included under that portion of subdivision (5) that prohibits \u201cobscene\u201d expression. Due to their constitutional definitions, \u201cfighting words\u201d cannot be \u201cobscene.\u201d <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284, reh. denied, 404 U.S. 876, 92 S. Ct. 26, 30 L. Ed. 2d 124 (1971). \u201cObscene\u201d expression \u201cmust be, in some significant way, erotic.\u201d Id. In this case, \u201c[i]t cannot plausibly be maintained that [the defendant\u2019s] vulgar [expression] . . . would conjure up such [sexual] stimulation in anyone likely to be confronted with [it].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The only apparent constitutional interpretation of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5), however, is to interpret \u201cabusive\u201d as prohibiting \u201cfighting words.\u201d Any broader meaning of \u201cabusive\u201d would be unconstitutional. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571-72, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942) (There are only \u201ccertain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting\u2019 words . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The majority\u2019s opinion is bewildering and, in light of <em>Indrisano, </em>is sure to confuse the Appellate Court, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>will likewise be unable to understand this 180 degree turn regarding the interpretation of identical language. The majority opinion can only be explained as result oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Even if \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) could be construed to proscribe \u201cfighting words,\u201d saying \u201cfuck you,\u201d in the context of this case, does not constitute such words. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that there are certain well defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, such as \u201cfighting words,\u201d that are outside constitutional protection. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>supra, 315 U.S. 571-72. \u201cFighting words\u201d are \u201cthose [words that] by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. . . . Such words, as ordinary [persons] know, are likely to a cause a fight.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 572-73. Before certain speech will be deemed to be \u201cfighting words,\u201d and placed outside first amendment protection, the state must show that the speech has more than the potential for a breach of the peace. <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S. Ct. 2533, 105 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1989) (burning flag does not constitute fighting words). The state must demonstrate that \u201cthe expression is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. . . . [Fighting words must be] a direct insult or an invitation to exchange fisticuffs.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>414 U.S. 105, 107, 109, 94 S. Ct. 326, 38 L. Ed. 2d 303 (1973) (\u201cWe\u2019ll take the fucking street later\u201d did not constitute fighting words because \u201cevidence [was] undisputed that [the defendant\u2019s] statement was not directed to any person or group in particular\u201d and \u201cthere was no evidence, or rational inference from the import of the language, that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>words were intended to produce, and likely to produce, <em>imminent </em>disorder . . . [Emphasis in original.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers. <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 461, 107 S. Ct. 2502, 96 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1987). The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d Id., 462-63. As Justice Powell observed: \u201c[W]ords may or may not be \u2018fighting words,\u2019 depending upon the circumstances of their utterance. It is unlikely, for example, that the words said to have been used here [\u2019\u2019you god damn mother fucking police \u2014 I am going to the superintendent of police about this] would have precipitated a physical confrontation between the middle-aged woman who spoke them and the police officer in whose presence they were uttered. The words may well have conveyed anger and frustration without provoking a violent reaction from the officer. Moreover ... a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to \u2018exercise a higher degree of restraint\u2019 than the average citizen, and thus be less likely to respond belligerently to \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 135, 94 S. Ct. 970, 39 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring); <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The majority has garbled and confused the facts in its analysis. To resolve whether an individual\u2019s speech constitutes \u201cfighting words,\u201d a court must determine what was said, to whom was it said, the context in which it was said, and the intent of the speaker. Because fighting words must be a <em>directed </em>personal insult; see <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>supra, 414 U.S. 108; the majority\u2019s reference to the customers who overheard the defendant\u2019s statements as she exited the store is wholly irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>vant. At no time did the defendant <em>direct </em>any statements toward the customers as a group or individually. As noted in <em>Cohen, </em>the defendant\u2019s statements were \u201cclearly not directed to the [customers]. ... No [customer] actually or likely to be present could reasonably have regarded the [defendant\u2019s statements] as a direct personal insult. Nor do we have here an instance of the exercise of the State\u2019s police power to prevent a speaker from intentionally provoking a given group to hostile reaction. . . . There is ... no showing that anyone who [heard the defendant] was in fact violently aroused or that [the defendant] intended such a result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 403 U.S. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has specifically rejected the presumption that the peace will be breached merely because there is an audience that may take \u201cserious offense at particular expression . . . .\u201d <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 491 U.S. 408. \u201cOn the contrary . . . [our precedents] recognize that a principal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The majority also focuses on the defendant\u2019s statement to the store detective. After being arrested and handcuffed, which the defendant perceived to be wrongful, while descending the stairs outside the manager\u2019s office, the defendant stated to the store detective: \u201cYou fucking bitch. I hope you bum in hell for all eternity.\u201d For three reasons, this statement does not constitute \u201cfighting words\u201d within this context. First, it was after this statement was made that the officer warned the defendant that he would charge her with breach of the peace if she did not calm down. And it was because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of her statement <em>to the police officer, </em>not her statement to the store detective, that she was so charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Second, although this statement may constitute a directed personal insult to the store detective, the statement did not incite any violence, nor was there any evidence that it was said with the intent of inciting immediate violence. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 403 U.S. 20. Moreover, while handcuffed, the defendant could not have posed a threat to anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Third, for first amendment puiposes, a store detective is analogous to a police officer. The detective had accused the defendant of shoplifting and had detained her for questioning, actions that are within the general duties of a law enforcement officer. Accordingly, just as in the case of a police officer, a store detective is expected to exercise a higher degree of tolerance to words that may, when directed to an average citizen, constitute \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 482 U.S. 462. \u201cThe freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d Id., 462-63. Indeed, on the basis of the jury\u2019s verdict finding the defendant not guilty of shoplifting, she had cause to be upset with the store detective and a right to verbally vent her frustration with respect to her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Whatever the factual predicate may be to support this conviction \u2014 the statement \u201cfuck you\u201d directed at the police officer or the statement \u201cYou fucking bitch[,] I hope you bum in hell for all eternity\u201d directed at the store detective, or both \u2014 those words, under the circumstances of this case, are insufficient to constitute \u201cfighting words.\u201d In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>City of New Orleans, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 131 n.1, as I previously indicated, the defendant said to a police officer, who had pulled over the vehicle in which she was traveling and asked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>husband for his driver\u2019s license, \u201c <em>\u2018you god damn [motherfucking] police </em>\u2014 I am going to [the superintendent of police] about this.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) With respect to that heated statement, Justice Powell observed that \u201c[i]t is unlikely . . . that the words said to have been used here would have precipitated a physical confrontation between the middle-aged woman who spoke them and the police officer in whose presence they were uttered. The words may well have conveyed ' anger and frustration without provoking a violent reaction from the officer.\u201d Id., 135 (Powell, J., concurring). Similarly, it is unlikely here that the defendant\u2019s utterance, while handcuffed, would have provoked either the police officer or the store detective to violence. Rather, the defendant was simply venting her frustration and anger with the situation. Such expression is protected by the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Today the majority of this court may have silenced an instance of vulgar speech, but in doing so it has circumscribed our constitutional right to freedom of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of breach of the peace when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior in a public place . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (1) Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The only difference between these two provisions is that \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1) refers to behavior \u201cin a public place,\u201d while \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) does not. The defendant does not raise the issue of whether the stairs leading from the manager\u2019s office to the sales area of the store constitutes a public place within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 812, the court never explained its statement that its interpretation of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) (1) \u201cis consistent with the \u2018fighting words\u2019 limitation . . . .\u201d A review of the facts and the court\u2019s treatment of them, however, leads one to conclude that the court was restricting subdivision (1) to <em>physical </em>conduct. The defendant\u2019s conduct in <em>Indrisano </em>had both a physical component; id., 815; (\u201cpushing his way through a door against the will of another person\u201d) and a speech component.
