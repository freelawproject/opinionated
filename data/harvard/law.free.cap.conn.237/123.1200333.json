J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1d\">This appeal requires us to decide the extent to which provisions of the Common Interest Ownership Act (CIOA), General Statutes \u00a7 47-200 et seq., limit the contractual right of a condominium developer to retain the deposit of a defaulting condominium purchaser. The plaintiff, Richard K. Fruin, filed a complaint in nine counts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which he sought to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>$25,500 that he had paid to the named defendant, The Colonnade One at Old Greenwich Limited Partnership, and others,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a deposit for the purchase of a condominium unit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a trial to the court, the court rendered judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Fruin </em>v. <em>Colonnade One at Old Greenwich Ltd. Partnership, </em>38 Conn. App. 420, 662 A.2d 129 (1995). We then granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to questions he had raised with regard to the effect of alleged CIOA violations on his right to rescind the purchase contract and recover his down payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the facts relevant to this appeal. \u201cIn May, 1989, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>contracted with the defendants to purchase a condominium unit yet to be constructed. The purchase price for the unit was $255,000. The plaintiff gave the defendants a check in the amount of $25, [500] as a down payment. The contract contained a default clause allowing the defendants to retain the down payment as liquidated damages if the plaintiff reneged on the agreement. The contract contained no contingencies and specified a closing date of August 15, 1990. The contract also provided that the defendants could extend the closing for a period not to exceed ninety days, and, if the defendants did choose to extend the closing, the defendants had to provide the plaintiff with a notice to close by a date within the extension period. If the closing was extended, the closing had to take place within ten days of the notice to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u201cWhen it became apparent that the defendants would not complete construction of the unit in question by the original closing date, the plaintiff and the defendants exchanged several letters regarding a closing date. The plaintiff wrote to the defendants in <em>June, 1990, </em>indicating that he was \u2018not in a hurry to close.\u2019 In reply, the defendants indicated that the closing could be extended at least into September, 1990, and that it might be possible \u2018to push the closing back another couple of weeks . . . but this cannot be guaranteed at this time.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u201cIn the meantime, the plaintiff had enlisted the aid of the defendants\u2019 sales office in an attempt to sell the unit to a third party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 10,1990, the defendants wrote to the plaintiff that the closing could be delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>until October 15, 1990, but that the closing had to take place on that date whether or not a new purchaser for the plaintiffs unit was found. The plaintiff countersigned the letter and returned it to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u201cOn September 26,1990, almost sixteen months after the execution of the contract to buy the condominium unit, the plaintiff wrote to the defendants requesting \u2018an indefinite extension\u2019 of the closing date. The stated reason was that the plaintiff was an officer in a reserve unit of the United States Army and he thought that he might be called to active duty because of the Persian Gulf crisis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 attorney responded by letter stating that the defendants would agree to a postponement, but that the closing had to take place no later than January 15, 1991. The plaintiff rejected the offer by the defendants to extend the closing date to January 15, 1991, and again mentioned the possibility of being called to active military duty, and noted the inability of the defendants\u2019 sales agency to resell the unit on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff failed to close on January 15, 1991, and the defendants exercised the default clause in the contract and retained the down payment of $25, [500] as liquidated damages. The plaintiff then instituted [an] action to recover the $25, [500]. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u201cThe case was tried to the court. The court concluded that the plaintiff had forfeited his deposit and that each of the nine counts in the complaint was without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u201cIn its memorandum of decision, the court found that it became impossible for the defendants to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>original closing date of August 15,1990, due to construction delays, but that the contract provided for an extension of up to ninety days after August 15,1990, and that the defendants offered to close on October 15, 1990, which was within this extension period. The court also found that the plaintiff initially accepted the October 15, 1990 closing date, but then asked for an indefinite extension. The court found that the defendants rejected that proposal but did offer to close on January 15,1991, and that the plaintiff failed to close by that date. The court concluded from these facts that the plaintiff breached the contract and had no right to recover his $25, [500] down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u201cThe court also concluded from the plaintiffs testimony that the sole reason for his default was that he changed his mind about purchasing the condominium unit,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> partially because he had been unable to sell his New York home. In reaching this conclusion, the court found that the contract had no contingencies, and that the plaintiff had the financial resources to purchase the defendants\u2019 condominium unit without selling his other home. With regard to the plaintiffs testimony that he anticipated being called to active military duty, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>found that if that had in fact occurred, a different result might arise under federal legislation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that because the plaintiff had not been called to active duty and had kept his civilian job, his reserve status did not affect the resolution of the case.\u201d Id., 421-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In affirming the judgment of the trial court, the Appellate Court reasoned that violations of CIOA may excuse a party from performance under a purchase contract executed pursuant to the act only if a nexus exists between the violations and the party\u2019s breach of the contract. Id., 428-33. Applying this analysis, the Appellate Court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to rescind the purchase contract and to recover his down payment because the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of CIOA bore no relationship to his own failure to comply with his contractual obligations. Id., 432-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that, absent bad faith on the part of a purchaser of a common interest community unit, such a purchaser may unilaterally rescind a CIOA purchase contract by reason of any violation of the act, regardless of whether the violation is in fact known to, or is relied upon by, the purchaser at the time of rescission. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that, because CIOA reflects the public policy of providing broad protection for purchasers like himself, the defendants\u2019 alleged noncompliance with provisions of the act renders his purchase contract void and gives him the right to rescind the contract. We are unpersuaded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Our analysis of the plaintiffs claim is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cIn determining whether CIOA affords the relief that the [plaintiff] seeks, it is axiomatic that we strive to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In reaching this goal, we consider first whether the language of the statute yields a plain and unambiguous resolution. . . . Any latent ambiguity in the statutory language itself is normally resolved by turning for guidance to the legislative history and the purpose the statute is to serve. ... In addition, we consider the statute as a whole with a view toward reconciling its parts in order to obtain a sensible and rational overall interpretation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 451, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">CIOA is a comprehensive legislative scheme that governs the creation, organization and management of all forms of common interest communities. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Willard Shopping Center Associates, </em>208 Conn. 318, 326, 544 A.2d 1207 (1988), on appeal after remand, 23 Conn. App. 129, 579 A.2d 130 (1990); <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 447. \u201c[CIOA] has five major parts. Part I of the act contains general provisions, including definitions of the three forms of common interest ownership: the condominium; General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (8); the cooperative; General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (10); and the planned community, a residual category of developments that are not condominiums or cooperatives but nonetheless come within the scope of the act. General Statutes \u00a7 47-202 (23). Part II of the act governs the creation, alteration and termination of common interest communities. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-220 through 47-242. Part III concerns the managerial aspects of the common interest community, including the organization and power of the unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>owners association. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-243 through 47-261. Part IV affords protection to unit buyers through its disclosure and warranty provisions. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47-262 through 47-281.\u201d <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>supra, 448 n.8. CIOA expressly aspires to serve as a \u201cgeneral act intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">An integral part of the detailed scheme set forth in CIOA is the inclusion of three separate provisions pursuant to which a party may rescind a purchase contract or seek redress for violations of the act. First, CIOA permits judicial rescission or modification of apurchase contract subject to the act if a court concludes that the contract was unconscionable when it was executed. General Statutes \u00a7 47-210 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, CIOA permits a purchaser to cancel, unconditionally and unilaterally, a purchase contract subject to the act, if the purchaser cancels within fifteen days of executing the contract and prior to conveyance. General Statutes \u00a7 47-269 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Third, CIOA permits any person to seek \u201cappropriate relief,\u201d if the person is \u201cadversely affected\u201d by a violation of the act or by a violation of the declaration or bylaws of the common interest community. General Statutes \u00a7 47-278.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> CIOA further provides that the reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>dies contained in the act are to be \u201cliberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party is put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed, provided consequential, special or punitive damages may not be awarded except as specifically provided in [the act] or by other rule of law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-212 (a). In addition, general principles of law and equity supplement CIOA\u2019s remedial provisions, but only to the extent that such general principles are not inconsistent \u201cwith this chapter.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47-207.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plain and unambiguous terms of the remedial provisions, therefore, qualify and limit the extent to which supplemental principles will afford relief that CIOA does not provide specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Without regard to the general principle requiring a nexus between statutory violations and a purchaser\u2019s failure to perform his or her own contractual obligations, we conclude that the specific remedial provisions of CIOA foreclose any right of the plaintiff to recover his down payment under the circumstances of this case. The plaintiff, who neither alleged unconscionability on the part of the defendants nor acted to rescind within fifteen days of the execution of his purchase contract, has no right of rescission under \u00a7 47-210 (a) or \u00a7 47-269 (a). Moreover, having failed to prove that he had been adversely affected by the defendants\u2019 alleged CIOA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>violations, the plaintiff has no right to relief under \u00a7 47-278. Significantly, the trial court found \u201cthat violations of CIOA ... if any, played no role at all in [the plaintiff\u2019s] decision to terminate the contract.\u201d In light of this finding, the validity of which the plaintiff does not challenge, the plaintiff could not have been \u201cadversely affected\u201d under \u00a7 47-278 by the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of CIOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The plaintiff maintains, however, that even if the specific provisions of CIOA do not afford him the relief that he seeks, he may nevertheless rescind the purchase contract and recover his down payment because CIOA, as a consumer-oriented remedial statute, should be construed, as a matter of public policy, to afford him the right to rescind so long as the defendants have violated the act and he himself has acted in good faith. We do not dispute the proposition that CIOA is a remedial statute and therefore \u201cmust be afforded a liberal construction in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>232 Conn. 666, 678, 657 A.2d 1087 (1995); <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>232 Conn. 480, 492, 656 A.2d 1009 (1995); <em>see Associated Investment Co. Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Williams Associates IV, </em>230 Conn. 148, 157-58, 645 A.2d 505 (1994). We disagree, however, that application of the principle of liberal construction permits us to interpolate into CIOA a remedy that the legislature has not provided, either explicitly or implicitly. See <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 199, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995); <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Areals, </em>225 Conn. 432, 442, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993); <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Willard Shopping Center Associates, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 327. To the contrary, we are persuaded that, read in its entirety, CIOA manifests the intent of the legislature that the remedies specifically enacted therein be the exclusive remedies for violations of the act. See <em>Murchison </em>v. <em>Civil Service </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Commission, </em>234 Conn. 35, 45, 660 A.2d 850 (1995); <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the significant difference between the language of the remedial provisions of CIOA and the language of those statutes in which we have found evidence of a legislative intent to afford a broad right to rescind. For example, under the Home Improvement Act (HIA), General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq., a homeowner, in the absence of proof of his or her bad faith, may unilaterally rescind a home improvement contract that fails to comply with the requirements set forth in that act. General Statutes \u00a7 20-429;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 321-22, 328, 576 A.2d 455 (1990); see <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717-18, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). HIA, however, expressly voids a contract that does not comply with its require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ments, and, unlike each of CIOA\u2019s remedial provisions, contains no language expressly limiting the right to rescind. See General Statutes \u00a7 20-429; see also <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>supra, 717-18. This explicit textual difference between the remedial provisions of CIOA and of HIA supports the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to provide an unrestricted rescission right as a remedy for CIOA violations. Without a statutory warrant to do so, we cannot engraft onto CIOA the remedy that the plaintiff seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Our review of the remedial provisions contained in CIOA persuades us that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the plaintiff cannot prevail on his CIOA claims. Under the circumstances of this case, CIOA provides no basis for the plaintiffs alleged entitlement to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-9\"> The plaintiffs complaint alleged: (1) the defendants\u2019 breach of a contract to purchase a condominium unit, which breach terminated the contract and excused further performance by the plaintiff; (2) a mutual rescission of the purchase contract; (3) the nonenforceability of the purchase contract because of its noncompliance with the requirements of the statute of frauds, General Statutes \u00a7 52-550; (4) the breach of the purchase contract by the defendants because of their noncompliance with the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5) the breach of the purchase contract by the defendants because of, inter alia, their violation of eleven specified requirements of CIOA; (6) a violation by the defendants of the requirements of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., because of their violations of CIOA; (7) a conspiracy by the defendants to damage the plaintiff by violating CIOA; (8) the uryust enrichment of the defendants; and (9) violations by the defendants of CIOA because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fourteen material variances between the recorded declaration of condominium and the public offering statement for the condominium unit on which the plaintiff had made a down payment.
