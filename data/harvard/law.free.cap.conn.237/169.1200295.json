Essentially, the trial court declared that the city has the authority to alter the capital budget proposed by the board of educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>tion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but once the capital budget is appropriated for the ensuing year the board of education has discretion over how the funds will be expended within any capital project classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The defendants appealed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from that portion of the declaratory judgment regarding the board of education\u2019s discretion over capital appropriations to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse and direct the trial court to render judgment in favor of the defendants on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The parties set forth the following pertinent facts in a joint stipulation of facts: As was then required by the city\u2019s charter,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the board of finance was responsible for reviewing the annual operating budget requests for the city\u2019s individual departments, including the board of education, and for making recommendations to the board of aldermen with respect to operating appropriations. Similarly, the capital projects committee, established by the city\u2019s charter,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was responsible for reviewing the annual capital projects budget requests submitted by the city\u2019s departments and for making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>recommendations regarding such submissions to the board of finance for the city\u2019s capital improvement program, which included projections of capital expenditures for a six year period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">A \u201ccapital project\u201d is defined by the city charter as \u201cany physical public betterment or improvement or any preliminary studies and surveys relative thereto; the acquisition of property of a permanent nature; and equipment for any public betterment or improvement when first erected or acquired; major alterations and repairs to existing buildings or structures; and major pieces of equipment.\u201d New Haven Charter \u00a7 78. The city\u2019s capital budget instruction manual further defines capital projects as those which \u201chave a useful life of at least five years,\u201d and defines \u201cmajor equipment\u201d as equipment costing \u201cat least $5,000 per unit.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">On March 16, 1988, the board of education submitted its capital project budget request and project descriptions for the 1988-89 fiscal year to the controller for submission to the capital projects committee. Along with its proposed budget, the board of education sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>mitted its six year capital improvement program estimates for fiscal years 1988-89 through 1993-94. The capital projects committee amended the board of education\u2019s original budget request by revising the particular projects that were to receive funding. The amended capital budget was approved by the board of finance and the revised amounts were appropriated to the board of education by the board of aldermen.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Subsequently, the board of education attempted to expend capital funds on projects that were not included in its annual appropriation. It is those actions that constitute the factual basis for the issues raised in this appeal. Specifically, the board of education requested funds from the \u201cFurniture Replacement\u201d account to purchase new furniture for its central office; funds in that account had been designated to purchase furniture for instructional areas and libraries. Similarly, the board of education requested funds from the \u201cRolling Stock\u201d account to purchase an automobile for the school superintendent\u2019s use; funds in that account had been designated to purchase two vans for the food services department, a delivery truck for stockroom operations, a dump truck and a sidewalk sweeper. The board of education also requested funds from the \u201cPaving and Fencing\u201d account to repair various schools\u2019 roofs and to pave a parking lot; funds in that account had been appropriated to implement a six year paving and fencing program to resurface playgrounds and pedestrian walks. Each of those requests was denied by the city\u2019s controller.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In discharging its state constitutional mandate to provide free public primary and secondary education;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 647, 376 A.2d 359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>(1977); the state has delegated the duty to educate a municipality\u2019s children to local boards of education. General Statutes \u00a7 10-220;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> see <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>138 Conn. 521, 532, 86 A.2d 662 (1952). In addition, the state has delegated to the municipalities other duties related to its educational obligation. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-241;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 699, 705-706, 638 A.2d 589 (1994); <em>Cheshire </em>v. <em>McKenney, </em>182 Conn. 253, 258, 438 A.2d 88 (1980) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>(\u201c[t]his court has recognized that \u2018[t]he state, in the exercise of its policy to maintain good public schools, has [also] delegated important duties in that field to the towns\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Relevant to this case, the legislature has charged the local boards of education with \u201cthe care, maintenance and operation of buildings, lands, apparatus and other property used for school purposes . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-220 (a). On the other hand, the legislature has charged the municipalities with constructing, equipping and renovating their schools, as well as partially financing the education provided.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 10-241. Moreover, in this case, the city has delegated some of its statutory duties to the board of education. New Haven Charter \u00a7 174.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Traditionally, there has been a tension between local boards of education, which seek sufficient funds to fulfill their educational mission, and municipalities, which are concerned with their overall financial condition. As this court noted in <em>Baston </em>v. <em>Ricci, </em>174 Conn. 522, 523, 391 A.2d 161 (1978), there has been a \u201clong-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>continuing problem of providing local education under a system in which the local boards of education are charged with the duty of maintaining good public elementary and secondary schools (General Statutes \u00a7 10-220) but are dependent for the funds necessary to perform this duty upon the appropriation of funds by the municipalities or one of their boards.\u201d See also, e.g., <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of </em>Education, supra, 228 Conn. 699 (whether town has satisfied its obligation by merely funding statutory minimum expenditure requirement); <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>162 Conn. 390, 399-400, 294 A.2d 546 (1972) (\u201ca municipal legislative or finance body may not impede implementation of the statutory obligation of the board of education\u201d); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>151 Conn. 1, 193 A.2d 466 (1963) (board of finance had no discretionary power to refuse to allocate funds that statutorily belonged in board of education\u2019s budget); <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>supra, 138 Conn. 521 (board of finance refused to recommend additional appropriation for board of education); <em>State ex rel.

A board of education\u2019s <em>annual operating budget </em>is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 10-222 (a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which provides that each local board shall submit to the appropriate municipal board a proposed budget \u2018 <em>for the ensuing year.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Nonetheless, a submitted budget need not be adopted as proposed: \u201cWhere a town board of education includes in the estimates it submits to a board of finance expenditures for a purpose which is not within statutory provisions imposing a duty upon it nor within one which vests it with a discretion to be independently exercised, the board of finance may, if in its judgment, considering not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>educational purpose to be served but also the financial condition of the town, it finds that the expenditure is not justified, decline to recommend an appropriation for it . . . .\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Board of Finance, </em>supra, 127 Conn. 350. \u201cTo hold otherwise would be tantamount to the giving of a blank check to boards of education to spend the money of the municipality without regard to economy, efficiency or other local needs.\u201d <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>supra, 162 Conn. 399. If \u201cthe estimate is for an expenditure for a purpose which the statutes make it the duty of the board of education to effectuate or they vest in the board of education a discretion to be independently exercised as to the carrying out of some purpose, [then] the town . . . has not the power to refuse to include any appropriation for it in the budget it submits and can reduce the estimate submitted by the board of education only when that estimate exceeds the amount reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose, taking into consideration along with the educational needs of the town its financial condition and the other expenditures it must make. The [municipality] in such a case must exercise its sound judgment in determining whether or to what extent the estimates of the board of education are larger than the sums reasonably necessary and if it properly exercises its discretion and the budget is approved by the town the board of education has no power to exceed the appropriations made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>supra, 706-707.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Notwithstanding a municipality\u2019s discretion with respect to the total annual operating appropriation, \u00a7 10-222 (a) provides that the \u201cmoney appropriated by any municipality for the maintenance of public schools shall be expended by and in the discretion of the board of education.\u201d In other words, \u201call appropriations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>placed in the [board of education\u2019s operating] budget may be expended by the [board] within its discretion.\u201d <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>supra, 151 Conn. 11. Therefore, even if the board of education justifies an appropriation for its annual operating budget based upon an anticipated expenditure for a particular educational purpose, it has the discretion to expend operating funds for an alternative educational purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the board of education has the same discretion with respect to the annual capital appropriation within any capital project account as it has with respect to its annual operating budget appropriation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. The plaintiffs fail to appreciate the distinction between the functions that the state has delegated to the board of education under \u00a7 10-220 and those that the state has delegated to the municipalities under \u00a7 10-241.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u201cIn construing a statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . [W]e are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>235 Conn. 448, 454-55, 668 A.2d 340 (1995). Although \u00a7 10-220 (a) charges boards of education with \u201cthe care, maintenance and operation of buildings, lands, apparatus and other property,\u201d when that provision is read in conjunction with \u00a7 10-241, it is obvious that \u201cmaintenance,\u201d as used in \u00a7 10-220, refers to general maintenance, such as the daily upkeep of school facilities and equipment, the cost of which is provided for in an annual operating budget. Section 10-241, which delegates certain duties to munic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ipalities, however, pertains to capital expenditures, such as the construction and renovation of physical facilities, the purchase of real property, or the purchase of capital equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">A local board of education acts as an agent of the state when it performs those duties delegated to it by the state. <em>Cheshire </em>v. <em>McKenney, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 258. In other words, if a school board is engaged in the provision of primary and secondary education, it is acting under the authority of the state and as the state\u2019s agent. Nevertheless, even in performing its duties as an agent of the state, \u201ca local charter may limit the powers of the local board of education where its provisions are not inconsistent with or inimical to the efficient and proper operation of the educational system otherwise entrusted by state law to the local boards.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Local boards of education, however, are also agents of the municipalities that they serve. Id., 258. A board of education acts as an agent of its respective municipality when it performs those functions originally entrusted by the state to the municipality that the municipality has subsequently delegated to the board of education; e.g., the construction of schools or the acquisition of capital equipment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> While acting as an agent of the municipality, the local boards of education must comply with the municipality\u2019s charter, ordinances and established fiscal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">New Haven\u2019s charter and ordinances distinguish between operating budgets and capital budgets and contain express provisions governing capital expenses and capital budgets. New Haven Charter \u00a7\u00a777 through 79; New Haven Code of Ordinances \u00a7 2-25. Under the city\u2019s ordinances, all decisions relating to capital expenditures are made by the board of aldermen, not the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of education.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Consequently, the board of education is constrained when expending funds that are allocated for capital projects \u2014 duties for which the municipality is ultimately responsible pursuant to \u00a7 10-241 \u2014 by the municipality\u2019s charter, ordinances and fiscal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The plaintiffs rely on <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Ellington, </em>supra, 151 Conn. 1, to support their argument that the board of education has the same discretion over capital budget expenditures as it has over operating budget expenditures. In <em>Ellington, </em>the board of education and the board of finance \u201cdisagreed over their respective powers in the management of funds appropriated by the town for school purposes.\u201d Id., 3-4. The town refused the board of education\u2019s request for funds to finance the position of curriculum coordinator. Id., 4. In order to prevent the board from diverting other funds to finance that position, appropriations for three new teacher positions and a capital outlay were placed in reserve accounts over which the board of finance had control. This court noted, however, that \u201c[t]he number of teaching positions necessary in the public schools, the need for a curriculum coordinator, and the maintenance of school properties are matters within the sound discretion of the board of education under General Statutes \u00a7 10-220.\u201d Id., 9. Accordingly, the court held that \u201c[t]he moneys belonged in the [board of education\u2019s] budget.\u201d Id., 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Ellington </em>is misplaced. In <em>Ellington, </em>there was no indication that either the town\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>charter or its ordinances provided for separate operating and capital budgets to fund the respective statutory duties of the board of education and the town. Rather, it appears that a single operating budget, which included a capital outlay, was submitted to the board of finance and that all the funds appropriated to the board of education were accounted for under the board of education\u2019s annual operating budget. The town never attempted to distinguish operating funds from capital funds, nor did it distinguish between the duties delegated to it and those delegated to the board of education. In fact, the town conceded \u201cthat all appropriations placed in the [board of education\u2019s] budget may be expended by the [board of education] within its discretion.\u201d Id., 11. Under those circumstances, this court held that the funds in question were for educational purposes and therefore should have been allocated to the board of education under its operating budget, over which it had exclusive discretion. Id., 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">We conclude that a local board of education must comply with the charter, ordinances and established procedures of its respective municipality when expending capital funds that have been appropriated to it for the accomplishment of the municipality\u2019s statutory educational duties. Consequently, in this case, the board of education does not have the authority to reallocate appropriated capital budget items, regardless of whether the reallocation is within or outside of a project classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Our holding in this case is consistent with the overall financial planning that is required for capital expenditures. Fiscal prudence requires long-term planning for these expenditures.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In this case, for the fiscal year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>1988-89, more than twelve million dollars was appropriated to the board of education for various capital projects. Given the magnitude of the amounts involved, the defendants required six year projections of capital expenditures.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To grant aboard of education discretion over the reallocation of capital funds could wreak financial chaos on a municipality. For example, a municipality may recognize that the food services department is in need of a van to adequately feed the schoolchildren. Accordingly, the municipality would appropriate funds for such a purchase. Yet, if the board of education had unfettered discretion to reallocate those funds for an alternative propose, such as the purchase of an automobile for the superintendent\u2019s use, the municipality\u2019s ability to discharge its duty to acquire a van would be frustrated. If such discretion is allocated to the board of education, a municipality could never be assured that its statutory obligations would be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In summary, the board of education of the city of New Haven does not have the authority to reallocate funds appropriated to it by the city under its capital budget, unless it receives permission to do so pursuant to the charter and ordinances of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\"> The trial court was presented with the narrow issue of whether the board of education had discretion to reallocate funds <em>within a capital </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>project account. </em>Because our decision makes clear that the board of education does not have discretion under the capital budget to expend funds, either within or outside of a capital project account, in a manner different from which they were specifically appropriated, and because the legal arguments of the parties subsume this broader issue, we address the broader issue as phrased.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> Because the defendants\u2019 respective individual duties and responsibilities imposed under the city\u2019s charter are not at issue in this appeal, the defendants are at times referred to in a general manner as \u201cthe defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> Effective July 1, 1993, after this action was commenced, the board of finance of the city of New Haven, consisting of the mayor, the controller, one alderman and six appointed citizens, was abolished by an amendment to the charter of the city of New Haven.
