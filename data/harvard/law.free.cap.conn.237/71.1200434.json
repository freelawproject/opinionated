The plaintiff, Paul Stewart, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a decision of the board concluding that (1) the commissioner\u2019s decision was valid despite his failure to comply with the 120 day time period set forth in \u00a7 31-300, and (2) the plaintiff was not permanently and totally disabled. The plaintiff claims that he is entitled to a new hearing because the commissioner had failed to issue an opinion within the statutory time period. The defendant second injury fund (fund) responds that the time period in \u00a7 31-300 is directory and that, in the absence of a showing of prejudice due to the delayed award, the plaintiff is not entitled to a new hearing. We conclude that the time period is mandatory and that the commissioner\u2019s decision was invalid because of its untimeliness, but that the invalid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ity was subject to waiver by the plaintiff. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the board and remand the case for a determination of whether the plaintiff waived his right to challenge the commissioner\u2019s untimely issuance of his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The following facts and procedural history are not in dispute. On May 14, 1985, while employed as an auto mechanic by the named defendant, Tunxis Service Center (Tunxis),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff suffered a work-related injury to his right foot. On September 25, 1987, he injured his right wrist, as a result of a fall caused by the prior injury to his foot. The plaintiff received an impairment rating of 35 percent permanent partial disability of his foot and 22 percent permanent partial disability of his wrist, and collected permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-308a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After recuperating from the injury to his foot, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the plaintiff returned to work at Tunxis, but was discharged on November 18, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">For several years after being discharged from Tunxis, the plaintiff collected discretionary benefits under \u00a7 31-308a, participated in vocational training, and engaged in job searches, but he was unable to hold down a regular job. The plaintiff subsequently moved for a hearing in order to determine whether he was permanently and totally disabled and thus eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-307<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, was entitled to additional discretionary benefits under \u00a7 31-308a. The fund contested the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Hearings were held before the commissioner on December 4,1991, and on March 5,1992, and the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>was closed on May 26, 1992. On March 26, 1993, which date was beyond the 120 day time period set forth in \u00a7 31-300; see footnote 1; the commissioner issued his finding and award, concluding that the plaintiff had not established that he was totally disabled, but also concluding that the plaintiff was entitled to discretionary benefits for an additional six months. The plaintiff appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s decision, claiming that the commissioner\u2019s failure to issue his decision within 120 days of the conclusion of the hearing had rendered the decision invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The board concluded that the plaintiff was entitled to a new hearing only if he could establish prejudice due to the delayed issuance of the commissioner\u2019s decision. The board further determined that the plaintiff had not demonstrated the requisite prejudice and, accordingly, upheld the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The plaintiff claims that the board\u2019s decision was incorrect because it failed to recognize that the commissioner\u2019s late decision was invalid. The fund responds that the time period in \u00a7 31-300 is a directory provision, and that unless the plaintiff can demonstrate prejudice resulting from the untimely decision, the commissioner\u2019s decision remains valid. We disagree with the fund\u2019s contention that the legislature intended the time period in \u00a7 31-300 to be directory. We conclude that \u00a7 31-300 involves a mandatory time period. We also conclude, however, that any lack of timeliness may be waived, either expressly or by conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u201cWell established principles of statutory construction govern our determination of whether a statutory time period is mandatory or directory. Our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>intent of the legislature. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 258, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992); <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991). In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). \u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. . . . If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995). Under this analysis, if a statutory time period is mandatory in nature, a showing of prejudice is not necessary to a conclusion that a failure to comply with the time period will invalidate the untimely action.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We begin with the language of the statute. In urging that we conclude that the time period in \u00a7 31-300 is directory, the fund relies on the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall,\u201d and argues that our cases have held that \u201cshall\u201d may have a meaning that is directory rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The fund is correct that we have concluded that the \u201cuse of the word \u2018shall,\u2019 though significant, does not invariably create a mandatory duty.\u201d <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989). The usual rule, however, is that \u201c[t]he legislature\u2019s use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 generally evidences an intent that the statute be interpreted as mandatory.\u201d <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>217 Conn. 1, 8, 583 A.2d 1287 (1991). The legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in \u00a7 31-300, therefore, although not conclusive, suggests that the time period was intended to be mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Furthermore, the legislature, rather than phrasing the amendment to \u00a7 31-300 in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words, as is often done with directory provisions; see, e.g., <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>143 Conn. 381, 387-88, 122 A.2d 789 (1956) (statutory provision that \u201cpetition shall be scheduled for at least one public hearing to be held within sixty days\u201d held directory because time limitation stated in affirmative terms); instead chose the negative phrasing \u201cbut no later than one hundred twenty days.\u201d The legislature\u2019s use of such negative terminology suggests that it intended \u00a7 31-300 to be mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The legislative genealogy and the legislative history of \u00a7 31-300 reinforce this linguistic interpretation. Prior to 1985, \u00a7 31-300 did not specify the time period within which a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner was required to issue an award. The relevant provision in that statute provided that \u201c[a]s soon as may be after the conclusion of any hearing, the commissioner shall send to each party a written copy ofhis award.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 31-300. In a case decided under that statute, the Appellate Court determined that a judgment rendered by a commissioner more than one year after the conclusion of a hearing was valid because, unlike other statutes that set a specific time period within which judgment must be rendered, \u00a7 31-300 did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>not contain a specific time period. Because the legislature could have included a specific time period, but had chosen not to do so, the Appellate Court concluded that the commissioner\u2019s decision was valid. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Northwind Energy Insulators, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 689, 690-91, 483 A.2d 618 (1984), cert. denied, 195 Conn. 801, 487 A.2d 564 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Shortly after the Appellate Court decided <em>Sullivan, </em>the legislature added the specific time period to \u00a7 31-300. As amended by No. 85-64, \u00a7 1, of the 1985 Public Acts, the relevant provision of \u00a7 31-300 reads: \u201cAs soon as may be after the conclusion of any hearing, <em>but no later than one hundred twenty days after such conclusion, </em>the commissioner shall send to each party a written copy of his award.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although there is nothing in the legislative history of Public Act 85-64 to indicate that the amendment was specifically intended to address the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sullivan, </em>the addition of a specific time period to \u00a7 31-300 so soon after the Appellate Court based a decision on the lack of such a time period suggests that the amendment was, indeed, a response to <em>Sullivan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Furthermore, because ordinarily \u201cno part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . and no word in a statute is to be treated as superfluous\u201d; (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 528, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993); we must attempt to give independent meaning to the 120 day time period that was added to \u00a7 31-300 by the amendment. If, prior to the amendment, the statutory directive that \u201c[a]s soon as maybe after the conclusion of any hearing, the commissioner shall send to each party a written copy of his award\u201d was merely directory, then the commissioner was required, within a reasonable time after the hearing, to send a copy of his award, but failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>issue a decision in a timely manner would not, as the Appellate Court decided in <em>Sullivan, </em>invalidate the commissioner\u2019s actions. If the insertion of the 120 day time period did not change the provision into a mandatoxy one, then the amendment would have had no purpose, because the words \u201cbut no later than one hundred twenty days after such conclusion\u201d would merely have indicated a time period within which the commissioner should send his award but, again, noncompliance would not invalidate the commissioner\u2019s actions. In that event, the language added in the amendment would have no independent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Moreover, when the bill that ultimately became the amendment was considered in the legislature, Senator Kenneth T. Hampton remarked that \u201c[t]his bill would <em>require </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner\u2019s decisions on tested claims to be issued within 120 days after the conclusion of the hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 28 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1985 Sess., p. 1106. Representative Jacob P. Rudolf made a similar remark: \u201c[T]he bill provides new language <em>requiring </em>the Commissioner to submit a written decision of his results, <em>no later than 120 days.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1985 Sess., p. 2100. These remarks, in combination with the foregoing analysis, lead us to conclude that the legislature intended as the essence of the thing to be done, not simply the issuance of a decision, but the issuance of a <em>timely </em>decision. This legislative history supports our conclusion that the time period in \u00a7 31-300 is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Although a mandatory statutory provision typically must be strictly complied with, the parties may waive noncompliance, either explicitly or implicitly by conduct. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillerest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 173, 659 A.2d 138 (1995). \u201cWaiver does not have to be express, but may consist of acts or conduct from which waiver may be implied. ... In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>other words, waiver may be inferred from the circumstances if it is reasonable to do so.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>211 Conn. 173, 179, 558 A.2d 971 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Our conclusion that the commissioner was required to observe the mandatory time period in \u00a7 31-300 does not resolve the rights of the parties in this case because there has not been a determination of whether the plaintiff waived his right to challenge the commissioner\u2019s untimely decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the board did not consider the issue of waiver, we therefore remand the case to the board in order that it may resolve the issue of waiver.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The decision of the board is reversed and the case is remanded to the board for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-300 provides: \u201cAward as judgment. Interest. Attorney\u2019s fee. Procedure on discontinuance or reduction. <em>As soon as may be after the conclusion of any hearing, but no later than one hundred twenty days after such conclusion, the commissioner shall send to each party a written copy of his findings and award. </em>The commissioner shall, as part of the written award, inform the employee or his dependent, as the case may be, of any rights the individual may have to an annual cost-of-living adjustment or to participate in a rehabilitation program under the provisions of this chapter. He shall retain the original findings and award in his office. If no appeal from his decision is taken by either party within ten days thereafter, such award shall be final and may be enforced in the same manner as a judgment of the superior court. The court may issue execution upon any uncontested or final award of a commissioner in the same manner as in cases of judgments rendered in the superior court; and, upon the filing of an application to the court for an execution, the commissioner in whose office the award is on file shall, upon the request of the clerk of said court, send to him a certified copy of such findings and award. In cases where, through the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, adjustments of compensation have been unduly delayed, or where through such fault or neglect, payments have been unduly delayed, the commissioner may include in his award interest at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in the case of undue delay in adjustments of compensation and may include in his award in the case of undue delay in payments of compensation, interest at twelve per cent per annum and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. Payments not commenced within thirty-five days after the filing of a written notice of claim shall be presumed to be unduly delayed unless a notice to contest the claim is filed in accordance with section 31-297. In cases where there has been delay in either adjustment or payment, which delay has not been due to the fault or neglect of the employer or insurer, whether such delay was caused by appeals or otherwise, the commissioner may allow interest at such rate, not to exceed the rate prescribed in section 37-3a, as may be fair and reasonable, taking into account whatever advantage the employer or insurer, as the case may be, may have had from the use of the money, the burden of showing that the rate in such case should be less than the rate prescribed in section 37-3a to be upon the employer or insurer. In cases where the claimant prevails and the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>sioner finds that the employer or insurer has unreasonably contested liability, the commissioner may allow to the claimant a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. No employer or insurer shall discontinue or reduce payment on account of total or partial incapacity under any such award, if it is claimed by or on behalf of the ir\\jured person that his incapacity still continues, unless such employer or insurer notifies the commissioner and the employee of such proposed discontinuance or reduction in the manner prescribed in section 31-296 and the commissioner specifically approves such discontinuance or reduction in writing. The commissioner shall render his decision within fourteen days of receipt of such notice and shall forward to all parties to the claim a copy of his decision not later than seven days after his decision has been rendered. If the decision of the commissioner finds for the employer or insurer, the injured person shall return any wrongful payments received from the day designated by the commissioner as the effective date for the discontinuance or reduction of benefits. Any employee whose benefits for total incapacity are discontinued under the provisions of this section and who is entitled to receive benefits for partial incapacity as a result of an award, shall receive those benefits commencing the day following the designated effective date for the discontinuance of benefits for total incapacity. In any case where the commissioner finds that the employer or insurer has discontinued or reduced any such payment without having given such notice and without the commissioner having approved such discontinuance or reduction in writing, the commissioner shall allow the claimant a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee together with interest at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a on the discontinued or reduced payments.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> Although Tunxis is the named defendant in this action, it is not a party to this appeal.
