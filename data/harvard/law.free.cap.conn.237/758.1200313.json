We conclude that it had such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiff, Southington \u201984 Associates, the lessor of commercial property in Southington Caldor Village, brought this action against the defendants, its tenant, Silver Dollar Stores, Inc. (Silver Dollar), and Louis M. Ursini, president of Silver Dollar, as guarantor of the lease for breach of contract for the failure to pay rent. In compliance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-91<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 131,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plaintiff annexed to its complaint a statement that the amount \u201cin demand is more than Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) but <em>less than $15,000.00 </em>exclusive of interest and costs.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendants filed a special defense claiming that the construction project in front of an adjoining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>property was so disruptive to Silver Dollar\u2019s business that it violated its right to quiet enjoyment, thereby relieving the defendants of the obligation to pay rent. Because the defendants failed to appear for trial, the trial court, <em>Langenbach, J., </em>entered a default against them. See Practice Book \u00a7 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Thereafter, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 365 et seq., the case was tried to the court as a hearing in damages. Although neither defendant had filed a notice of defenses pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 367, at the hearing in damages Ursini argued that he had signed the guarantee as president of Silver Dollar, and not in his individual capacity, and both defendants argued that the plaintiff had breached the lease by permitting renovations elsewhere in Southington Caldor Village that violated Silver Dollar\u2019s right of quiet enjoyment and interfered with its business. The trial court rejected both defenses, finding that Ursini had signed the lease in his individual capacity and that the renovations to other sections of the shopping center did not so disrupt the traffic flow as to cause significant financial loss to Silver Dollar. Finally, the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had attempted to mitigate the damages caused by the defendants\u2019 breach. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff against both defendants. The court computed damages as follows: losses to the date of the judgment in the amount of $22,144.03, and losses from the date of the judgment to the end of the contract period in the amount of $128,529.98. After allowing a credit to the defendants for their security deposit in the amount of $4085.44, the court awarded the plaintiff $146,588.57.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the defendants were made aware, during the hearing in damages, that the plaintiff was seeking money damages in excess of the amount stated in the demand for relief attached to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>plaint, they did not object to the amount being sought on the basis that it exceeded that demand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The defendants appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, challenging the trial court\u2019s rejection of its two defenses as well as its finding regarding mitigation. <em>Southington \u201984 Associates </em>v. <em>Silver Dollar Stores, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 608, 608 n.1, 665 A.2d 920 (1995). The Appellate Court labeled the issues raised as factual and, consequently, summarily rejected them. Id., 608. Although the parties waived oral argument, following its own examination of the record the Appellate Court asked for supplemental briefs on the issue of whether the trial court had the authority to render judgment for an amount in excess of the amount stated in the demand for relief attached to the plaintiffs complaint. Id., 608-609. Reasoning that the case was controlled by <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>15 Conn. App. 185, 543 A.2d 785 (1988), the Appellate Court concluded, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4185,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that it was plain error for the trial court to have awarded damages in excess of $15,000 and, accordingly, reversed the judgment as to damages and remanded the case to the trial court with direction to modify the judgment \u201cso that it totals no more than $15,000 plus costs.\u201d <em>Southington \u201984 Associates </em>v. <em>Silver Dollar Stores, Inc., </em>supra, 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The plaintiff petitioned this court for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, which we granted, limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>properly conclude that it was plain error to render judgment in an amount in excess of the statement re amount in demand?\u201d <em>Southington \u201984 Associates </em>v. <em>Silver Dollar Stores, Inc., </em>235 Conn. 937, 937-38, 668 A.2d 375 (1995). We conclude that, absent unfair surprise or prejudice to the defendants, the trial court was not bound by the amount in that statement and that, consequently, the trial court did not commit plain error. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The plaintiff contends that by limiting its claim for damages to the amount in the demand for relief, the Appellate Court has, in effect, resurrected the ad damnum requirement that once served to limit the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and that was eliminated nearly twenty years ago by the legislature, and that the Appellate Court has concomitantly undermined the arbitration and fact-finding programs created by the legislature. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We begin with a discussion of the history of the statement of the demand for relief, the purpose of that statement and the limitations it imposes on the plaintiff, if any. At the same time that the legislature adopted a uniform court system, vesting in the Superior Court the power to entertain all actions except those in which the Probate Court had original jurisdiction; General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 51-164s;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> it also enacted No. 77-497 of the 1977 Public Acts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 52-91 and thereby eliminated the ad damnum requirement because it was no longer needed as a basis for limiting a particular court\u2019s jurisdiction in rendering a judgment. See <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Spinelli, </em>139 Conn. 429, 431-32, 94 A.2d 621 (1953) (amount in demand as disclosed by complaint determined whether jurisdiction was in Superior Court or in Court of Common Pleas); <em>Bridgeport Hardware Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Bouniol, </em>89 Conn. 254, 261, 93 A. 674 (1915) (same); see also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>171 Conn. 412, 415, 370 A.2d 978 (1976) (damages awarded cannot exceed amount of ad damnum).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In 1982, the legislature created fact-finding and arbitration programs in civil litigation; Public Acts 1982, No. 82-441;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and in 1983, the legislature again amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 52-91 to require a plaintiff to attach to the complaint a demand for relief in order to assist our trial courts in identifying cases that were eligible for the newly enacted fact-finding and arbitration programs. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-144 (P.A. 83-144).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unlike the previous ad damnum require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>ment, however, the statement contemplated by the amended \u00a7 52-91 does not require the plaintiff to state the exact amount being sought. To comply with the amended statute, a plaintiff need only state which of the three categories applies to the case: less than $2500; $2500 or more, but less than $15,000; or $15,000 or more.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See footnote 1. These categories correspond to the eligibility requirements for the fact-finding and arbitration programs that had been created by legislation prior to P.A. 83-144.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>549n and 52-549u.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thereafter, the rules of practice were amended to reflect those statutory changes. See Practice Book \u00a7 546D (trial court may refer to fact finder any contract action \u201cin which money damages only are claimed, which is based upon an express or implied promise to pay a definite sum, and in which the amount, legal interest or property in demand is less than fifteen thousand dollars\u201d); and Practice Book \u00a7 546N (court may refer to arbitrator \u201cany civil action in which the damages, legal interest or property in demand is less than fifteen thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The plaintiff contends, and we agree, that if we were to conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 52-91 and Practice Book \u00a7 131 limit the amount of recovery, plaintiffs would be compelled to over inflate their demands for relief to choose the \u201c$15,000 or more\u201d option, so as to avoid the risk that a subsequent judgment for that amount might be set aside in accordance with the Appellate Court\u2019s prior opinion in this case. As a consequence, many cases that would otherwise qualify for arbitration and fact-finding programs would never be properly labeled and identified. The important goal of judicial economy that underlies these programs would, therefore, likely be undermined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">We recognize that Practice Book \u00a7 313 provides that, in personal injury cases tried to a jury, the amount of the verdict cannot exceed the amount demanded.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This rule recognizes the difficulty a jury may have in placing a value on an injury. Although that provision is clearly inapplicable to this contract action adjudicated as a hearing in damages, it is useful as a point of contrast because, had the legislature and the judges of the Superior Court wanted to apply this kind of limitation to all awards, they were aware of how to accomplish that goal. See <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 416, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988) (\u201cthe use of different words [or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>absence of repeatedly used words in the context of] the same [subject matter] must indicate a difference in legislative intention\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 694-95, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Section 313 may also serve to avoid the surprise and prejudice that an unanticipated damage award could bring to a defendant. Indeed, it was those very concerns that the Appellate Court expressed in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 192-93, an appeal from a judgment rendered in a trial to the court wherein the Appellate Court held that the plaintiff was limited in the recovery of damages by the amount requested in the demand for relief and that the failure of the plaintiff to amend the demand pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-259 operated to limit his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">In the present case, there was no such surprise or prejudice to the defendants. The record clearly reflects that, at the hearing in damages, the defendants knew that the damages to the plaintiff had accumulated to exceed $15,000. Pointedly, the defendants failed to indicate any surprise when the plaintiff announced that back rent totaled $22,144.33 and future rent totaled $128,598, and they never objected to the plaintiffs claim for five years worth of rent on the basis that it exceeded the amount in the demand for relief. On the basis of this record, in the absence of any prejudice to the defendants, the plaintiff could have amended its complaint at any time to conform to the proof. Practice Book \u00a7 182.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We would be elevating form over substance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>limit damages in this case to the amount requested in the demand for relief. To the extent that <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Naugatuck, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 185, <em>requires </em>a fact finder to limit damages to the amount stated in the demand for relief, in the absence of a showing of surprise or prejudice, it is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-91 provides: \u201cPleadings; contents of complaint.

We therefore do not challenge the exercise of that court\u2019s discretion to determine whether the trial court was limited by the demand for relief. In order for an appellate court to invoke the plain error doctrine to reverse a judgment, however, that court must conclude that \u201cthe error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ralto Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Impact Commission, </em>220 Conn. 54, 59, 594 A.2d 981 (1991).
