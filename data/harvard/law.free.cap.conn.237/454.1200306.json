J.</author>\n<p id=\"Azn\">The principal issue in this appeal is the propriety of the trial court\u2019s instructions to, and inquiries of, prospective jurors prior to the commencement of individual voir dire. After a jury trial, the defendant, Nathaniel Faust, was convicted of rioting at a correctional institution in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-179b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court rendered judgment on the jury verdict. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following facts. At all times relevant to this appeal the defendant was an inmate incarcerated at Gamer Correctional Institution (Garner). On the evening of April 21, 1993, while the defendant and other inmates were returning to their cells from dinner, an inmate riot occurred at Gamer.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>When the riot began, correctional officer Francis Stack received a report of inmates fighting. While responding to the report, Stack confronted the defendant and several other inmates in a hallway leading to one of the cellblocks. Stack informed the inmates that their presence in the hallway violated prison regulations, and ordered them to leave the area immediately. All the inmates except the defendant complied with Stack\u2019s order. When Stack approached the defendant, the defendant pulled out a sock containing a combination lock. The defendant then repeatedly beat the sock against a sally port window while yelling to other inmates, \u201cIt\u2019s on\u201d and \u201cKick it off.\u201d Within moments of the defendant\u2019s outburst, several other correctional officers joined Stack and, together, they subdued the defendant and escorted him from the hallway. Additional facts will be discussed as they become relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) gave instructions to and asked questions of prospective jurors; (2) denied his challenge to the venire panels from which the jury for his trial had been selected; and (3) instructed the jury in several regards. We are not persuaded by any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s introductory instructions to, and inquiries of, two venire panels prior to the commencement of individual voir dire impaired his state constitutional and statutory rights to individual voir dire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The following facts are relevant to this claim. Six jurors and two alternates were selected for the defendant\u2019s trial from two separate venire panels.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For each venire panel, prior to the commencement of the voir dire examination of individual panel members, the judge, accompanied by counsel for the defendant and counsel for the state, proceeded to the jury assembly room and met the entire panel. The trial court informed the panel that the defendant had been charged with committing criminal offenses, identified those offenses and introduced counsel. After each counsel had made brief statements to the panel, the trial court explained to the panel, in general terms, several fundamental principles of criminal law and instructed the panel on these principles.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, during the trial court\u2019s explanation to the first panel of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right not to testify at trial, the court remarked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to panel members that \u201cI\u2019m not trying to change your minds, I\u2019m trying to tell you certain things that won\u2019t get [you] disqualified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Interspersed among its introductory remarks and instructions, the trial court conducted general inquiries of each venire panel into areas of potential bias or incapacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The general inquiries required only affirmative or negative responses from panel members. The trial court also asked specific, open-ended follow-up questions of those individual panel members whose responses to the court\u2019s general inquiries had revealed possible bias or incapacity. The follow-up questions were asked and answered in the presence of the other panel members.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">For each venire panel, after the trial court had completed its introductory instructions and preliminary questions, the court reviewed with both counsel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>responses to questions given by individual panel members. The trial court excused several panel members for cause in light of their responses to the inquiries the court had made. Although the trial court invited the defendant to object before it removed panel members for cause, he made no such objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court also assured counsel that they retained the right to challenge the remaining panel members for cause during individual voir dire. After the trial court\u2019s conference with counsel and the court\u2019s removal of several panel members for cause, counsel commenced their individual voir dire examination of the remaining panel members.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u201cBoth the federal and state constitutions guarantee to an accused the right to a public trial by an impartial jury. U.S. Const., amends. VI and XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8. . . . Part of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 391, 645 A.2d 535 (1994), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996). In Connecticut, \u201c[t]he right to a voir dire examination of each prospective juror in a criminal action is provided by \u00a7 54-82f of the General Statutes. [The court has the duty to analyze individual questioning under this section and limit examination to questions relating to (1) juror\u2019s qualifications, (2) interest, if any, in the subject matter of the action, and (3) relations with the parties thereto.] This right was established as a constitutional one in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>1972 by inclusion in article IV of the amendments to the state constitution of the provision that [t]he right to question each juror individually by counsel shall be inviolate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Dahlgren, 200 Conn. 586, 600, 512 A.2d 906 (1986); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>218 Conn. 309, 318, 589 A.2d 343 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>203 Conn. 506, 511, 525 A.2d 509 (1987). We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s instructions and inquiries during its introductory sessions with each of the two venire panels did not violate the defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights to individual voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We find no impropriety in the preliminary instructions given by the trial court to each venire panel prior to the commencement of the voir dire examination of individual panel members. \u201cPreliminary instructions serve the important function of orienting the jurors to the nature of the trial to come. It is helpful to explain at the very start the nature and scope of the jury\u2019s duty, some of the basic ground rules and the issues to be decided.\u201d A Collection of Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal (3d Ed. 1995) p. 1-1. Such instructions are commonly given and, if properly crafted, do not infringe upon a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 182-85, 665 A.2d 63 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>220 Conn. 602, 614-17, 600 A.2d 1330 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>29 Conn. App. 533, 539-41, 616 A.2d 1148 (1992), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 924, 618 A.2d 531 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>23 Conn. App. 160, 168-70, 580 A.2d 520, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 831, 583 A.2d 130 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 981, 111 S. Ct. 1635, 113 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1991); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 622-28, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986) (approving trial court\u2019s use of preliminary instructions following jury selection).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Our review of the instructions given to the venire panels discloses that the instructions were legally accurate, substantially comported with model preliminary instructions; see A Collection of Connecticut Selected Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal, supra, pp. 1-2 through 1-11; and were appropriately tailored to assist panel members in performing their duties as jurors. Moreover, the defendant has failed to demonstrate any way in which the instructions adversely affected his ability to conduct an individual voir dire. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim of impropriety as to the trial court\u2019s introductory instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Although the instructions to the venire panels were themselves proper, the trial court should not have remarked during its instructions to members of the first venire panel that \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you certain things that won\u2019t get [you] disqualified.\u201d The trial court should have confined its introductory remarks and instructions to basic legal principles that informed the panel members of their responsibilities and obligations as jurors and that guided them in fulfilling those responsibilities and obligations. We caution trial courts against making any extraneous and unnecessary comment such as that made by the court in this case. We are persuaded, however, that no prejudice to the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights to individual voir dire flowed from the trial court\u2019s remark. The remark was made to only the first venire panel, was brief and isolated, and was made in the midst of the trial court\u2019s lengthy introduction to that panel. Moreover, the defendant conducted full individual voir dire examination of each of the jurors who was ultimately selected to sit for his trial. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the single remark, in the overall context of the trial court\u2019s otherwise exemplary introductory instructions to the first venire panel, prejudiced the defendant\u2019s voir dire rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We are also persuaded that the questions the trial court asked panel members did not violate the defendant\u2019s statutory and constitutional voir dire rights. It is well established that the trial court is vested with broad discretion to determine the extent and form of the voir dire examination. See <em>Bleau </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>221 Conn. 331, 340, 603 A.2d 1147 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dahlgren, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The trial court, however, must temper its exercise of discretion over voir dire in order to comport with the goals of the voir dire examination. \u201cThe purpose of the voir dire examination is two-fold: first, to provide information upon which the trial court may decide which prospective jurors, if any, should be excused for cause; and second, to provide information to counsel which may aid them in the exercise of their right to peremptory challenge. . . . There are two sets of interests protected by the voir dire: (1) the interests of the parties, namely, the defendant and the state; and (2) the interests of the prospective jurors.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 391-92. \u201c[T]he exercise of [the trial court\u2019s] discretion will not constitute reversible error unless it has clearly been abused or harmful prejudice appears to have resulted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Skipper, </em>228 Conn. 610, 625, 637 A.2d 1101 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">A trial court may pose questions to entire venire panels prior to individual voir dire; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 63-64, 544 A.2d 611 (1988); and may dismiss for cause any panel member whose answers to the court\u2019s inquiries reveal bias. See id., 64; see also Practice Book \u00a7 847.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ability to question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>prospective jurors assists the court in its task of excluding from a jury any person about whom it entertains doubts regarding impartiality; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>supra, 64; and thus enables the court to fulfill its independent duty of securing a criminal defendant\u2019s guarantee of a fair trial by an impartial jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 527, 688 A.2d 1288 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 843, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). In this case, the trial court\u2019s general questions, which merely required an affirmative or negative response from panel members, were pertinent and proper for testing the competency and capacity of panel members to serve as jurors, and were unlikely to plant prejudicial matter in the minds of the panel members. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion when it posed general questions to the members of each venire panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Although the trial court\u2019s general inquiries were proper, once individual panel members had indicated the existence of possible bias or incapacity to serve as jurors by their responses to those inquiries, the court should not have proceeded further in the presence of other panel members. Follow-up questions that required elaboration beyond an affirmative or negative response should have been reserved for subsequent individual inquiries. A prospective juror\u2019s biased opinions or attitudes, expressed through answers to specific questions in the presence of other members of the venire panel, may taint the impartiality of the other members. See Jurywork: Systematic Techniques (2d Ed. 1989) \u00a7 2.11 (1), p. 2-68; see also <em>Mu'Win </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 425, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bible, </em>175 Ariz. 549, 570, 858 P.2d 1152 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(1993) (en banc), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1046, 114 S. Ct. 1578, 128 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In order to decrease the risk of one panel member\u2019s bias contaminating an entire venire panel, the preferable procedure would have been for the trial court to note the panel members whose responses to the court\u2019s general inquiries indicated possible bias or incapacity, and either to have asked specific follow-up questions outside the hearing of other panel members or to have relied upon the parties to pursue any follow-up questions during individual voir dire. We strongly discourage trial courts from asking such questions of individual panel members in the presence of the entire venire panel. We also caution trial courts to craft all their preliminary inquiries so as to guard against the exposure of prospective jurors to any biases of responding panel members.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Although it would have been preferable, in this case, for the trial court not to have asked follow-up questions in the presence of other panel members, the defendant has failed to establish that the court\u2019s conduct prejudiced his ability to conduct individual voir dire. The defendant had ample opportunity to question prospective jurors on prejudice that might have resulted from their exposure to responses to the trial court\u2019s preliminary questions. The defendant engaged in individual voir dire with each of the panel members selected to serve as a juror for his trial. During individual voir dire, the trial court did not limit or foreclose in any material respect questions designed to uncover bias or incapacity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, at the time when the jurors who ultimately convicted the defendant had been selected, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>defendant had not exhausted his peremptory challenges. \u201cUnless all his peremptory challenges have been exercised before the completion of jury selection, it is presumed that no juror was permitted to serve whom the defendant regarded as biased or unsuitable, although he might have preferred others.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>190 Conn. 219, 225, 460 A.2d 961 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 61-62; <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 480, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The record does not demonstrate that the jurors\u2019 exposure to responses given by panel members to the trial court\u2019s preliminary questions affected any of the jurors in such a way as to prevent him or her from judging the defendant fairly and impartially. Accordingly, the defendant cannot succeed on this claim of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The defendant next claims that the selection of venirepersons from the Danbury judicial district<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rather than from Fairfield county violated his constitutional right to have a jury selected from a fair cross section of the community.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201cThe Sixth Amendment requires that the jury panels be drawn from a source representing a fair cross section of the community in which the defendant is tried. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 536 [95 S. Ct. 692, 42 L. Ed. 2d 690] (1975) .... [T]he Sixth Amendment guarantees the <em>opportunity </em>for a representative jury venire, not a representative venire itself. ... In order to guarantee this right, Connecticut adopted General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 51-220a, which requires that venire panels be randomly selected.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 698-99, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The defendant\u2019s cross section claim is a narrow one. The defendant does not challenge his venire panels pursuant to <em>Duren </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 99 S. Ct. 664, 58 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1979).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant claims only that <em>\u201c[ijfthe relevant \u2018community\u2019for fair cross section\u2019 purposes under the Duren test ... is the county in which the prosecution takes place, </em>then [he] was deprived of that fair cross section because the two arrays of [venirepersons] from which his jury was chosen did not reflect a fair cross section of Fairfield [c]ounty.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to whether the relevant community for purposes of selecting venire panels is based on counties rather than on judicial districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The Appellate Court recently addressed a claim similar to the claim raised by the defendant in this appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carolina, </em>40 Conn. App. 762, 768-70, 673 A.2d 562 (1996). We agree with the Appellate Court that \u201c[t]o a large extent defining the community for purposes of the sixth amendment is an arbitrary decision. . . . County lines or federal district lines do not magically determine the parameters of a community. . . . [H]ow-ever . . . because the decision is somewhat arbitrary, it is a decision that should be left when possible to a body authorized to legislate on such matters.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 769, quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>867 F.2d 1003, 1009 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 920, 110 S. Ct. 285, 107 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1989); see <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>49 Cal. 3d 736, 744-45, 781 P.2d 537, 263 Cal. Rptr. 503 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The legislature has determined that the judicial district is the relevant community for purposes of selecting venire panels. \u201cIn 1977, the Connecticut legislature adopted a unified court system through the creation of twelve judicial districts that replaced counties as the means of establishing venue. General Statutes \u00a7 51-344.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Over the next five years, the legislature amended the provisions relating to the selection of jurors to replace the word \u2018county\u2019 with the words \u2018judicial district.\u2019 See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-219c, 51-220a, 51-222, 51-231,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> 51-238 and 51-344. Through these statutes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Connecticut legislature has defined the community for purposes of jury selection to be the judicial district instead of the county.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carolina, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 769-70.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The defendant does not claim that the legislature either created or has maintained the impaneling statutes for an invidious purpose; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 218, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982); or that the statutes in some other way violate his constitutional rights. In the absence of any challenge to the constitutionality of the impaneling statutes, the defendant\u2019s attempt to redefine the area that constitutes the relevant community for jury selection purposes must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The defendant also challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s final instructions to the jury. The defendant contends that portions of the final instructions violated his federal constitutional rights under the sixth amendment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the fourteenth amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>persuaded by any of the defendant\u2019s claims of instructional impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the elements required for a conviction of rioting at a correctional institution under \u00a7 53a-179b by removing a necessary element of the offense from the jury\u2019s consideration. Although the defendant concedes that he did not preserve this claim at trial, he contends that he is entitled to relief under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude that any possible error occasioned by the instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails the fourth prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">A defendant is constitutionally entitled to have the jury instructed on the essential elements of the crime charged and to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 509-10, 115 S. Ct. 2310, 132 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 363, 521 A.2d 150 (1987). Accordingly, a trial court is prohibited from incorporating into its jury instructions evidentiary presumptions that have the effect of relieving the state of its burden of proving every essential element of the crime. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>U.S. 510, 520-24, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>199 Conn. 30, 34, 505 A.2d 699 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">To prove a violation of \u00a7 53a-179b, one element the state must prove is that the charged offense occurred at a correctional institution. See footnote 1. During the course of its final instructions, the trial court told the jury: \u201cGamer is clearly a correctional institution within the meaning of [\u00a7 53a-179b]. You don\u2019t have to waste [any time] on that if you find it occurred at Gamer \u2014 Garner is a correctional institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">\u201cIn analyzing the defendant\u2019s claim, we assume, without deciding, that the challenged instruction constituted a <em>Sandstrom </em>violation. [See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, 442 U.S. 520-24.] This assumption, however, does not end the inquiry because such an error is harmless if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>226 Conn. 618, 624, 629 A.2d 1067 (1993); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cerilli, </em>222 Conn. 556, 584, 610 A.2d 1130 (1992).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">Upon review of the entire record, we are persuaded that the state has satisfied its burden of proving that any impropriety in the trial court\u2019s instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Abundant evidence adduced at trial established that the conduct that had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>formed the basis of the charged violation of \u00a7 53a-179b had occurred at a correctional institution. Witnesses for the state testified not only that the charged offense had occurred at a correctional institution, but also that the defendant had been incarcerated at that correctional institution at the relevant time. The defendant has never contested any of this evidence. To the contrary, the defendant himself testified that he had been incarcerated at a correctional institution at the time of the charged offense. The defendant further testified that inmates had rioted at that correctional institution at the time of the charged offense. His defense was limited to a denial of his participation in the riot.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The evidence adduced at trial compels the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the absence of the assumed improper instruction, the jury would have concluded that the charged violation of \u00a7 53a-179b had occurred at a correctional institution. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to satisfy the fourth prong of <em>Golding, </em>and therefore cannot prevail on his claim of harmful instructional error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 537, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 624-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on rioting at a correctional institution improperly enlarged the offense with which he had been charged. The defendant first contends that it was improper for the trial court to read to the jury \u00a7 53a-179b (a) in its entirety because the information had charged him with violating only a portion of that statute. The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find him guilty for inciting, instigating or taking part in a strike, conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>for which he had not been charged. We are unpersuaded by either of these claims.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. The information charged the defendant with inciting, instigating or taking part in a disturbance, riot or organized disobedience to the rules and regulations of a correctional institution. During the trial court\u2019s final instructions to the jury regarding the count of rioting at a correctional institution, the court read \u00a7 53a-179b (a) in its entirety. After the trial court excused the jury, the defendant took an exception to the court\u2019s reading of the entire statute. In response to the defendant\u2019s exception, the trial court immediately recalled the jury and reinstructed it as follows: \u201cI did read the entire statute to you on riot and the various [ways] it could happen \u2014 I think there are seven, eight or nine alternatives. The [information, of course, alleges [that the defendant] incited \u2014 he did incite, instigate, or take part <em>in </em>\u2014 you\u2019re <em>limited to those three specific words in terms of the allegations of the complaint on riot. Not aiding, abetting or any of those things, but just simply incite, instigate, or take part in. And if you find that he didn\u2019t do those things </em>\u2014 [any <em>one] of them </em>\u2014 then, <em>obviously, you can\u2019t find him guilty on that charge.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant did not take an exception to the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and he does not claim on appeal that the supplemental instruction was in any manner improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cIt is improper for the trial court to read an entire statute to a jury when the pleadings or the evidence support a violation of only a portion of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>229 Conn. 529, 537, 643 A.2d 1213 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dinoto, </em>229 Conn. 580, 584, 642 A.2d 717 (1994). In this case, the original jury instructions were overly expansive because the information charged the defendant only with inciting, instigating or taking part in a disturbance. The trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction, however, cured the court\u2019s improper reading of \u00a7 53a-179b (a) in its entirety. \u201cThe defendant cannot complain of alleged instructional misstatements that are corrected by a timely supplemental instruction. . . . Indeed, a supplemental charge is likely to enjoy special prominence in the minds of the jurors because it is fresher in their minds when they deliberate.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 224, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>233 Conn. 1, 13, 658 A.2d 89 (1995). We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s claim based on the trial court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 53a-179b (a) in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">We also conclude that the trial court did not enlarge the offense of rioting at a correctional institution to include an uncharged theory that the defendant incited, instigated or took part in a strike. \u201c[T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 204, 562 A.2d 481 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Although the trial court mentioned \u201cstrike\u201d in its final instructions, the court referred to the term only when it read \u00a7 53a-179b (a) to the jury and when it defined the statutory terms \u201criot,\u201d \u201cdisorder\u201d and \u201cstrike.\u201d The trial court never mentioned \u201cstrike\u201d in its explanation to the jury of the essential elements of \u00a7 53a-179b that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, the trial court expressly instructed the jury that, in order to convict the defendant, it had to find that the state had proven that he had committed the acts in the manner alleged in the information, which did not charge him with inciting, instigating or taking part in a strike. Reading the jury charge as a whole, we are persuaded that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s isolated references to \u201cstrike.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Last, the defendant claims that the trial court impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury to disregard the standard of reasonable doubt mentioned by defense counsel in his closing argument, and improperly instructed the jury regarding reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence and the jury\u2019s legal duty. We disagree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We find no error in the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard counsel\u2019s remarks concerning the standard of reasonable doubt. It is the sole province of the trial court to instruct the juiy on the law that it will apply during its deliberations. Moreover, \u201c[a] trial court has wide discretion to determine the propriety of counsel\u2019s argument and may caution the jury to disregard improper remarks in order to contain prejudice. A reviewing court may only disturb the trial court\u2019s actions in instances of abuse of this wide discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 102, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In this case, although defense counsel\u2019s remarks might have constituted an accurate but abbreviated summary of the reasonable doubt standard,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we are persuaded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury to disregard the remarks. The instruction was generally worded, neither expressly referring to nor mentioning the defendant or his closing argument,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and had been preceded by another instruction to the jury to disregard both parties\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>descriptions of the law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Moreover, we have repeatedly stated that attempts to clarify reasonable doubt should be avoided because they often tend to obfuscate that concept. \u201cA criminal defendant is entitled to a clear and unequivocal charge that his guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We have recognized that [a]ttempts to explain the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury. . . . We have further noted that [j]udicial attempts to clarify the meaning of the phrase \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 by explanation, elaboration or illustration . . . more often than not tend to confuse or mislead. . . . [W]e find no abuse of discretion in the court instructing the jury to disregard argument by counsel tending to cloud the meaning of so important a concept as reasonable doubt. In so doing, the trial court discharge [s] its duty to give jury instructions that are accurate in law, adapted to the issues and adequate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>207 Conn. 619, 636-37, 543 A.2d 270 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 184; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryerson, </em>201 Conn. 333, 342, 514 A.2d 337 (1986). Under these circumstances, we are unpersuaded that the trial court\u2019s instruction constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The defendant\u2019s challenge to the portions of the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence and the jury\u2019s duty warrants little discussion. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the \u201claw is made to protect society and innocent persons not to protect guilty ones\u201d and that it is the \u201csworn duty of [the] jury to enforce the law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the defendant acknowledges, however, we have on several occasions upheld, in the context of the jury charge as a whole, language identical or substantially similar to the challenged language. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 145, 672 A.2d 899 (1996) (\u201cthe law is made to protect society and innocent persons and not to protect guilty ones\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 695-96, 613 A.2d 788 (1992) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 168, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985) (\u201cit is the sworn duty of the jury to enforce the law which is made for the protection of life, society and property and to render such a verdict as the evidence warrants\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Neither of the challenged instructions, when properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>considered in the broader context of the trial court\u2019s instructions in their entirety, diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof or otherwise misled the jury in any way.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v.

App. 661, 669-71, 664 A.2d 773, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 908, 665 A.2d 903 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court failed to instruct the jury adequately as to the necessity of proof of the \u201corganized disobedience to the rules and regulations\u201d portion of \u00a7 53a-179b (a). The defendant, however, concedes that the trial court instructed the jury as to the necessity of proof of organized disobedience under the portion of \u00a7 53a-179b with which he had been charged, and he does not challenge the propriety of that instruction. The defendant therefore appears to claim that the trial court improperly failed to repeat its correct instruction throughout its charge to the jury. This claim, however, was not raised at trial, and is devoid of analysis and of citation to any relevant authority. We therefore decline to review it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 546 n.22; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 294, 664 A.2d 743 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> The defendant briefly alludes to a claim that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard defense counsel\u2019s remarks concerning reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>doubt undermined his sixth amendment right to counsel. The defendant, however, provides no analysis to support this claim, and we thus address it only in the context of whether the trial court\u2019s conduct improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\"> At the conclusion of defense counsel\u2019s final argument, he stated: \u201cThe [j]udge is going to instruct you on reasonable doubt.

If you think he\u2019s possibly guilty then, under the law, he's not guilty. If you think he\u2019s probably guilty then, under the law, he\u2019s not guilty. The burden of proof is stronger than that. You have to be firmly convinced. A subjective state of near certitude not absolute certitude. There\u2019s no such thing, but. subjective state of near certitude.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b495-9\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, you\u2019ve heard some arguments and terms \u2014 certitude, possible doubt, some doubt; disregard that completely.

I concur in the result. I write separately because of my concerns with regard to the racial and ethnic composition of the community from which the venirepersons were selected. The defendant\u2019s trial took place in the city of Danbury and his jury was selected from the judicial district of Danbury rather than from the county of Fairfield, within which Danbury is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">According to the 1990 census, the towns within the judicial district of Danbury have a total population of 162,584, of which 5040 residents are African-American (3 percent) and 6670 residents are Hispanic (4 percent). The county of Fairfield, however, has a total population of 827,645, of which 81,519 residents are African-American (10 percent) and 70,818 residents are Hispanic (8.5 percent). It is quite obvious that the racial and ethnic composition of the community from which the venirepersons for the defendant\u2019s jury were drawn would have been substantially different if the community had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>consisted of the county of Fairfield instead of the judicial district of Danbury. The county of Fairfield would have provided this African-American defendant, Nathaniel Faust, with more than double the chance of having African-American and/or Hispanic jurors. In this case, no minorities served on the defendant\u2019s jury; every juror was white. Indeed, not one African-American or Hispanic individual was even subjected to voir dire during jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Historically, the county has been the unit from which potential juries were summoned. \u201cFrom time immemorial in this state, the community unit which is the basis for the source of a jury array is that of a county . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>167 Conn. 539, 551, 356 A.2d 125, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 846, 96 S. Ct. 84, 46 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1975). Even after the legislature substituted the judicial district for the county, this court continued to recognize the county as the appropriate community from which to draw venirepersons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 252 n.7, 496 A.2d 513 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Although the defendant clearly challenged the drawing of the venirepersons from the judicial district instead of from the county, he effectively withdrew the claim, in a letter addressed to this court, because of the Appellate Court decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carolina, </em>40 Conn. App. 762, 768-70, 673 A.2d 562 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would not reach the issue in part II of the majority opinion; rather, I would leave it for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> The Appellate Court held: \u201cOn the basis of federal court precedent, we conclude that there is no constitutional limitation on the legislature\u2019s ability to define community as the judicial district for the purposes of jury selection.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carolina, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 770. I note that the defendant did not challenge the constitutionality, under either the state or federal constitution, of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-219c, 51-220a, 51-222, 51-231, 51-238 or 51-344, with respect to the designation of the judicial district instead of the county for the drawing of the venire.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
