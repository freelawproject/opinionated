Ross, was convicted of six counts of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, after a separate penalty phase hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was sentenced to death. We affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions in their entirety but set aside the judgments with respect to the imposition of the death penalty. We held that, contrary to the requirements of \u00a7 53a-46a (c),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>tiary rulings by the trial court at the penalty phase hearing had impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to prove extenuating circumstances that might explain his behavior and mitigate his moral culpability and might therefore counsel against the ultimate sanction of death. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 286, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). Accordingly, we remanded the cases to the trial court for a penalty phase rehearing pursuant to \u00a7 53a-46a.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In the course of preparing for the penalty phase rehearing, the state and the defendant entered into a stipulation requesting the trial court to reserve to this court seven questions of law relating to the conduct of such a hearing. The trial court approved the stipulation and agreed to the reservation of the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201c(1) If the rehearing of the penalty phase is held before the court rather than a jury, will the decision of the majority of the judges of that court be sufficient to render judgment as to the findings of the existence or non-existence of an aggravating factor and as to the existence or non-existence of a mitigating factor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201c(2) If the answer to question #1 is in the affirmative, will the decision of the majority of that court be sufficient to impose sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">\u201c(3) Does the pro se defendant have the right to waive the presenting of evidence that might tend to be mitigating in nature at the rehearing of the penalty phase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\u201c(4) If the answer to question #3 is in the affirmative and the defendant waives his right to present possibly mitigating evidence and further objects to the presentment of any possibly mitigating evidence in his behalf, will the trial court be bound by the voluntary actions of the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\u201c(5) If the answer to question #4 is in the negative, is the court permitted or required to appoint counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to present evidence that might tend to be mitigating in nature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201c(6) Here, where at the first penalty phase hearing the defendant presented evidence that he then claimed to be mitigating in nature that was insufficient to convince that trier-of-fact that a mitigating factor existed, is the new trier-of-fact required to consider that preexisting evidence in arriving at its judgment, even though the defendant objects to a consideration of such evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201c(7) If the sentence of death is imposed, do the provisions of [Public Acts 1995, No. 95-16, \u00a7 3 (b)] apply to the review of such sentence by the Supreme Court, thus eliminating any requirement of a proportionality review of such sentence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The factual stipulation accompanying the reserved questions recites the following history of events subsequent to the remand ordered by this court. \u201cThe defendant has expressed a desire to have the [penalty phase rehearing] before a court (as opposed to a jury); to stipulate to the existence of aggravating facts; and to object to the presentment of any mitigating evidence in his behalf. In pursuit of this alleged desire, he has moved to represent himself[,] has objected to the appointment of counsel to represent him[,] and has objected to the appointment of standby counsel. The trial court ordered a mental examination to determine the competency of the defendant. After a full hearing on the issue of the defendant\u2019s competency and on the voluntariness of his waiver of his right to counsel, the court[:] (1) permitted [the defendant\u2019s] counsel to withdraw[;] (2) permitted the defendant to represent himself[;] and (3) over the defendant\u2019s objection, appointed experienced standby counsel.\u201d The stipulation further states that \u201c[t]he defendant further agrees . . . that the court at the [penalty phase rehearing] will find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>existence of an aggravating factor, and that no mitigating factor exists, and thus, under the law, will impose a sentence of death for each of the [capital] felonies that he has been convicted of committing in these cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The stipulation is not, however, conclusive on a number of considerations that have significant bearing on a proper response to the reserved questions. With respect to the first and second reserved questions, the defendant has not yet formally requested, on the record, that the court, rather than a jury, be the decision maker at his penalty phase rehearing, and the state has not yet formally indicated, on the record, whether it would acquiesce in such a request. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> With respect to the third, fourth, fifth and sixth reserved questions, the defendant has not yet waived, after a formal canvass on the record, his right to contest the state\u2019s evidence concerning the existence of aggravating factors and his right to present evidence concerning the existence of mitigating factors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the seventh reserved question, the stipulation does not address how legislative repeal; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-16, \u00a7 3 (b); of Supreme Court proportionality review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46b (b) (3)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> will enter into the final determination of the appropriate trial court procedures for the penalty phase rehearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Although we are mindful of the public interest in expediting the finality of judicial proceedings, we are persuaded that it would be imprudent for us to answer the reserved questions in this case at this juncture. Because the applicability of the reserved questions of law to the rights of the parties depends upon contingencies that might never arise, the questions presented by the reservation are not, in our opinion, \u201creasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4147. In effect, the reservation asks us for advisory opinions, which we decline to give.

Tait, Connecticut Appellate Practice and Procedure (2d Ed. 1993) \u00a7 8.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We decline to answer the reserved questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b353-7\"> After the filing of the reservation in this court, we ordered the parties to prepare briefs addressing the propriety of a decision by this court responding to the questions of law contained in the reservation.

It is extremely unlikely that any trial judge would prevent a defendant facing the possibility of a death penalty from deciding, at least before the hearing commences, that he will offer mitigating evidence even though contrary to his earlier expressed intent.
