J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">Federal and state constitutional law prohibit peremptory challenges of jurors if such challenges are racially motivated. The principal issue in this certified appeal is the identification of the point in time during the jury selection process at which a litigant must voice an objection to a peremptory challenge that allegedly was based on race. After a jury trial, the defendant, Shawn Robinson, was convicted of two counts of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 53a-60.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury verdict, and the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court remanded the case for further proceedings to determine whether the defendant had raised a timely objection to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of a venireperson. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>38 Conn. App. 598, 662 A.2d 1295 (1995). We granted the defendant\u2019s peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>tion for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court with direction to remand to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant has not challenged, either in the Appellate Court or in this court, the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his convictions for assault in the second degree. The jury reasonably could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, while the defendant was an inmate at the Manson Youth Correctional Facility in Cheshire, he struck and intentionally caused physical injury to two correctional officers who were engaged in the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The only issue before us is the defendant\u2019s claim that, in selecting the six person jury that convicted him of these assaults, the state improperly used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The opinion of the Appellate Court describes the relevant facts. \u201cOf the first thirty-eight venirepersons called for jury selection,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> three were black. One of those three was excused by the court for hardship, and the other two, Lisa Spruill and Melvin Perry, were excused by the state through the use of peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\u201cSpruill was the second person voir dired and Perry the thirty-eighth person voir dired. The defendant did not object on the basis of <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>[476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986)], immediately after the state used a peremptory challenge to excuse Spruill, but the defendant did object on that basis as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to Spruill and Perry immediately after the state excused Peny, and moved that the entire venire panel be dismissed. When the defendant made his <em>Batson </em>claim, he asked the state to put on the record its reasons for excusing both Perry and Spruill.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u201cThe state asserted that it [had] excused Peny for two reasons. First, the state felt that a comment made by Perry, \u2018it takes two to fight,\u2019 indicated that Perry would be lenient about fights and that Perry thought that no one was solely at fault for a fight. Second, the state was concerned with the fact that Perry had a fourth grade education, whereas the other jurors that had been selected had at least high school educations. The state was asked by the court if it wanted to put anything on the record as to Spruill, and the state declined, stating that the defendant had not made a <em>Batson </em>claim as to her immediately following her voir dire. The court did not require the state to put on the record its reasons for excusing Spruill.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201cWhen the defendant requested a ruling on his motion to dismiss the venire panel because of the exclusion of both Peny and Spruill, the court stated that it was premature to rule because not enough had developed for it to be able to find any prejudice. The defendant continued to argue his claim on statistical grounds, raising the fact that the state had struck \u2018a hundred percent of the people in the cognizable [racial] group,\u2019 and that the state had, therefore, excused a disproportionate number of black venirepersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">\u201cThe court found that the state\u2019s reasons for the challenge of Perry were not pretexts and inferentially that the defendant had not satisfied his burden of proof that the striking of Perry was racially motivated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>made no ruling as to Spruill because the defendant had not objected when she was excused. In short, no <em>Batson </em>hearing was held as to Spruill.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cThe court never specifically ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the entire venire panel but implicitly denied it because it found the peremptory challenge as to Perry [had not been] racially motivated and that no <em>Batson </em>hearing was needed as to the peremptory challenge of Spruill because the defendant\u2019s claim as to her was untimely. After the trial . . . had concluded, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial based on his <em>Batson </em>claims. The court denied that motion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 605-606.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On the issue of law concerning the proper timing for <em>&amp; Batson </em>challenge, the Appellate Court concluded that, in order to avoid a finding of waiver, a defendant must object to the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge on equal protection grounds \u201cat that point in the voir dire proceedings when the possibility of purposeful discrimination became or should have become apparent.\u201d Id., 615. In light of this conclusion, the Appellate Court remanded this case to the trial court for a hearing to determine whether the defendant had objected in a timely manner. Id., 615-16, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">For future cases, the Appellate Court exercised its supervisory powers to establish a rule requiring contemporaneous notice. As articulated by the Appellate Court, the proposed contemporaneous notice procedure would require a defendant, whenever the state exercised a peremptory challenge, to alert the trial court and the state that, at some later time, the defendant might raise a <em>Batson </em>claim with reference to the propriety of that peremptory challenge. The defendant would then be required to raise a plenary claim that a peremptory challenge had not been racially neutral, as soon as he or she had become aware, or should have become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>aware, of the relevant facts as they became manifest during the questioning of other potential jurors. If the defendant either did not notify the court and the state immediately of a possible future <em>Batson </em>challenge or did not pursue the <em>Batson </em>claim further as soon as he or she had grounds reasonably to have done so, the <em>Batson </em>challenge would have been deemed waived. In the absence of a waiver, the trial court would hold a hearing to determine the validity of the <em>Batson </em>claim once it had matured. Id., 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The defendant appeals from the Appellate Court\u2019s disposition of his <em>Batson </em>claim. He argues that any requirement that a <em>Batson </em>claim must be raised at the moment a defendant becomes aware or should become aware of a possible equal protection violation impairs his equal protection rights under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, he contends that the contemporaneous notice rule adopted prospectively by the Appellate Court would similarly fail to protect a defendant\u2019s equal protection rights. The state urges us to uphold the rulings of the Appellate Court as constitutionally adequate and protective of judicial resources. We agree with the defendant. Rather than adopt the contemporaneous notice rule, we conclude that a party has timely raised an equal protection objection to the use of a peremptory challenge if that claim is brought to the attention of the trial court before the jury has been sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u201cIn <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>[supra, 476 U.S. 79,] the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors on account of their race . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 323, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 10-11, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S.

Ed. 2d 411 (1991) (extending holding in <em>Batson </em>to situation in which defendant and challenged juror belong to different racial or ethnic groups).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u201cOnce a criminal defendant asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the prosecution must advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . .<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant is then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the state\u2019s articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine [as a question of fact] if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">A defendant may waive his or her equal protection right to be free of improperly motivated peremptory challenges. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 392, 645 A.2d 535 (1994), on appeal after remand, 236 Conn. 561, 674 A.2d 416 (1996). \u201cAs the United States Supreme Court has stated, [n]o procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the light. <em>Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>501 U.S. 923, 936-37, 111 S. Ct. 2661, 115 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1991), quoting <em>Yakus </em>v. <em>United States, </em>321 U.S. 414, 444, 64 S. Ct. 660, 88 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1944).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">A defendant can be deemed, however, to have waived the equal protection right to be free of racially motivated peremptory challenges by failing to assert that right only if he or she has had access to sufficient information to support the equal protection claim. See generally <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938) (\u201cwaiver is ordinarily an intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>201 Conn. 598, 603, 519 A.2d 9 (1986) (\u201cwaiver must be accomplished with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, the appropriate point at which a defendant must assert a <em>Batson </em>claim depends on when, in light of our jury selection procedure, the defendant has had access to the necessary information to assert an ostensibly viable claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In determining the time at which a defendant has access to the information that he or she needs in order to decide whether to pursue a <em>Batson </em>claim, we must consider the procedure by which a jury is selected from a venire panel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before individual voir dire commences, the members of the venire panel are sworn or affirmed. The trial court and the trial attorneys then disclose to the venire panel the names of counsel with which each of the attorneys is affiliated, the names of prospective witnesses, and other facts relevant to the general nature of the case. Practice Book \u00a7 847. The trial court then asks members of the venire panel if any of them is familiar with the people or the information just disclosed, and usually asks if there is any other reason why any of them would be unable to participate as an unbiased juror. A. Spinella, Connecticut Criminal Procedure (1985) p. 652. The trial court may excuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>any prospective juror for cause. Practice Book \u00a7 847. Also, the trial court may give preinstructions to the panel in order to inform the panel of generally applicable legal concepts. See <em>State </em>v. Figueroa, 235 Conn. 145, 184, 665 A.2d 63 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Our constitutional and statutory law permit each party, typically through his or her attorney, to question each prospective juror individually, outside the presence of other prospective jurors, to determine the venireperson\u2019s fitness to serve on the jury.

Spinella, supra, p. 660. The purpose of voir dire is to \u201cfacilitate [the] intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges and to help uncover factors that would dictate disqualification for cause.\u201d <em>Nebraska Press Assn. </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 602, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring); see <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 144; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 381, 528 A.2d 794 (1987).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The procedure that attends the selection of a jury creates the possibility that a defendant may not have sufficient information to raise a <em>Batson </em>claim until late in the voir dire process. \u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that the state\u2019s excuse of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was racially motivated. These include, but are not limited to: (1) The reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the prosecutor failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the prosecutor advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the prosecutor used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race. . . . <em>State </em>v. Gonzalez, supra, [206 Conn. 399]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 11].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 325. These factors require a comparison of the characteristics, the voir dire questions and the voir dire responses of the challenged venire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>person with those of the venirepersons who were not challenged, and require knowledge of the state\u2019s use of all of its peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In light of our jury selection system and the information necessary for the defendant to prevail on a <em>Batson </em>claim, we conclude that such a claim is timely, and has not been waived, if the defendant raises it at any time before the jury is sworn.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our \u201c[c]oncem for protecting to the maximum extent possible the equal protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rights of both the accused and the excluded venirepersons, consistent with the constraints imposed by [our] jury selection process, guides [our] decision.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>836 S.W.2d 930, 935 (Mo.) (en banc), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1014, 113 S. Ct. 636, 121 L. Ed. 2d 566 (1992). When a sufficient number of venirepersons has been questioned to constitute a jury panel, a defendant will have had access to all information available to support his or her raising of a <em>Batson </em>claim. Although in many cases a defendant may have had sufficient information at a point earlier in the voir dire,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we are persuaded that it is preferable to create a \u201cbright line test [to] ensure consistency by removing any doubt about when a <em>Batson </em>hearing should be conducted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>293 S.C. 54, 57-58, 358 S.E.2d 701 (1987). Furthermore, to require the claim to be raised at the earliest possible opportunity would create an \u201carbitrary procedural hurdle\u201d to the vindication of an important constitutional right. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>supra, 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The rule that we establish today is consistent with the twin goals served by the requirement of a timely objection. Timely objection enables the parties and the trial court (1) to preserve an adequate record for appeal, and (2) to avoid prejudicial error by permitting reconsideration while it is still possible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 392-93. We address each goal in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The state contends that allowing a defendant to defer raising a <em>Batson </em>claim until just before the jury is sworn will increase the difficulty of preserving an adequate record for appellate review because counsel and the trial court may have forgotten details of each individual voir dire. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dobynes, </em>905 F.2d 1192, 1197 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 877, 111 S. Ct. 206, 112 L. Ed. 2d 167 (1990). We disagree. We recognize that the parties may need to take detailed notes regarding the circumstances of and their reasons for each peremptory challenge, but we are not persuaded that the burden of such note-taking will be unreasonable. The parties have an opportunity to place on the record, at any time, all information that is reasonably pertinent to potential <em>Batson </em>claims. Indeed, if the hearing is held after voir dire has been completed, more information is available to the parties than at any earlier time in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The state further contends that a rule resolving <em>Bat-son </em>claims after the completion of the voir dire is impractical. The state maintains that a juror who has been peremptorily challenged earlier in the voir dire would most likely have been released from jury duty, under our \u201cone-day, one-jury\u201d system, by the time the jury is ready to be sworn.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In light of this system, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>trial court would have no way of avoiding prejudicial error by reseating a venireperson who had previously been challenged improperly. Adoption of a rule postponing the adjudication of <em>Batson </em>claims until the completion of voir dire would, therefore, in the view of the state, require the trial court to delay the trial by dismissing the chosen jurors and the venire, and beginning jury selection anew. In the absence of a showing of prejudice or of bad faith, we are not persuaded that the risk of delay is a sufficient reason to require a defendant to raise a potential <em>Batson </em>claim before he or she has access to sufficient information to do so properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In summary, we hold that a defendant may object to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge on <em>Batson </em>equal protection grounds at any time prior to the swearing of the jury. In the present case, because the defendant objected to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of venireperson Spruill before the jury had been sworn, the defendant\u2019s objection was timely. The trial court, therefore, improperly failed to hold a hearing on the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Our conclusion that the trial court improperly failed to hold a <em>Batson </em>hearing requires us to decide what the proper remedy shall be. There are two alternatives. We could direct a limited remand, ordering the trial court to conduct a hearing now to determine whether the state\u2019s peremptory challenge was racially moti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>vated. See, e.g., <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 100; <em>People </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>44 Cal. 3d 216, 226-27, 746 P.2d 452, 242 Cal. Rptr. 477 (1987); <em>Tursio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>634 A.2d 1205, 1213 (D.C. 1993); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 Md. 50, 75-76, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988). This is the remedy usually invoked, and it is the remedy provisionally ordered by the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 616. Alternatively, we could reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and direct it to remand the case to the trial court with direction to set aside the judgment against the defendant and to conduct a new trial on the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Under the circumstances of the present case, we conclude that a new trial is the more appropriate remedy. Five years have passed since the voir dire. The state, moreover, did not place its reasons for striking the venireperson on the record at the time of the voir dire. We are persuaded, therefore, that there is \u201cno reasonable possibility that the circumstances surrounding [the voir dire] can be reconstructed fairly . . . .\u201d <em>Mejia </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. 522, 541, 616 A.2d 356 (1992) (remanding for limited hearing but noting that trial court may order new trial if it cannot make necessary findings).

California courts have held that when a struck jury system is used, a party must object before the selection of jurors, including alternate jurors, has been completed; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Gore, </em>18 Cal. App. 4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>692, 703, 22 Cal.

See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>156 Cal. App. 3d 63, 69-70, 202 Cal. Rptr. 657 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b271-7\"> The fact that a <em>Batson </em>claim may be raised at any time until the end of voir dire does not, of course, require counsel to wait until that time. In the interest of judicial economy, we urge the parties to raise such claims as soon as they are confident that they have a record that is adequate for the <em>Batson </em>claim to be fairly adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">We are persuaded that it would serve no useful purpose to impose a contemporaneous notice requirement that would deem a <em>Batson </em>claim to be waived unless a party alerted the court of the possibility of such a claim immediately after a peremptory challenge had been exercised. If such a requirement were adopted, the path of prudence, to avoid the risk of waiver, would be to alert the court of a possible <em>Batson </em>claim after each peremptory challenge. The interests of judicial economy would not be served by such automatic reservations of <em>Batson </em>claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\"> Prospective jurors generally serve only one day unless they are called back to complete voir dire or are selected for a jury. General Statutes \u00a7 51-238a provides: \u201cLength of term of service as juror. The length of the term of service for jurors shall be one day except that (1) if a juror is impaneled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>on a jury trial which lasts more than one day, then the term of service shall be the length of that trial or (2) if a juror is administered the voir dire oath and examination of such juror is not completed during that day, then the term of service shall be through the completion of the examination, if the juror is not selected, or the length of the jury trial, if the juror is selected, or (3) if the court otherwise orders, then the term of service shall be such number of days as the court may order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">We note that, on its face, this statute does not preclude a trial court from recalling an improperly challenged juror either for further questioning or for service on the jury \u201cif the court otherwise orders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> We note that it always would be difficult for a defendant or the state to reconstruct the reasons for challenging a particular venireperson, and for the trial court to evaluate those reasons, even if, as here, a transcript of the voir dire proceedings is available. A prosecutor, when exercising a peremptory challenge to remove a venireperson, \u201cmay legitimately [base that decision] not only on answers given by the prospective juror to questions posed on voir dire, but also on the prosecutor\u2019s observations of the prospective juror. An impression of the conduct and demeanor of a prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>juror during the voir dire may provide a legitimate basis for the exercise of a peremptory challenge. . . . Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s explanation that a venireperson was excluded because he or she seemed, for example, inattentive or hostile to the government, if credible, is sufficient. . . . Because challenges are often based on such subtle, intangible impressions, the reasons for exercising the challenges may be quite difficult to remember . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McCrory </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>supra, 82 F.3d 1247-48. Furthermore, due to the \u201coften subtle reasons for the exercise of peremptory challenges, a court\u2019s determination of whether a prosector has used them in a discriminatory fashion will often turn on the judge\u2019s observations of prospective jurors and the attorneys during voir dire and an assessment of their credibility. . . . It is nearly impossible for the judge to rule on such objections intelligently\u201d long after the relevant events occurred. (Citations omitted.)

I am aware of no case in the country where the passage of time alone was found to be sufficient reason to remand a case for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>a new trial without any other circumstance indicating that a limited remand would be futile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Rather than presuming that an effective <em>Batson </em>hearing cannot be conducted despite the fact that the entire voir dire, including that of the sole venireperson in question, has been transcribed fully,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I believe that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>should remand the case to the trial court so that the court may judge the credibility of the state\u2019s proferred reason(s) for the use of its peremptory challenge. If, due to the lapse of time, the state is unable to provide a nondiscriminatory reason for excusing Spruill or if it appears to the trial court that the state\u2019s reasons are pretextual, the court could then order anew trial. <em>Mejia </em>v. <em>State, </em>328 Md. 522, 541, 616 A.2d 356 (1992) (\u201cshould it appear that there is no reasonable possibility that the circumstances surrounding the striking of [the venireperson] can be reconstructed fairly, then a new trial may be required and the trial judge may order one\u201d); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>supra, 242 Kan. 123 (remand for <em>Batson </em>arguments \u201cbased upon the trial record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>counsel\u2019s recollection\u201d). Moreover, on remand, the trial court would have the ability to order a new trial if the court feels that it cannot properly evaluate the reasons proffered by the state due to the lapse of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In short, I do not believe that we should assume that the record cannot be reconstructed to permit a <em>Batson </em>hearing that is fair to both the state and the defendant. To do so seems to me to usurp the trial court\u2019s function and to require a costly new trial when such a step may be unnecessary. Despite the lapse of time since the voir dire, the trial court may be fully capable of affording the defendant a proper <em>Batson </em>hearing. I would remand the case to the trial court for that determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\"> Each of the three cases cited by the majority in which Batson-type cases were remanded for new trials is distinguishable.

Rptr. 477 (1987), the California Supreme Court conducted an independent examination of the record, noting that the trial court had expressed \u201cserious suspicions\u201d about the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to exclude six African-American venirepersons; id., 226; and noting the fact that \u201cseveral [bjlack venirepersons were excused after giving seemingly routine, acceptable responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions.\u201d Id., 223. The California attorney general had even conceded on appeal that the record revealed no \u201capparent\u201d reason for excusing three of the six venirepersons in question. Id. Lastly, at trial, the prosecutor attempted to justify his systematic removal of African-American venirepersons by suggesting that such a practice was fair play because the defendant was systematically excluding Caucasians. Id., 224. In <em>Tursio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>634 A.2d 1205, 1207-1209 (D.C. 1993), the defendant made a motion for a new trial on <em>Batson </em>grounds and the prosecution responded with a written account of its reasons for each of the nine peremptory challenges questioned by the defendant. The trial court accepted the prosecutor\u2019s explanations and concluded that there had been no <em>Batson </em>violation. The District of Columbia Court, of Appeals concluded that the trial court had erred in accepting the prosecutor\u2019s explanations because \u201c[t]he inherent logic and credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s individual explanations as to each stricken venireperson are not sufficient, taken only by themselves, to rebut such a prima facie case of racial discrimination when prospective jurors of several races who appear to be similarly situated \u2014 based on their answers to questions during voir dire \u2014 are accepted or rejected for jury service by apparent reference to race.\u201d Id., 1212. Finally, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>70 N.Y.2d 420, 426, 516 N.E.2d 1208, 522 N.Y.S.2d 94 (1987), the New York Court of Appeals determined that an attempt to conduct a meaningful <em>Batson </em>hearing would have been futile because the judge who had tried the case had since left the County Court bench and the voir dire had not been transcribed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"> The transcript of Spruill\u2019s voir dire reveals a potentially nondiscriminatory reason for the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge. Spruill gave some indication that she might be unwilling to change her mind during deliberations despite any arguments and opinions of other jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">\u201c[The State:] Now, how are you [at] interacting with other groups of people? Think you can do that? If you were selected and had to talk to five other people on the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>\u201c[lisa Spruill:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">\u201cQ. Now, suppose five of those people were voting one way regardless of which way it is. And you feel the opposite way. Would you stick to your guns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">\u201cQ. Would you try to get them to listen to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">\u201cQ. Would you listen to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">\u201cQ. Would you change your mind based on the mere fact that five people feel differently than you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-15\">\u201cQ. Okay. Would you change your mind if they brought up some testimony or evidence that swayed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-17\">\u201cQ. You wouldn\u2019t change your mind at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-18\">\u201cA. No, I wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-19\">\u201cQ. You wouldn\u2019t [be] open for discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-20\">\u201cA. Open for discussion but I wouldn\u2019t change my mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-21\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s explore this a little further. Suppose you were voting one way and five people voting the opposite way. Now, you listened] to everything that went on. The state\u2019s witnesses, the defense witnesses, if any. Now you made up your mind. These five people say, \u2018What about this?\u2019 They brought up something in a different light and they analyze the fact in a different way. Do you think anything they said would make you reconsider and change?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-22\">\u201cA. Possibly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-23\">\u201cQ. So you would keep an open mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-24\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
