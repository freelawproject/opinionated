The plaintiff, Charles Fabrizio, brought a malpractice action against the defendant, Howard S. Glaser, a dentist, alleging that the defendant had failed to obtain informed consent for the extraction of the plaintiffs wisdom teeth. The defendant both denied that he had failed to obtain such consent and asserted, as affirmative defenses, that the plaintiffs action was barred by either the two year or the three year provision of the applicable statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-584.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant after answering interrogatories in which it found that the plaintiffs action was barred by the three year provision of the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion to set aside the verdict and rendered judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court. Relying on the general verdict rule, that court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>38 Conn. App. 458, 661 A.2d 126 (1995). We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal the applicability of the general verdict rule under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The plaintiff has framed the issue before us in graphic terms. He maintains that \u201cthe general verdict rule can only be black or white \u2014 [i]f interrogatories are submitted to a jury, the general verdict rule must not apply.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) The defendant responds, to the contrary, that the submission of interrogatories does not automatically resolve the ambiguity about the basis for the underlying verdict that the general verdict rule was designed to address. See <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 786, 626 A.2d 719 (1993). Specifically, the defendant contends that, because the record in this case, including the partial interrogatories, does not disclose why the jury found for the defendant, the general verdict rule bars appellate review of the plaintiffs challenge to the jury\u2019s finding on the statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and arguments of the parties, we are persuaded that the Appellate Court properly upheld the applicability of the general verdict rule under the circumstances of this case. <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>Glaser, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 461-66. Because this issue is fully addressed in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court, it would serve no useful puipose for us to elaborate further on the discussion therein contained.
