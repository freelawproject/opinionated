Although we today announce a modification of the constancy of accusation doctrine, we nevertheless affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On a Sunday morning in May or June, 1992, the victim, a thirty year old female, left her West Haven residence to take a walk on the beach promenade several blocks from her home. On her way to the promenade, the defendant, whom the victim did not know, approached her and inquired whether he could walk with her. She agreed, and they walked and talked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>together for approximately forty-five minutes to an hour. After stopping briefly to purchase a soft drink at a restaurant, the defendant and the victim exchanged telephone numbers. When the defendant asked the victim if he could see her that night, she declined his request. The defendant then departed, and the victim returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Over the next few months, a series of telephone calls ensued between the victim and the defendant, resulting mostly in an exchange of messages on their respective telephone answering machines. On one occasion when the defendant spoke with the victim on the telephone, he asked her for a date. She again declined the defendant\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Some time in early to mid-August, the victim returned home from vacation to find a message from the defendant on her answering machine. They were unable to speak to one another until the evening of August 18, at which time the victim mentioned to the defendant that she was going shopping. The defendant asked to accompany her, and the victim agreed. The victim also agreed to pick up the defendant at his residence. Upon the victim\u2019s arrival at the defendant\u2019s apartment building, the defendant came down to her car, told her that he was not ready to leave, and suggested that she come up to his apartment while he finished dressing. The victim agreed and accompanied the defendant to his third floor apartment. The defendant offered the victim a drink, which she refused, and then he proceeded to drink a beer and smoke a marijuana cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The victim became concerned that the defendant was not interested in shopping with her and informed him that she was leaving. The defendant walked over to the couch where the victim was seated and told her that he did not want her to leave. After telling her how pretty she was, the defendant kneeled down in front of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and, against her wishes, placed his hands under her blouse. Despite her protests and efforts to push him away, the defendant proceeded to fondle and kiss her breasts. The victim finally managed to pull away from the defendant, but as she tried to leave, he grabbed her, pulled her down onto a nearby mattress, and fell on top of her. The victim, who continued to resist as the defendant attempted to remove her clothing, eventually freed herself and again tried to leave. The defendant caught her, however, and pushed her back down onto the mattress. The defendant then forcibly removed the victim\u2019s overalls and underpants and forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">After sexually assaulting the victim, the defendant prevented her from leaving the apartment until he had finished dressing. When the defendant finally allowed the victim to leave, he followed her to her car and insisted that he wanted to see her again. The defendant eventually backed away from the victim\u2019s car and she drove off, proceeding directly to the nearby home of a friend, David McCall, whom she told about the incident. Several days later, the victim called the New Haven Rape Crisis Center and told counselor Beverly DeLoatch about the assault. A few weeks thereafter, the victim told another friend, Judy Dixon, about the incident. In early September, the victim gave a recorded statement concerning the sexual assault to Detective Mary Fish of the New Haven police department. On the basis of the victim\u2019s statement to Fish, the defendant was arrested and charged with sexual assault and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">At trial, the victim testified about the sexual assault and identified each of the four individuals whom she had told about the incident. The state thereafter elicited the testimony of those four persons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>each of them was admitted as constancy of accusation evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as they become relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The defendant first claims that the admission into evidence of constancy of accusation testimony<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the federal constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant acknowledges that we have recently concluded that constancy of accusation evidence does not run afoul of the federal confrontation clause. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 643 A.2d 854 (1994). He claims, however, that we should reconsider our determination in light of United States Supreme Court precedent holding that an out-of-court statement not falling within a firmly rooted hearsay exception is presumptively unreliable, and therefore inadmissible for confrontation clause purposes, unless the hearsay statement exhibits particular<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ized guarantees of trustworthiness. See, e.g., <em>Idaho </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 818, 821-22, 110 S. Ct. 3139, 111 L. Ed. 2d 638 (1990). Specifically, the defendant argues that because the constancy of accusation doctrine is not a well established hearsay exception<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and because evidence introduced under the doctrine carries no special indicia of reliability,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> constancy of accusation testimony violates the sixth amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument ignores a fundamental tenet of confrontation clause jurisprudence, namely, that the clause \u201cis not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, <em>as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970). It is true, as the defendant claims, that since <em>Green, </em>the United States Supreme Court has clarified the contours of the confrontation clause insofar as it relates to the admission of out-of-court statements when the declarant does <em>not </em>testify. See, e.g., <em>White </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 112 S. Ct. 736, 116 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1992) (spontaneous declaration and medical examination exceptions to hearsay rule do not require declarant either to testify or to be found unavailable); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S. Ct. 1121, 89 L. Ed. 2d 390 (1986) (moving party need not prove unavailability of declarant if statement sought to be admitted falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>within coconspirator hearsay exception); <em>Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980) (hearsay exception for prior testimony does not violate sixth amendment if declarant either testifies or is unavailable; in latter case, testimony admissible only upon showing that it bears adequate indicia of reliability). In none of these cases, however, has the court retreated from its holding in <em>Green </em>that the sixth amendment is not violated if the declarant testifies in court and is subject to cross-examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because constancy of accusation evidence is not admissible unless the victim has testified, and is subject to cross-examination, concerning the crime and the identity of the person or persons to whom the victim has reported the crime; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 566, 638 A.2d 578 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 453-55, 442 A.2d 906 (1982); we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the constancy of accusation doctrine violates the sixth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">The defendant also claims that we should abandon, or at least severely limit, the constancy of accusation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>doctrine. Although we decline to abandon the doctrine entirely, we conclude, in light of modem day considerations, that it should be restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We begin our analysis of this issue with a review of the evolution of our constancy of accusation doctrine, which traces its roots to the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule. The fresh complaint doctrine \u201cevolved as a response to the common-law requirement of \u2018hue and cry.\u2019 Victims of violent crimes were expected to cry out immediately and alert their neighbors that they had been violently assaulted. The neighbors could then initiate a collective search for the aggressor. The \u2018hue and cry\u2019 also served to dispel any suspicion that the victim had been somehow involved or complicit in the crime. . . . Trial courts required ftdl details of the victim\u2019s complaint as a necessary element of the prosecution\u2019s case in those instances of violence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u201cThe courts applied the same \u2018hue and cry\u2019 requirement in rape cases .... Because \u2018hue and cry\u2019 was a necessary prerequisite for a court to hear a rape case, [women who had not complained] could not have their cases prosecuted. Later, courts heard cases in which women had not raised the hue and cry after having been raped. In those cases, however, the courts allowed the evidence of the woman\u2019s silence to be introduced as a self-contradiction to her later claim of rape. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201cGradually, the \u2018hue and cry\u2019 mle proved largely ineffective because it did not assure the capture of the perpetrator and because even someone complicit in a crime could raise a cry of complaint. Other methods, such as the offering of monetary rewards and criminal immunity for information leading to the apprehension of the perpetrator, proved more useful in apprehending and prosecuting violent offenders. 1 L. Radzinowicz, A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>History of English Criminal Law 27 (1956).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>121 N.J. 150, 157-58, 578 A.2d 370 (1990).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u201cThe courts continued, however, to assume in these cases that any \u2018normal\u2019 woman would report a rape soon after its occurrence. The clear implication of this assumption was that if the woman did not complain, it was likely that no rape had occurred. See [D.] DuBois, \u2018A Matter of Time: Evidence of a Victim\u2019s Prompt Complaint in New York,\u2019 53 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1087 (1988). Therefore, these courts allowed evidence of the woman\u2019s silence to be introduced as a self-contradiction to her later claim of rape. <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Hill, </em>[supra, 121 N.J. 159]; <em>Cole </em>[v. <em>State, </em>83 Md. App. 279, 290-91, 574 A.2d 326, cert. denied, 321 Md. 68, 580 A.2d 1077 (1990)]. These assumptions about how a \u2018normal\u2019 woman should react to a sexual assault, coupled with the common-law rule requiring corroboration of the victim\u2019s testimony in order to obtain a rape conviction, reflect the common law\u2019s profound distrust of female complainants in rape cases. See S. Estrich, \u2018Rape,\u2019 95 Yale L.J. 1087 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks, </em>891 S.W.2d 597, 601 (Tenn. 1994). \u201cThis continued adherence to the hue and cry in rape cases willfully ignored both its ineffectiveness in every other context, and the possibility that women would keep silent about rape because more than any other violent crime it could shed shame and embarrassment on the victim. Courts in effect believed that \u2018[i]t was entirely natural, after becoming the victim of an assault against her will, that [a woman] should have spoken out. That she did not, that she went about as if nothing had happened, was in effect an assertion that nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>violent had been <em>done.\u2019 [4 J. </em>Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1972) \u00a7 1135, p. 298].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 158-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u201cIn the early 1800s courts began to examine more closely the principles underlying the rules of evidence. . . . Courts developed the hearsay rule, barring witnesses from repeating statements made out-of-court by other people. . . . Partly because of that development, the \u2018hue and cry\u2019 rule in rape cases was replaced by the fresh-complaint rule. The fresh-complaint rule excluded the details of the complaint and did not allow testimony in order to prove the underlying issue of whether the woman had been raped. The narrow purpose of the rule was to negate any inference that because the victim had failed to tell anyone that she had been raped, her later assertion of rape could not be believed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u201cBecause juries were allowed \u2014 sometimes even instructed \u2014 to draw negative inferences from the woman\u2019s failure to complain after an assault, see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>351 Mo. 804, [818, 174 S.W.2d 337] (1943), the doctrine of \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 evolved as a means of counterbalancing these negative inferences. Used in this way, the \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 doctrine allowed the prosecutor to introduce, during the case-in-chief, evidence that the victim had complained soon after the rape. Its use thereby forestalled the inference that the victim\u2019s silence was inconsistent with her present formal complaint of rape. 4 J. Wigmore, [supra, \u00a7 1135]. In other words, evidence admitted under this doctrine effectively served as \u2018anticipatory rebuttal,\u2019 in that the doctrine often permitted the prosecutor to bolster the credibility of the victim before her credibility had first been attacked. Id. The \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 doctrine thus constituted a rare exception to the common-law rule that prohibited rehabilitative evidence in the absence of an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility. Id.; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[id.,] \u00a7 1124; 1 McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 47 (4th ed. 1992).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks, </em>supra, 891 S.W.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">This court expressly adopted the fresh complaint doctrine in <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830), in which we stated that \u201con an indictment for rape . . . such evidence is received to shew <em>constancy </em>in the declarations of the witness. If a female testifies, that such an outrage has been committed on her person, an enquiry is, at once, suggested, why it was not communicated to her female friends.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Forty-six years later, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153 (1876), we expanded the rule to permit the state to introduce testimony concerning the details of the complaint. We explained our reason for doing so as follows: \u201cWhy has the rule been adopted that in prosecutions for rape . . . the public prosecutor may show that the woman on whom the assault was made complained of it to her friends? It is simply because such a course would be natural if the crime had been committed, but very unnatural if it had not been. But her natural impulses would prompt her to tell all the details of the transaction. Why, on the same principle, ought not her statement of the details to be evidence? If her story were untrue, the greater would be the opportunity for detection, and the accused would be helped in his defense. If her story were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth would the more clearly appear.\u201d Id., 156-57. This extension of the fresh complaint rule became known as the constancy of accusation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In accordance with the rationale of <em>Kinney, </em>our era-rent rule allows the state to introduce the fact of the complaint and the details of the complaint once the victim has testified regarding the alleged sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom a complaint had been made. Subject to a determination by the trial court that the proffered evidence is more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>probative than prejudicial, the state may introduce the constancy of accusation testimony of each of the persons to whom the complainant had reported the sexual assault. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 769, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982) (constancy testimony by neighbor, doctor and police officers); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 525, 442 A.2d 927 (1982) (constancy testimony by police officers, mother-in-law and social worker); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>161 Conn. 291, 294, 287 A.2d 386 (1971) (constancy testimony by grandmother, friend, mother, teacher and police officer); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zoravali, </em>34 Conn. App. 428, 440, 641 A.2d 796, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 921 (1994) (constancy testimony by police officers, three social workers and nurse). Finally, the complaint need not have been made promptly after the commission of the alleged offense; any delay in reporting is to be considered by the fact finder in evaluating the weight of the constancy of accusation testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 291, 592 A.2d 943 (1991) (\u201c \u2018[w]hatever delay took place between the time of the attack and the time the victim first told witnesses of it does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, but merely presents a question of fact for the trier as to the weight to be given it\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra, 529 (same). Since <em>Kinney, </em>we have consistently rejected attempts either to eliminate or to modify the doctrine. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>supra, 768 (rejecting claim that constancy of accusation doctrine was no longer viable); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 199-203, 506 A.2d 118 (1986) (legislature\u2019s elimination of corroboration as requirement for sex offenses does not require change in constancy of accusation doctrine); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>supra, 292 (refusing to adopt dictum from earlier case that would have required complaint to be made within \u201c \u2018natural\u2019 \u201d time); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 564 (declining review of unpreserved claim that constancy doctrine is \u201coutmoded and clearly anachronistic\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Today, every state but California<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> permits the prosecution to introduce evidence of a rape victim\u2019s complaint in its case-in-chief. The vast majority of jurisdictions, however, limits such evidence to testimony concerning the fact of the complaint; the details of the complaint are not admissible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Connecticut is one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of only five states<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that continues to permit testimony regarding the details of a sexual assault victim\u2019s complaint even if such testimony is not otherwise admissible either as a prior consistent statement introduced to rebut a claim of recent fabrication or under the excited utterance hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Several jurisdictions have recently reconsidered the continued vitality of the fresh complaint doctrine. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Cal. 4th 746, 883 P.2d 949, 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 407 (1994); <em>Battle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>630 A.2d 211 (D.C. 1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 121 N.J. 150. The highest court of each of these jurisdictions has concluded that the assumptions that originally gave rise to the doctrine are no longer tenable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cIndisputably, one of the historic premises of the doctrine \u2014 that it is natural for the victim of a sexual assault to complain promptly following the assault \u2014 has been discredited substantially in contemporary times. The overwhelming body of current empirical studies, data, and other infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>mation establishes that it is <em>not </em>inherently \u2018natural\u2019 for the victim to confide in someone or to disclose, immediately following commission of the offense, that he or she was sexually assaulted.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 758; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks, </em>supra, 891 S.W.2d 604 (rule has \u201cits genesis in . . . profoundly sexist expectation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 658, 591 N.E.2d 672 (1992) (doctrine has \u201cits origins in outmoded, and invalid, sexual myths\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 164 (rule founded on \u201csexist notions of how a woman should act after she has been raped\u201d). At the same time, these courts have also recognized that many people still adhere to the belief that a rape victim ordinarily will report the crime and that the failure of the victim to do so casts doubt on the credibility of the accusation. Consequently, most of the jurisdictions that have had occasion to consider the continued efficacy of the doctrine have decided to retain it in recognition of the unfortunate fact that the prejudices underlying the doctrine remain all too prevalent in our society. \u201c[0]ur judicial process cannot remove from every juror all subtle biases or illogical views of the world. The fresh-complaint rule responds to those jurors on their own terms.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 164; <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>81 N.Y.2d 10, 17, 611 N.E.2d 265, 595 N.Y.S.2d 364 (1993); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks, </em>supra, 604 (\u201cuntil the \u2018presumption\u2019 that the victim\u2019s testimony is a fabrication disappears, we must retain the doctrine of \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Although we agree that the assumptions underlying the constancy of accusation doctrine are unfounded, we are also cognizant of the fact that those misconceptions are not uncommon. We are particularly in accord with the view expressed by the Supreme Court of New Jersey in its attempt to balance the various interests involved: \u201cSociety\u2019s perception and understanding of rape is changing. Yet, no one contends that subtle and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>overt bias against women victims of rape has been eradicated. Hence, we hesitate to discard the benefit of this rule to a woman who does complain without a clearer understanding of the burdens the rule may impose on the woman who does not complain. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\u201cIf we were to eliminate the fresh-complaint rule, rape victims would suffer whenever members of the jury held prejudices that women who do not complain have not really been raped. If we limit the fresh-complaint rule to the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule, allowing the admission of spontaneous or excited utterances, then women who had not complained very shortly after the crime would not be able to have their complaints admitted into evidence. . . . [Permitting] third-hand testimony of a rape complaint only in response to defense counsel\u2019s impeachment of the woman complainant on the grounds that she recently fabricated the charges . . . would allow the defense, and not the State, to control the circumstances under which the subject of a prior complaint is raised. As a result, the issue of a prior complaint would arise in a context prejudicial to the victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 121 N.J. 164-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">On the other hand, a defendant has an interest in not being unreasonably burdened by such accrediting or supporting evidence, which, as the defendant here correctly maintains, generally is not admissible in the trial of crimes other than sexual assault.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Concerns about such evidence are magnified if the victim has reported the alleged offense to a number of persons, all of whom are permitted to testify about the details of the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>plaint. In such circumstances, there is an enhanced risk that the jury may be unduly swayed by the repeated iteration of the constancy of accusation testimony. Indeed, one commentator has opined that testimony by multiple witnesses about the facts of the victim\u2019s complaint may so unfairly bolster the victim\u2019s credibility that, in such cases, \u201ccross-examination of the victim is not a sufficient protection from prejudice.\u201d C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (Sup. 1995) \u00a7 11.22.1, p. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Our evaluation of these competing considerations persuades us that the scope of our current doctrine is broader than necessary to protect against the unwarranted, but nonetheless persistent, view that a sexual assault victim who does not report the crime cannot be trusted to testily truthfully about the incident. Although we are not yet willing to reject the constancy of accusation doctrine completely due to biases still extant in our society, we are persuaded that restricting the evidence adduced thereunder to testimony regarding the fact of the complaint provides a more reasonable accommodation of the interests of the defendant, the state and the victim than does our current rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In deciding to modify our constancy of accusation rule, we are not unmindful of the important role that the doctrine of stare decisis plays in our system of justice. Stare decisis, however, is not an end in itself. See, e.g., <em>Kluttz </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>228 Conn. 401, 406, 636 A.2d 816 (1994). Thus, \u201c[principles of law which serve one generation well may, by reason of changing conditions, disserve a later one. . . . Experience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>v. <em>Sharon Hospital, </em>188 Conn. 1, 17-18, 448 A.2d 190 (1982). \u201cThe flexibility and capacity of the common law is its genius for growth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>and adaptation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 199. We conclude that our previous rule no longer provides the most appropriate accommodation between the competing interests involved in sexual assault cases.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that a person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>tity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported. In determining whether to permit such testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In addition, the defendant is entitled to an instruction that any delay by the victim in reporting the incident is a matter for the jury to consider in evaluating the weight of the victim\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Finally, we conclude that the modification of the rule that we announce today will apply only to those cases in which constancy of accusation testimony has not yet been admitted into evidence on the date of the publication of this opinion. As we have previously indicated, our decision to modify the constancy of accusation doctrine is based solely on policy considerations and not on constitutional grounds. Consistent with our resolution of the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment claim; see part I of this opinion; we are not persuaded that the introduction of the details of the complaint for corroborative purposes violates the fair trial rights of defendants in sexual assault cases. Furthermore, we have frequently given only prospective effect to changes based strictly on policy considerations that do not carry constitutional implications. See, e.g., <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>230 Conn. 795, 806, 646 A.2d 806 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 397, 645 A.2d 535 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645-46, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 129 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 40, 540 A.2d 42 (1988).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, we see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>reason to order a new trial in this or any other case in which testimony had been properly permitted under our former version of the constancy of accusation doctrine.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to strike the testimony of an expert witness for the state, Beverly DeLoatch, because she had violated the court\u2019s sequestration order. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On the day before the commencement of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for an order requiring the sequestration of the state\u2019s witnesses<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a and Practice Book \u00a7 876.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> DeLoatch, the counselor at the New Haven Rape Crisis Center to whom the victim had reported the attack, testified for the state, both as a constancy of accusation witness and as an expert on rape trauma syndrome. During cross-examination, DeLoatch acknowledged that sometime prior to testifying she had perused a document <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that \u201cmight have been\u201d a copy of the written statement given by the victim to the police. DeLoatch further testified, however, that her recitation of the details of the sexual assault was based solely on her conversations with the victim and not on the written statement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Furthermore, no evidence was adduced as to whether DeLoatch had reviewed the document before or after the sequestration order was entered. Finally, DeLoatch indicated that she had taken no notes during her conversations with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The defendant maintains that DeLoatch\u2019s review of the written statement constituted a violation of the trial court\u2019s sequestration order. He claims that because DeLoatch had kept no notes of her discussions with the victim, DeLoatch\u2019s trial testimony must have been based upon her reading of the victim\u2019s statement. The state contends, first, that the record is inadequate to review this claim because there is no evidence to establish that DeLoatch reviewed the statement subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>to the trial court\u2019s order, and, second, that even if DeLoatch did read the statement after the sequestration order had been entered, her doing so did not violate the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The defendant concedes that \u201cthe record is . . . ambiguous as to the exact date on which Ms. DeLoatch reviewed the complainant\u2019s statement,\u201d yet claims error on the ground that \u201cthe spirit of the sequestration order\u201d was violated. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument as frivolous. As the appellant, the defendant bears the burden of providing a record sufficient for review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061. A record that fails to disclose whether an alleged violation of a trial court\u2019s order occurred before or after the order was entered is plainly inadequate.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The defendant next claims that he was denied a fair trial in violation of his due process rights under the federal and state constitutions<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> because: (1) the state amended the charging information shortly before the commencement of jury selection, thereby depriving him of adequate notice of the charges against him; and (2) the state, in violation of the trial court\u2019s discovery order, failed to disclose a laboratory report for several months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>after the report was issued. We are not persuaded by either of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The original information filed by the state charged the defendant with two counts of sexual assault. Several months before trial, the state amended the information by adding a charge of unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95. On the day before jury selection commenced, the state filed a second amended information that charged the defendant with kidnapping in the first degree, a class A felony, in lieu of the charge of unlawful restraint in the first degree, a class D felony. The defendant moved to strike the second amended information and to reinstate the first amended information solely on the ground that the state had filed the kidnapping charge in retaliation for a speedy trial motion that the defendant had filed. The trial court concluded that the state\u2019s action was not retaliatory and, accordingly, denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The defendant now asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the late amendment deprived him of adequate notice of the charges against him in violation of due process. The defendant, however, expressly disavowed this claim in his argument to the trial court in support of his motion to strike.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Thus, the record below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>contains nothing to substantiate the defendant\u2019s contention on appeal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because \u201c[t]he defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his [unpreserved] claim of constitutional error\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); he cannot prevail on his claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to strike the second amended information.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">The defendant also contends that his right to a fair trial was violated because the state failed to provide him with a laboratory report until the second day of jury selection, approximately six months after the report was completed. He claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude this evidence. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">The defendant\u2019s comprehensive discovery motion was granted on January 6, 1993. On October 29, 1993, the prosecution turned over a laboratory report dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>April 30,1993, which contained the results of certain testing that the state had conducted on several articles of the victim\u2019s clothing. The report indicated that seminal fluid was present on the clothing. The record does not reflect when the state initially received the report or why the report was not provided to the defendant earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Upon receipt of the report, the defendant sought a postponement of the evidentiary portion of the trial until November 8, and the trial court, on November 1, granted the defendant\u2019s request.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> On November 4, after a defense expert had reviewed the laboratory report and examined the clothing, the defendant filed a motion to exclude the results of the testing conducted by the state on the ground that certain tests that he wanted to have performed on the clothing would require too lengthy a delay of the trial. In argument to the trial court, the defendant explained that the testing procedures would have taken several weeks to complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 741 governs the defendant\u2019s right to information and materials from the state. At the time of the trial, that provision provided in relevant part as follows: \u201cUpon a written motion made by a defendant . . . the prosecuting authority . . . shall disclose in writing the existence of and allow the defendant to inspect, copy, photograph and have reasonable tests made on any of the following relevant materials . . . (6) Copies of results or reports of scientific tests, experiments or comparisons made in connection with the particular case . . . which are material to the preparation of the defense or are intended for use by the prosecuting authority as evidence in chief at the trial . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 747<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> gives the trial court broad leeway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to determine what sanction, if any, may be appropriate if the state fails to comply with the rules of discovery. <em>State </em>v. Cosgrove, 186 Conn. 476, 489, 442 A.2d 1320 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>181 Conn. 299, 310, 435 A.2d 334 (1980). The question before us, then, is whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The primary purpose of a sanction for violation of a discovery order is to ensure that the defendant\u2019s rights are protected, not to exact punishment on the state for its allegedly improper conduct. As we have indicated, the formulation of an appropriate sanction is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court. However, \u201c[suppression of relevant, material and otherwise admissible evidence is a severe sanction which should not be invoked lightly.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980). \u201cIn determining what sanction is appropriate for failure to comply with court ordered discovery, the trial court should consider the reason why disclosure was not made, the extent of prejudice, if any, to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">We conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the laboratory report. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s request for a postponement of the trial, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the court would have rejected an application by the defendant for an additional continuance so that his expert could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>have conducted further tests on the clothing. The defendant, however, elected not to seek a further continuance. In addition, the defendant has not alleged, or proven, that the state intentionally withheld the report to gain a tactical advantage or for some other improper purpose. Finally, the defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice flowing from the late disclosure of the report, with respect to either his speedy trial rights or his ability to present a defense.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant has not satisfied his burden of establishing that the trial court improperly failed to prohibit the state from introducing the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), kidnapping in the first degree, is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Section 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) provides that a \u201cperson is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and ... he restrains the person abducted with intent to . . . inflict physical injury upon him or violate or abuse him sexually.\u201d As defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (1), \u201c \u2018[rjestrain\u2019 means to restrict a person\u2019s movements intentionally and unlawfully in such a manner as to interfere substantially with his liberty by moving him from one place to another, or by confining him either in the place where the restriction commences or in a place to which he has been moved, without consent. ...\u201d As charged in the information, the defendant was accused of confining the defendant in the place where the restriction commenced.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The defendant claims that because \u00a7\u00a7 53a-92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>(a) (2) (A) and 53a-91 (1) do not define a minimum period of time necessary to constitute impermissible confinement, the statute is unconstitutionally vague because, \u201c[theoretically, the briefest, most incidental constraint would, if combined with the other elements, warrant a charge of kidnapping.\u201d The defendant also claims that under those statutory provisions, the restraint necessary to effect the sexual assault would itself constitute confinement, thereby allowing a jury to convict a defendant of kidnapping in the first degree solely on the basis of proof of a sexual assault, a result which, the defendant maintains, gives rise to the \u201cspecter of standardless law enforcement.\u201d Whatever possible merit these arguments might have in another factual setting, they fail under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cDue process requires that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know whatris prohibited and provide explicit standards for those who apply them in order to prevent the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. ... In a case such as this, where first amendment freedoms are not implicated, a claim that a statute is void for vagueness is determined by its applicability to the particular facts presented. . . . The fact that a statutory provision may be of questionable applicability in speculative situations is usually immaterial if the challenged provision applies to the conduct of the defendant in the case at issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 502-503, 594 A.2d 906 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The defendant has not established that the challenged statutory provisions are impermissibly vague as applied to this case. The state adduced evidence that the defendant refused to allow the victim to leave his apartment several times before, during and after the sexual assault took place. The victim first attempted to leave the defendant\u2019s apartment when she realized that he was not interested in going shopping with her. The defendant, ignoring the victim\u2019s repeated requests that she be permitted to return to her car, prevented her from doing so by kneeling down in front of her and forcing her to remain on the couch. When the victim resisted and sought to leave, the defendant succeeded in pulling her down to the floor. The victim eventually managed to escape his grasp and, once again, tried to flee. The defendant, however, barred her departure by force. Finally, after the defendant had sexually assaulted the victim, he detained her in the apartment until he had finished dressing. Thus, the defendant restrained the victim for a considerable period of time by repeatedly and forcibly thwarting her efforts to leave the apartment. As we have previously noted in considering a vagueness claim similar to that made by the defendant, \u201c[w]hile we recognize that there are conceivable factual situations in which charging a defendant with kidnapping based upon the most minuscule [duration of confinement] would result in an absurd and unconscionable result . . . we do not find this case to present such a situation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

In a subsequent conversation with McCall, the victim pointed out the apartment in which the sexual assault took place, which could be seen from McCall\u2019s residence. The victim, however, did not reveal the defendant\u2019s identity to McCall.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">Dixon, a close friend of the victim, testified that sometime in August, 1992, the victim, who had been acting \u201cvery strange, very quiet, very closed,\u201d revealed to Dixon that she had been sexually assaulted. The victim told Dixon that the perpetrator\u2019s name was Floyd, that she had met him while she was taking a walk, and that he had raped her when she stopped by his apartment to pick him up to go shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">DeLoateh, a counselor and assistant director of the New Haven Rape Crisis Center, testified that the victim contacted her by telephone in August, 1992. She informed DeLoateh that she had been sexually assaulted several days earlier. The victim, who told DeLoateh the defendant\u2019s last name, also explained that she had been acquainted with the defendant for a few months and that she had met him while taking a walk.

Both the tape and a transcript of the interview were admitted into evidence under the constancy of accusation doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> Following McCall\u2019s testimony, the trial court properly instructed the jury that his testimony was admissible solely to assist the jury in assessing the victim\u2019s credibility and not as substantive proof of the alleged sexual assault.

The United States Supreme Court has never expressly considered the question of whether an out-of-court statement that is not introduced for substantive purposes is nevertheless subject to the same confrontation clause analysis as is an out-of-court statement introduced solely for purposes of impeachment or corroboration, although it has intimated that the same analysis may appertain.

Moreover, we recognize that the defendant, on cross-examination of a constancy witness, may elicit details of the victim\u2019s complaint for the purpose of demonstrating inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s trial testimony about the sexual assault and the victim\u2019s report of the incident. In such cases, the effect of our modification of the constancy of accusation doctrine is merely to shift the timing of the introduction into evidence of the details. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kendricks, </em>supra, 891 S.W.2d 603 (excluding details from state\u2019s case-in-chief serves to require \u201ccourts to condition the admissibility of the details of the complaint upon the most fundamental principle governing the admissibility of a prior consistent statement \u2014 that the victim\u2019s credibility must have already been attacked before the rehabilitative evidence is admissible\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> We note, for example, that the probative value of any such evidence may be greatly diminished, or even eliminated, in the rare case in which the defendant, in advance of trial, stipulates that the only contested issue is that of the identity of the perpetrator and not the actual occurrence of the sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> Moreover, to apply our new rule retrospectively would place unreasonable burdens on the state and on victims whose constancy of accusation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>testimony was admitted in justified reliance on our prior consistently applied law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> Our decision to give only prospective effect to the modification of the doctrine is buttressed by the fact that the issue was raised, sua sponte, by the court and not raised by the parties prior to our order requesting supplemental briefing.

I am pleased that the majority has trimmed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sails of the rule pertaining to constancy of accusation evidence in sexual assault cases; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>229 Conn. 557, 575-79, 643 A.2d 854 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but I feel it has not gone far enough to ameliorate the prejudice to defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">I agree that the elimination of the details of the alleged sexual assault will reduce some of the prejudice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>defendant, but, without further restrictions, the prejudicial impact of the constancy evidence still outweighs its probative value. This court justifies the continuation of the rule in a modified form in part on the ground that constancy evidence is admissible \u201conly to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d As any trial lawyer can attest, prosecutor or defense counsel, this distinction is academic in the real world of criminal trials. It is clear that the prejudicial impact of constancy evidence is not eliminated merely because the trial judge instructs the jury that it is admitted only for corroboration. The distinction between corroborative evidence and substantive evidence has no meaning to the average juror. Constancy of accusation evidence bolsters the victim\u2019s courtroom story, rendering it more credible as if there was another witness to the sexual assault. See <em>Krulewitch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>336 U.S. 440, 453, 69 S. Ct. 716, 93 L. Ed. 790 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring) (\u201c[t]he naive assumption that prejudicial effects can be overcome by instructions to the jury . . . all practicing lawyers know to be unmitigated fiction\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The sole justification for maintaining any form of the rule is the belief that some jurors may adhere to a sexist presumption of fabrication or consent unless the victim complains to a third party, because they believe that it would be natural, and expected, for a woman who had been sexually assaulted to complain. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>522 N.W.2d 304, 308 (Iowa 1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>121 N.J. 150, 158-63, 578 A.2d 370 (1990); 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence (4th Ed. 1972) \u00a7 1135. I must concede that there may be some jurors, who are able to survive the vigorous jury voir dire conducted by the state, who may harbor such a notion. That belief, however, more likely than not, will impact jury deliberations only when there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>some doubt whether the victim was in fact assaulted, and not in cases where the only issue is the identity of the assailant. Accordingly, I would limit the admissibility of constancy of accusation evidence solely to those instances where the defendant, either through cross-examination or direct testimony, asserts that the victim was not sexually assaulted, either because the sexual intercourse at question was consensual or because it never occurred. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>State, </em>44 Ala. App. 479, 480, 213 So. 2d 664 (1968) (\u201ccomplaint in rape and statutory rape is admissible ... to show conduct by the prosecutrix which is consistent\u201d); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State, </em>171 Ga. App. 478, 481, 320 S.E.2d 597 (1984) (\u201cin a prosecution for rape, the fact of the woman\u2019s having made complaint soon after the assault took place is admissible in evidence for the purpose of rebutting the idea that the female consented\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State v. Wells, </em>supra, 308 (\u201cjustification for admitting such statements is to thwart the . . . assumption that the offense did not occur in the absence of a complaint\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 163 (fresh complaint rule \u201callows the State to negate the inference that the victim was not sexually assaulted because of her silence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Although the scope of the details to which a constancy of accusation witness may testify have been narrowed, this court continues to permit a witness to testify as to \u201cthe identity of the alleged perpetrator.\u201d If the singular concern that justifies the rule relates to the improper inference jurors may draw from a victim\u2019s silence, then the prosecution should only be allowed \u201cto forestall this . . . assumption by showing that the woman was <em>not silent, </em>i.e., that <em>a complaint was in fact made\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) 4 J. Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 1135, p. 299; see also <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 44 Ala. App. 480 (constancy of accusation testimony is not admitted for corroboration, thus details of complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>are not admissible); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>supra, 522 N.W.2d 308 (\u201cunderlying details of the complaint are immaterial to the purpose of the offer and inadmissible\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 121 N.J. 163 (\u201c[o]nly the fact of the complaint, not the details, is admissible\u201d). The testimony of a constancy of accusation witness should be confined to the fact that the victim complained of being assaulted. Therefore, the name or identity of the accused should be excluded. See <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>State, </em>273 Ala. 337, 345, 139 So. 2d 309 (1961) (\u201cIn prosecutions for rape the State may, on the direct examination of the prosecutrix, prove the bare fact that she made complaint of the injury, and when and to whom .... This would exclude any statement made in the complaint pointing out the identity of the person accused . . . .\u201d); <em>Register </em>v. <em>State, </em>640 So. 2d 3, 9 (Ala. Crim. App. 1993); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 171 Ga. App. 481-82; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Ill. App. 3d 303, 307, 279 N.E.2d 8 (1971) (\u201cperson to whom the complaint was made can properly testify to the fact that it was made, although it is not proper for such person to give the name of the accused\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>supra, 308; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 163. Of course, the accused, either through cross-examination or direct testimony, may open the door for the admission of the details of the victim\u2019s complaint, including the identity of the alleged assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Furthermore, the rule should be returned to its original parameters and restricted to a fresh complaint; see <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830); which was \u201cmade within a reasonable time after the alleged assault and must have been spontaneous and voluntary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>supra, 121 N.J. 163. \u201c[Statements that are procured by pointed, inquisitive, coercive interrogation lack the degree of voluntariness necessary to qualify under the fresh-complaint rule.\u201d Id., 167. Voluntariness, however, must be determined on a case-by-case basis and left to the discretion of the trial court. \u201cAmong the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>factors a court should consider in making that determination are the age of the victim; the circumstances under which the interrogation takes place; the victim\u2019s relationship with the interrogator, i.e., relative, friend, professional counselor, or authoritarian figure; who initiated the discussion; the type of questions asked \u2014 whether they are leading and their specificity regarding the alleged abuser and the acts alleged.\u201d Id., 168. Finally, the trial court should be instructed that, it may, within its discretion, exclude cumulative fresh-complaint evidence. \u201c[I]n close cases in which the victim\u2019s complaint has already been once established and it appears that repeated fresh-complaint testimony would leave the jury with the impression that the State has gathered a greater number of witnesses than the defense, the trial court may properly exercise its discretion and exclude the testimony.\u201d Id., 169-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It is worthwhile to note, as the majority appears to underscore, that the bottom line regarding the admissibility of any constancy evidence remains within the discretion of the trial judge. Therefore, even if an offer of constancy evidence by the state does not include the details of the alleged sexual assault, the trial court must still weigh whether its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value, so as to determine whether to further limit the testimony in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this concurrence or to reject the offered constancy testimony in total.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In summary, I would limit the rule as follows: (1) constancy evidence would be admissible only if the defendant, either through cross-examination or through direct testimony, asserts that the victim was not in fact sexually assaulted; (2) the complaint must be made within a reasonable time after the alleged assault, or any delay must be reasonably explained; (3) the victim\u2019s complaint must be voluntarily made; (4) constancy testimony must be confined, on direct, to the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>victim complained, and should not contain details of the complaint, including the identity of the alleged assailant; and (5) the trial judge has discretion to exclude cumulative constancy evidence. Only then would the rule have been trimmed in a manner that does not exceed its purpose, while minimizing the prejudicial impact on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As a matter of public policy, the constancy of accusation evidence rule may be justified if circumscribed as indicated above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In my view, the contours of the rule adopted today by the court continue to exceed that which is required to meet its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In all other respects, I concur with the majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 575-79, I wrote in dissent: \u201cI continue to be concerned about the contours of the rule admitting constancy of accusation evidence in sexual assault cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 573, 638 A.2d 578 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). In the present case, on appeal, the defendant argues that the rule is founded on premises that are anachronistic, outmoded and sexist.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">si: * *</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">\u201cSimply put, the hearsay exception of constancy of accusation is predicated on the assumption that unless the victim \u2014 who in most instances is a female \u2014 announces to the world that she has been a victim of a sex crime, her credibility is suspect. Indeed, the majority endorses this justification when it states that \u2018it would be natural for the victim of actual or attempted sexual assault to relate the incident to others if it had actually happened, but not if the incident had not occurred.\u2019 I find this rationale to be offensive. We do not engage in this reasoning with respect to any other crime involving an adult victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\u201cFurthermore, the empirical assertion that an actual victim of sexual assault would naturally relate the incident to others stands in opposition to the real experiences of women reported in the literature. S. Estrich, \u2018Rape,\u2019 95 Yale L.J. 1087, 1088-89 (1986). In addition, the second assumption underlying this empirical claim \u2014 \u2018but not if the incident had not occurred\u2019 \u2014 defies common sense. If anything, the rule gives a person who has fabricated an assault an incentive to report the crime and its \u2018details\u2019 to friends and acquaintances. Therefore, constancy evidence not only has its origin in a sexist assumption, but allows inherently unreliable evidence to support a criminal conviction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\"> I continue to have serious reservations about whether the constancy of accusation rule of evidence violates the confrontation clause of the United States constitution. (State constitution was not raised by the defendant.) See <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 573, 638 A.2d 578 (1994) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting). I also question the continued validity of the 1970 case of <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970) (\u201cConfrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination\u201d). Nevertheless, because the defendant relies solely on the federal constitution, and <em>Green </em>has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>specifically overruled by the United States Supreme Court, I leave this issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-15\"> In other situations, where we have allowed collateral evidence for the purpose of bolstering the credibility of the victim, that evidence did not also indicate guilt as does constancy evidence. For example, in <em>State </em>v. Borrelli, 227 Conn. 153, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993), we allowed expert evidence on the battered woman\u2019s syndrome to be presented, but only after the complaining witness was impeached. In that situation, the nature of the expert testimony did not implicate the guilt of the defendant for the specific crime for which he was being tried. Rather, it merely gave a scientific explanation for the apparent inconsistency of the complaining witness\u2019 trial testimony and her prior out-of-court statements.
