J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6F\">This appeal requires us to decide whether General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23c,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which protects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>certain classes of tenants from dispossession, limits the right of a mortgagee after foreclosure to obtain, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-22,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an execution of a judgment of ejectment against a protected tenant. The trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>against the defendants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> including the tenant in possession of the mortgaged property, Carmel Sullivan, and in favor of the substitute plaintiff, Berkeley Federal Bank and Trust, FSB (Berkeley).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, the trial court issued an execution of a judgment of ejectment against Sullivan, but stayed execution of the judgment pending appeal. Sullivan appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">For the purposes of this appeal, the relevant facts are undisputed. Because Sullivan is over sixty-two years of age and has certain physical disabilities, she meets the requirements of a protected tenant of a condominium unit under \u00a7 47a-23c (a) (1) (A) and (B). She has paid and continues to pay fair rent in the amount of $600 each month. Berkeley does not have good cause to evict Sullivan under \u00a7 47a-23c (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The plaintiff mortgagee filed a complaint against Sullivan, and others, seeking strict foreclosure and other relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the trial court, <em>Hon. Anthony V. DeMayo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>state trial referee, rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure against the defendants,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Sullivan moved to open the judgment. The trial court, <em>Hon. Donald W. Celotto, </em>state trial referee, granted the motion in order to allow Sullivan to preserve a defense of protection from dispossession pursuant to \u00a7 47a-23c in the event that Berkeley sought an execution of the judgment of ejectment, and later reentered the judgment nunc pro tunc.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">After none of the defendants, including Sullivan, redeemed on the assigned law days, Berkeley moved for possession and an execution of the judgment of ejectment against Sullivan. The trial court, <em>Hon. Donald W. Celotto, </em>state trial referee, granted the motion, concluding that \u00a7 47a-23c does not protect a tenant in possession from ejectment pursuant to \u00a7 49-22. The trial court stayed its judgment pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">On appeal to this court, Sullivan claims that \u00a7 47a-23c applies to any proceeding to dispossess a protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tenant, including a proceeding for an execution of a judgment of ejectment after a judgment of strict foreclosure has been rendered. Berkeley claims, to the contrary, that the applicable statute is \u00a7 49-22, which authorizes an execution of a judgment of ejectment without regard to \u00a7 47a-23c, which, according to Berkeley, relates solely to summary process proceedings. We agree with Sullivan.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Resolution of the issue presented by this appeal requires a reconciliation of two statutes that lie at the conjunction of mortgage law and landlord tenant law. One statute confers rights upon a mortgagee and the other confers rights upon the mortgagor\u2019s tenants. In undertaking our analysis of the proper realm of each statute, we are \u201cguided by well established principles of statutory construction. Statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the [statutes themselves], to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [their] enactment, to the legislative policy [they were] designed to implement, and to [their] relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matterfs]. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 656, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 755-56, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Our task of statutory construction is guided further by the fact that \u201c\u00a7 47a-23c is a remedial statute intended to benefit elderly, blind and physically disabled ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ants.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>215 Conn. 367, 373, 576 A.2d 469 (1990); see 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1980 Sess., p. 5327, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano; 23 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1980 Sess., pp. 1393-94, remarks of Senator Clifton A. Leonhardt. As such, the statute must be \u201cconstrued liberally in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit\u201d in order to effect the legislative intent. <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 373; see <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 757; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122, 140, 653 A.2d 798 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, we must answer two questions. First, does the protection afforded to tenants by \u00a7 47a-23c have any applicability in the context of an action by a mortgagee under \u00a7 49-22 to obtain possession of the mortgaged premises after foreclosure? Second, if \u00a7 47a-23c is applicable, how are the terms of the two statutes to be reconciled? We conclude that both questions should be answered to afford Sullivan the rights conferred upon her by \u00a7 47a-23c.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">We must first determine whether the circumstances of this case implicate \u00a7 47a-23c as well as \u00a7 49-22. The parties agree that, as a general matter, \u00a7 49-22 authorizes a mortgagee to obtain possession of foreclosed property from a mortgagor\u2019s tenant in possession. Berkeley disagrees, however, with Sullivan\u2019s contention that \u00a7 47a-23c affords the right to prevent ejectment to a mortgagor\u2019s tenant after foreclosure. We conclude that the fact of a foreclosure, under the circumstances of this case, does not preclude a tenant from invoking the rights conferred by \u00a7 47a-23c.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The crucial question is the scope of \u00a7 47a-23c. That statute provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o <em>landlord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>may bring an <em>action </em>of summary process <em>oro ther action </em>to dispossess a [protected] <em>tenant . . </em>. except\u201d for good cause. (Emphasis added.) Berkeley argues that it is not a \u201clandlord,\u201d that its motion for an execution on its judgment of ejectment after foreclosure is not an \u201caction\u201d and that, after foreclosure, Sullivan is no longer a \u201ctenant.\u201d We disagree. The terms \u201clandlord,\u201d \u201caction\u201d and \u201ctenant\u201d are each defined by statute in a manner that brings this case within \u00a7 47a-23c.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Berkeley fits the definition of \u201clandlord\u201d because it holds absolute title to the condominium unit. A \u201clandlord\u201d is defined as \u201cthe owner ... of the dwelling unit . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l (d). \u201cOwner\u201d is defined as \u201cone or more persons, jointly or severally, in whom is vested ... all or part of the legal title to property . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l (e). Berkeley became the owner, and thus the landlord, when the entire legal title to the condominium unit became vested in it as a result of the foreclosure judgment and the passing of the law days.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Barbara Weisman, Trustee </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>Kaspar, </em>233 Conn. 531, 551, 661 A.2d 530 (1995) (\u201cjudgment of strict foreclosure in favor of senior mortgagee vests absolute title in the foreclosing plaintiff, upon the failure of the junior mortgagees who are parties defendant to redeem the property\u201d); <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>128 Conn. 697, 700, 25 A.2d 650 (1942) (upon failure to redeem, title becomes absolute in mortgagee); <em>City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>120 Conn. 16, 25, 179 A. 339 (1935) (\u201c[w]here a foreclosure decree has become absolute by the passing of the law days, the outstanding rights of redemption have been cut off and the title has become unconditional in the [mortgagee]\u201d); <em>Nourse </em>v. <em>Lycett, </em>114 Conn. 432, 437, 159 A. 277 (1932) (judgment of foreclosure determines \u201cdebt and the absolute title of the mortgagee after the law day\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Berkeley next claims that a motion for an execution of the judgment of ejectment, pursuant to an action for foreclosure, is not an \u201caction,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 47a-23c and defined in General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, Berkeley contends that the codification of \u00a7 47a-23c in the summary process chapter of the landlord and tenant title implies a corresponding limitation in the scope of the phrases \u201cother action to dispossess a tenant\u201d in \u00a7 47a-23c (b) (1) and \u201cany other proceeding in which rights are determined\u201d in the definition of \u201caction.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l (a), footnote 9. Despite this broad statutory language, Berkeley argues that \u00a7 47a-23c applies only to actions brought pursuant to statutes contained in title 47a, denominated Landlord and Tenant. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Section 47a-23c (b) (1) protects certain classes of tenants from eviction through \u201can action of summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>process or <em>other action to dispossess a tenant. . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cAction\u201d is expansively defined in part as \u201cany other proceeding in which rights are determined, including an action for possession.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-l (a). Although \u00a7 47a-23c does not explicitly state that it applies to a motion for ejectment after foreclosure, we conclude that such a motion is an \u201caction to dispossess a tenant,\u201d and thus, is an \u201caction\u201d to which the statute applies. Cf. <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>159 Conn. 64, 69, 69 n.2, 266 A.2d 387 (1970) (applying summary process statute, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-42, to action to eject tenant brought in eminent domain proceeding). This conclusion follows from the language of the statute and is reinforced by the broad remedial purpose of the statute. <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 373. Because the method by which the landlord acquired title is wholly irrelevant to the statute\u2019s remedial purpose, namely, the protection of certain classes of tenants, it would be inconsistent with that remedial purpose to construe the statute to exclude protection for tenants whose landlords acquire title by foreclosure and seek possession through an execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Finally, we consider Berkeley\u2019s claim that Sullivan does not fit within the definition of \u201ctenant\u201d under \u00a7 47a-23c. We conclude that Sullivan is a \u201ctenant\u201d because she is a former tenant who became a tenant at sufferance. See <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 373 (holding that \u00a7 47a-23c protects former tenant within protected class who has become tenant at sufferance). The lease of a mortgagor\u2019s tenant, if the lease was subsequent to the mortgage, is extinguished upon foreclosure by the mortgagee and the passing of the law days without a redemption. See <em>Small Business Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>188 Conn. 286, 288-89, 449 A.2d 988 (1982) (mortgagor); <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Beach Hotel Corp., </em>113 Conn. 716, 720, 156 A. 865 (1931) (tenant); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>R. Kratovil &amp; R. Werner, Modern Mortgage Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1981) \u00a7 20.05; see also <em>City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 120 Conn. 25 (Upon foreclosure, \u201c[a]ll right and interest of subsequent incumbrancers [are] extinguished. The [mortgagee is] vested with absolute title in and dominion over the property.\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Extinction of the lease does not, however, make the tenant a trespasser. The tenant becomes a tenant at sufferance at the moment his or her rightful possession terminates. \u201cA tenancy at sufferance arises when a person who came into possession of land rightfully continues in possession wrongfully after his [or her] right thereto has terminated. <em>Welk </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>136 Conn. 603, 608-609, 73 A.2d 295 (1950).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 372; see <em>Small Business Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>supra, 288-89. Because Sullivan continued in possession after her rightful possession had ceased, she became a tenant at sufferance. As a tenant at sufferance, she is a \u201ctenant\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 47a-23c.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">For these reasons, we reject Berkeley\u2019s argument that \u00a7 47a-23c, by its own terms, has no applicability in the case of a motion for ejectment. Construed in light of its remedial purposes, the statute has applicability to Sullivan\u2019s rights under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Having concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 49-22 and 47a-23c both pertain to Berkeley\u2019s attempt to obtain possession of the foreclosed property occupied by Sullivan, we must next determine how these statutory provisions interact in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>particular factual circumstances of this case. Bearing in mind the remedial purpose of \u00a7 47a-23c, we conclude that its operative provisions prohibit the eviction of Sullivan by Berkeley in the absence of good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">As did the common law,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u00a7 49-22 permits a court, in its discretion and <em>if the mortgagee is so entitled, </em>to issue an execution of a judgment of ejectment in favor of the mortgagee after a successful action to foreclose the mortgage, as long as the person in possession is a party to the mortgage action. Section 49-22 (a) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]n any action brought for the foreclosure of a mortgage . . . the [mortgagee] may, in his complaint, demand possession of the land, and the court <em>may, </em>if it renders judgment in his favor and <em>finds that he is entitled to the possession of the land, </em>issue execution of ejectment . . . provided no execution shall issue against any person in possession who is not a party to the action . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Because \u00a7 49-22 requires the trial court to determine whether the mortgagee is entitled both to foreclosure<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to possession before issuing an execution of a judgment of ejectment, it expressly contemplates that there may exist circumstances in which a mortgagee is entitled to foreclosure, but is not entitled to possession. Indeed, courts have recognized that, \u201cin equity, title and possession of premises may not automatically be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>linked.\u201d <em>EMC Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 467, 469, 659 A.2d 212 (1995); see <em>Hite </em>v. <em>Field, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 70, 79, 462 A.2d 393 (1982) (permanently enjoining execution of judgment of ejectment because tenants in possession were not given notice of action in violation of right to due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Although \u00a7 49-22 fails to specify the circumstances under which a mortgagee would not be entitled to possession, we are persuaded that \u00a7 47a-23c identifies one such situation. Section 47a-23c evinces the legislative intent to protect certain classes of tenants from removal from their rental units, regardless of the identity of the landlord or the method by which the landlord acquired title. The legislature provided this protection for elderly tenants because \u201cit [would be] unfair, at that stage in people\u2019s [lives], once they are sixty-two, when they are often living on fixed incomes to tell them they have to leave their home[s]. The trauma that is involved, the loss of friends, the loss of a sense of community, the displacement from [perhaps] long established homes, the displacement from places of worship, from medical services. All these things create a very negative impact on elderly persons .... We are focusing on the people who do need the protection.\u201d 23 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1980 Sess., pp. 1393-94, remarks of Senator Clifton A. Leonhardt; see 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18, 1980 Sess., p. 5327, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Not only must we construe \u00a7 47a-23c broadly in light of its remedial purpose; <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 373; we must also assume that the legislature \u201cacted with knowledge of existing statutes<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and with an intent to create one consistent body of laws.\u201d <em>Zachs </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>207 Conn. 683, 696, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>542 A.2d 1145 (1988). The legislature, therefore, was aware when it enacted \u00a7 47a-23c that foreclosing mortgagees could pursue the ejectment of tenants in possession through \u00a7 49-22. It strikes us as highly unlikely that the legislature intended to exclude from the protective shield created by \u00a7 47a-23c those tenants whose landlords acquire ownership interests as foreclosing mortgagees.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 47a-23c shields tenants who qualify for its protections from executions of judgments of ejectment pursuant to \u00a7 49-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Berkeley argues, however, that when the legislature revised \u00a7 49-22 in 1984, extension of the protections afforded by \u00a7 47a-23c to a tenant of a defaulting mortgagor was a possibility that the legislature explicitly considered and rejected. We disagree. In 1984, the law revision commission proposed four alternate amendments to \u00a7 49-22 to the judiciary committee. These proposals were intended to strengthen the due process rights of a mortgagor\u2019s tenant upon foreclosure in response' to a Superior Court decision; <em>Hite </em>v. Field, supra, 38 Conn. Sup. 79; declaring the existing provision unconstitutional. See Law Revision Commission, Ninth Annual Report of the Connecticut Law Revision Commission to the General Assembly (1983) pp. H-2 to H-28. The fourth alternate proposal suggested that the legislature amend \u00a7 49-22 to require that all actions to dispossess a mortgagor\u2019s tenant be brought under the summary process statutes in order to ensure the vindi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>cation of the tenant\u2019s due process rights. Id., pp. H-9 to H-11, and H-26 to H-28. The judiciary committee, however, did not refer this proposal to the General Assembly. See 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1984 Sess., p. 3131, remarks of Representative Martin M. Looney (describing bill). Nothing in the proceedings before the General Assembly indicates that it expressly considered this option; see <em>Institute of Living </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>133 Conn. 258, 264-66, 50 A.2d 822 (1946) (unclear extent to which committee report before General Assembly influenced legislative committee or legislators); and we will not speculate about whether it considered the option sub silentio.
