J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGp\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the intent to cause death and the intent to cause serious physical injury are mutually exclusive states of mind under the circumstances of this case. After a jury trial, the defendant, Gregory Williams, was convicted of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assault in.the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment on the jury verdict and the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>reversed his convictions. <em>State </em>v. Williams, 39 Conn. App. 18, 663 A.2d 436 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth the facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cIn April, 1991, the defendant and the victim had been living together on and off for about five years, and had a two year old son. On April 12, 1991, the victim traveled to California with her parents and her son. After spending time in California, the victim\u2019s son returned to Connecticut with the victim\u2019s parents. The victim traveled to North Carolina to attend a training course offered by her employer. At that time, the victim decided not to resume living with the defendant upon her return. Accordingly, when she returned to Connecticut on April 19, she and her son moved in with her parents in Stratford.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">\u201cOn April 20,1991, the defendant came to the parents\u2019 home in Stratford looking for the victim. When the victim\u2019s father told the defendant that he was not welcome on the property and asked him to leave, the defendant began yelling at the victim\u2019s father that he would be sorry, that it may take one or two weeks but he would five to regret this day. The defendant also attempted to challenge the victim\u2019s father out into the street to fight him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\u201cThe following morning, the victim received a call from a coworker informing her that the defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>just called from a mental hospital. The victim\u2019s former next-door neighbor also called to let her know that there was a pile of women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing stacked behind the fence in the back of the victim\u2019s former residence. Believing that the defendant would not be at the house, the victim, her son and her sister went to the victim\u2019s former residence to retrieve their belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">\u201cThe victim\u2019s sister, who had driven, parked behind the house near a pile of clothing. The women hurried from the car and began putting clothes into garbage bags. While the women were collecting the clothes, the defendant appeared. The victim ran, yelling to her sister to call the police. The defendant caught her and fell to his knees begging her not to leave him. The victim attempted to keep the situation under control by pretending to go along with him, but winked at her sister signaling her to go for help.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cThe victim\u2019s sister screamed at the victim to get into the car. The defendant then ran to the car, removed his son from the car seat and ran into the house. While holding his son, the defendant pushed the victim through the door of the house. The defendant then punched the victim in the face and hit her in the head with a baseball bat from the neighbor\u2019s yard. The defendant delivered eight blows to the victim\u2019s head until the baseball bat finally broke. The victim suffered serious head injuries and was close to death.\u201d Id., 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter aha, that the trial court had improperly instructed the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During its final charge, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>court stated that \u201cthe law does recognize that a person who is acting intentionally \u2014 was found to be acting intentionally can simultaneously intend to cause some injury \u2014 to cause the victim some injury and at the same time, intend to cause that person\u2019s death . . . .\u201d The defendant claimed that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly permitted the jury to render inconsistent guilty verdicts on the counts of attempted murder under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a and assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). Id., 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Appellate Court held that although a jury may properly find that, during an attack on a victim, a defendant\u2019s intent changed from the intent to cause serious physical injury to the intent to cause death,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a jury cannot properly find, as a matter of law, that a defendant possessed these intents simultaneously with respect to the same victim. Id., 22, 22 n.6. In light of this holding, the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction improperly permitted the jury to render legally inconsistent verdicts for attempted murder under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a and assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), and thus necessitated a new trial. Id., 22-23, 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">On appeal to this court, the state claims that the trial court properly instructed the jury because, under the circumstances of this case, the intent to cause the victim\u2019s death was not legally inconsistent with the simultaneous intent to cause her serious physical injury. The defendant contends, to the contrary, that, as a matter of law, the two intents are mutually exclusive and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>that the trial court\u2019s instruction impermissibly permitted the jury to render inconsistent verdicts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree with the state that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the defendant simultaneously could have possessed the specific intents required for conviction of attempted murder under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a and assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The issue, broadly stated, is whether the intent to cause death and the intent to cause serious physical injury are mutually exclusive as a matter of law. We conclude that such mutual exclusivity is not to be presumed. Indeed, we have already held that, under some circumstances, these intents can be possessed simultaneously. In <em>State </em>v. Hinton, 227 Conn. 301, 305, 630 A.2d 593 (1993), the defendant fired a single shotgun blast into a group of men, killing three and injuring another. Addressing the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly accepted inconsistent verdicts of guilty on counts of attempted murder and assault in the first degree, we concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear that an assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (2) would be consistent with an attempted murder count in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a if [the actual victim] were the defendant\u2019s intended victim, because those statutory sections require intentional conduct.\u201d Id., 318-19. Because the counts of attempted murder and intentional assault had been premised on a single act of violence, our approval of verdicts of guilty for both offenses with respect to the same victim and the same act necessarily acknowledged that a defendant may simultaneously possess the intent to cause death and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the intent to cause serious physical injury. Accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>257 Ill. App. 3d 137, 153, 630 N.E.2d 878 (1993), cert. denied, 156 Ill. 2d 563, 638 N.E.2d 1121 (1994) (intents for aggravated battery and attempted murder not mutually exclusive); <em>People </em>v. <em>McDavis, </em>97 App. Div. 2d 302, 304-305, 469 N.Y.S.2d 508 (1983) (intents for assault in first degree and attempted murder not mutually exclusive); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Kynette, </em>15 Cal. 2d 731, 761, 104 P.2d 794 (1940), cert. denied, 312 U.S. 703, 61 S. Ct. 806, 85 L. Ed. 1136 (1941) (\u201c[tjhere is no repugnancy between an intent to kill the victim and an intent to injure him\u201d), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>People </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>50 Cal. 2d 190, 197, 324 P.2d 1 (1958), and <em>People </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>12 Cal. 3d 290, 301 n.8, 524 P.2d 1300, 115 Cal. Rptr. 516 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The defendant contends that, because the intent required to violate \u00a7 53a-54a differs from the intent required to violate \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), it is legally impossible to possess these two intents simultaneously. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Although \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-59 (a) (1) require the same mental state, namely, a specific intent; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 318-19; the particular intents required to violate these statutes are not the same. For each intent, a distinct conscious objective is sought. A verdict of guilty of attempted murder requires a finding of the specific intent to cause death. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49, 53a-54a and 53a-3 (11). A verdict of guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), in contrast, requires a finding of the specific intent to cause serious physical injury. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-3 (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">The defendant\u2019s argument founders on the mistaken presumption that one who intends to kill a person may not also intend to cause serious physical injury to that person. We can perceive no logical reason to preclude, as a matter of law, the simultaneous possession of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>intents by a defendant toward the same victim. It is entirely consistent and reasonable, under the facts of a particular case, for a jury to find that a defendant intended to inflict serious wounds upon a victim while also intending to cause that victim\u2019s death. A defendant \u201ccan intend both to cause the victim a serious physical injury and to kill the victim. No temporal separation is required for the intent, but obviously one is required for the result. A possible factual scenario would have a defendant intending to kill a person but first causing serious physical injuiy or disfigurement, so as to make the victim suffer before dying. The intent is simultaneous, as the conscious objective to cause the requisite results is simultaneous, while the results themselves are separated by time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 26 <em>(Foti, J., </em>dissenting); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Womack, </em>40 Cal. App. 4th 926, 931, 47 Cal. Rptr. 2d 76 (1995) (intent to kill victim inconsistent with intent to induce same victim to give false testimony or to withhold true testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 583 A.2d 896 (1990), on appeal after remand, 218 Conn. 747, 591 A.2d 813 (1991), but that case does not compel a different conclusion. In <em>King, </em>the trial court had improperly instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty both of attempted murder under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 and 53a-54a and assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) with respect to the same victim. Id., 592-95. We determined that the juiy\u2019s verdict of guilty on the count of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) necessitated a finding that the defendant had acted recklessly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury\u2019s verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>of guilty on the count of attempted murder, in contrast, necessitated a finding that the defendant had acted with specific intent. With respect to the same victim and the same act, however, specific intent and recklessness are distinct and mutually exclusive mental states under our penal code \u201cbecause one who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result. . . . Therefore, the transgression that caused the victim\u2019s injuries was either intentional or reckless; it could not, at one and the same time, be both. . . . Where a determination is made that one mental state exists, to be legally consistent the other must be found not to exist.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 594; see <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>219 Conn. 363, 370, 593 A.2d 124 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 4, 505 A.2d 683 (1986). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 318-19, we declined to extend these principles to encompass scenarios involving the simultaneous possession of the <em>same </em>mental state, and we similarly decline to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The holding in <em>King </em>was premised on the conclusion that, because a defendant cannot act recklessly and intentionally at the same time toward the same victim, a guilty verdict based on a finding that a defendant acted with recklessness is inconsistent with a guilty verdict based on a finding that the defendant acted intentionally. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 594. That is not this case. The trial court in the present case did not instruct the jury that it could find that the defendant simultaneously had acted recklessly and intentionally toward the victim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the trial court instructed the jury that it could find that the defendant had intended to inflict serious physical injury upon the victim and, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the same time, intended to cause her death. <em>King, </em>therefore, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">We conclude that, under the appropriate circumstances, a defendant can simultaneously intend to cause the death of, and intend to cause serious physical injury to, the same victim. \u201cIntent is a question of fact, the determination of which should stand unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is an unreasonable one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 197, 672 A.2d 488 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>229 Conn. 328, 333, 641 A.2d 123 (1994). In this case, the defendant repeatedly struck the victim over the head with a baseball bat until the bat broke. The jury reasonably could have inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct that he had possessed, at the same time and by the same acts, the intent to cause the victim\u2019s death and the intent to cause the victim serious physical injury while he was attempting to kill her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the defendant could have possessed both intents simultaneously, the trial court\u2019s instruction to that effect did not permit the jury to return legally inconsistent verdicts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 313; <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 594. Accordingly, the trial court properly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 provides in relevant part: \u201cCriminal attempt: Sufficiency of conduct; renunciation as defense, (a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201cMurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b769-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 provides in relevant part: \u201cAssault in the first degree: Class B felony, (a) A person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The jury acquitted the defendant of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\"> We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">\u201c1.
