Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946); (2) instructed the jury on common design liability as an alternate form of accessory liability; (3) denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder; (4) instructed the jury that it could infer the defendant\u2019s intent to cause the death of another in light of his use of a dangerous weapon, thereby relieving the state of its burden of proof on an element of the crime of murder in violation of the due process clause of the federal constitution; and (5) permitted the state to introduce impeachment evidence on a collateral matter. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of June 26, 1991, Hector Gonzalez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>(Gonzalez) and Ms wife, Valerie Falcon, drove to Seaside Park in Bridgeport with their two year old son, Hector Gonzalez, Jr., and Falcon\u2019s eight year old son, William GMsti, Jr. While at the park, they met Fitzgerald Guisti (Guisti), an uncle of William Guisti, Jr. Guisti informed Gonzalez and Falcon that he was planning to drive to the east side of Bridgeport to purchase some marijuana. Gonzalez and Falcon agreed to follow Guisti in their vehicle, a Ford Bronco. The two veMcles then left the park. Gonzalez, accompamed by Falcon in the front seat and the two children in the back seat, drove the Bronco, while GMsti drove alone in Ms car.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Guisti, followed by Gonzalez and Ms tMee passengers in the Bronco, proceeded to the corner of Hallett and Jane Streets where several men, including Gerald Torres, Sammy Segarra, Juan Rivera, a man identified oMy as \u201cEdgar\u201d and the defendant, were congregated. Guisti pMled Ms car over to the side of the road to inquire whether any of the men had marijuana for sale. Gonzalez drove the Bronco past Guisti\u2019s veMcle and continued down Jane Street toward Helen Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Torres, in response to Guisti\u2019s inquiry, stated that he had some marijuana and told Guisti to get out of his car. As Guisti was exiting Ms automobile, he heard Torres yell, \u201cthat\u2019s the truck, let\u2019s do the truck,\u201d an apparent reference to the Bronco, which had just passed by and was proceeding down Jane Street toward Helen Street. Meanwhile, Gonzalez had turned the Bronco around on Helen Street and was traveling back toward Jane Street in the direction of Guisti\u2019s vehicle. Torres, Segarra, Rivera, Edgar and the defendant hurriedly retrieved guns from a nearby automobile and Md behind several cars parked on the street to await Gonzalez\u2019 return.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">As Gonzalez approached and passed the parked cars behind wMch they were Mding, the men ran out into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>street and began shooting at the Bronco. One member of the group was armed with an Uzi-type machine gun and the others were carrying handguns.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Guisti yelled to the group that there was a child in the Bronco, to which Torres replied, \u201cFuck it, keep on,\u201d and the shooting continued. The men fired about thirty-five to forty shots at the Bronco,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> approximately ten of which actually struck the vehicle. Three of the bullets passed through the passenger compartment of the Bronco and exited through the front windshield. William Guisti, Jr., was fatally injured when a 9 millimeter bullet passed through his heart, lung and liver. The defendant was thereafter arrested, charged and tried for the crimes of murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and carrying a pistol without a permit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>At the conclusion of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court instructed the jury on the law governing each of the counts. The jury thereafter found the defendant guilty as charged. On appeal, the defendant challenges the propriety of several of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions, as well as the introduction into evidence of certain testimony used by the state to impeach several defense witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence on the murder, conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder counts. We reject each of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>improper because: (1) the instruction was broader than the principle <em>of </em>vicarious liability adopted by this court in <em>State v. Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 630 A.2d 990 (1993); (2) it was inconsistent with our penal code; (3) application of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine to this case violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and, in addition, violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to fair notice of the conduct proscribed by our murder statute; (4) the state\u2019s failure to rely on a theory of vicarious liability at the hearing in probable cause barred it from doing so at trial; and (5) the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could apply the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine to the inchoate crime of attempted murder. We address each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>In Pinkerton v. United States, </em>supra, 328 U.S. 647-48, the United States Supreme Court concluded that under the federal common law, a conspirator may be held hable for criminal offenses committed by a coconspirator if those offenses are within the scope of the conspiracy, are in furtherance of it, and are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 32, we were required to decide whether to recognize the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine for purposes of our state criminal law. We concluded, first, that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is not inconsistent with our penal code and, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>we were not prohibited from recognizing that theoiy of criminal liability as a matter of state common law. See General Statutes \u00a7 53-4.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Without foreclosing the use of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine in other circumstances, we then concluded that application of the doctrine was appropriate in <em>Walton, </em>in which the defendant was a leader of the conspiracy, the offense for which vicarious liability was sought to be imposed was an object of the conspiracy and the offense was proved by one or more of the overt acts alleged in support of the conspiracy charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 44-46, 50-51.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We now must decide whether to extend the principle of vicarious liability that we adopted in <em>Walton </em>to a case in which not all of these conditions have been met, a question that we expressly reserved in <em>Walton. </em>See id., 46 n.12. Subject to the limitations set forth hereinafter, we conclude that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability may be imposed even if none of the three <em>Walton </em>conditions is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In adopting the principle of vicarious liability set forth in <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 328 U.S. 640, we noted in <em>Walton </em>that <em>\u201cPinkerton </em>liability is now a recognized part of federal criminal conspiracy jurisprudence\u201d; St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 43; and that the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine has been adopted by the majority of state jurisdictions that have considered the issue. Id., 44. In so doing, we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the doctrine necessarily casts too wide a net of vicarious criminal liability. \u201cThough it is sometimes mischaracterized, <em>Pinkerton </em>[liability] is not a broad principle of vicarious liability that imposes criminal responsibility upon every co-conspirator for whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>substantive offenses any of their confederates commit. On the contrary, in the very decision in which the principle was articulated, co-conspirator liability was carefully confined to substantive offenses that are (a) committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (b) reasonably foresee [able] by the co-conspirator sought to be held responsible as a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>927 F.2d 53, 56 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1210, 111 S. Ct. 2811, 115 L. Ed. 2d 983 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Thus, \u201cthe rationale of <em>Pinkerton </em>Lability ... is essentially that, because the conspirator played a necessary part in setting in motion a discrete course of criminal conduct, he should be held responsible, within appropriate limits, for the crimes committed as a natural and probable result of that course of conduct. \u2018A conspiracy is a partnership in crime.\u2019 <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, [328 U.S.] 644. Each such partner \u2018instigated the commission of the crime,\u2019 and \u2018[t]he unlawful agreement contemplated precisely what was done. It was formed for the purpose. The act was done in execution of the enterprise. The rule which holds responsible one who counsels, procures, or commands another to commit a crime is founded on the same principle. That principle is recognized in the law of conspiracy when the overt act of one partner in crime is attributable to all. An overt act is an essential ingredient of the crime of conspiracy .... If that can be supplied by the act of one conspirator, we fail to see why the same or other acts in furtherance of the conspiracy are likewise not attributable to the others for the purpose of holding them responsible for the substantive offense.\u2019 Id., 647.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Furthermore, \u201capplication of the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle to a homicide committed in furtherance of a conspiracy has long been part of our jurisprudence. See, e.g., <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 642, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>133 Conn. 171, 173, 49 A.2d 594 (1946); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>132 Conn. 39, 44, 42 A.2d 354 <em>(1945).\u201d State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 50-51. Indeed, even prior to <em>Pinkerton, </em>we had employed a rule of vicarious criminal liability under which a coconspirator could be held liable for a murder if that crime was the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of a common plan and was committed \u201cwhile acting in pursuance of, or in furtherance of, the common design.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cots, </em>126 Conn. 48, 59, 9 A.2d 138 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Under the facts of this case, we see no reason why it was improper for the trial court to have instructed the jury regarding the principle of vicarious liability enunciated in <em>Pinkerton. </em>Although the state did not prove that the defendant was the leader of the conspiracy to ambush the Gonzalez vehicle and its occupants, the evidence reasonably established that the defendant was a fully engaged member of the conspiracy who had actively participated in the shooting and that he, along with his coconspirators, intended to kill one or more of the vehicle\u2019s passengers. Thus, in circumstances where, as here, the defendant was a full partner in the illicit venture and the coconspirator conduct for which the state has sought to hold him responsible was integral to the achievement of the conspiracy\u2019s objectives, the defendant cannot reasonably complain that it is unfair to hold him vicariously liable, under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, for such criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">As we acknowledged in <em>Walton, </em>however, the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine has been criticized, principally on the basis that the criminal \u201claw would lose all sense of just proportion if one might, by virtue of his one crime of conspiracy, be held accountable for thousands of additional offenses of which ... he did not influence at all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>supra, 227 Conn. 51. Thus, as we also indicated in <em>Walton, </em>there may be occasions when it would be unreasonable to hold a defendant criminally hable for offenses committed by his coconspirators even though the state has demonstrated technical compliance with the <em>Pinkerton </em>rule. Id. For example, a factual scenario may be envisioned in which the nexus between the defendant\u2019s role in the conspiracy and the illegal conduct of a coconspirator is so attenuated or remote, notwithstanding the fact that the latter\u2019s actions were a natural consequence of the unlawful agreement, that it would be unjust to hold the defendant responsible for the criminal conduct of his coconspirator. In such a case, a <em>Pinkerton </em>charge would not be appropriate. As we have explained, however, we are not presented with such a situation in this case. Because we continue to believe that the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, when properly applied, is consistent with our penal code, we reiterate our approval of the doctrine for those cases in which the state can establish that its use would be fair and reasonable in light of the nature of the conspiracy, the defendant\u2019s participation therein, and the relationship between the defendant\u2019s role in the conspiracy and the coconspirators\u2019 conduct for which the state seeks to hold the defendant accountable. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on <em>Pinkerton </em>liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The defendant next claims that <em>Pinkerton </em>liability is inconsistent with our penal code because it allows a jury to convict a defendant of murder even though the defendant did not himself have the specific intent to cause the death of another as required under \u00a7 53a-54a (a). He asserts that our felony murder statute, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> sets forth an exclusive list of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>duct for which a defendant may be convicted of murder without having the intent to kill as required under \u00a7 53a-54a (a). We disagree. The defendant\u2019s argument fails to account for an important distinction between felony murder liability and <em>Pinkerton </em>liability. A defendant may be convicted of felony murder for a death caused by himself or another when the death occurs during the commission of one of a number of specified felonies, even if neither the defendant nor his confederate had any intent to kill. Under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, however, a defendant may not be convicted of murder unless one of his criminal associates, acting foreseeably and in furtherance of the conspiracy, caused the victim\u2019s death with the intent to do so. Accordingly, the principle of vicarious liability articulated in <em>Pinkerton </em>does not impermissibly intrude upon the province of the felony murder statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The defendant\u2019s final three arguments regarding <em>Pinkerton </em>liability require little discussion. The defendant first contends that application of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine to his case violates the prohibition against ex post facto laws found in article one, \u00a7 10, of the United States constitution<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and his due process right to fair notice of the conduct proscribed by \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>claim is without merit. In approving the trial court\u2019s jury instruction <em>on Pinkerton </em>liability, we have not created a new criminal offense, nor have we expanded our doctrine of vicarious criminal liability. Rather, as we have earlier noted, application of the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine to a homicide foreseeably committed in furtherance of a conspiracy is firmly rooted in our jurisprudence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of liability because the state did not rely on that doctrine at the hearing in probable cause. This claim, too, must fail. The purpose of a hearing in probable cause is simply to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime charged to allow the state to try the defendant for that offense. We have never suggested that the state\u2019s failure to rely on a particular principle of criminal liability at a probable cause hearing bars it from proceeding under that theory at trial when, as here, the charge to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>defendant has been held to answer at trial is the same as that for which a valid determination of probable cause has been made. In the absence of any sound reason to adopt the rule urged by the defendant, we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle should not be applicable to inchoate offenses and, therefore, that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find him guilty of attempted murder on the basis of a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of vicarious liability.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant, however, has presented no reason, and we know of none, why the commission of an inchoate crime cannot be a reasonably foreseeable consequence of a criminal conspiracy. Furthermore, the defendant does not claim that his coconspirators\u2019 crimes of attempted murder were either unforeseeable or not committed in furtherance of the conspiracy, the object of which was to commit murder. Finally, the defendant has not demonstrated why it was unfair or unreasonable to hold him responsible for those inchoate offenses in this case. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The defendant next asserts that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on accessory liability under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> violated his rights under the due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Specifically, he contends that the trial court\u2019s reference to common design liability during its instruction on the law of accessory liability was likely to have led the jury to believe that it could find the defendant guilty of murder as an accessory even though he lacked the specific intent to cause the death of another as required under \u00a7 53a-54a.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although we agree that the challenged portion of the trial court\u2019s instruction was improper, we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury could have been misled by the erroneous jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">A careful review of the trial court\u2019s instructions on murder and accessory liability is necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At the beginning of its jury instruction on murder, the trial court stated: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when with the intent to cause the death of another person he causes the death of such person, or of a third person. This means that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause the death of another person, and that in accordance with that intent, the defendant caused the death of that person or of a third person.\u201d The trial court then explained to the jury the elements of the crime of murder, reiterating the requirement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>a defendant cannot be convicted of that offense unless he had the intent to kill. At the conclusion of its charge on murder, the court instructed the jury on accessory liability, explaining that \u201c[i]f you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant personally participated in the murder, then you must consider whe[ther] he intentionally aided or [abetted] some other person in the commission of the murder in question.\u201d The court then proceeded to give a detailed instruction on accessory liability under \u00a7 53a-8, concluding as follows: \u201cIf you find that a person committed the murder in question, then the next thing you must decide is whether the defendant shared the intent of the person who committed the crime, and I remind you that the intent of which I speak is to kill another person. If you find the defendant, sharing in the intent to kill another person, if any, did one of the five things specified, that is, solicited or requested or commanded or importuned or intentionally aided in the commission of the crime, then he would be guilty of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u201cTo summarize, then you must find beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant did any one of the five things specified in \u00a7 53[a]-8. That he is just as guilty of the crime of murder as though he had committed it, and you should return a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u201cIf two or more persons participate in a crime, they are equally responsible although it was the immediate act of one which actually brought the crime about. Participation means not only actively sharing in its final commission, but in doing anything to aid, to assist, to inspire or to encourage the conduct which caused it. <em>All who join in a common design to commit an unlawful act, the natural and probable consequence of the execution of which involves the contingency of taking human life, are responsible for a homicide committed by one of them while acting in pursuanfce] of or furtherance of common design.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cIf you find that the State has failed to [prove] beyond a reasonable doubt either or both of the elements of the crime charged, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then proceeded to instruct the jury on lesser included offenses of the crime of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defendant argues that the emphasized portion of the trial court\u2019s instruction allowed the jury to convict the defendant of murder without first finding that he had the intent to kill. We agree with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s inclusion of the common design language in its instruction on accessory liability was improper because, when viewed in isolation, that language reasonably may be understood to permit the jury to treat the defendant as an accessory, and therefore be subject to liability as a principal, even though he himself did not act with the requisite intent to kill.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">We disagree, however, with the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s statement regarding common design was likely to have caused the jury to conclude that it could find the defendant guilty of accessory to murder without a predicate finding that the defendant himself had a specific intent to kill. \u201cIt is well established that individual jury instructions should not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 444, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993). \u201cThe pertinent test is whether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>235 Conn. 145, 170, 665 A.2d 63 (1995). Thus, \u201c[t]he whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the [jurors] in guiding them to the proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 37, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). Accordingly, \u201c[i]n reviewing a constitutional challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lemoine, </em>233 Conn. 502, 509, 659 A.2d 1194 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, the trial court did not instruct the jury on common design liability as an alternate form of accessory liability. Rather, the court\u2019s statement regarding common design was simply a part of the court\u2019s summary of the principles underlying accessory liability.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, and most importantly, the trial court forcefully and repeatedly instructed the jury regarding the specific intent necessary to convict the defendant of murder either as a principal or as an accessory.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In particular, the court explained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the jury that it could not find the defendant guilty of accessory to murder unless it determined that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>defendant \u201cshared the intent of the person who committed the crime\u201d and that the defendant had \u201ca criminality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of intent and unlawful purpose in common with the person or persons who actually committed the crime.\u201d In light of the entire charge \u2014 in particular, the two sentences immediately preceding the court\u2019s lone reference to common design \u2014 it is highly unlikely that the jury understood that reference to be anything other than a restatement of the court\u2019s explanation that a person may be convicted of murder as an accessory even though he had not personally killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Finally, the trial court began its instructions on the murder charge by explaining that a \u201cperson is guilty of murder when with the intent to cause the death of another person he causes the death of such person, or of a third person.\u201d At the conclusion of its charge on murder, and immediately after its statement regarding common design, the trial court repeated its admonition that the state was required to prove each of the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt. This latter instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>bolsters our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s statement regarding common design, when viewed in the broader context of the trial court\u2019s instructions in their entirety, could not reasonably have led the jury to believe that it could find the defendant guilty of murder under an accessory theory without first finding that he had the requisite intent to kill. Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the ground of instructional impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The defendant further claims that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder on the ground that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he fired at the Bronco with the requisite intent to kill. The defendant also maintains that the evidence was inadequate to support his conviction of murder under an accessory theory of liability. We disagree with each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In reviewing the defendant\u2019s claims of evidentiary insufficiency, \u201c[w]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 126, 646 A.2d 169 (1994). \u201cOrdinarily, intent can only be inferred by circumstantial evidence; it may be and usually is inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct. . . . Intent to cause death may be inferred from the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 120, 622 A.2d 519 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence that the defendant participated in the ambush with the intent to kill the individuals riding in the Bronco. The defendant and at least four other men armed themselves and proceeded to he in wait for the Bronco. When the Bronco came into view, the defendant and the others ran out into the street and, as the vehicle proceeded past them, fired up to forty shots at it. The defendant knew that the Bronco contained at least two occupants, Gonzalez and Falcon, who were seated in plain view in the front seat.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, several of the shots were apparently aimed at the passenger compartment, including three that passed through the Bronco\u2019s front windshield. Thus, it is reasonable to infer from the manner in which the ambush was conducted, including the number of shots fired and the proximity of the shooters to the Bronco and its passengers, that the defendant and his coconspirators each intended to kill Gonzalez and Falcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The defendant argues that it also would have been reasonable, in light of all of the evidence, for a juror to find that the defendant and his companions were firing only at the Bronco and not at its passengers. Even if such a finding might be warranted, it is irrelevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In considering whether the evidence fairly supports a jury\u2019s finding of guilt, \u201cwe do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 134. Because sufficient evidence supports the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>sion that the defendant and his coconspirators discharged their weapons with the intent to kill Gonzalez and Falcon, the defendant\u2019s claims of insufficient evidence of intent are without merit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The defendant also contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of murder under an accessory theory of liability because there was inadequate proof that he solicited, requested, commanded, importuned or intentionally aided anyone in the commission of the murder. We disagree. \u201cSince under our law both principals and accessories are treated as principals ... if the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, establishes that [the defendant] committed the [murder] charged or did some act which forms ... a part thereof, or directly or indirectly counseled or procured any persons to commit the offenses or do any act forming a part thereof, then the convictions must stand. ... To prove guilt as a principal, the state must prove each element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. To be guilty as an accessory one must share the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose with the perpetrator of the crime and one must knowingly and wilfully assist the perpetrator in the acts which prepare for, facilitate or consummate it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 465, 450 A.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Although the evidence did not clearly demonstrate which of the perpetrators actually fired the shot that fatally injured William Guisti, Jr., the evidence did establish that the defendant and his companions together prepared and readied themselves for the ambush by retrieving their weapons and hiding to avoid notice. As the Bronco approached, the men took aim at it and its occupants, firing repeatedly into the vehicle with the intent to kill one or more of the passengers. \u201cIf the state\u2019s version of the facts is credited, the evidence shows sufficient concert of action between the defendant and his companion[s] to support . . . the accessory allegation . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 604, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claims of evidentiary insufficiency are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could infer that the defendant acted with the intent to cause the death of another in light of his use of a deadly weapon, thereby relieving the state of its burden of proof on the element of intent. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The trial court gave the following jury instruction regarding the crimes of murder and attempted murder: \u201cAn intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death. One who uses a deadly weapon upon [vital] parts of another may be deemed to have intended the probable result of that act and from such circumstance a proper inference may be draw[n] in some cases that there was intent to kill.\u201d At the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge, the defendant commented on the instruction as follows: \u201c[T]he court has given the standard charge on intent as it relates to use of weapons in a homicide. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The defendant isn\u2019t objecting to that language; he\u2019s just merely asking that the court give the additional instruction that the mere use of [a] weapon is not in and of itself evidence of a specific intent \u2014 specific intent to kill . . . .\u201d The trial court noted the defendant\u2019s exception but declined to give a supplemental instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The defendant claims that the challenged instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion on intent to him because the charge directed the jury to presume that he had the intent to kill merely by virtue of his use of a deadly weapon. See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979). The defendant did not raise this claim at trial,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but nevertheless seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u201cIn <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>supra, [442 U.S.] 517-24, the United States Supreme Court held that a jury instruction that the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights because a reasonable jury could have interpreted the instruction as a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption and thus relieved the state of its burden of proving every element of the crime. <em>See Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 105 S. Ct. 1965, 85 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 U.S. 422, 98 S. Ct. 2864, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1978); <em>Mullaney </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881, 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975) .... We have, however, recognized that the rule of <em>Sandstrom </em>must not be oversimplified. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 582-83, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>186 Conn. 261, 263, 440 A.2d 967 (1982). <em>Sandstrom </em>does not invalidate, for example, the use of an entirely permissive inference or presumption, which allows . . . the ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>mental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and that places no burden of any kind on the defendant. <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 157, 99 S. Ct. 2213, 60 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1979); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 20, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>180 Conn. 171, 175, 429 A.2d 457 (1980). A permissive inference suggests to the jury a possible conclusion to be drawn if the State proves predicate facts, but does not require the jury to draw that conclusion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 300-302, 503 A.2d 146 (1986); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>193 Conn. 632, 644-45, 479 A.2d 218 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>185 Conn. 163, 167-69, 440 A.2d 858 (1981), aff'd, 460 U.S. 73, 103 S.

The trial court instructed the jury that one <em>\u201cmay be deemed </em>to have intended the probable result\u201d of the use of a deadly weapon on a vital body part and, further, that \u201cfrom such circumstance a proper inference may <em>be draw[n] in some cases </em>that there was intent to kill.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This instruction did nothing more than apprise the jury that it was <em>permitted </em>to draw an inference regarding the defendant\u2019s intent from the evidence adduced at trial; the charge did nothing either to dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof or to place any burden on the defendant. Moreover, the trial court prefaced its instruction with the statement that \u201c[a]n intent to cause death <em>may be inferred </em>from circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In light of the permissive language used by the trial court, there is no possibility that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>rational juror could have concluded that he or she was required to draw the inference, by virtue of the defendant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon, that the defendant intended to cause the death of another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly refused his request to instruct the jury that the use of a deadly weapon is alone insufficient to establish that he had the intent to kill. He maintains that the trial court was required to give the requested charge in order to ameliorate the harm flowing from the improper instruction on intent. Because we have rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>Sandstrom </em>claim, this claim must also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly allowed the state to impeach certain defense witnesses on a collateral matter. Although we agree that the trial court should not have allowed the challenged testimony into evidence, we conclude that its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, several witnesses provided alibi testimony that when the shooting took place, the defendant was at a bar known as Como\u2019s Cafe, located at 418 Main Street in Bridgeport. One of those witnesses, Jesus DeJesus, further testified that, at the time of the shooting, he was the owner of Como\u2019s Cafe. On cross-examination, DeJesus indicated that he was not the permittee of the bar and that he had not been responsible for filing the necessary legal documents with the state department of liquor control (department). Several other witnesses also testified that they were at Como\u2019s Cafe on the night of the shooting and that they, too, observed the defendant there. Each also testified that DeJesus was the owner of the bar and that it was called Como\u2019s Cafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">In its rebuttal case, the state elicited testimony from Kyle Anderson, an agent for the department, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>purpose of impeaching the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses. Anderson stated that the liquor permit on file with the department indicated that the establishment located at 418 Main Street in Bridgeport was named Danny\u2019s Cafe and that it was owned by Umberto Perez and Jose Lebr\u00f3n. The defendant objected to Anderson\u2019s testimony, claiming that it was collateral and, therefore, improper impeachment evidence. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection on the ground that Anderson\u2019s testimony was not collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cA witness may not be impeached by contradicting his or her testimony as to collateral matters, that is, matters that are not directly relevant and material to the merits of the case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 327, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). \u201cThe determination of whether a matter is relevant or collateral . . . generally rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 248, 630 A.2d 577 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We conclude that the trial court improperly allowed the state to elicit Anderson\u2019s testimony regarding the name and ownership of the establishment located at 418 Main Street in Bridgeport. The sole purpose of Anderson\u2019s testimony was to establish that DeJesus was not the owner of the bar and that its name was not Como\u2019s Cafe, facts that were not material to whether the defendant was present at the bar at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Because the admission into evidence of the improper impeachment testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that its admission was harmful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 629, 573 A.2d 716 (1990). Thus, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ground only if he can establish that it is more probable than not that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected by the error. Id. We are satisfied that Anderson\u2019s testimony had no effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">First, Anderson\u2019s testimony did not establish that the testimony of any of the alibi witnesses was not credible. Anderson stated only that, at the time of the most recent permit renewal application, the trade name on the liquor permit was Danny\u2019s Cafe and that Dejesus was not listed as an owner. His testimony did not preclude the possibility that the bar was known by a name other than its registered name or that DeJesus had an ownership interest in the bar at the time of the shooting. Moreover, even if the jurors were to have concluded, on the basis of Anderson\u2019s testimony, that the defense witnesses were not to be believed concerning the name and ownership of the bar, the issue was of such marginal significance to the case that it is unlikely to have adversely affected the jury\u2019s view of the overall credibility of the witnesses. Finally, the alibi witnesses\u2019 accounts of the events at the bar on the night of the shooting were so riddled with inconsistencies that their testimony regarding the bar\u2019s name and ownership was insignificant by comparison. We conclude, therefore, that Anderson\u2019s testimony could not have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict and, therefore, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

Instead, the court\u2019s remarks immediately preceding its instruction on common design indicated that it was offering a summary of accessory liability, rather than an alternative or different theory of liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> The relevant portion of the trial court\u2019s instruction on murder and accessory liability for murder is as follows: \u201cIn the first count of the information the defendant is charged as follows: C. Robert Satti, Jr., Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for the Judicial District of Fairfield, accuses Raul Ivan Diaz of murder, and charges that at the City of Bridgeport, Fairfield County, on the 26th day of June, 1991, at or about 10:00 P.M., in the area of Helen Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>and Jane Street, Bridgeport, the said Raul Ivan Diaz, <em>with the intent to cause the death </em>of one William Guisti, David Hector Gonzalez, Valerie Falcon or Junior Gonzalez, did shoot at another person and cause the death of said William Guisti in violation of Section 53a-54a (a) of the Connecticut General Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">\u201cThat section insofar as is pertinent to this case reads as follows: A person is guilty of murder when <em>with the intent to cause the death of another person </em>he causes the death of such person, or of a third person. This means that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>intended to cause the death </em>of another person, and that <em>in accordance with that intent, </em>the defendant caused the death of that person or of a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\u201cIn order to convict the defendant of murder, you must find that the defendant caused the death of William Guisti. You must find proved beyond a reasonable doubt that William Guisti died as a result of the actions of the defendant, and I\u2019ll explain that to you further in a moment. Next, you must conclude that the person causing the death of the victim did so <em>with the intent to cause the death. </em>... [A] person acts <em>intentionally with respect to a result or conduct </em>described by a statute defining an offense, <em>when his conscious objective is to cause </em>such result or engage in such conduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\u201cIf you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>had the intent to cause the death </em>o/and that <em>having the intention to cause the death of </em>William Guisti the defendant did cause his death, then you may find the defendant guilty of the crime of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\u201cHowever, consider in your deliberations the following: <em>An intent to cause death may be inferred </em>from circumstantial evidence, such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death, [0]ne who uses a deadly weapon upon parts of another may be deemed <em>to have intended the probable result </em>of that act and from such circumstance aproper inference may be draw[n] in some cases that <em>there was intent to kill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">\u201cPlease <em>don\u2019t be confused by the word intent. An intent may be formulated in an instant. But you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had that intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">\u201cIt makes no difference whether William Guisti\u2019s injuries were actually inflicted by the defendant\u2019s firing of a gun or by another gun if the defendant was engaging with others in a common purpose to carry on an activity as I will charge you. He would be guilty of murder and attempted murder if the injury is caused thereby, even though it was not the defendant\u2019s gunshot, but that \u2014 but was that of another with whom he was acting in con[cert] that caused the death of William Guisti. It is of no consequence that the evidence may not clearly establish that the death of William Guisti was caused by the defendant or an accomplice as I will explain that to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cIf you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant personally participated in the murder, then you must consider whe[ther] he intentionally aided or [abetted] some other person in the commission of the murder in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">\u201cThere is a statute, [section] 53a-8 called an accessory statute and it reads as follows: A person acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in the conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principle offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">\u201cYou will note that this section does not connect the five things specified by the word and but separates them by the word or. The state does not have to prove that the person did all five of the things specified. It is sufficient that the state proves any one of the five things specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">\u201cIf the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant solicited or requested or commanded or importuned or intentionally aided another person in the commission of the murder, then he is guilty of murder. Under [section] 53a-8, if the defendant did any of the five things specified he is, in the eyes of the law, just as guilty of the crime of murder as though he had directly and personally committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u201cAt this point I will briefly define the five terms used in this section: solicit means to [ask] earnestly; request means to ask for or express a desire for; command means to order or direct; importune means to command, urge or incite; and aid means to assist, help or support.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u201cThe law makes all of the following persons guilty of [a] crime: those who actually committed the crime; those who do some act which forms a part of the crime; those who assist in the actual commission of the crime; those who assist in the commission of any act which forms a part of the crime; those who directly or indirectly instigate or encourage or order any part, rather, order any other person to do an act which forms a part of the crime. To find a person guilty of this section, you must find he was more than actively present at the commission of the crime or passively acquiescent in the crime or innocently did acts which, in fact, did aid in the commission of the crime. <em>To find a person guilty under this section, you must find that he has a criminality of intent and unlawful purpose </em>in common with the person or persons who actually committed the crime. Whether a person is present at the commission of a crime, aids or [abets] a commission is a question of fact, the answer to which depends on circumstances surrounding his presence and his conduct, both during the commission of the crime and after the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">\u201cIf you find that a person committed the murder in question, then the next thing you must decide is <em>whether the defendant, shared the intent of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>the person who committed the crime, </em>and I remind you that <em>the intent of which I speak is to kill another person. </em>K you find the defendant, <em>sharing in the intent to kill another person, </em>if any, did one of the five things specified, that is, solicited or requested or commanded or importuned or intentionally aided in the commission of the crime, then he would be guilty of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u201cTo summarize, then you must find beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant did any one of the five things specified in [section] 53[a]-8. That he is just as guilty of the crime of murder as though he had committed it, and you should return a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u201cIf two or more persons participate in a crime, they are equally responsible although it was the immediate act of one which actually brought the crime about. Participation means not only actively sharing in its final commission, but in doing anything to aid, to assist, to inspire or to encourage the conduct which caused it. All who join in a common design to commit an unlawful act, the natural and probable consequence of the execution of which involves the contingency of taking human life, are responsible for a homicide committed by one of them while acting in pursuance] of or furtherance of common design.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">\u201cIf you find that the state has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either or both of the elements of the crime charged, then you must find the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> In light of Guisti\u2019s exclamation that there was a child in the Bronco and Torres\u2019 response to that statement, the jury fairly could have concluded that Torres, and perhaps one or more of the other assailants, was also aware that there was at least one child seated in the Bronco.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> The defendant seeks to buttress his claim of evidentiary insufficiency with the fact that the state adduced no evidence of a motive for the ambush. Although evidence of a motive to kill the Bronco\u2019s passengers no doubt would have provided further support for the juiy\u2019s guilty verdict, the lack of motive evidence is not determinative of whether the defendant had the intent to kill required under the murder statute. Because \u201c[mjotive is not an element of the crime of murder\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 69-70, 621 A.2d 728 (1993); \u201cthe state is under no obligation to show a motive for the accused to commit the crime charged.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 14, 526 A.2d 1311, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 955, 108 S.

Thus, we will not upset the guilty verdict solely because the state presented no evidence of motive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b565-8\"> Because we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail on this claim, we need not consider the effect of his express disavowal of the claim at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> A different conclusion would be warranted if, for example, the state\u2019s rebuttal evidence indicated that there was no bar located at that address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b568-10\"> The defendant does not claim, nor could he establish, a violation of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b569-9\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4e\">concurring.
