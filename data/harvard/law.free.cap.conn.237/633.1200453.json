The defendant, Scott Brian Wolff, was convicted after a jury trial of two counts of assault of a peace officer in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-167c (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of breach of the peace in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181 (a) (5).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>37 Conn. App. 500, 657 A.2d 650 (1995). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the question of whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the trial court had failed to conduct an adequate canvass before permitting the defendant to proceed to trial without counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant presented for review, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4140,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the following alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>nate grounds for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court: (1) the trial court improperly permitted the defendant to represent himself without ordering, sua sponte, an examination to determine whether he was competent to do so; and (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the element of intent required for conviction of the breach of the peace charge. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to the validity of the defendant\u2019s waiver, and affirm its judgment with respect to the jury instruction regarding the breach of the peace charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On May 26, 1992, while Hartford police officer Stephen Miele was on foot patrol near the train station in downtown Hartford, he stopped an individual who fit the description of a robbery suspect being sought by the police. Because the suspect was uncooperative, Miele requested assistance and was soon joined by police officer Laura Buyak. While Miele was in the process of arresting the robbery suspect, his attention was diverted to the defendant, who was standing at the top of the train station stairway shouting something approximating the following: \u201cFuck you, you motherfucking cops. You\u2019re all cocksuckers. You\u2019re all out to get me.\u201d The defendant was also screaming such things as \u201c[f]ucking cops,\u201d causing other people to stop and see what was occurring. Dennis Connolly, who was working in a store across the street from the train station, heard a commotion outside and, when he went to investigate, saw the defendant standing at the top of the stairs, shouting at Miele and Buyak, using the language previously described. Connolly was annoyed and alarmed by the defendant\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">After placing the robbery suspect in Buyak\u2019s patrol car, Miele and Buyak approached the defendant and attempted to calm him down. Because Miele thought that the defendant might have been a friend of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>man arrested, he approached the defendant in order to explain why the other man had been arrested. As Miele was trying to speak to the defendant and calm him down, the defendant swung at Miele, striking him in the chest. When Buyak attempted to assist Miele, the defendant became even more agitated and began swinging his arms and fists at both officers, who tried to defend themselves and to restrain the defendant. During the ensuing struggle, the defendant and the two officers fell down several steps of the stairway, resulting in loss of consciousness to Buyak, and an injury to Miele\u2019s foot. When Buyak regained consciousness, the defendant was on the ground, still struggling with Miele. Buyak then picked up Miele\u2019s baton and struck the defendant in the legs until he was sufficiently subdued to permit the officers to handcuff him. The defendant was then taken to the police station in a patrol wagon, and both officers were treated at a hospital for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">At the defendant\u2019s arraignment on May 27, 1992, the court, <em>Pellegrino, J., </em>proposed to appoint the public defender to represent the defendant. The defendant informed the court, however, that he intended to represent himself. At his next two pretrial appearances, on June 10,1992,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and June 24,1992, <em>before Pellegrino, J., </em>and <em>Kocay, J., </em>respectively, the defendant appeared without counsel and reiterated his desire to proceed pro se. At the defendant\u2019s next appearance, on July 7, 1992, the court, <em>Kocay, J., </em>informed the defendant that, despite the defendant\u2019s objections, it was going to appoint the public defender to represent him. Judge Kocay told the defendant: \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t want the public defender then he can sit behind you when the case comes up. But I\u2019m going to continue this so they can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>discuss it with you to determine if a public defender is appropriate. <em>... At this stage I\u2019m going to appoint the public defender to assist you. You can refuse his services if you wish but he\u2019s going to be appointed notwithstanding.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Although the defendant had initially objected to the appointment of the public defender stating, \u201cNo, that\u2019s my choice,\u201d by the end of the July 7 hearing he had learned that the public defender might be able to help him get access to his supplemental security income (SSI) checks, at which point he inquired when he would be able to talk to the public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">On July 21,1992, assistant public defender Ross Delaney appeared before Judge Kocay on behalf of the defendant and requested a continuance to confer with the defendant, which the court permitted. The following day, Delaney again appeared for the defendant and argued a motion for bond reduction before Judge Kocay. When asked if he was the defendant\u2019s attorney of record, Delaney responded that he was. Delaney also stated, however, that he was acting as standby counsel. During the bond reduction hearing, the state recounted the facts of the case, maintaining that the defendant had been screaming and swearing at police officers, and then had engaged in a fight with them. Delaney then said that he had discussed the case with the defendant, who had presented a different version of the incident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>At the next pretrial hearing, on September 15, 1992, Delaney again appeared for the defendant and addressed the court, <em>O\u2019Keefe, J., </em>on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The defendant renewed his objection to being represented by Delaney, insisting that he had been pro se all along, but also stating that when Judge Kocay had appointed Delaney, he had \u201c[gone] along with it.\u201d The court then allowed the defendant individually to present argument about his bond.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">At the defendant\u2019s next appearance, on November 18, 1992, the court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>informed the defendant that his case was ready for trial and asked the defendant if he had counsel. After the defendant told Judge Espinosa that he intended to represent himself, she questioned him in order to determine whether to accept his waiver of counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>told the defendant that he would be permitted to represent himself at trial, with Delaney acting as standby counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>After a recess, the trial court reconvened. Upon reconvening, further colloquies and proceedings took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>place among the trial court, the state, the defendant and his standby counsel. The court explained the process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>jury voir dire to the defendant, and he indicated that he understood the court\u2019s explanation. The court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>explained that it would be in the defendant\u2019s interest to have the two sets of charges severed so as to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>undue prejudice to him. See footnotes 7 and 10. In this connection, Delaney also indicated that he had advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the defendant of the \u201clegal ramifications\u201d of having the cases tried separately or together, and that \u201cit was [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>defendant\u2019s] decision to state whatever he [wanted].\u201d When the state objected to a severance, the state, at the court\u2019s request, described the facts of the two sets of charges, and the defendant elected to have them tried together.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court then explained to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ant that the state proposed to file a substitute information that would change the charge in the December 20, 1991 incident from a misdemeanor to a felony, that the charge of \u201cassault on a peace officer\u201d is a class C felony carrying a minimum mandatory sentence of one year, and a maximum sentence of ten years and a $5000 fine, and that the charge of \u201c[b]reach of the peace\u201d carries a maximum penalty of six months and a $1000 f\u00edne. The court further explained that, because of the defendant\u2019s decision to have the cases tried together, the state had to file a substitute information, and stated: \u201cSo if that\u2019s what you want to do you\u2019ll understand the consequences of that then I will recess and give the state an opportunity to [file a substitute information] because what\u2019s going to happen is you have to plead again. You have to plead not guilty to the new charges, and ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>for a jury trial.\u201d Before the court recessed, however, the defendant requested copies of the police reports on the two cases. Delaney indicated that he had those copies, and would give them to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">After the luncheon recess, the state handed copies of its two long form substitute informations to the defendant, and the defendant was put to plea on the charges involved in this appeal. The clerk read the long form information involved in this case, which spelled out the statutory elements of the charges of assault of a peace officer and breach of the peace.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court then, at the state\u2019s request, readvised the defendant of the penalties for assault of a peace officer and breach of the peace, and the court again asked the defendant whether he had \u201cever represented [himjself before in a case,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Thereafter, the parties selected a jury, and the trial proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">At trial, the defendant represented himself, with Delaney acting as standby counsel. The jury found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>defendant guilty of all three charges and, after the court ordered the defendant examined pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-566,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court rendered judgment of conviction in accordance with the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. In the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>trial court improperly (1) permitted him to represent himself without a determination that he was competent, (2) permitted him to proceed without an adequate waiver of counsel, (3) determined that sufficient evidence was introduced at trial from which a rational trier of fact could find the defendant guilty of breach of the peace, and (4) instructed the jury on the intent element of breach of the peace.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 501-502. The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s third claim, and did not reach the first and fourth claims. With respect to the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel claim, the court concluded that, when the trial court had canvassed the defendant in order to determine whether to accept his waiver, it had failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 961 (3), which requires that, in order for a defendant to waive his right to counsel and represent himself, the court must be satisfied that he \u201c[cjomprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings, the range of permissible punishments, and any additional facts essential to a broad understanding of the case.\u201d See footnote 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The Appellate Court considered the defendant\u2019s claim under \u00a7 961 (3) pursuant to the plain error doctrine; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>see Practice Book \u00a7 4185;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> concluding that, \u201c[although the defendant did not properly preserve this claim of error for appeal, noncompliance with a mandatoiy rule of practice constitutes plain error. \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 506. The court also noted that \u201c[t]his claim is also reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s actions constituted plain error, we need not undertake a <em>Golding </em>analysis.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>supra, 506 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s canvass of the defendant was flawed because the court had not advised him of the specific statutory elements of the crimes charged. Id., 506. \u201cIn an attempt to comply with \u00a7 961 (3), the court did advise the defendant of the penalties that he faced in light of the state\u2019s charges, but it did not advise him of the elements of those crimes so as to inform him adequately of the nature of the charges against him.\u201d Id. In response to the state\u2019s argument that the trial court was entitled to presume that the defendant\u2019s counsel had explained to him the nature of the offenses in sufficient detail, the Appellate Court read the record to disclose that \u201cthe defendant proceeded without the assistance of counsel from the inception of his court appearances. We cannot presume, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s attorney had explained the nature of the offenses to the defendant.\u201d Id., 507. The court concluded, accordingly, that there had been \u201c \u2018substantial defective compliance\u2019 \u201d with \u00a7 961 (3). Id. Accordingly, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. Id., 509. This certified appeal by the state followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">We first address the certified issue, namely, whether the Appellate Court properly concluded that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel and election to proceed pro se was invalid. The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court did not comply adequately with the requirements of \u00a7 961 (3). The state takes issue with the Appellate Court\u2019s decision on two grounds. First, the state argues that the Appellate Court improperly construed the provision in \u00a7 961 (3) that the defendant be advised of the nature of the charges against him to require the trial court to advise the defendant of the specific elements of the crimes with which he was being charged. Second, the state contends that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court could not presume that the defendant\u2019s counsel had advised him of the nature of the charges. The state further argues that all of the remaining requirements of \u00a7 961 had been satisfied. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">We first consider the Appellate Court\u2019s reliance, under the plain error doctrine, on what it held to be the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with a mandatory rule of practice, namely, \u00a7 961 (3). To the extent that the Appellate Court based its conclusion on the effect of \u00a7 961 (3) solely as a mandatory rule of practice, apart from its constitutional underpinnings,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that basis was flawed because \u00a7 961 and the constitutional requirements for permitting a defendant to waive his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>counsel and, thereby, assert his constitutional right to represent himself, are synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The right to counsel and the right to self-representation \u201cpresent mutually exclusive alternatives. A criminal defendant has a constitutionally protected interest in each, but since the two rights cannot be exercised simultaneously, a defendant must choose between them. When the right to have competent counsel ceases as the result of a sufficient waiver, the right of self-representation begins. . . . Put another way, a defendant properly exercises his right to self-representation by knowingly and intelligently waiving his right to representation by counsel.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Day, 233 Conn. 813, 821, 661 A.2d 539 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Section 961 \u201cwas adopted in order to implement the right of a defendant in a criminal case to act as his own attorney <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 532, 480 A.2d 435 (1984) <em>(Gethers I). </em>Before a trial court may accept a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, it must conduct an inquiry in accordance with \u00a7 961, in order to satisfy itself that the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel is knowingly and intelligently made. <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 822. Because the \u00a7 961 inquiry simultaneously triggers the constitutional right of a defendant to represent himself and enables the waiver of the constitutional right of a defendant to counsel, the provisions of \u00a7 961 cannot be construed to require anything more than is constitutionally mandated. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>211 Conn. 215, 220, 558 A.2d 669 (1989); <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">\u201c[A] defendant need not himself have the skill and experience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation .... <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>[422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975)]. Rather, a record that affirmatively shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>that [he] was literate, competent, and understanding, and that he was voluntarily exercising his informed free will sufficiently supports a waiver. Id.; <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, [193 Conn.] 536.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 827-28. The nature of the inquiry that must be conducted to substantiate an effective waiver has been explicitly articulated in decisions by various federal courts of appeals. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cash, </em>47 F.3d 1083, 1088 (11th Cir. 1995) (court must inform defendant of charges, included offenses and possible range of punishment); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hurtado, </em>47 F.3d 577, 583 (2d Cir. 1995) (factors determining valid waiver include whether defendant understood that he had choice between proceeding pro se and with assigned counsel, understood advantages of having trained counsel, and had capacity to make intelligent choice); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Van Krieken, </em>39 F.3d 227, 229 (9th Cir. 1994) (defendant must be aware of nature of charges against him, possible penalties and disadvantages of self-representation); <em>Government of Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>James, </em>934 F.2d 468, 471 (3d Cir. 1991) (waiver must be made with apprehension of nature of charges, statutory offenses included within them, range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to charges, circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to broad understanding of whole matter); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Silkwood, </em>893 F.2d 245, 249 (10th Cir. 1989) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>814 F.2d 245, 251 (6th Cir. 1987) (\u201cmodel inquiry\u201d includes questioning about defendant\u2019s legal background, knowledge of crimes charged, possible punishments, familiarity with Federal Rules of Evidence and Criminal Procedure, procedure for testifying, and advice that defendant would be better served by representation by trained attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">None of these authorities, however, stands for the proposition that a defendant must be specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>informed of the particular elements of the crimes charged before being permitted to waive counsel and proceed pro se.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In fact, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated that \u201cperfect comprehension of each element of a criminal charge does not appear to be necessary to a finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>913 F.2d 712, 715 (9th Cir. 1990). A discussion of the elements of the charged crimes would be helpful, and may be one of the factors involved in the ultimate determination of whether the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him. A description of the elements of the crime is not, however, a sine qua non of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights in this context. Indeed, in our cases we have approved of a defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to proceed pro se where the record did not affirmatively disclose that the trial court explained the specific elements of the crimes charged to the defendant as long as the defendant understood the nature of the crimes charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 829 (defendant aware that he was charged with capital felony and multiple counts of murder); <em>State </em>v. <em>Town</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>send,, supra, 211 Conn. 222 (defendant aware that he was charged with murder); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 371 n.2, 497 A.2d 408 (1985) (while informing defendant of gravity of crime charged, court advised defendant that he was charged with tampering with witness); <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 537 (defendant stated that he was aware that he was charged with two counts of robbery). In each of those cases, we concluded that the defendant had validly waived his right to counsel, although none of those decisions indicated that the defendant had been expressly apprised of the elements of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Applying the appropriate constitutional standard to this record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel and assertion of his right to represent himself were valid insofar as he comprehended \u201cthe nature of the charges and proceedings\u201d against him. Practice Book \u00a7 961 (3). The defendant knew that he was charged with two counts of assault of a peace officer, and with one count of breach of the peace. He knew in detail the facts claimed by the state to constitute his guilt of those charges, through discussions with his counsel, through statements of those facts on the record in his presence, and through the police reports that he had in his possession. Furthermore, shortly after the court accepted his waiver of counsel and his assertion of his right of self-representation, but before any further proceedings had begun, the state handed him the substitute information, the clerk read it to him, and he pleaded not guilty and elected to be tried by a jury. That information contained the essential elements of the crimes charged. Neither the defendant nor his standby counsel, however, took any action to indicate that this additional specific information created any confusion in his mind regarding the nature of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We also agree with the state that this record is sufficient to support the presumption that the defendant\u2019s counsel, Delaney, had explained to him the nature of the offenses in sufficient detail to permit the trial court to conclude that \u00a7 961 (3) had been satisfied. <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 537. Contrary to the assertion of the Appellate Court that the defendant had proceeded pro se from the inception of his court appearances, the defendant was represented by Delaney from July 7, 1992, to November 18,1992, when the defendant waived his right to counsel and proceeded to trial pro se. During that time, there were at least three pretrial hearings at which Delaney appeared on behalf of the defendant. At the July 21, 1992 hearing, Delaney appeared for the defendant and requested that the case be continued so that he could confer with his client. After having had the opportunity to speak with the defendant, Delaney again appeared for the defendant on July 22. Although Delaney described himself both as the defendant\u2019s counsel of record and as his standby counsel, Delaney argued a motion for bond reduction on his behalf. During that hearing, the assistant bail commissioner indicated that the defendant was charged with assault on a police officer. The assistant state\u2019s attorney also stated that the defendant had been publicly screaming and swearing at police officers and had fought with them, resulting in one officer being knocked unconscious. When the court asked Delaney if he would like to speak with the defendant about those issues, Delaney responded, \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken to him, Your Honor. He differs from what they said. He claims they came up and said a few things, he mouthed off, he wasn\u2019t mouthing off at them, he was talking to somebody else. He said they came over and got into his face and things started.\u201d Thus, the record affirmatively discloses that Delaney discussed the facts of the case with the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ant. It is a fair inference from this record that, in representing the defendant in those pretrial hearings and in discussing those facts with him, Delaney also discussed with the defendant the legal significance of those facts. Accordingly, this record supports the presumption that Delaney sufficiently explained the nature of the charges to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Finally, we agree with the state that this record also discloses that the remaining requirements of \u00a7 961 were complied with.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is evident from the waiver of counsel canvass; see footnote 9; that the trial court informed the defendant that he had a right to be represented by an attorney, who would act as either full counsel or standby counsel, inquired about the defendant\u2019s social, emotional and educational background, as well as his knowledge of trials, and discussed with the defendant his understanding of the consequences of representing himself and the possible punishments he faced if convicted. The trial court, therefore, properly concluded that the defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Moreover, \u201cthe court should ascertain, through an appropriate inquiry, that the defendant possesses the intelligence and capacity to make the choice and to appreciate the consequences of his decision to represent himself. . . . Some of the factors bearing on the defendant\u2019s capacity include age, education, mental health, prior experience with criminal trials and consul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tation with counsel prior to proceeding pro se, although none of these inquiries is a constitutional necessity.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The waiver of counsel canvass here reveals that the defendant: (1) had completed two and one-half years of college; (2) had a history of emotional problems but did not currently require treatment or medication; (3) had prior experience as a defendant in a criminal trial; (4) had consulted with counsel prior to proceeding pro se; and (5) had standby counsel available to assist him throughout the entire trial. The trial court\u2019s inquiry pursuant to \u00a7 961 supports a conclusion that the defendant was competent to waive his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">We now turn to the first of the defendant\u2019s alternate grounds for affirmance. The defendant claims that the trial court improperly permitted him to represent himself without ordering, sua sponte, a competency examination,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>defendant concedes that every criminal defendant is presumed to be competent. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (b). The defendant also concedes that the state, he and Delaney, acting as his appointed counsel or his standby counsel, each failed to move for such an examination. General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d (c). The defendant argues, however, that the circumstances of this case, in which the trial court was faced with a defendant who had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>history of mental illness and was charged with crimes involving bizarre and irrational behavior, required that the trial court order, suasponte, a competency examination before it permitted him to proceed pro se. The defendant further argues that, even if the trial court properly concluded, prior to the commencement of the trial, that he was competent, his behavior during the course of the trial, which eventually led the court to order a postverdict examination of him pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566, should have alerted the trial court that a \u00a7 54-56d (d) competency examination was required. The defendant asserts that, although he failed to raise these claims at trial, he is entitled to prevail under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We conclude that he may not prevail because his claim fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">We agree with the defendant that the record is adequate to review his claim and that, because \u201c[t]he conviction of an accused person who is not legally competent . . . violates the due process of law guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 686, 535 A.2d 345 (1987); his claim is of constitutional magnitude. The first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are thus met. We therefore proceed to a consideration of the third prong, namely, whether the alleged constitutional violation exists that deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 399-400, 113 S. Ct. 2680, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>125 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1993), mandates that any defendant who is competent to stand trial as a matter of state law is competent to waive the right to counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 825. Accordingly, we focus our inquiry on whether a \u00a7 54-56d (d) examination was required in order to determine whether the defendant was competent to stand trial and, therefore, to waive the right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">The standard we use to determine whether a defendant is competent under state law to stand trial is that set forth in <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S. Ct. 788, 4 L. Ed. 2d 824 (1960) (test for competence to stand trial is \u201c \u2018whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u2019 \u201d). The <em>Dusky </em>standard has been codified at \u00a7 54-56d (a), which provides that \u201c[a] defendant shall not be tried, convicted or sentenced while he is not competent. For the purposes of this section, a defendant is not competent if he is unable to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The defendant first argues that, because the trial court was aware of his prior psychiatric history and was also aware that the crimes that he was accused of involved \u201cirrational behavior,\u201d the court was constitutionally obligated to order a competency examination prior to accepting his waiver of counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201c[T]he rule of <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson </em>[383 U.S. 375, 86 S. Ct. 836, 15 L. Ed. 2d 815 (1966)] imposes a constitutional obligation, under the due process clause, to undertake an independent judicial inquiry, in appropriate circumstances, into a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial .... When a <em>Pate </em>inquiry is required, a court may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>rely on the defendant\u2019s subjective appraisal of his own capacity or on the court\u2019s personal observations of the defendant but must hold an evidentiary hearing into the defendant\u2019s competence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cA defendant who challenges the validity of his [waiver] for lack of an evidentiary inquiry into his competence must make a showing that . . . the court had before it specific factual allegations that, if true, would constitute substantial evidence of mental impairment. <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U.S. 1, 21, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 10 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1963). Substantial evidence is a term of art. Evidence encompasses all information properly before the court, whether it is in the form of testimony or exhibits formally admitted or it is in the form of medical reports or other kinds of reports that have been filed with the court. Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s competency.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 605, 504 A.2d 497 (1986).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cThe decision to grant [an evidentiary] hearing [into a defendant\u2019s competence] requires the exercise of sound judicial discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 366, 507 A.2d 992 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">At the time that it accepted the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel, the trial court was aware that the defendant: (1) had completed two and one-half years of college; (2) had a past history of mental illness but was not currently receiving psychiatric treatment or taking medication; and (3) had been fully and adequately informed of the consequences of representing himself. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the defendant was occasionally rude and argumentative during the waiver of counsel canvass, he gave rational and coherent responses to the trial court\u2019s questions. His answers indicate that he was aware that, if he lost the case, he faced the possibility of twenty years in prison and that, as a result of a previous trial, he had some familiarity with courtroom procedure. Furthermore, prior to the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the defendant\u2019s waiver, he had been observed by three judges during seven pretrial hearings, four representatives of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, and Delaney, none of whom saw fit either to request or to order a competency examination pursuant to \u00a7 54-56d (d). See footnote 18. The trial court could reasonably have concluded that insufficient evidence had been generated to raise a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings or assist in his own defense and, therefore, that an independent competency inquiry was not required prior to acceptance of his waiver of counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>230 Conn. 572, 587-88, 646 A.2d 108 (1994) (independent competency examination not required if defendant [1] did not suffer from known or apparent mental illness that would impair ability to understand proceedings or assist in defense, [2] possessed minimum communication skills, [3] understood basic charges against him and right to accept or reject plea bargain, and [4] understood consequences of decision); <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 605-606 <em>(Pate </em>inquiry not required if only evidence of possible incompetency was defendant\u2019s unsubstantiated reference to history of psychiatric treatment and medication). We cannot conclude, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to order, sua sponte, a <em>Pate </em>inquiry. With regard to the trial court\u2019s initial acceptance of the defendant\u2019s waiver, therefore, the defendant has failed to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The defendant also argues that, even if he had been competent at the time the trial court accepted his waiver of counsel, events that occurred during the course of the trial, specifically, his (1) failure to make a motion to sever the two cases, (2) lack of understanding of the voir dire process, (3) elicitation of prejudicial material from other similar incidents,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> (4) inappropriate behavior such as rudeness and throwing papers, and (5) lack of understanding of trial procedure, raised a reasonable doubt about his continued competence, and that the trial court, therefore, should have suspended the trial and ordered a competency examination. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We agree that a defendant who is competent at the commencement of a trial may later become incompetent and that, when a reasonable doubt concerning the defendant\u2019s competency is raised, the trial court must order a competency examination. <em>State </em>v. <em>DesLaurier, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 589 n.12. Much of the defendant\u2019s argument, however, is based on the inadequacy of his legal skills as evidenced by examples of strategic errors he made in the course of representing himself. We are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s incompetence to stand trial is demonstrated by his lack of legal competence to try his case skillfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>The competence that is required for a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel to be valid is not, as the defendant suggests, the competence to <em>represent himself, </em>but is, rather, the competence to <em>waive the right </em>to counsel. <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>supra, 509 U.S. 399-400. \u201cThus, while it is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel\u2019s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts ... a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to represent himself has no bearing upon his competence to <em>choose </em>self-representation.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 400. \u201cWe harbor no illusions that a defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel and proceed pro se generally will lead to anything other than disastrous consequences. . . . Nonetheless, the values informing our constitutional structure teach that although [a defendant] may conduct his own defense ultimately to his own detriment, his choice must be honored out of that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 821. The defendant\u2019s skill in representing himself, therefore, is of marginal relevance to his competence to choose self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to order a presentence psychiatric examination pursuant to \u00a7 17a-566; see footnote 12; indicates that the trial court became aware during the course of the trial that the defendant was mentally impaired and, accordingly, should have ordered a \u00a7 54-56d (d) examination.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That argument is equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">We must presume from the fact that the trial court ordered a \u00a7 17a-566 (a) examination that it suspected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>that the defendant was \u201cmentally ill and dangerous to himself or others.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201c[a]n accused may be suffering from a mental illness and nonetheless be able to understand the charges against him and to assist in his own defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeAngelis, </em>200 Conn. 224, 230, 511 A.2d 310 (1986). Section 17a-566 serves as a sentencing tool. The fact that the trial court suspected that the defendant might be mentally ill and ordered a \u00a7 17a-566 examination to assist it in determining whether the defendant required custodial care and treatment at Whiting Forensic Institute, rather than incarceration within the correctional system, does not, therefore, compel a conclusion that it had reason to believe that any mental impairment from which the defendant suffered prevented him from presenting a defense or proceeding pro se. Thus, with regard to the trial court\u2019s continued acceptance of the defendant\u2019s waiver, the defendant has failed to meet the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The defendant\u2019s second alternate ground for affirming the judgment of the Appellate Court is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the element of intent necessary to find him guilty of breach of the peace. The defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s instruction failed to include the judicial gloss that we applied, after the present case had been tried, to the same mens rea language in the disorderly conduct statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 806-19, 640 A.2d 986 (1994). Because this claim was not preserved in the trial court, the defendant seeks to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, or, in the alternative, under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We conclude that the defendant may prevail under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">We agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for review and that he has raised a claim of consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tutional magnitude. It \u201cis . . . constitutionally axiomatic that the jury be instructed on the essential elements of a crime charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 708, 539 A.2d 561 (1988). The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects an accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 483-84, 668 A.2d 682 (1995). The defendant\u2019s claim is, therefore, of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Moreover, it is clear from the record that the constitutional violation exists. The trial court\u2019s mens rea instruction simply restated the pertinent language of \u00a7 53a-181; see footnote 3; and then referred to the generalized instruction that the court had given on intent: \u201cIt must be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm in a public place by the commission of the forbidden conduct, which, in this case, is using abusive or obscene language. I remind you of what I just told you about intent. A person acts intentionally, with respect to a result, or to conduct, when his conscious objective is to cause such result, or to engage in such conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">The statutory language setting forth the intent required for conviction of breach of the peace is identical to the language in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182 (a),<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>which states the mens rea necessary for conviction of disorderly conduct. In order to avoid constitutional vagueness problems, we have applied interpretive gloss to the mens rea language of the disorderly conduct statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 795. In <em>Indrisano, </em>we concluded that \u201cthe mens rea language of \u00a7 53a-182 (a) can be formulated more precisely as follows: the predominant intent is to cause what a reasonable person operating under contemporary community standards would consider a disturbance to or impediment of a lawful activity, a deep feeling of vexation or provocation, or a feeling of anxiety prompted by threatened danger or harm. In order to sustain a conviction for disorderly conduct, the state must begin by demonstrating that the defendant had such a state of mind.\u201d Id., 810-11. The need to apply interpretive gloss to \u00a7 53a-182 (a) that we perceived in <em>Indrisano </em>is equally present with regard to \u00a7 53a-181.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We therefore proceed to consideration of whether the trial court\u2019s failure to include the <em>Indrisano </em>gloss in the jury instructions was harmless. The defendant argues that the state has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the improper jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Miele, Buyak and Connolly all testified that the defendant had been shouting and swearing at the police officers, thus attracting the attention of passersby, and that in response to the defendant\u2019s behavior, Miele and Buyak had approached the defendant, who hit Miele. A struggle then ensued between the defendant and the officers, during which all three fell down the stairs, resulting in injuries to the officers. The defendant, on the other hand, testified on direct examination that he had been standing outside the train station but had not been shouting at Miele and Buyak, and that the two officers had approached him and asked him if he had a problem, to which he had responded, \u201cYes. The Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ford police are fucking me.\u201d According to the defendant, Miele then grabbed hold of the defendant\u2019s arm and the defendant, in an attempt to free himself, hit Miele. On cross-examination, the defendant testified that when the officers had asked him if he had a problem, he had responded only, \u201cNo,\u201d and had not used abusive or obscene language and had not struck Miele.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Given that the testimony concerning this event is ambiguous regarding the defendant\u2019s intent, it cannot be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s omission of the <em>Indrisano </em>gloss did not contribute to the verdict. In other words, the jury, under the trial court\u2019s instruction, could have fully credited the defendant\u2019s testimony that his only provocative conduct was the statement \u201c[t]he Hartford police are fucking me,\u201d and, nevertheless, still found him guilty of breach of the peace, a result that is constitutionally infirm. The fourth prong of <em>Golding </em>is, therefore, satisfied and the defendant is entitled to a new trial on the breach of the peace charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed in part and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to the assault of a peace officer charges, and to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial on the breach of the peace charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

The bail commissioner reminded the court that, at the defendant\u2019s arraignment, he had recommended a promise to appear, and was reinstituting that recommendation \u201con the assault on [a] police officer file.\u201d The court was reluctant to release the defendant on a promise to appear and requested that Delaney, as the defendant\u2019s attorney of record, assist the defendant in obtaining his social security disability checks in order to post bond. The defendant complained that Delaney had not contacted him as had been promised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>previously and, therefore, that he had been unable to post bond and work on his defense. The defendant specifically referred to the December 20, 1991 incident and clearly knew the difference between that case and the May 26, 1992 case. The state opposed any reduction in bail, arguing that '\u2018[both] cases involve unprovoked attacks on police officers. In one situation the officers were arresting another party for a robbery.

I told the court that I\u2019d like to go out on the street \u2014 outside okay, I\u2019m in jail now, so I can start putting together my defense.

Okay, so I am somewhat familiar [with] what a trial consists of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjA\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Let me, let\u2019s get one thing straight here, you have a right to defend yourself, but the court has to determine first and put on the record that you know what you\u2019re doing, that\u2019s all. If you want to [go to] trial and defend yourself then that\u2019s fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsM\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah, well if the court says that I\u2019m incompetent, then so be it. But I mean\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj3\">\u201cThe Court: I\u2019m not going to say that unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATi\">\u201cThe Defendant: Well they must\u2019ve decided that I am competent, but they\u2019re stonewalling me because I cannot go out and prepare my defense. I mean I can\u2019t prepare my defense in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao-\">\u201cThe Court: Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6G\">\"The Defendant: Because I need to subpoena people, I need to gather infor \u2014 you know talk to people about this and that. I mean that\u2019s only fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1F\">\u201cThe Court: Well, unfortunately you are in custody and you have to defend yourself. If you want you have available to you a lawyer, but you don\u2019t want the lawyer you want to do it on your own. That is your right as long as you know what you\u2019re doing and you know the consequences of what you\u2019re doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: Well my consequences is I lose the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWt\">\u201cThe Court: Right, do you understand how much time you're facing in jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFBs\">\u201cThe Defendant: He told me last, two consecutive ten year bids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al9\">\u201cThe Court: All right and that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af5\">\u201cThe Defendant: Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkX\">\u201cThe Court: Well is that right? What\u2019s assault on an officer, five?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArY\">\u201cMr. Delaney: C felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">\u201c[William Bumpus, Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: C, it\u2019s ten, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adb\">\u201cThe Court: Ten. Ten years, you have two counts of assault on an officer, that is twenty and then you have on the other one two, two and a half years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">\u201cThe Defendant: Okay so now you\u2019re telling me \u2014 I mean I\u2019m aware of the consequences but I mean I see it as being highly unfair that you expect me to go to trial like that without being able to prepare my defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayf0\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if what you\u2019re saying is that the only way you can prepare your defense is by being out on the street that\u2019s not correct. Many people prepare their own defenses and defend themselves when they\u2019re in custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxK\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah, oh yeah, there\u2019s no doubt about that, I agree with you on that, but I mean is it that too much to ask for a promise to appear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiK\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s not what you\u2019re\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGh\">\u201cThe Defendant: You\u2019re saying I already had a bond reduction, this and that and on my last court appearance, okay, he was ready to give me a trial then, okay. And he never, the judge never gave me my next court date, okay. I mean there\u2019s all sorts of you know violations. Now if the only way we can get this over with is for me to start today then so be it, but I mean it\u2019s very unprofessional, I say, it\u2019s \u2014 you\u2019re going to make me look very unprofessional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajz\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s one of the dangers of representing yourself when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and you\u2019re not a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6\">\u201cThe Defendant: No but you\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t know what, how to prepare a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-\">\u201cThe Court: No I\u2019m not saying that, you may know, I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen you in the courtroom, I haven\u2019t seen whatever it is you want to do. My purpose here is to explain to you the consequences of you representing yourself. And the consequences are these, that you\u2019re going to be facing an experienced lawyer who knows the mies of evidence and procedure. Who knows how to question witnesses and cross-examine, who has had many years experience, legal training and you have none. Now if you want to represent yourself knowing the consequences that you\u2019re facing twenty years in prison, if you get convicted, that\u2019s your right. As long as we understand the consequences of your actions, that\u2019s the only reason we\u2019re here. You have, every citizen has a right to defend and represent themselves, and you have that right like anybody else. If what you\u2019re trying to do is tell me that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>only way you can defend yourself is by getting out in the street then I told you that is not the purpose we\u2019re here. Some judge has decided that the proper amount of the bond is what has been set. That\u2019s that judge\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWU\">\u201cThe Defendant: Ma\u2019am, okay, we can start the trial, but I want to say this. Having four or five pretrials on one case is too much, okay? Number one the case in 1991 was expected to \u2014 I was on the pretrial docket on three different occasions for that case. Now that\u2019s wrong in itself, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_de\">\u201cThe Court: All right, you wanted a trial sooner, is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVm\">\u201cThe Defendant: Of course I wanted a trial sooner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQE\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Then that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU3\">\u201cThe Defendant: That didn\u2019t happen. Now all of this and I\u2019m not granted a promise to appear. You know what that says to me? That says that you people are being very unfair, but like I say there\u2019s no problem with starting a trial, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzG\">\u201cThe Court: All right, we\u2019ll do that, which case are we starting on then? Both together or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au2\">\u201cThe Defendant: You don\u2019t know which case \u2014 you see, you know that\u2019s your decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsF\">\u201cThe Court: Well, that\u2019s not my decision, that\u2019s the state\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsJh\">\u201cMr. Bumpus: Yes, Your Honor, the state would be requesting to try both matters together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKs\">\u201cThe Court: All right, and what\u2019s your position on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq6\">\u201cThe Defendant: That\u2019s not a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A53\">\u201cThe Court: You want to try both of them at the same time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajli\">\u201cThe Defendant: We\u2019ve already been through that, yeah. The \u2014 one of the previous judges said that having both cases would save the state money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmW\">\u201cThe Court: All right. For the record then I want to just question you to make sure that it\u2019s clear about the fact that you\u2019re representing yourself. You have a public defender assigned to you, I\u2019m going to ask Mr. Delaney to remain as standby counsel. What that means is that if you want to speak to him, if a legal issue comes up that you want to talk to him about it, then you may do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKmv\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019d like another \u2014 someone else beside Mr. Delaney because I\u2019ve been given false information by him, that\u2019s why.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACH\">\u201cThe Court: Well Mr. Delaney is familiar\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASr\">\u201cMr. Delaney: You better put it on the record if you want to have something to do about that, you better tell the judge what false information you got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACn\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Delaney is the one that\u2019s familiar with the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJd\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yeah?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abz\">\u201cThe Court: And so he knows what your situation is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">\u201cThe Defendant: Uh hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ars\">\u201cThe Court: Now you don\u2019t want him because he gave you false information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201cThe Defendant: Okay, you can answer this question.

By entering a guilty plea, a defendant is waiving his right to trial by jury, his right to confront accusers, and the privilege against self-incrimination; the defendant is not, however, simultaneously asserting another constitutional right. Unlike a guilty plea, waiver of the right to counsel involves reciprocal constitutional rights; the assertion of the right to self-representation compels waiver of the right to counsel. In the context of \u00a7 961 (3), therefore, we construe the phrase \u201cnature of the charges\u201d to mean precisely that which is constitutionally required for the assertion of these complementary constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> Although the Appellate Court based its decision on its conclusion that the trial court had not complied with the requirements of \u00a7 961 (3) and, therefore, did not address whether the trial court had properly concluded that the remaining requirements of \u00a7 961 had been met, because a brief examination of the waiver of counsel canvass reveals that the remaining requirements of \u00a7 961 were fulfilled, we shall, in the interest of judicial economy, reach that conclusion, rather than remanding the case to the Appellate Court for such a determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> As we noted in part I C of this opinion, the court\u2019s inquiry pursuant to \u00a7 961 addressed the issue of competence.

The court either may appoint one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry to examine the defendant or it may order the commissioner of mental health to conduct the examination either by a clinical team consisting of a physician specializing in psychiatry, a clinical psychologist and a psychiatric social worker, or by one or more physicians specializing in psychiatry. If the commissioner of mental health is ordered to conduct the examination, he shall select the members of the clinical team or the physician or physicians. If the examiners determine that the defendant is not competent, they shall then determine whether there is substantial probability that the defendant, if provided with a course of treatment, will regain competency within the maximum period of any placement order under this section.

In support of his theory that there was a police conspiracy, the defendant introduced evidence of other confrontations between himself and the police. Although the defendant\u2019s acknowledgment of previous confrontations with the police may, in fact, have been prejudicial to his case, the defendant\u2019s claim of a police conspiracy is not, in and of itself, sufficient to require a competency examination where, as in this case, the trial court was aware prior to the presentation of evidence that this was his theory of defense and had warned him of the possible prejudicial effect of revealing that he had been involved in previous altercations with the police, and where the rest of the record supports a finding of the defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> The defendant does not claim that the content of the \u00a7 17a-566 examination demonstrates that the trial court should have ordered a competency examination.

I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s decision that the defendant be granted a new trial on the alternate ground that the trial court should have ordered a competency hearing prior to permitting the defendant to waive his right to counsel. Because this issue was not raised at trial, the court engages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>a Golding<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> review to determine whether it can be raised on appeal. Although the majority concedes that the issue involves a claim of constitutional magnitude and that the record is sufficient, they refuse to review the claim because a violation does not clearly exist. I disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The trial court has an obligation to undertake an independent judicial inquiry to determine if the defendant is competent. State v. <em>Lloyd, </em>199 Conn. 359, 366, 507 A.2d 992 (1986). That obligation not only extends to whether the defendant is competent to be tried; id.; but also whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel. See <em>Godinez </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 398, 113 S. Ct. 2680,125 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1993) (standard of competency for pleading guilty or waiving right to counsel is same as competency standard for standing trial). Before it may allow the accused to proceed through the treacherous path of self-representation, and throughout the course of the proceedings, a trial court is obliged to determine whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel. Id., 399-400.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">As a result of our chaotic procedure of constantly reassigning trial judges, a defendant, as in this case, may appear before several judges during preliminary proceedings and before yet another different judge for trial. In order to afford the defendant due process of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>law, it only stands to reason that his claim must be measured by the collective knowledge of the trial judges he appeared before. Nevertheless, in this case, the individual knowledge of several of the trial judges was sufficient to alert them that they were required to suspend the pretrial and trial proceedings in order to determine the defendant\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Recently, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 661 A.2d 539 (1995), this court held the following: \u201cWhile a defendant has an absolute right to self-representation, that right is not self-executing. A trial court in this state must satisfy itself that several criteria have been met before a criminal defendant properly may be allowed to waive counsel and proceed pro se. A waiver [of the right to counsel] will be accepted only after the judicial authority makes a thorough inquiry and is satisfied that the defendant: (1) Has been clearly advised of his right to the assistance of counsel, including his right to the assignment of counsel when he is so entitled; (2) Possesses the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of the decision to represent himself; (3) Comprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings, the range of permissible punishments, and any additional facts essential to a broad understanding of the case; and (4) Has been made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. Practice Book \u00a7 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\u201cAt the same time, we have recognized that this test cannot be construed to require anything more for an effective waiver of counsel than is constitutionally mandated, because such a waiver triggers the constitutional right of an accused to represent himself. . . . The multifactor analysis of \u00a7 961, therefore, is designed to assist the court in answering two fundamental questions: first, whether a criminal defendant is minimally competent to make the decision to waive counsel, and second, whether the defendant actually made that deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>sion in a knowing, voluntary and intelligent fashion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 822-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In my view, there was substantial evidence to indicate that the defendant may have been mentally impaired, and thus unable to waive his right to counsel in a knowing and intelligent fashion. Consequently, the trial court should have ordered a competency hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d. The majority\u2019s focus on the facts, which allows it to reach its conclusion, is so narrow that it defies credulity. Despite the following information, which the trial court had before it, the majority claims that there was insufficient evidence to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">First, a police officer\u2019s own version of the defendant\u2019s bizarre conduct, which led to his arrest in this case, is telling of the defendant\u2019s mental instability and possible incompetency. According to Stephen J. Miele, an officer with the Hartford police department, on May 26, 1992, the defendant, for some unknown reason, began shouting vulgarities at him and Laura Buyak, another Hartford police officer, who were in the process of arresting an unrelated individual. When the officers approached the defendant to ask him to calm down and to explain why they were arresting the other individual, he physically lashed out, striking Miele in the chest. The defendant continued to flail his arms, causing the two officers and himself to fall down a flight of stairs, thereby knocking Buyak unconscious. The defendant continued to punch Miele and attempted to bite him. Ultimately, the defendant was overpowered and handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Second, as known by one of the pretrial courts and the trial court, the defendant had a history of mental illness and had a prior conviction of assaulting and kidnapping his parents, an event which illustrated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>mental illness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a senior in high school, the defendant began seeking treatment from a psychiatrist. A few years later, after leaving college, the defendant suffered a \u201cpsychotic decompensation,\u201d i.e., a nervous breakdown. Subsequently, the defendant was diagnosed as a \u201cschizo-effective\u201d and underwent several psychotic hospitalizations and outpatient treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Third, the defendant explained his actions and based his defense on his belief that the Hartford police force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>was conspiring to harass him and have him evicted from various homeless shelters in Hartford. The defendant had been arrested on two previous occasions for assaulting various Hartford police officers: the defendant allegedly assaulted Albert DeStefano on December 20,1991, because DeStefano wished him a Merry Christmas; and the defendant allegedly assaulted Frederick J. Reinert on March 3, 1992, when the defendant tried to elude questioning. Only the incident that occurred on May 26,1992, involving Miele and Buyak, was at issue in this case. Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s unfounded paranoid defense presented at trial, which discussed the details of these separate incidents, opened the door for the admission of highly prejudicial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Fourth, after reading the entire transcript of the trial, it is apparent to me that a competency hearing was warranted. Certain exchanges and comments made by the defendant indicate his possible incompetence. For example, when informed by the court that DeStefano would not be available as a witness because he had recently left on vacation, the defendant responded: \u201cYour Honor, that ... is completely unjust. I mean, DeStefano \u2014 I base my whole case on DeStefano. I say the man has a personal vendetta against me. And I say he\u2019s . . . the criminal in this situation. I mean, he\u2019s the one that knew . . . the trial was about to start. He\u2019s playing his cards perfectly. He\u2019s very smart. Now he\u2019s getting away with this. He ... he was here last week. He knew the trial was about to start. And he left on a Friday, and . . . today is Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">A second example of the defendant\u2019s paranoia and disjunctive thinking occurred while he was questioning Ramona Rucker, a security guard at the Civic Center mall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-8\">\u201cQ. Would you say that I\u2019m capable of running?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cA. Yes you are. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cQ. Would you say that I\u2019m capable of running faster than you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never chased you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">\u201cQ. Are you saying that I\u2019m a coward?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">As a third illustration, in his closing argument to the jury, the defendant stated: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard my testimony, which I hope you found to be warm, calm and spontaneous. I am alone here, but only in appearance. I have had help from millions, upon millions of people in a subtle and undeniable way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Indeed, during his redirect examination of police officer Sergio Khuzkian, the defendant asked the witness to state his opinion of him. Khuzkian responded: \u201cMr. Wolff, you\u2019re not a well man, in my opinion from where I know you. As a matter of fact, I think [you are] crazy, and I think that you need some kind of mental help. And for me to sit here and have you question me I find ridiculous. From where I see you, from the point where I first met you, who was a man who was down and out on his luck, to a point where you\u2019ve gone totally insane, to the point where you don\u2019t even recognize me and you swear at me. You\u2019re constantly abusive to people downtown, to the officers, and you constantly \u2014 and it\u2019s like \u2014 like\u2014it\u2019s obvious that everybody knows you because of your actions. And I\u2019m there five days a week, and I see you there five days a week. I see you downtown acting in an insane manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Furthermore, after the verdict was returned, but before passing sentence, the trial court ordered that the defendant undergo a sixty day psychiatric examination at Whiting Forensic Institute. Subsequently, Carol Caplan, a member of the psychiatric team that evaluated the defendant at Whiting, testified that the defendant\u2019s mental condition had evolved and that he presently suffered from a paranoid disorder, which caused him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to be \u201ca high risk of dangerousness to himself or to others when his paranoid disorder is most severely out of order.\u201d As a result of that condition, Caplan observed that the defendant\u2019s thinking was illogical and that \u201c[h]e often draws illogical conclusions.\u201d Nevertheless, because the defendant refused medication that was prescribed to him, the psychiatric team recommended that he be sentenced in accordance with his conviction. In passing sentence, the trial court noted that the defendant \u201chas specifically and unequivocally stated [that] he will not take medication, and that is what he needs.\u201d The court then accepted the recommendation of the Whiting Forensic Institute and committed the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Under these circumstances, the thought of allowing the defendant to waive his right to counsel without adequately determining his competency is alarming. When information of this sort and volume comes to the attention of the trial judge, he or she is required to conduct an independent inquiry to determine the defendant\u2019s competency before allowing the defendant to waive his or her right to counsel. Likewise, during a trial in which a defendant is representing himself, the trial court may be obliged to reevaluate its order regarding the waiver of counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>supra, 199 Conn. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">I also question the majority\u2019s imputation of some import to the fact that the defendant completed two and one-half years of college and the fact that he is not currently receiving psychiatric treatment or taking medication. I find neither of these facts insightful into whether an individual may be competent to waive his or her right to counsel. Certainly there are highly educated individuals who, due to mental illness, are incompetent. Likewise, there are certainly individuals who suffer from mental illness who are not taking medication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>may in fact cure or minimize their illness and render them competent. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>235 Conn. 671, 669 A.2d 573 (1996). Indeed, in this case, the trial court noted that \u201cone thing that [the defendant] needs is medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Accordingly, I would affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s order that the defendant be granted a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b692-8\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989) (certain unpreserved claims may be raised on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> I note that there are some constitutional claims involving fundamental rights, such as the right to counsel, that should not be subject to <em>Golding </em>scrutiny because the violation of the right is patently obvious in its deprivation. Moreover, as in this case, it defies logic and reason to believe that the defendant should seek a competency examination of himself to determine whether he is competent to waive his right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b692-10\"> I recognize that \u201cthe competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive his right to counsel is the competence to <em>waive the right, </em>not the competence to represent himself.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Godinez v. Moran, </em>supra, 509 U.S. 399.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> \u201cOn December 28, 1989, the defendant was living with his parents, Gunther and Elvira Wolff, at the family residence at 438 Fern Street, West Hartford. Gunther Wolff, a sixty-five year old self-employed engineer, was working in his second floor study at about 4 p.m. when the defendant entered the study. The defendant told Gunther that he wanted to use some of the tools that Gunther had stored there. When his father declined to permit the defendant access to the tools, the defendant attempted to obtain them by force, throwing his father to the floor and keeping him pinned down to the floor by kneeling on his legs. During the next forty-five minutes, approximately, the defendant kept his father pinned to the floor, lectured him, and occasionally banged his head against the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">\u201cAt about 4:45 p.m., Elvira Wolff, who had been out, returned to the house. Alerted by noise upstairs, she entered the study on the second floor and saw her husband and the defendant on the floor. She screamed and attempted to pull the defendant off of his father. The defendant then verbally and physically assaulted his mother for a period of about sixty minutes. The defendant yelled at her and slapped her across the face and chest a number of times. Both victims wanted to leave the room, but were afraid to attempt to do so. Although there was a telephone in the room, neither victim attempted to use it. The defendant positioned himself between his parents and the door so that they could not leave without going around him. At one point, the defendant\u2019s father attempted to smash a window in the study in order to summon help, but was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s mother told him that she expected guests for dinner and that she had to prepare the meal. The two victims and the defendant then went to the kitchen. Subsequently, the defendant\u2019s father asked the defendant if he could take a walk in the neighborhood. The defendant replied that they could leave whenever they wanted. Both parents left the house, went to the nearest telephone and contacted the West Hartford police department. When the police responded, they found the defendant in the garage, working under the hood of an automobile. While his father was visibly upset, the defendant appeared calm and cooperative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>29 Conn. App. 524, 525-27, 616 A.2d 1143 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">The Appellate Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial because the trial court\u2019s instructions created a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled.
