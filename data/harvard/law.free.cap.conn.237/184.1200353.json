The plaintiffs, Jolly, Inc., Richard Tuliano and Carman Tuliano,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeal from the judgment of the trial court dismissing, for lack of aggrievement, their administrative appeal from the decision of the named defendant, the zoning board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>appeals of the city of Bridgeport (board), in favor of the defendant Cyrco, Inc. (Cyrco).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 initial claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that Cyrco had not waived its right to contest jurisdiction by failing to file a motion to dismiss in accordance with \u00a7 8-8 (j). See footnote 1. The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that they had failed to prove that they were aggrieved, in the classical sense, by the board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court, in dismissing their appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, improperly ignored binding precedent wherein we have consistently concluded that taxpayers in zoning appeals involving the sale of liquor are a priori aggrieved under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and, consequently, have automatic standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">We agree with the trial court that Cyrco did not waive its right to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We conclude, however, that our prior interpretation of \u00a7 8-8 (a) is proper and that the trial court ignored such precedent when it determined that the plaintiffs did not have standing to prosecute their appeal. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs can pursue their appeal because they are taxpayers in the municipality and the board\u2019s decision involves the sale of liquor; thus they are presumed to be aggrieved. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The facts underlying the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are as follows. In November, 1993, Cyrco, acting through its president, James A. Cyr, petitioned the board for a variance from the city zoning regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petition requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>a variance of chapter 17, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the regulations, which provides for a minimum of 1500 feet between liquor establishments, to permit Cyrco to relocate its existing liquor store from 1426 Pembroke Street to 572-578 Boston Avenue, where it would be located 1430 feet from the plaintiffs\u2019 liquor store.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">After a public hearing, the board granted Cyrco\u2019s petition and the plaintiffs appealed to the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiffs alleged that there had been insufficient proof of hardship to justify the board\u2019s decision to grant the variance requested by Cyrco.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to reaching the issue of hardship, however, the court addressed the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 aggrievement because it implicated the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">At the outset, the court determined that the plaintiffs did not meet the criteria of statutory aggrievement, as provided in \u00a7 8-8 (a), whereby a person who owns land that abuts or is within a radius of 100 feet of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>involved in the board\u2019s decision is considered automatically aggrieved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The court further concluded that the plaintiffs were not classically aggrieved because they had failed to prove that their personal legal interests were specially and injuriously affected by the board\u2019s decision. In that connection, the court found that there was no evidence that the board\u2019s decision to grant the variance would have an adverse effect on the plaintiffs\u2019 property from an increase in road traffic, a change in traffic patterns or any physical impact, and that the only special adverse impact advanced by the plaintiffs, namely, a loss of economic advantage due to increased business competition, was highly speculative and insufficient to establish classical aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Finally, while acknowledging that the plaintiffs, as taxpayers challenging a zoning decision involving the sale of liquor, had established that they were automatically aggrieved under existing case law, the court, nevertheless, refused to allow the plaintiffs the benefit of this long-standing rule because it concluded that the reasoning of such prior cases was flawed, anachronistic and should be overruled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of its findings that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the plaintiffs were neither statutorily nor classically aggrieved and, in the trial court\u2019s view, should no longer be considered automatically aggrieved based solely on the fact that they were taxpayers appealing from a zoning decision involving a liquor outlet, the trial court concluded that it was without subject matter jurisdiction to consider the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the trial court improperly concluded that Cyrco had not waived its right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction by failing to file a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in accordance with \u00a7 8-8 (j).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plaintiffs argue that \u00a7 8-8 (j) mandates that jurisdiction can be contested only by a motion to dismiss and that failure to file such a motion, therefore, results in a waiver of one\u2019s right to contest jurisdiction in the future. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We previously have indicated that pleading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of a plaintiff\u2019s appeal. <em>Park City Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>210 Conn. 697, 702-703, 556 A.2d 602 (1989); <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>158 Conn. 497, 501, 264 A.2d 566 (1969); <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Town Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 505, 509, 242 A.2d 705 (1968). Failure to raise the issue of aggrievement is not a bar to future consideration of that issue because aggrievement implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. See <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 307, 592 A.2d 953 (1991). \u201cA possible absence of subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed and decided whenever the issue is raised. The parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court, either by waiver or by consent. <em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 308, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993); <em>In re Judicial Inquiry No. 85-01, </em>221 Conn. 625, 629, 605 A.2d 545 (1992); <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 429-30, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 143, 145.\u201d <em>Sadloski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>228 Conn. 79, 84, 634 A.2d 888 (1993), on appeal after remand, 235 Conn. 637, 668 A.2d 1314 (1995). \u201cOrdinarily, a challenge to the court\u2019s jurisdiction is raised by the filing of a motion to dismiss. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ever, \u2018[w]henever a lack of jurisdiction to entertain a particular proceeding comes to a court\u2019s notice, the court can dismiss the proceeding upon its own motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Park City Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 702. Section 8-8 (j) does not present an exception to this rule. In the present case, therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly considered the issue of the plaintiffs\u2019 aggrievement prior to reaching the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the trial court, by dismissing their appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, improperly ignored binding Connecticut Supreme Court precedent wherein we have consistently concluded, pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (a), that taxpayers in zoning appeals involving liquor outlets are presumed to be aggrieved and, therefore, have automatic standing to appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Macaluso </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>167 Conn. 596, 600-601, 356 A.2d 885 (1975); <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>156 Conn. 426, 428, 242 A.2d 713 (1968); <em>M. &amp; R. Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 280, 281-82, 231 A.2d 272 (1967); <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 116, 117, 214 A.2d 361 (1965); <em>Whitney Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 285, 287, 189 A.2d 396 (1963); <em>London </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>149 Conn. 282, 284, 179 A.2d 614 (1962); <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>145 Conn. 655, 661, 145 A.2d 832 (1958); <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 160, 163-64, 128 A.2d 325 (1956); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 65, 71-72, 98 A.2d 515 (1953); <em>Farrv. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>139 Conn. 577, 583, 95 A.2d 792 (1953).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The issues raised by the plaintiffs have two parts: (1) whether the trial court improperly ignored binding precedent in concluding that the plaintiffs could not establish aggrievement solely by showing that they were taxpayers appealing a zoning decision involving a liquor outlet; and (2) whether we should overrule our prior interpretation and subsequent application of \u00a7 8-8 (a), wherein we have held that taxpayers are, a priori, aggrieved persons under \u00a7 8-8 if the zoning decision involves premises used or to be used for the sale of liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">It is axiomatic that a trial court is bound by Supreme Court precedent. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Plainville, </em>40 Conn. App. 179, 182, 669 A.2d 1242 (1996) (Appellate Court, as intermediate court, is prevented from reexamining or reevaluating Supreme Court precedent); <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, 25 </em>Conn. App. 543, 553, 596 A.2d 463 (1991), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 222 Conn. 541, 610 A.2d 1260 (1992) (same); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Education Assn., </em>9 Conn. App. 199, 203-204, 518 A.2d 394 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 802, 519 A.2d 1206 (1987) (same); see also <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, 4 </em>Conn. App. 19, 20, 492 A.2d 207 (1985), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 201 Conn. 632, 519 A.2d 13 (1986) (same). This principle is inherent in a hierarchical judicial system. In the present case, it is undisputed that the trial court determined that under existing case law the plaintiffs had standing to appeal because they were taxpayers appealing from a zoning decision involving premises concerned with the sale of liquor and, therefore, were considered to be automatically aggrieved. The trial court refused to follow the precedent compelling this conclusion, however, because the court disagreed with our existing interpretation of the phrase \u201caggrieved person\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 8-8 (a). See footnote 1. Although the concerns raised by the trial court might ultimately have merit and support its contention that the time has come to reconsider the propriety of the automatic aggrievement rule, revision of Supreme Court precedent is not the trial court\u2019s function.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, improperly ignored this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>court\u2019s precedent in concluding that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The board and Cyrco contend, however, that even if we were to conclude that the trial court improperly ignored our precedent concerning automatic aggrievement, we should, nevertheless, reconsider the viability of that precedent and overrule it on our own. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u201c \u2018Stare decisis gives stability and continuity to our case law. This court, however, has recognized many times that there are exceptions to the rule of stare decisis. Principles of law which serve one generation well may, by reason of changing conditions, disserve a later one. . . . Experience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better. . . . The adaptability of the common law to the changing needs of passing time has been one of its most beneficent characteristics. A court, when once convinced that it is in error, is not compelled to follow precedent. ... If, however, stare decisis is to continue to serve the cause of stability and certainty in the law \u2014 a condition indispensable to any well-ordered system of jurisprudence \u2014 a court should not overrule its earlier decisions unless the most cogent reasons and inescapable logic require it. . . . <em>This is especially trae when the precedent involved concerns the interpretation or construction of a statute.\u2019 . . . Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955); see <em>Kluttz </em>v. <em>Howard, 228 </em>Conn. 401, 406, 636 A.2d 816 (1994); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 335-36, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>General Electric Employees Federal Credit Union </em>v. <em>Zakrzewski, </em>235 Conn. 741, 744, 670 A.2d 274 (1996). We are not persuaded that the board and Cyrco have presented cogent reasons and inescapable logic for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>overruling our precedent interpreting \u00a7 8-8 (a) to establish a rule of automatic standing to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 71-72, we interpreted the aggrievement requirement for zoning appeals relying on the court\u2019s reasoning in an earlier decision, <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>64 Conn. 526, 534, 30 A. 775 (1894).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Alth ough <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>involved our interpretation of the term \u201caggrievement\u201d as used in a statute dealing with the granting of liquor licenses, in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>we concluded that the reasoning in <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal </em>applied \u201cwith like force and reason to the same word as used in [the zoning appeals statute].\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 72. \u201cIn <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>[supra, 534] Justice Simeon E. Baldwin [stated]: \u2018[EJvery owner of property, assessed in the grand list of the town in which he resides, has a substantial interest in the prosperity and good order of that town. The expense of the local police of any town, as well as of criminal proceedings before its local tribunals, is largely dependent on the number of the liquor saloons and bar rooms within its limits, and the character of those who keep them. If licenses are granted with too free a hand, or without proper discrimination, the burdens of taxation are likely to be increased. Every taxpayer therefore has a certain, though it may be small, pecuniary interest in having the license law well administered; and if he is also a resident in the town where he pays his taxes, he has an additional interest, common to every citizen, in promoting the general welfare of the community. In view of these considerations, we think that any resident taxpayer of a town who feels aggrieved at the granting of a license for the sale of liquors therein, has the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of appeal under the [Public Acts] of 1893, and that he is not bound to show any grievance or interest in the matter peculiar to himself, either in his own motion for an appeal before the county commissioners, or by reasons of appeal in the Superior Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Later, in <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 661, another case in which we considered aggrievement in the context of a zoning appeal,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we observed: \u201cThe essence of the holdings in <em>Beard\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, [64 Conn. 534] and the cases which have followed it, is that to be an aggrieved person within the meaning of the statute one must show a pecuniary interest injuriously affected by the action of the zoning board of appeals and that such a showing may be sufficiently made, in a case where liquor traffic is involved, by proof that one is a taxpayer in the town, in view of the pecuniary effect upon every taxpayer resulting from the incidents of such traffic. Such a distinction recognizes, again, that in liquor traffic there is a possible source of danger to the public which is not inherent in other businesses and that therefore such traffic warrants distinctive and particular treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">More recently, we again addressed the policy reasons behind the automatic aggrievement rule. In <em>Macaluso, </em>the defendant had \u201cattacked as anachronistic the policy considerations underlying our longstanding principle that in cases in which traffic in liquor is involved and a statute similar to \u00a7 8-8 conferring a right of appeal upon persons aggrieved by decisions of a zoning board of appeals is applicable, a resident taxpayer of a town is a priori an aggrieved person with standing to prosecute the appeal, and need not show that he has an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>interest peculiar to himself. . . . These cases have recognized that the sale and use of liquor may involve such a risk that a resident taxpayer of a town has a sufficient pecuniary interest as well as a sufficient interest in the general well-being of his community to allow him to appeal such decisions. . . . The defendant has not persuaded us to reconsider the merits of the principle of appellate procedure embodied in these decisions.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Macaluso </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 600-601.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The problems associated with the sale and use of alcohol in our society today are common knowledge. On appeal, neither the board nor Cyrco has presented any evidence to suggest that these problems have abated. We remain convinced that the sale and use of alcohol, and its concomitant abuse and significant role in criminal activity, result in an increased risk to the general well-being of the community as well as an increased risk of pecuniary loss to the taxpayer largely resulting from the increased need for policing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The board and Cyrco argue that the rationale for the automatic standing rule is not applicable in the present case because the challenged zoning decision does not increase the number of liquor outlets in Bridgeport; rather, a single existing liquor outlet is being moved from one location to another and, therefore, there will not be an increased need for policing due to the board\u2019s decision. In fact, Cyrco argues that there will be a reduction in the need for local police because its liquor store is being moved further away from the plaintiffs\u2019 store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and is being moved from an isolated area to a \u201cfar safer main thoroughfare.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>we construed a zoning regulation similar to the 1500 foot regulation at issue in the present case as a declaration of policy by the town that the <em>location </em>of existing liquor stores has an effect on the general welfare of the community. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 70. \u201c[T]he town council took cognizance of the potential danger from this traffic and that the [1500 foot] restriction was enacted as one means of attempting to keep it within bounds. Although under the present Liquor Control Act the so-called \u2018old fashioned saloon\u2019 of earlier days has been supplanted by the variously designated places of the licensed dispensing permittees for which it provides, the potential menace of the traffic persists. It is a matter of common knowledge that a large percentage of today\u2019s serious crimes stems from the excessive use of alcohol and that the hazard to life and limb from intoxication has been tremendously increased by the advent of present-day automobile traffic. These are material considerations in determining the meaning of the word \u2018aggrieved\u2019 as used in [the zoning appeal statute] . . . .\u201d Id., 70-71. We agree with the reasoning in <em>O\u2019Connor </em>that Bridgeport has expressed a policy in its 1500 foot rule, namely, that the specific location of liquor stores within city bounds substantially affects the public welfare, regardless of any increase or decrease in the number of liquor stores in the aggregate. We conclude, therefore, that the rationale behind the automatic aggrievement rule is applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In determining whether to overrule precedent, particularly precedent that is a product of statutoiy interpretation, such as the automatic aggrievement rule, subsequent legislative action or inaction is a key consideration. \u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to be aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the inteipretation of a statute and ... its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that inteipretation. . . . This presumption is strengthened when the legislature has affirmatively reenacted the statute after the interpretation in question.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 627, 594 A.2d 464 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">This consideration is compelling in the present case. Since 1953, this court has consistently held that a resident taxpayer appealing a zoning decision involving the sale of liquor is, a priori, an aggrieved person under \u00a7 8-8 (a). See <em>Macaluso </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 167 Conn. 600-601; <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 156 Conn. 428; <em>M. &amp; R. Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 155 Conn. 281-82; <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 153 Conn. 117; <em>Whitney Theatre Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 150 Conn. 287; <em>London </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 149 Conn. 284; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 145 Conn. 661; <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 144 Conn. 163-64; <em>O\u2019Connor v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 140 Conn. 71-72; <em>Farr </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 139 Conn. 583. Since that time the legislature has revisited \u00a7 8-8 on numerous occasions and has never indicated that our interpretation was not what it had intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In 1977, the legislature amended the definition of \u201caggrieved person\u201d to include a presumption of aggrievement for a person whose land abuts or is within a 100 foot radius of the land involved in the decision. See Public Acts 1977, No. 77-470; Public Acts 1967, Nos. 348, 712. It has since rejected proposals to remove these automatic aggrievement provisions. See 32 H.R.

Cyrco argues that the automatic aggrievement rule unreasonably discriminates against it as a beneficiary of a zoning variance involving the sale of liquor and deprives it of equal protection of the law. This claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[W]e are guided by the familiar principles that a statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did . . . that a legislature need not strike at all evils at the same time . . . and that reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind ....

However, the plaintiffs did have standing as resident taxpayers to challenge the variance for a package store under prior case law. A higher court may have a different view on whether the rule on standing in liquor cases should be changed, and in the interest of judicial economy a ruling on the merits is appropriate here if the plaintiffs successfully appeal on the aggrievement issue.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court considered the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and found that Cyrco had failed to prove hardship and, therefore, that the board had improperly granted its variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Cyrco contends that the trial court improperly considered the merits of the appeal after having concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Although the plaintiffs agree that this is ordinarily true, they argue that because of the highly unusual situation involved, wherein the trial court refused to follow existing Supreme Court precedent and conceded the possibility that a higher court might not agree with its decision, the trial court\u2019s consideration of the merits of the case was appropriate.

In support of this claim, Cyrco argues that an obligation to pay taxes does not necessarily establish that the plaintiffs had actually paid their taxes. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">To establish aggrievement, first, \u201cthe plaintiff [must allege] facts which, if proven, would constitute aggrievement as a matter of law, and, second . . .

In their appeal to the trial court,, the plaintiffs alleged facts that, if true, would adequately support their claim of automatic aggrievement. Specifically, they alleged that Richard and Car-man Tuliano owned and operated the business and property located at 874 Boston Avenue in Bridgeport, that Cyrco had requested a waiver of the regulation prohibiting the establishment of a liquor outlet within 1500 feet of another liquor outlet, and that the plaintiffs, as the owners, operators and permittees of a liquor outlet within 1500 feet of the property that is the subject of the application, are aggrieved by such a decision. During the court proceedings, the plaintiffs testified and presented evidence to support their allegation that they owned and operated property and a business located in Bridgeport. No other evidence was presented on the issue of the plaintiffs' taxpayer status. Thereafter, in its memorandum of decision, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs did have standing as resident taxpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ers to challenge the variance for a package store under prior case law.\u201d Although Richard and Carman Tuliano are not residents of Bridgeport, we have previously held that nonresident taxpayer status is sufficient to establish automatic aggrievement in this context. See footnote 14. Thus, the court implicitly took judicial notice of the fact that proof of ownership of property within a city is sufficient to establish a presumption that one is a taxpayer in that city. Cyrco presented no evidence to contradict this finding. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination is adequately supported by the evidence and, therefore, we reject Cyrco\u2019s alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\"> Originally, we relied upon a plaintiffs status as a taxpayer and as a resident of the municipality in support of the automatic aggrievement rule.

The majority asserts two reasons for reaffirming this court\u2019s interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 that taxpayers are automatically aggrieved with respect to zoning decisions involving liquor outlets, thereby providing them with standing to appeal: (1) stare decisis; and (2) legislative silence. Under the circumstances of this case, neither of these reasons justifies reaffirmation of this anachronistic policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The plaintiffs Richard and Carman Tuliano (Tulianos), business competitors of the defendant Cyrco, Inc. (Cyrco), claim to be aggrieved and seek the benefit of the automatic aggrievement rule. The Tulianos are the owners and operators of the plaintiff Jolly, Inc., a corporation doing business as Jolly Time Package, a liquor store located appropriately 500 feet from the location of Cyrco\u2019s liquor store. In November, 1993, Cyrco sought to move its business to a new location that was exposed to greater traffic and that would be 1430 feet away from the Tulianos\u2019 store. For this reason, Cyrco filed two variance applications with the named defendant, the Bridgeport zoning board of appeals (board). The board granted both of Cyrco\u2019s variances, one of which allowed a variance from the regulatory requirement that there be 1500 feet between liquor outlets. Subsequently, the Tulianos filed an appeal to challenge the board\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">I agree that \u201c[s]tare decisis gives stability and continuity to our case law\u201d; <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 62, 111 A.2d 4 (1955); and we therefore should follow our own precedent. But when the reasoning of that precedent is patently flawed or it has no contemporary relevance it must be set aside. \u201c[PJrinciples of law which serve one generation well may, by reason of changing conditions, disserve a later one. . . .

In overruling prior case law because of a change in public policy considerations, we recently had occasion to quote Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201c \u2018It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\u2019 O.

In that case, aggrievement was based upon an interpretation of a statute which gave \u201cresident taxpayers\u201d the right to appeal the granting of a license to sell liquor. Id., 533. In justifying its interpretation to allow resident taxpayers the right to appeal, the court noted certain concerns associated with the operation of a liquor outlet. \u201cThe expense of the local police of any town, as well as of criminal proceedings before its local tribunals, is largely dependent on the number of the liquor saloons and bar rooms within its limits, and the character of those who keep them. If licenses are granted with too free a hand, or without proper discrimination, the burdens of taxation are likely to be increased. <em>Every taxpayer </em>therefore has a certain, though it may be a small, pecuniary interest in having the license law well administered; <em>and if he is also a resident </em>in the town where he pays his taxes, he has an additional interest, common to every citizen, in promoting the general welfare of the community.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 534. Based upon that reasoning, this court deemed all resident tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>payers to be automatically aggrieved with respect to zoning decisions that pertain to the sale of liquor. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 65, 71-72, 98 A.2d 515 (1953). Subsequently, this court expanded the rule to include nonresident taxpayers, such as the Tulianos here. <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>144 Conn. 160, 164, 128 A.2d 325 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">As indicated by the trial court in this case, every reason that has been advanced for granting taxpayers automatic standing to challenge decisions of zoning boards regarding the traffic of liquor has long ceased to exist. The liquor control commission has replaced the taxpayer in policing the character of those who dispense liquor and the manner in which a liquor outlet is operated, and other zoning regulations control the number of establishments. Indeed, as Judge Fuller wrote in his trial court memorandum of decision: \u201cThe interlocking scheme of controls by the municipal zoning ordinance and the department of liquor control mitigate possible harm to the public interest expressed in the cases upholding the liquor exception. Under the present scheme of liquor control there are many kinds of permits, and as a practical matter many of them create no danger to the public or result in turning intoxicated drivers or criminals loose in the municipality. . . . Maintaining an automatic appeal for any taxpayer in the municipality where a liquor permit is granted for any type of sale is unrealistic under the modem scheme of liquor regulation. Many if not most businesses conducted under one or more of the categories of liquor permits pose no greater danger to the public safety, morals or welfare than other businesses, including many types of retail stores, warehouses, garages, service stations and adult book stores.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Secondly, the majority asserts that the legislature has impliedly consented to this court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8-8 that grants automatic aggrievement to taxpayers who wish to challenge zoning decisions pertaining to a liquor outlet. In this case, for the reasons mentioned previously, the automatic aggrievement rule has ceased to have any contemporary purpose. Therefore, unlike <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 627, 594 A.2d 464 (1991), which is relied upon by the majority, or <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 35-36, 602 A.2d 560 (1992), both of which had contemporary purposes supporting the court\u2019s respective statutory interpretations, the legislature\u2019s silence in this matter should not be construed as an implicit approval of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">This distinction is clearly demonstrated in the recent case of <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 541, which was authored by Chief Justice Peters. In <em>Brunswick, </em>this court overruled the 1879 case of <em>Doolittle </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>47 Conn. 316 (1879), which interpreted the mesne process statute to prohibit an attorney, who is a commissioner of the Superior Court, from signing a writ in his own case. General Statutes (1875 Rev.) title 19, chapter 1, \u00a7 1, the statute at issue in <em>Doolittle, </em>now General Statutes \u00a7 52-45a, was amended at least six times after <em>Doolittle </em>was decided. At no time, however, did the legislature reverse the <em>Doolittle </em>holding by enacting an appropriate amendment to the statute. Nevertheless, the <em>Brunswick </em>court held that \u201c [ajbsent the public policy reasons that existed in 1879 . . . adherence to [that] rule ... no longer serves any purpose.\u201d <em>Brunswick </em>v. <em>Inland, Wetlands Commission, </em>supra, 554. Similarly, this court\u2019s statutory interpretation that taxpayers are automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>aggrieved when challenging a zoning decision relating to the sale of liquor should be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In addition to determining that the Tulianos were not automatically aggrieved, the trial court also determined that they were not classically aggrieved. To be classically aggrieved, an appellant must satisfy a two part test: (1) the appellant must have a specific, personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision; and (2) this interest must have been specially and injuriously affected by the board\u2019s decision. <em>Walls </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>176 Conn. 475, 477-78, 408 A.2d 252 (1979). The trial court found that \u201cthe [Tulianos] have not met their burden of proof that they are specially and injuriously affected by the shifting of [Cyrco\u2019s] package store .... There is no evidence of any adverse affect from an increase in traffic, change in traffic patterns or any physical impact upon the [Tulianos\u2019] property by the opening of a package store in an existing building 1430 feet away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Rather, the trial court determined that \u201c[t]he impact claimed by the [Tulianos] amounts to a speculative fear of loss of economic advantage, or more specifically, [a] concern that the proposed package [store] . . . will cut into the [Tulianos\u2019] liquor business. However, a business competitor of a successful applicant for a variance, zoning permit or special exception is not classically aggrieved without a showing of injury to his property rights, and merely being a business competitor is insufficient.\u201d The Tulianos do not challenge the trial court\u2019s classical aggrievement analysis and I do not find it to be erroneous. Therefore, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the Tulianos have proven neither statutory aggrievement nor classical aggrievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">In my view, the automatic aggrievement rule should be abandoned and the trial court\u2019s decision affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>on the ground that the Tulianos were not classically aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-6\"> The majority unfairly states that \u201cneither the board nor Cyrco has presented any evidence to suggest that these problems have abated.\u201d As Cyrco clearly states in its brief, \u201c[sjince the trial court thoroughly researched and examined the issues [regarding the obsolescence of the automatic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>aggrievement rule], it would serve no purpose to simply reiterate the court\u2019s reasoning . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
