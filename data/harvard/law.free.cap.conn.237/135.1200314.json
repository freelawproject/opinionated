J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8g\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the department of environmental protection (department) appropriately directed a town to construct a regional wastewater treatment facility in order to abate long-standing local pollution of the Connecticut River. The plaintiff, Timothy R. E. Keeney, commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), brought suit in eight counts for declaratory and injunctive relief and for civil penalties against the defendant, the town of Old Saybrook, for allegedly violating four orders to abate pollution, and consequently violating General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-436, 22a-427, 22a-458 and 22a-14 et seq. The trial court rendered judgment for the commissioner on all counts and issued a permanent injunction that requires Old Saybrook to comply with all outstanding environmental orders. In addition, the trial court imposed a civil penalty of $98,060 because of Old Saybrook\u2019s past failure to comply with the four orders. Old Saybrook appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court in part and remand for further articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The trial court found the following facts documenting a long-standing history of water pollution in Old Say-brook. In 1981, Malcolm Pimie Engineers issued a report (Pimie report) disclosing that a large number of individual residential septic systems in Old Saybrook were discharging improperly renovated wastewater or were completely failing, resulting in pollution of the groundwater and the Connecticut River. Similar problems in the towns of Westbrook and Clinton were documented by Malcolm Pimie Engineers in separate studies. Many of these septic systems could not be repaired either because the groundwater table was too high or because the residential lots on which they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>located were too small. Old Saybrook never questioned the validity of the findings of the Pimie report.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In accordance with the recommendations of the Pirnie report, the department, with the assistance of Old Saybrook and other coastal towns, developed a \u201csewer avoidance program\u201d to respond to the problems of the failing septic systems. The commissioner issued three orders against Old Saybrook for implementation of the sewer avoidance program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Orders 3109 and 3110 require Old Saybrook to implement a program to monitor and inspect the septic systems, to verify compliance with the sewer avoidance program to the commissioner on a stated schedule and to send annual reports to the commissioner. Order 3111 requires Old Saybrook to implement a program to maintain the septic systems and to verify compliance with the program to the commissioner on a stated schedule. Old Saybrook impliedly agreed to the terms of these orders by not taking a timely appeal to challenge any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In 1985, the commissioner issued order 4116,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which required Old Saybrook and the town of Westbrook to conduct a regional study, for the commissioner\u2019s approval, that would recommend solutions to the regional wastewater management problems that failing septic systems were causing in these towns. After the commissioner removed a requirement that Old Say-brook implement any recommendations to be made in the study from order 4116, Old Saybrook took no appeal from its remaining terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">In accordance with order 4116, Old Saybrook hired engineering consultant Hayden-Wegman to conduct the required study, which, pursuant to a request from the town of Clinton, included that town as well. In March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>1989, Hayden-Wegman issued a final report, entitled the \u201cHayden-Wegman Old Saybrook-Westbrook Joint Wastewater Management Study Final Draft, revised March 1989\u201d (Hayden-Wegman report). The HaydenWegman report confirmed the problem of failing septic systems, and recommended the construction of a regional wastewater treatment facility that would discharge wastewater into the Connecticut River. Old Say-brook never questioned the validity of the findings of the Hayden-Wegman report.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On October 20,1989, after a series of communications and meetings between officials of the department, Old Saybrook officials and others, the commissioner signed modified order 4116. The modified order required Old Saybrook to implement the recommendations contained in the Hayden-Wegman report by having built a regional wastewater treatment facility that would service the towns of Old Saybrook, Westbrook and Clinton. Although Old Saybrook would be responsible for coordinating the design, construction and funding of the facility, all three towns would share in its costs. On October 24, 1989, modified order 4116 was hand-delivered to Barbara Maynard, the first selectman of Old Saybrook. Additional facts will be set forth as they become relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The commissioner brought suit in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief and civil penalties against Old Saybrook. In counts one, two, three and eight of the substitute amended complaint, the commissioner alleged that Old Saybrook had violated General Statutes \u00a7 22a-428<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by failing to comply with orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>3109, 3110, 3111 and modified order 4116. In addition, in count eight, the complaint alleged that the legislative body of Old Saybrook had violated General Statutes \u00a7 22a-458,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by failing to authorize the necessary funds to comply with modified order 4116. In counts four and six, the complaint alleged that Old Saybrook had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>violated General Statutes \u00a7 22a-427,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by causing pollution of the waters of the state as a result of its failure to implement orders 3109, 3110, 3111 and modified order 4116. In counts five and seven, the complaint alleged that Old Saybrook had violated the Environmental Protection Act, General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by causing \u201cunreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction of the water and other natural resources of the state\u201d through its failure to implement orders 3109, 3110, 3111 and modified order 4116.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The trial court, <em>J. Walsh, J., </em>first denied a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to decide each claim under \u00a7\u00a7 22a-14 et seq., 22a-435 and 22a-438. After trial, the trial court, <em>Hon. Frances Allen, </em>state trial referee, concluded that Old Saybrook was bound by the terms of modified order 4116 either because Old Saybrook had agreed to the modified order or because it had failed to take a timely appeal therefrom. The trial court further determined that Old Saybrook had violated each of the four orders and, as alleged, had caused pollution in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 22a-14 et seq., 22a-427, 22a-435 and 22a-438. Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the commissioner on all counts, imposing substantial civil penalties on Old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Saybrook and enjoining Old Saybrook to comply with the orders to abate pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On appeal, Old Saybrook claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that Old Saybrook had validly agreed to modified order 4116 or, in the alternative, that the order constituted a valid new order; (2) concluded that \u00a7 22a-427 creates a cause of action independent of the cause of action for violations of orders created by \u00a7\u00a7 22a-435 and 22a-438; (3) determined that Old Saybrook has violated either \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 or 22a-14 et seq. by causing pollution in any respect; and (4) imposed civil penalties on Old Saybrook.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with Old Saybrook that modified order 4116 is not binding on it. We conclude, however, that the trial court properly determined that Old Saybrook has violated orders 3109, 3110 and 3111, and that the civil penalties imposed by the trial court with respect to these orders are within its discretion. We also conclude that the record is not sufficiently specific about the basis upon which the trial court held that Old Saybrook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>has violated applicable environmental statutes by \u201ccausing pollution,\u201d and therefore direct the trial court to provide an articulation of its holding in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Old Saybrook\u2019s principal claims challenge the validity of modified order 4116, which purports to obligate Old Saybrook to construct a regional wastewater treatment facility. There are two issues with respect to modified order 4116: (1) did proper officials of Old Saybrook validly manifest its agreement with modified order 4116; and (2) is modified order 4116 enforceable against Old Saybrook without regard to whether Old Saybrook agreed, on the ground that it was a new order from which Old Saybrook did not take a timely appeal. We agree with Old Saybrook on both of these issues, and therefore hold that the commissioner cannot rely on modified order 4116 as a basis for requiring the construction of the treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">We are guided in our analysis by the standard of appellate review that governs questions of law. \u201cWe have long held that where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 132, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Old Saybrook\u2019s challenge to the validity of its purported agreement to modified order 4116 rests on its contention that any such agreement required compliance with the provisions of the General Statutes and the Old Saybrook town charter. Before we can address the merits of this argument, we must decide what rules govern a purported modification of an order issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>pursuant to the Water Pollution Control Act. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-416 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Water Pollution Control Act sets forth a comprehensive statutory scheme for the protection of the waters of the state. After an administrative finding that a municipality \u201cis causing\u201d pollution, \u00a7 22a-428 authorizes the commissioner to order a municipality to abate such pollution. See footnote 3. After the issuance of a pollution abatement order<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a municipality may request a hearing and, if further relief is sought, may appeal the order to the trial court. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-436 and 22a-437.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If no hearing is requested within thirty days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the pollution abatement order becomes final and thereafter no further hearing may be requested and no appeal may be taken. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-436 and 22a-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Section 22a-436 provides that the commissioner may modify a pollution abatement order \u201cby agreement\u201d with the municipality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The modified order created by agreement \u201cshall not constitute a new order [and t]here shall be no hearing subsequent to or any appeal from such modification . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-436. The statute does not stipulate the manner in which a municipality must manifest its agreement to a modified order.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In the absence of an expressly applicable statutoiy mandate in \u00a7 22a-436, we conclude that the validity of a municipality\u2019s agreement to a modified pollution abatement order depends on compliance with the procedures specified in applicable provisions of the General Statutes and of the municipality\u2019s charter. A municipality is a creature of the state. \u201cIt is well established that a city\u2019s charter is the fountainhead of municipal powers. <em>State ex rel. Raslavsky </em>v. <em>Bonvouloir, </em>167 Conn. 357, 362, 355 A.2d 275 (1974). The charter selves as an enabling act, both creating power and prescribing the form in which it must be exercised. <em>Food, Beverage &amp; Express Drivers Local Union </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>147 Conn. 401, 405, 161 A.2d 587 (1960); <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>100 Conn. 604, 606, 124 A. 247 (1924); <em>State ex rel. Southey </em>v. <em>Lashar, </em>71 Conn. 540, 545-46, 42 A. 636 (1899).\u201d <em>Perretta </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>185 Conn. 88, 92, 440 A.2d 823 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">To determine the validity of Old Saybrook\u2019s purported agreement to the modified pollution abatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>order in this case, we must therefore examine not only the conduct of individual Old Saybrook officials, but also the relevant provisions of the General Statutes and the Old Saybrook town charter provisions that constrain their authority to act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court found that several of Old Saybrook\u2019s officials, including its board of selectmen, its first selectman, and its town attorney, were fully cognizant of the terms of the modified order, had discussed its merits and had voiced no objection thereto. The question before us is whether these officials and the board of selectmen had the power and properly exercised the power to agree to a modified order that would commit Old Saybrook to spend approximately $16 million toward the construction of a regional wastewater treatment facility and, thereby, waived Old Saybrook\u2019s right to contest the validity of the construction order in court. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-436.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Old Saybrook contends that it did not agree to the order modification because no official, board or commission ever validly agreed to the order. Furthermore, Old Saybrook contends that if any official or body did indicate agreement, that official or body lacked the authority to do so. The commissioner disagrees, arguing that the board of selectmen, the first selectman and the town counsel indicated Old Saybrook\u2019s agreement to the modification by their conduct and statements, and that the first selectman, in particular, had the authority so to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We conclude that, although the board of selectmen had authority under the relevant statutes and the town charter to agree to an order modification with such consequences, it failed to exercise that power properly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Furthermore, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the relevant provisions of the General Statutes and the town charter conferred this authority on the first selectman and the town counsel. As a result, we conclude that Old Saybrook never validly agreed to the order modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The General Statutes grant Old Saybrook the power to agree to any environmental order and thereby to bind itself to the construction of a wastewater treatment facility. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (1) (A) (granting all towns power to \u201c[c]ontract and be contracted with, [to] sue and be sued\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (A) (ii) (granting all towns power to \u201c[c]reate, provide for, construct, regulate and maintain all things in the nature of public works and improvements\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (6) (B) (i) (granting all towns power to \u201c[l]ay out, construct, reconstruct, repair, maintain, operate, alter, extend and discontinue . . . sewage disposal plants\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 7-194 (granting all towns that have charters power to \u201cprovide for the execution of contracts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The authority of towns to enter into binding agreements of this kind is an authority that is vested, both under the General Statutes and under the charter of Old Saybrook, in the board of selectmen and not in the first selectman or the town counsel. General Statutes \u00a7 7-12 specifically authorizes the board of selectmen to \u201csuperintend the concerns of the town, adjust and settle all claims against it and draw orders on the treasurer for their payment.\u201d The charter of Old Say-brook vests in the board of selectmen all powers and duties granted to boards of selectmen by the constitution and the General Statutes. Old Saybrook Charter, c. 3, \u00a7 4. Boards of selectmen, therefore, have the power to prosecute and defend suits to which the town is a party; <em>Union </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>19 Conn. 331, 337 (1848); to submit claims to arbitration; <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Huntington, </em>64 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Conn. 88, 96, 29 A. 245 (1894); and to settle claims. General Statutes \u00a7 7-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The authority vested in boards of selectmen to settle claims includes the authority to agree to an order modification pursuant to \u00a7 22a-436. By relinquishing its right to appeal the modified order, the town gains an opportunity to bargain with the commissioner for more favorable terms in the modified order. Such bargaining is analogous to settling a lawsuit. Moreover, the settlement of such a claim falls within the authority of the board of selectmen even though its implementation requires substantial town expenditures. Although General Statutes \u00a7 7-348<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> limits the board of selectmen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>authority to contract in excess of appropriations, this provision expressly is not \u201ca limitation upon the settlement of claims or judgments against the town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">In order to exercise properly its authority to settle claims, however, the board of selectmen was required to take such action at a regular or special meeting.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Whenever the General Statutes or the municipal charter prescribes a particular procedure by which a specific act is to be done or a power is to be exercised, the prescribed procedure must be followed for the act to be lawful. <em>Caldrello </em>v. <em>Planning Board, </em>193 Conn. 387, 391, 476 A.2d 1063 (1984); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Eighth Utilities District, </em>179 Conn. 589, 594, 427 A.2d 425 (1980); <em>Food, Beverage &amp; Express Drivers Local Union </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>supra, 147 Conn. 405; <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>104 Conn. 238, 253, 132 A. 690 (1926). Because those \u201cwho contract with a municipal corporation are charged with notice of the extent of . . . the powers of municipal officers and agents with whom they contract ... it follows that if the . . . agent had in fact no power to bind the municipality, there is no liability on the express contract . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>206 Conn. 449, 452, 538 A.2d 694 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u201cIt is a well-settled rule that when municipal councils or boards of any kind are called upon to perform legislative acts or acts involving discretion and judgment in administering the public affairs, <em>they can only act at authorized, meetings </em>duly held. The council or board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>must meet and act as a board or council. The members cannot make a valid determination binding upon the [municipality] by their assent separately and individually expressed.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jack </em>v. <em>Torrant, </em>136 Conn. 414, 420, 71 A.2d 705 (1950); <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 290, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); <em>Ziomek </em>v. <em>Bartimole, </em>156 Conn. 604, 612, 244 A.2d 380 (1968); see also 10 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. Rev. 1990) \u00a7 29.15. This well settled rule is supported by the charter of Old Saybrook, which, although allowing the board of selectmen to determine its own rules of procedure, requires meetings to be open to the public, votes to be recorded, a quorum to be present and no \u201cordinance, resolution, or vote . . . [to] be adopted by less than two (2) affirmative votes.\u201d Old Saybrook Charter, c. 3, \u00a7 3. Indeed, the obligation to build a wastewater treatment facility \u201caffects too many rights . . . and imposes upon the town too heavy a responsibility for maintenance and too great a liability\u201d for failure to construct the facility \u201cto permit it to be done by the board without formal action, duly recorded.\u201d <em>Stratford </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>106 Conn. 34, 37, 137 A. 13 (1927) (involving construction of highway).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The trial court made no finding that the board of selectmen had approved the modification of order 4116 at a regular or special meeting, and our review of the record leads us to conclude that the board of selectmen did not so act. Although the board of selectmen formally adopted four resolutions relating to the proposed regional wastewater treatment facility, none of these resolutions constituted agreement by the board of selectmen to the modified order.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On June 1, 1989, the board of selectmen, acting in its capacity as the water pollution control authority, approved the acceptance of the Hayden-Wegman report that recommended the construction of the facility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Whatever the reasons for this action may have been, we are persuaded that approving an engineering report does not constitute agreement to be bound by an order requiring costly implementation of the recommendations of that report.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On October 16, 1989, the board of selectmen, acting as the water pollution control authority, formally authorized the signing of an intermunicipal agreement with the towns of Clinton and Westbrook for the joint construction of the regional wastewater treatment facility. Although the signing of the intermunicipal agreement was a preliminary step necessary to appropriately obtaining financing from the state, allocating the cost among the towns and administering the construction of the facility, we are persuaded that agreement to the intermunicipal agreement does not constitute agreement to be bound by the modified order.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Finally, on October 19, 1989, the board of selectmen formally adopted two resolutions that authorized placement on a referendum by the town meeting of questions relating to the following issues: the appropriation of funds for designing the wastewater treatment facility and for acquiring the necessary land, and the execution of the intermunicipal agreement. These resolutions do not constitute agreement to the order modification because they do not manifest assent to be bound by the modified order in the absence of approval of the questions by referendum. Indeed, the questions were defeated at a referendum held on November 21, 1989. We conclude that none of these resolutions constitutes agreement to the modified order.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The trial court found that Old Saybrook\u2019s agreement to the modified order had been manifested not only by its board of selectmen but also by the first selectman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>and the town counsel, singly and jointly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The difficulty with premising town agreement on the actions of these town officials is that they lacked the authority to agree to this order modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The first selectman had no authority, either under the General Statutes or under the charter of Old Say-brook, to agree to modified order 4116. Both General Statutes \u00a7 7-12a and chapter 4, \u00a7 1, of the town charter designate the first selectman as the town\u2019s chief administrative officer. As chief administrative officer, the first selectman has the responsibility to preside over meetings of the board of selectmen and to act as the ceremonial head of the town; Old Saybrook Charter, c. 3, \u00a7 2; but has no express authority to settle claims or to contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the General Statutes and the charter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Old Saybrook expressly confer such authority on the board of selectmen, we conclude that the first selectman has no such implied authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Furthermore, we conclude that the board of selectmen did not delegate to the first selectman the authority to agree to the order modification. Having the authority to agree to the order modification, the board of selectmen theoretically could have delegated that authority to any selectman; see 3 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 12.43 and vol. 10, \u00a7 29.15;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but it did not do so. On June 15, 1989, acting as the water pollution control authority, the board of selectmen expressly resolved that the first selectman had authority to apply for a grant and a loan from the state for the construction of the regional waste-water treatment facility.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>valid order is a prerequisite to an. application for state funding, we conclude that delegation of the authority to apply for funding, as a matter of law, does not manifest delegation of the authority to agree to construct the wastewater treatment facility in accordance with the requirements of modified order 4116. No other alleged action by the board of selectmen supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the first selectman had been delegated the authority to act on behalf of the board of selectmen in this respect. Neither directly nor indirectly, therefore, did the first selectman have the authority to agree to modified order 4116.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The town counsel similarly had no authority to settle town claims. Unless granted additional powers by statute or charter, the town counsel may only \u201cbind the municipality to the same extent that any attorney may bind his or her client.\u201d 10 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 29.15. Because a town counsel generally \u201chas no authority to compromise claims ... an unauthorized compromise is not binding on the municipality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 452; see also 3 E. McQuillin, supra, \u00a7 12.52.05. In the absence of a provision in the General Statutes or the charter of Old Saybrook<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> conferring on the town counsel the power to contract or to settle claims, the town counsel lacked the authority to agree to modified order 4116.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>For all the reasons stated above, we conclude that Old Saybrook never validly agreed to modified order 4116. To the extent that the trial court\u2019s injunctive orders and civil penalties depend upon its conclusion to the contrary, those injunctive orders and civil penalties are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Even without Old Saybrook\u2019s agreement to modified order 4116, that order may be binding on the town on other grounds. The trial court determined that modified order 4116 was enforceable as a new order that was binding on Old Saybrook because Old Saybrook had not taken a timely appeal to challenge its validity. Old Saybrook claims, to the contrary, that modified order 4116 did not constitute a valid new order because Old Saybrook never received notice that the order, which was labeled \u201cOrder Modification,\u201d was an appealable new order. We agree with Old Saybrook.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. At the request of the first selectman of Old Saybrook, an official of the department hand-delivered modified order 4116 to her. Modified order 4116 was labeled an \u201cOrder Modification,\u201d unlike the original order 4116 that was labeled \u201cOrder.\u201d Furthermore, the modified order stated in text that it had been \u201c[e]ntered as a modification of\u201d the original order 4116. The town did not appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Because a town may appeal from a new order, but may not appeal from a modified one; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-436; whether modified order 4116 is properly characterized as a valid new order depends upon whether it appropriately informed Old Saybrook that the town could appeal. \u201cThe right of appeal, if it is to have any value, must necessarily contemplate that the person who is to exercise the right be given the opportunity of knowing that there is a decision to appeal from and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>of forming an opinion as to whether that decision presents an appealable issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bridgeport Bowl-O-Rama, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>195 Conn. 276, 281, 487 A.2d 559 (1985); <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>151 Conn. 269, 271-72, 196 A.2d 760 (1963). Any uncured defect in the notice may not be misleading. See <em>Cocivi </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>20 Conn. App. 705, 708, 570 A.2d 226, cert. denied, 214 Conn. 808, 573 A.2d 319 (1990) (defective notice not cured by later publication because statute required notice to be published twice); see also <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>190 Conn. 746, 748, 462 A.2d 1042 (1983) (defective notice cured); <em>Selk </em>v. <em>District of Columbia Dept. of Employment Services, </em>497 A.2d 1056, 1058 (D.C. App. 1985) (ambiguous notice of final determination held to be inadequate as matter of law because notice failed to specify whether appeal had to be filed within ten business days or within ten calendar days); <em>Matter of Edmead </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>67 N.Y.2d 714, 716, 490 N.E.2d 853, 499 N.Y.S.2d 934 (1986) (time for appeal does not ran if agency through ambiguity creates impression that determination was not conclusive).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In the present case, the commissioner specifically labeled modified order 4116 as an order modification. Under the circumstances of this case, the use of that label, at a minimum, created an ambiguity about whether the order was an appealable new order or an unappealable modified order. Due to the ambiguity, the document failed to give Old Saybrook notice that an appealable order had been issued. We hold that if an agency has created ambiguity as to the nature of an order that leads a party reasonably to believe that he or she cannot appeal that order, that ambiguity must be resolved against the agency. The \u201corder modification,\u201d therefore, must be construed only as an attempt to modify the original order 4116. Because we have already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>held that Old Saybrook never validly agreed to the order modification, modified order 4116 is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Old Saybrook also claims that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 22a-427<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> creates a cause of action on the part of the commissioner independent of the cause of action for violations of orders created by \u00a7\u00a7 22a-435 and 22a-438.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The commissioner disagrees, claiming that he has the authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6 (a) (3)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> to sue for an injunction to enforce \u00a7 22a-427. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">In interpreting statutes, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>235 Conn. 650, 656, 668 A.2d 1309 (1995). \u201cEnvironmental statutes, considered remedial in nature, are to be construed liberally to reach the desired result. <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 57, 441 A.2d 68 (1981).\u201d <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>226 Conn. 358, 382, 627 A.2d 1296 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>We look first to the text of the relevant statutes. Section 22a-427 provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person or municipality shall cause pollution of any of the waters of the state . . . .\u201d This statute is silent as to whether the commissioner may sue directly under its provisions. Old Saybrook correctly asserts that \u00a7 22a-427 is part of a comprehensive statutory scheme, the Water Pollution Control Act, that allows the commissioner to issue an order to abate pollution; see General Statutes \u00a7 22a-428; and to sue for an injunction and for civil penalties for a violation of such an order. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-435 and 22a-438. Nowhere in this comprehensive statutory scheme, however, is the commissioner explicitly prevented from suing to enjoin violations of \u00a7 22a-427.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Water Pollution Control Act does not exist in a statutory vacuum. \u201cTitle 22a of the General Statutes is entitled \u2018Environmental Protection.\u2019 It contains various acts, all relating to the general purpose of the entire title. Sections 22a-l through 22a-13 provide for the general state policy, create a department of environmental protection, and establish the duties and powers of the commissioner.\u201d <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 44, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987). One of the powers of the commissioner, enumerated in \u00a7 22a-6 (a) (3), is the power to \u201cinstitute legal proceedings including, but not limited to, suits for injunctions, for the enforcement of any statute . . . administered ... by him . . . .\u201d This unambiguous expression of legislative intent persuades us that the commissioner may sue for an injunction to abate pollution in violation of \u00a7 22a-427 whether or not the commissioner has chosen to issue an order to abate pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Old Saybrook further claims that the trial court improperly determined that it has violated \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>and 22a-14 et seq. by failing to comply with the commissioner\u2019s orders because it is not affirmatively causing pollution. On the one hand, this issue relates to orders 3109, 3110 and 3111, which stand in one class, and we conclude that Old Saybrook may not prevail as to these orders. On the other hand, this issue relates to the substantive directive to build a regional wastewater treatment facility contained in modified order 4116, which, we determine, cannot be directly enforced yet may give rise to liability under \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 and 22a-14 et seq. We conclude, however, that the record is not sufficiently specific about the factual basis upon which the trial court held that Old Saybrook has violated these environmental statutes by causing pollution, and therefore direct the trial court to provide an articulation of its holding in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We first address orders 3109, 3110 and 3111. Old Saybrook\u2019s eleventh hour claim that it has not violated \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 and 22a-14 et seq. by causing pollution is unavailing because, having chosen not to appeal from these orders, Old Saybrook may not attack them in this proceeding. The commissioner issued orders 3109,3110 and 3111 after finding that Old Saybrook was \u201cmaintaining conditions which can reasonably be anticipated to cause pollution of the waters of the state . . . .\u201d Old Saybrook did not appeal from the issuance of these orders, and the time to appeal has passed. The trial court properly determined that the orders had been violated. Under these circumstances, the trial court must issue the requested injunction. See <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone </em>Corp., 170 Conn. 27, 32-33, 364 A.2d 208 (1975); see also <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 45. Old Saybrook cannot collaterally attack these orders in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We must next consider whether the trial court properly determined that Old Saybrook has caused pollution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 and 22a-14 et seq. by not building any wastewater treatment facility<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> to abate the pollution, in conjunction with its failure to comply with the prior orders. Old Saybrook contends that it has not \u201ccause[d] pollution\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-427 and has not engaged in \u201cconduct . . . [that] has, or is reasonably likely unreasonably to pollute, impair or destroy the public trust in the . . . water ... of the state\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-17. In particular, Old Saybrook contends that it has not actively discharged pollution and that its failure to abate pollution caused by its residents does not constitute a violation of these statutes. We conclude that a municipality may violate these statutes, which incorporate common law nuisance principles, without affirmatively causing pollution if the municipality has intentionally failed to abate a public nuisance. Old Saybrook, therefore, may have violated these statutes by intentionally failing to build a wastewater treatment facility. The trial court found a statutory violation, but did not specify whether it had found that Old Saybrook had acted negligently or intentionally in creating the public nuisance. We, therefore, must remand this case to the trial court for further articulation of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In determining whether a municipality\u2019s knowing failure to abate pollution amounts to causing pollution under \u00a7\u00a7 22a-427 or 22a-14 et seq., our analysis \u201cis guided by well established principles of statutory construction. Statutory construction is a question of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 22-23; <em>HUD/Barbour-Waverly </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Our analysis begins with the language of the statutory provisions at issue. Neither of these statutory schemes, however, indicates whether a municipality must itself affirmatively pollute the waters of the state in order to violate the scheme. Section 22a-427 provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person or municipality shall cause pollution of any of the waters of the state . . . .\u201d Section 22a-16 is an expansive citizen suit provision allowing any person to sue anyone \u201cfor declaratory and equitable relief\u2019 in order to protect \u201cthe public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction . . . .\u2019\u2019In order to establish a prima facie case under \u00a7 22a-16, the plaintiff must establish that \u201cthe conduct of the defendant, acting alone, or in combination with others, has, or is reasonably likely unreasonably to pollute . . . the public trust in the . . . water\u201d of the state. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-17; <em>see Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 57-58. The legislative history of these statutes likewise is silent regarding whether a municipality may cause pollution without itself affirmatively discharging pollutants into the waters of the state.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>In the absence of guidance from the language of the statute or the legislative history, we look to common law principles of nuisance. \u201cIt is assumed that all legislation is interpreted in light of the common law at the time of its enactment. 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984 Rev.) \u00a7 50.01.\u201d <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental </em>Protection, supra, 226 Conn. 389. This presumption is particularly apt in relation to environmental statutes. See id., 389 and n.24. Indeed, the Water Pollution Control Act expressly incorporates common law public nuisance principles by declaring that \u201cthe pollution of the waters of the state is inimical to the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the state, [and is] a public nuisance. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-422; see <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">In light of the statutory declaration that water pollution constitutes a public nuisance; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-422; Old Saybrook apparently does not contest that the pollution of the Connecticut River and the Long Island Sound by the failing septic systems in Old Saybrook is a public nuisance. A public nuisance exists if: (1) the condition complained of has a natural tendency to create danger and inflict injury upon person or property; (2) the danger created is a continuing one; (3) the use of the land is unreasonable or unlawful; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>(4) the condition or conduct complained of interferes with a right common to the general public. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tippets-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, </em>204 Conn. 177, 183, 527 A.2d 688 (1987); see also <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">A public nuisance can be created intentionally or negligently. A nuisance is created intentionally if \u201cthe creator of the condition intends the act that brings about the condition . . . .\u201d <em>Quinnett </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>213 Conn. 343, 348, 568 A.2d 786 (1990). We hold today that \u201can interference with the public right, is intentional if the [municipality] . . . knows that it is resulting or is substantially certain to result from [its] conduct.\u201d 4 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 825 (1979); see, e.g., <em>Sandifer Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roeland Park, </em>6 Kan.

It is not enough to make an invasion intentional that the actor realizes or should realize that [its] conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>involves a serious risk or likelihood of causing the invasion. [The actor] must either act for the purpose of causing it or <em>know that it is resulting or is substantially certain to result from [the actor\u2019s] conduct.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 4 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 825, comment c. If the invasion results from continuing or recurrent conduct, \u201cthe first invasion resulting from the actor\u2019s conduct may be either intentional or unintentional; but <em>[if] the conduct is continued after the actor knows that the invasion is resulting from it, further invasions are intentional.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., \u00a7 825, comment d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Because Old Saybrook is a municipality, it would not be liable for maintaining a public nuisance through its failure to abate pollution under the common law if its conduct were merely negligent nonfeasance. We have long held that \u201c[liability can be imposed on the municipality only in the event that, if the condition constitute [s] a nuisance, it was created by some positive act of the municipality.\u201d <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>151 Conn. 689, 692, 202 A.2d 134 (1964); <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 388; <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 205, 209, 439 A.2d 949 (1981); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 464, 470, 356 A.2d 176 (1975). Indeed, we have stated that \u201cfailure to remedy a condition not of the municipality\u2019s own making is not the equivalent of the required positive act in imposing liability in nuisance upon a municipality.\u201d <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 209-10; <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 693; see <em>Sheeler v. Waterbury, </em>138 Conn. 111, 115, 82 A.2d 359 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The rule limiting municipal liability for nuisance created through mere nonfeasance has its origins in principles of municipal immunity. Noting that municipalities are not liable, under the common law, for mere \u201cnegligence in the performance of governmental functions and duties,\u201d we concluded, in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Conn. 386, 389, 155 A. 499 (1931), that a municipality may be liable for a nuisance it creates through its negligent misfeasance or nonfeasance even if that misfeasance or nonfeasance also constitutes negligence from which the municipality would be immune. Id., 389. We then listed examples from our prior cases in order to illustrate the distinction between nuisance and mere negligence. Id., 391-92. Without further analysis, later cases, citing <em>Hoffman, </em>have stated the rule more broadly to preclude liability for any nuisance created through mere nonfeasance. See, e.g., <em>Sheeler v. Waterbury, </em>supra, 138 Conn. 115-16; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Rocky Hill, </em>126 Conn. 402, 407, 11 A.2d 399 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">These precedents arose in the context of claims of municipal liability for nuisance created <em>negligently </em>through the unintentional conduct of the municipality. The language of the opinions is, however, broader than the claims therein resolved. The language speaks expansively of municipal immunity in the absence of some positive act of the municipality. Despite this sweeping language, we have never held that a municipality is not liable for an <em>intentional </em>nuisance created through its failure to abate pollution.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The question before us, therefore, is whether to extend the rationale of these precedents to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>immunity to a municipality for its intentional creation of a public nuisance. Without deciding what the law of municipal liability may be in other contexts, in light of the strong public policy manifested by the environmental protection statutes,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we conclude that a municipality may be liable for a public nuisance that it intentionally creates through its prolonged and deliberate failure to act to abate that nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The trial court found that Old Saybrook has caused pollution \u201cby not abating the pollution which it can best abate.\u201d The trial court grounded this finding in Old Saybrook\u2019s failure to implement the sewer avoidance program set forth in orders 3109,3110 and 3111. Specifically, despite its acquiescence in the validity of these orders, Old Saybrook has failed to implement the appropriate programs to inspect area septic systems, monitor contamination of area groundwater and surface waters, regulate the pumping of septic systems through a permit system, effect maintenance of septic systems by residential property owners through an enforcement system, and has failed to report its compliance with these orders to the commissioner. Furthermore, Old Say-brook has failed to build a regional wastewater treatment facility without challenging the adequacy of the financial contributions to be made by neighboring towns or the scientific validity of the engineering study that had found that failing septic systems were polluting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the Connecticut River in a manner that could be remedied best by the construction of such a regional waste-water treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We conclude nonetheless that the trial court\u2019s finding that Old Saybrook has caused pollution is not sufficiently specific with respect to whether Old Saybrook\u2019s continuing conduct over time in creating a public nuisance, in light of the various orders, rose to the level of intentional conduct under \u00a7 825 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. \u201cAn articulation is appropriate [if] the trial court\u2019s decision contains some ambiguity or deficiency reasonably susceptible of clarification.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 114; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chagnon, </em>210 Conn. 734, 751, 557 A.2d 525, on appeal after remand, 212 Conn. 322, 561 A.2d 436 (1989); <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Sturman, </em>186 Conn. 13, 16, 438 A.2d 1181 (1982). Accordingly, we remand this case for further articulation of this issue, and retain jurisdiction for the puipose of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Last, we address whether the trial court properly issued civil penalties against Old Saybrook for failing to comply with orders 3109,3110 and3111 andmodified order 4116. Old Saybrook contends that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing these penalties. Because we have determined that modified order 4116 was never properly agreed to or issued, any penalty imposed against Old Saybrook for noncompliance with that order is invalid. That invalidity does not, however, impair the propriety of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion to impose civil penalties based on violations of the other orders. We must address whether the trial court appropriately exercised its discretion in imposing a civil penalty of $22,660 against Old Saybrook for vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>lating each of the remaining orders, orders 3109, 3110 and 3111.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing these penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Section 22a-438 permits the trial court to impose a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day of each violation of an order. In imposing a civil penalty, the court may consider \u201cthe nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation, the person or municipality\u2019s prior history of violations, the economic benefit resulting to the person or municipality from the violation, and such other factors as deemed appropriate by the court. The court shall consider the status of the person or municipality as a persistent violator.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-438 (a); see also <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>L &amp; S Construction, </em>226 Conn. 205, 214-15, 626 A.2d 1299 (1993). The trial court stated that it had considered these factors, especially some good faith efforts of Old Saybrook to comply with the orders, the deterrent purpose of the penalties and the financial consequences of such penalties on the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Although the trial court might well have discussed each statutory factor in further detail, it indicated that it had considered the appropriate factors, and \u201c[t]he defendants have not sought further articulation of the factual basis underlying the court\u2019s imposition of . . . civil penalties in [this case]. See Practice Book \u00a7 4051. . . . [On this record,] \u2018it would be sheer speculation for this court to assume that the trial court [incorrectly applied the] legal standard.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumpton, </em>202 Conn. 224, 232, 520 A.2d 226 (1987); <em>DiBerardino </em>v. <em>DiBerardino, </em>[213 Conn. 373, 385, 568 A.2d 431 (1990)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a nominal civil penalty of $20 per day for violations of each valid order. \u201c[T]here was ample evidence before the trial court to justify the imposition of . . . substantial penalties . . . .\u201d Id. The trial court found that a pollution problem existed, that Old Saybrook had been aware of the pollution problem and that the town had made some good faith efforts to solve the problem. Old Saybrook, however, has failed to comply with orders 3109, 3110 and 3111 since 1983. Finally, the trial court considered the town\u2019s ability to pay and the need for deterrence.

Because Old Saybrook did not clearly raise this issue before the trial court and the trial court did not address it, we decline to address it for the first time on appeal. See <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>235 Conn. 693, 704 n.10, 669 A.2d 1202 (1996); <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 830 n.14, 629 A.2d 379 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Finally, Old Saybrook claims that the trial court improperly declined to dismiss the claims under \u00a7 22a-14 et seq. because of improper venue. Although the record is obscure, it appears that the trial court determined it had subject matter jurisdiction despite the allegedly improper venue. We decline to reach this issue, however, because it was inadequately briefed. Old Saybrook\u2019s argument on this issue consists of one eonclusory sentence stating that the venue provision in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16 is mandatory and a citation to a case; <em>Farricielli </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>186 Conn. 198, 200-205, 440 A.2d 286 (1982) (holding that venue provision in Uniform Administrative Procedure Act is mandatory); that is not directly on point. On this record, we are not prepared to conclude that \u00a7 22a-16 deprives the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the claims brought to it by the commissioner.
