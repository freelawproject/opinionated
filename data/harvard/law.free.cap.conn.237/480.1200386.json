The trial court, after a de novo trial, rendered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Carl Dunham, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Jr., in which it held that the last will and testament of the testator, Jessica Scott Dunham, dated August 27, 1978, be admitted to probate in its entirety. The defendant Joan Dunham Rogerson, the testator\u2019s daughter, has renewed on appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the challenges that she raised at trial to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court and to the merits of the judgment rendered by the trial court. The trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>considered and rejected Rogerson\u2019s jurisdictional challenge, and the trial court, <em>R. Walsh, J., </em>considered and denied her motions for a mistrial and for the opening of the judgment against her. Upon a careful review of the claims of impropriety raised by Rogerson in her brief and at oral argument in this court, we conclude, in light of the record before the trial court, that the judgment of the trial court should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-11\"> In a companion case, Roger Dunham also appealed from the judgment of the trial court admitting the will to probate. That appeal has been withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
