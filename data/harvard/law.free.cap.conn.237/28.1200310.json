The plaintiff, Barbara Oakley, appealed to the Superior Court from the decision of the named defendant, the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission), dismissing her complaint of sexual discrimination by the defendant, the state judicial branch. In her appeal, the plaintiff requested a remand for further consideration by the commission and \u201c [s]uch other relief as the Court may deem fair and equitable.\u201d On September 3, 1992, the trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal and ordered the remand that she had requested. On February 3, 1993, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff in the amount of $7500, the maximum specified in \u00a7 4-184a (a) (2). The Appellate Court, in response to the appeal of the commission, upheld the validity of the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff. <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>38 Conn. App. 506, 662 A.2d 137 (1995). We granted the commission\u2019s petition for certification to appeal, limited to the question of the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>jurisdiction to act on the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The concern raised by the certified question is the fairness of countenancing a substantial delay in the filing of a motion for attorney\u2019s fees, a delay that results in the adjudication of the motion long after the expiration of the time for further appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment on the merits of the underlying administrative appeal. We recognize the legitimacy of this concern. Despite its legitimacy, the concern is one that cannot be addressed through the process of appellate review but requires a change in the appropriate provisions either of the General Statutes or of the Practice Book. See <em>Kupstis </em>v. <em>Michaud, </em>215 Conn. 435, 437, 576 A.2d 152 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that, on the present state of the law, the commission cannot prevail in its contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Because the jurisdictional issue was fully addressed in the thoughtful and comprehensive opinion of the Appellate Court, it would serve no useful purpose for us to elaborate further on the discussion therein contained.
