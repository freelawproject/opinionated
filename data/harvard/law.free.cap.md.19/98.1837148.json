The defendant\u2019s motion should have been granted, because the evidence objected to relates to matters of account between the defendant and partnership firms, of which the plaintiff is not the legal representative. The said firms are legally distinct from that of which the plaintiff is the surviving partner, and there is no evidence of any assignment, in writing, of the indebtedness shown by said accounts against the defendant, either to tlie plaintiff or to the firm of which he is tlio surviving partner; nor is there evidence of any unwritten equitable assignment of said indebtedness, made with the assent of the defendant, or supported by any promise from him to pay the same to the plaintiff, or to the firm of which he is the surviving partner. <em>Sto. on Part., secs. </em>254, 253, 244 and 334. 2 <em>Robs.

There being no evidence whatever of an assignment, in writing, to the plaintiff, or the firm of which he is the surviving partner, of the defendant\u2019s alleged indebtedness to the firms which existed prior to July 1st, 1851, the Court, in admitting the testimony objected to by the defendant, to go to\" the jury, must have been of opinion, that the said testimony tended to prove an unwritten equitable assignment of said indebtedness. But such unwritten assignment, if proved, would give the plaintiff no right of action at law, in his own name, against the defendant, unless it was either made with his assent, or the defendant expressly promised to pay. There is no evidence, whatever, that the defendant assented to the making of any such assignment, or that he ever had knowledge of any changes in the firm of <em>Nathan Rogers </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>other than that communicated by one of the witnesses. In this aspect of the testimony, nothing but an <em>express promise </em>to pay, by the defendant, could give the plaintiff a right to sue him at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-6\">3rd. That the contract of the 15th of October 1852, ere-, ated a special agency, and was not such a <em>chose in action </em>as admits of assignment, Nathan Rogers and John P. Rogers, in the firm name of Nathan Rogers &amp; Co., could not take upon themselves the execution and discharge of the agency created by the said contract, and charge the defendant on account thereof, without his knowledge and assent. The Court therefore erred in rejecting the defendant\u2019s 3rd praj^er. <em>White vs. Davidson, et al., </em>8 <em>Md. Rep., </em>169.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-7\">4th, The instruction asked in the defendant\u2019s 4th prayer should have been granted. The losses referred to, all occurred after the first change in the firm ; and the right or authority to place any part of any cargo in the barque, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>tlie bar\u00ed)uo\"k account, being entirely derived from the agreement of tlie 15tli of October 1852, it could not be assumed by other persons than tlio.se who were the parties to the said agreement, nor could they assign it. The- defendant would not be responsible for any such losses sustained by oilier persons than those upon whom tills right or authority was conferred by said agreement, unless before or at the time of putting in the cargo, he promised or agreed to be responsible therefor. Even a subsequent express promise to that effect would not avail, being <em>nudum pactum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-4\">5th. That the instruction ashed in the defendant\u2019s 7th prayer ought to have been granted without modification. It was not calculated to mislead the jury, and the propriety of the charges for commission was one of the matters in dispute, and the defendant had a right to the instruction without modification. <em>Whiteford vs. Buckmyer &amp; Adams, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>127. <em>Ghitty on </em>Gont., 480. The addition to the prayer is not law. Commissions were to he allowed by the defendant, according to the stipulations of the special agreement creating the agency, and the usage therein referred to. The addition to the prayer asserts, in effect, that commissions -were to be paid <em>for all acts </em>performed in execution of the agency, without reference to the agreement; provided only, in the performance of said acts, the party performing them acted with a proper knowledge of, and a proper regard for, the interests of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">On the point made under the first exception, as to the effect of the Act of 1825, ch. 117, see <em>Sothoron vs. Weems, </em>6 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>435. <em>Coates vs. Glenn, </em>5 <em>Md.

Goldsborough, </em>for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">The motion, the subject of the first exception, was pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>perly denied. Upon the testimony following that, of the accounts, the defendant is shown to be answerable on the final balance of those accounts to the firm of Nathan Rogers <em>&amp; </em>Co., as it was composed at Nathan Rogers\u2019 death; all the firms subsequent to the first one having been in effect, recognized as successors to that first in reference to the management of the vessels, and all matters embraced in the accounts, and all successive balances of account of the respective partnerships being merged, through Nathan Rogers\u2019 rightful control of those balances, in the balance finally resulting to Nathan Rogers in his ultimate partnership with John. Besides, the defendant has given no point to the motion, as required by the Act of 1825, ch. Ill, but has virtually offered a general prayer, that the plaintiff, on all the evidence, is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-4\">The first and second prayers (2nd bill of excejDtions) are erroneous, at least in requiring as conditions to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, as survivor of the last constituted firm of Nathan Rogers &amp; Co., not only knowledge in the defendant as to who made up that firm, but also an acknowledgment of indebtment to that firm, and, moreover, an express promise to pay the firm or plaintiff what may be claimable on all the transactions and accounts of the preceding firms. At the farthest, either one of the last two terms of the requisition would suffice for title to recover. But a recognition of the substitutional rights of the successive firms, and that to be even implied from circumstances, and to be imputed by law in the absence of defendant\u2019s inquiry as to partners, and a promise thence to pay, to be inferred, will suffice for the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff, as surviving partner of the last firm; especially as Nathan Rogers, the primary and essential agent in the defendant\u2019s view, and his contract, continued the principal in the last and every preceding firm,. It was sufficient, too, to have testimony (as we have) whence to infer assignment or surrender to Nathan Rogers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and liis successive associates, of all claims of extinguished firms. Beside all which, the precedent balances merge in the final claim of the last firm. The balance of each firm\u2019s account (on each the defendant being the debtor) was settled in the account with the succeeding firm. Nathan Rogers was competent, as a partner in each firm, so to extinguish those balances. Charles Butler shows, too, that Nathan Rogers and John were authorized to such effect, in being empowered to close all business and accounts. His' being examined as a witness, proves him divested of all interest, and in favor of the last firm. <em>7 H. &amp; J., </em>213, <em>Barger vs. Collins. </em>An express promise to pay was not necessary, even before the Act of 1829, ch. 50. 4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>351, <em>Allstan vs. Contee, </em>16 <em>Pick., </em>321, <em>Armsby vs. Farnham. </em>An agency may be recognized by subsequent adoption and recognition. <em>Pars.

An actual knowledge in defendant on that subject, was not necessary for his liability to the last firm, constituted, as it might be, of any one or more with Nathan Rogers ; his not inquiring, (if he did not inquire,) putting at his risk the fact as it might prove to be. Nathan Rogers was the man principally trusted, and Stewart was careless as to who might be associated with him; he makes no complaint on this score, nor of any loss on account of carelessness or negligence. 2 <em>H. &amp; G., Mitchell vs. Hall. </em>John P. Rogers, and all parties connected with these firms, are estopped by these proceedings from ever' claiming again against Stewart, and this is all he can injustice demand. 1 <em>Phil. Ev., </em>360. 3 <em>Id., </em>370. <em>Story on Part., sec. </em>328. <em>Pars. Mer. Law, </em>115. 2 <em>Md. Ch.

Rep., </em>298.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">Stewart\u2019s silence was a waiver of all objection on the score of the change of the members of the partnership. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., Allegre vs. Ins. Co. </em>He never made the objection when it could have been made, although he had every inducement to make it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">The principles asserted in refutation of the first and second prayers, condemn the position of the fourth prayer. The sixth prayer seems to claim the discharge of the defendant from all liability for his debt, upon the fallacjr that the \u201cLinda Steward\u201d being security for the debt, is (inasmuch as she was, as alleged, unlawfully sold) to be regarded as constructively availed of, at a value equal to the amount of the debt; or, in consequence of the asserted illegal conversion, is to be treated as having been the only resort for payment of the debt. The proposition thus presented, cannot require argument to repel it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">The seventh prayer was granted, so far as to concede' that commissions are forfeited where agency was unskilful or negligent, so as to yield no benefit to the defendant, but the Court below, by their clause added to the proposition, declared in effect, and properly, that where there was proper knowledge of the defendant\u2019s interests, and proper regard for them, in the conduct of the agent, there could be no unskilfulness nor negligence imputed; and that although no benefit might have flowed from the agency, commissions for even the unsuccessful service were claimable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-9\">The following authorities were also cited on the part of the appellee: 10 <em>East., </em>104, <em>Peacock vs. Harris. </em>2 <em>Har.

(See <em>ante page </em>108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The question or point presented by this exception, is-substantially the same with those in the 1st, 2nd and 4th prayers, viz., that in the absence or failure of evidence off an acknowledgment of indebtedness and <em>express promise </em>by the defendant to pay the plaintiff, the evidence as to the accounts and the items enumerated in the motion should be excluded, because those accounts were <em>\u201cres inter alios actce </em>and the causes of action represented by those accounts could not be recovered by the plaintiff, without evidence of such &lt; acknowledgment of indebtedness and express promise by the defendant. The prayers above referred to, being based upon the same theory, (that an, acknowledgment and express promise are necessary to be proved, to enable the plaintiff to- recover,) we will consider them and the first exception together. The position assumed by the defendant in his motion and those prayers, if correctly interpreted, is not tenable, dioses in action, between partners and others, like choses in action between individuals, rest in privity of contract, and, at common law, could bo sued on only in the name of the parties thereto, or their legal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Exceptions to the rigid rule of the common law, growing out of the doctrines of equitable actions and implied assumpsits, have long been recognized and adopted. In <em>Surtees vs. Hubbard, </em>4 <em>Esp. Rep., </em>203, Lord Ellenborough said: \u201cChoses in action, generally, are not assignable. Where a party is entitled to money, and assigns over his interest to another, the mere act of assignment does not entitle the assignee to maintain an action for it. The debtor may refuse his assent; he may have an account against the assignor, and wish to have his set off; but if there is any tiling <em>Wee assent </em>on the part of the holder of the money,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>in that case I think this, which Is <em>an equitable action, </em>is maintainable.\u201d The principle of this decision was early incorporated in our own adjudications. In <em>Allsion vs. Contee, 4 H. &amp; J., </em>351. it was determined, that where three partners dissolve, and two of them form a second partnership, assuming the debts of the old firm, and, after notice or knowledge of this arrangement, a debtor of the old firm promises to pay tho new firm, the latter could sue in its own name, alone, for the debt. This case resembles, in many of its features, that now under consideration. More recently, the decision in <em>4 Esp. Rep. </em>lias been cited and expressly approved, by the Court of Appeals of this State, in <em>Barger </em>&amp; <em>Collins, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>213. There it was held, that although all the partners must sue on a contract made with the partnership generally, if, after a dissolution, a claim is assigned to one of the parties, the assignee can sue in his own name, by proof that the debtor, with notice of the dissolution and assignment, promised to pay the assignee, and <em>such promise may be implied from the acts of the debtor, </em>as well as expressly proved. The general remark of the Court, in <em>Crawford vs. Burke, </em>4 <em>Gill, </em>213, viz., \u201cPrior to the Act of 1829, ch. 51, the assignee of a chose in action, unless'it veas negotiable by the mercantile law, was obliged to sue in the name of the assignor, or, if he was dead, in that of his personal representative, is to be construed, in connection witli the subject matter. That was the case of a written assignment, under the Act of 1829, ch. 51, in which tho Court held, the assignee, suing in his own name, need neither aver, in his declaration, a promise by the defendant to pay him the account, nor that it was <em>bona fide </em>as-signed to him. The Court were speaking of the effect of assignment <em>solely, </em>at common law, in contradistinction to a written assignment, under the Act referred to, and correctly laid down the general rule, without adverting to the effect of an assignment, parol or written. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>followed by assent or assumpsit, express or implied. \"W\u00e9 think, therefore, the ruling of the Court below, in rejecting the defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony as to the accounts and the items thereof, and refusing the defendant\u2019s 1st, 2nd and 4th prays, was correct, because they imposed upon the plaintiff the necessity of producing evidence, which the law did not require ; it being competent for the jury to find, from the facts proved, whether there was an assignment or transfer of the accounts from the old firm to the new, and whether the defendant assented to it, and promised, expressly or impliedly, to pay the balance to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The defendant\u2019s third prayer refers to the agency established between the original firm of Nathan Rogers &amp; Co. and the defendant, and declares that the transactions connected with the management of the vessels, which occurred subsequently to the formation of the last mentioned firm of Nathan Rogers <em>&amp; </em>Co., are not subjects of charge against the defendant, unless he knew who the partners were who composed the said firm, and with such knowledge recognized the said firm as his agents. In contracts of a continuing nature, as guaranties for advancements to be made, or bonds for the faithful discharge of a duty, questions often arise as to their true extent and operation, when there has been any change of the partners, by the retirement of the old, or the admission of the now one; for instance, whether the guarantee.would be liable either to the old firm or to the new, for any such advances or credits, after any such change?</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u201cIt has been held, that the guarantor would not be liable therefor ; and that no such guaranty ought to be extended beyond the actual import of its terms, but that it ought to be limited to advances and credits made by the original firm only.\u201d <em>Story on Part., sec. </em>245. In <em>Weston vs. Barton, </em>4 <em>Taunt. Rep., </em>613, 682, Sir James Mansfield said, \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>is not necessary, now, to enter into the reasons of these decisions, but there may be very good reasons for such conslructioua. It is very probable that sureties may be induced to enter into such a security, by a confidence which they repose hi the integrity, diligence, caution and accuracy of one or two of the partners. In the nature of tilings, there cannot be a partnership consisting of several persons, in which there are not some persons possessing these qualities in a greater degree than the rest, and it may be that the partner dying, or going out, may be the very person on whom the sureties relied. It would, therefore,-be very unreasonable to hold the surety responsible after such change.\u201d These considerations apply, if possible, more strongly to the agencies of the character in question, where the largest confidence is involved, and the largest capital may ho invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This prayer is only an assertion of the common law maxim, <em>\u201cdelegatus non potest delegare.\u201d </em>The agency, like the accounts, might have been transferred with the knowledge and assent of the defendant, from the old to the new firms, but this transfer and assent must be manifested by some evidence that the defendant know who constituted the new linns, and recognized the said firms as his agents in the management of his vessels, or either of them. Unlike the prayers before mentioned, this did not impose on the plaintiff any illegal requirements ; did not prescribe any mode of proof, positive or presumptive, of the knowledge and recognition prior or subsequent, but required the jury to find facts which, it seems to us, were material to the issues, and, as such, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Prayer No. 6, assumes that the plaintiff forfeited all claim to charges for services, management, advancement, &amp;c., if the\u2018 jury believed he sold the barque without authority. This assumption is erroneous. The plaintiff might, by the course of dealing between the defendant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>himself, Lavo become entitled to a balance on account against the defendant, and the latter have a claim against the former, for the amount of the vessel improperly sold; \u25a0the conversion or trespass of the plaintiff would, not extinguish the debt of the defendant. This defect justified the Court below in rejecting the prayer* without deciding whether the plaintiff had, under the contract, a power of sale for the general balance due ou their advancements and liabilities for the vessel. The contract of the 18th October 1852, recites, that to facilitate the hotter employment of the said vessels, and to secure (the appellants) for any necessary advances that they may make for said vessels, or to James A. Stewart, or any liabilities they may incur on account of said vessels, or order, the said Stewart has signed the necessary certificate to enable them to have the said barque registered in <em>their </em>names, and the appellants agreed to surrender said vessels, or the control thereof, to appellee, or his assigns, upon payment of any sum due them, over and above the nett profits, and all advances to said Stewart, and securing\u2019 them for all liabilities therefor. There is an express reservation of a lien on the vessels for advances to said vessels, or their owner, or to his order, and all liabilities therefor, with the legal title and possession in the plaintiffs. . Independently of such a contract, although a mooted question, the better opinion seems to he, that a lien existed in behalf of the ship\u2019s husband, for advances. <em>Story on Part., </em>444, 20. <em>John. Rep., </em>611, <em>note </em>3. A pawnee, at common law, may file a hill in equity against the pawner, for foreclosure and sale, or he may proceed to sell <em>ex mero motw? </em>upon giving due notice of Iris intention to the pledger. <em>Story on Bail\u2019ts, sec. </em>310. 2 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>453. It appears in this case, that the defendant was notified of the balance against him for advances, and of the plaintiff\u2019s intention to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The modification of the 7th prayer, when taken in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>uoetion with the points presented, does not seem subject to exception. The proposition presented by the defendant,, was, that if tiro jury believed the vessels wore managed so unskilfully that no benefit accrued to the defendant from the services anil management of plaintiff, or those through whom he claimed, then the plaintiff was entitled to no commission ; an instruction which might, we think, have been safely given, without misdirection. The Court helow did not reject this proposition, hut added, from abundant caution, a modification not conflicting with it, that if the jury believe that, in the performance of said acts, tire party performing the same therein, acted with a proper knowledge of, and a proper regard for, the interests of the defendant, (that is, not unskilfully,) the plaintiff is entitled to claim commissions for acts so done, whether any benefit resulted or not. In other words, that the agent\u2019s commission did not depend upon the profitable result of the adventure, if lie discharged his duty faithfully. No allusion was made to the instruments under which the agent acted, and no presumption was to bo drawn unfavorable to its observance ; on the contrary, \u201ca proper regard for the interests of the defendant,\u201d implied a strict observance of all the obligations of the agent, written or otherwise.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b127-7\">(Decided December 3rd, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">We concur with the Court below in its rulings on the first exception, and in the rejection of the appellant\u2019s 1st,, 2nd, 4th and 6th prayers, and modification of the 7th, but think there was error in rejecting the defendant\u2019s 3rd prayer, and therefore reverse the judgment and remand-the cause upon <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
