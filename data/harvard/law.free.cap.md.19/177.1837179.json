A bill was filed by certain of the holders of said \u201cincome bonds,\u201d praying for an injunction to restrain the sale of said \u201cmortgage bonds,\u201d and claiming a priority over, and an equitable lien upon, said \u201cmortgage bonds\u201d in the hands of their holders. Answers were filed by the defendants, responsive to and denying the material allegations of the bill. There was no competent and admissible evidence tending to show that any of the complainants were induced to purchase the \u201cincome bonds\u201d under any other representations than those on the face of said bonds, or that the R.

The bill of complaint filed on the 29th of February 1856, by the appellees against the appellants, was a creditor\u2019s bill, as well as a bill for an injunction; its allegations are fully stated in the opinion of this Court. Upon this bill the Court below (Lee, J.) granted an injunction, without requiring a bond, but the defendants, R. Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Sons, shewing by petition that the writ prevented their disposing of a large amount of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d the said Court afterwards required a bond to be given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">The answer of the Garretts, filed the 4th of April 185.6, states as follows: That they never held'themselves out, nor assumed to act, nor were authorized to act, as general agents of the Central Ohio Rail Road Company, but in the fall of . 1853, consented to act for it in negotiating and disj&gt;osing of certain of its bonds \"or obligations, and from that time have continued to act for it in the disposition, from time to time, of such obligations as it might entrust to them for that purpose, and negotiating loans on its account, and making advances of money and credit to it, or for its use, upon securities. That among the obligations entrusted to it by the company, for sale or hypothecation,.were certain of its \u201cincome bonds,\u201d a class of securities well known in the stock markets, and deriving their name from the pledge of the income of the road set out upon their face as the security and the only security offered for their payment over and above the general liability of the company. That the Central Ohio Rail Road Company, in all the \u201cincome bonds\u201d issued by it, (except one for $1,000,) including those of the complainant, May, by an agreement endorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>thereon, and signed hy its president, gave to the holders of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d the right to convert them into stock at par. That in the disposition of said \u201cincome bonds,\u201d though they often had a discretion as to price, they were never authorized hy the Central Ohio Rail Road Company to make any agreement hy which the company was to be liable to tire purchaser thereof in any other manner or to any other effect than as apparent on tho \u201cincome bond,\u201d \u25a0and that tbey never assumed, in any case of sale or hypothecation of any of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d of said company, to make such sale or hypothecation upon any agreement, express or implied, with the purchaser or holder, or any one for their account, which gave or was meant to give such purchaser or holder any right or title against the company, other than what was embodied in and apparent on the bond itself. That nobody who purchased \u201cincome bonds,\u201d but the complainants, have ever set up a claim that they were negotiated with an agreement for other rights than those given hy the bond, and that such claim, on their part, was made only a few days before the filing \u25a0of the bill. That in regard to the \u201cincome bonds\u201d held by the complainant, May, they deny, in terms, that they or either of them made to him or to his agent, Oolrichs, or to any one for either of them, the declarations, representations or affirmations charged in the bill. That a third mortgage was executed by the Central Ohio Rail Road Company, with their privity, and openly to Messrs. Swann, Hopkins and Lurman, (tbe latter being a partner of tbe aforementioned Henry Oelriehs,) dated 1st, and acknowledged 5th March 1855, and recorded in Ohio, where all the property lay that was covered hy it, and that the mortgagees (Swann, &amp;c.) put their certificates on \u00a7295,000 of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d in April 1855, and on the remainder in Juno following, in which last month and year the bonds were brought to the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the community, in Baltimore, where they were regularfy printed in the brokers\u2019 books, as early as September 1855. That the whole amount of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d (after deducting $100,000, provided for a sinking fund) was $850,000, of which amount they hold $198,000, received at the times above stated, when the company was not insolvent, according to their then or present belief, as they advanced in cash for it, between 1st May 1855, and <em>1st </em>February 1.856, $110,481.18, principally for payment of interest on mortgage and \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and forbore to sell the securities they held, as they might have done at any time, for their reimbursement. That the said $198,000 of \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d are now held by them for sale, without limit, on account of the Central Ohio Rail Road Company, and they are entitled, out of the first sales, to be reimbursed $143,150, being a portion of their advances in. 1855, and, of the further sales, the proceeds arc to bo divided, and 65 per cent, goes to the residue of the debt due them, and 35 per cent, to the satisfaction of <em>certain notes </em>of the company, endorsed by sundry of its directors for its accommodation, and discounted for its use, and that when the bill was filed in this cause, the sum of $24,366.50 was due them, by average, 12th September 1855, and the further sum of $314,892.92 on the 5th February 1856, and that when the bill was filed, they had full power to sell said mortgage bonds for their debt, and that besides said mortgage bonds, they hold as security $151,500 of \u201c''income bonds,\u201d the interest coupons on the first and second mortgages taken up by them, and a mortgage executed to them without any request on their part, though accepted by them, bearing date 28th September 1855, and also held an order for $8,893.\u201915 of mail pay on the Postmaster General, which has since been received, and is the only payment made them. That they deny that the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d or third mortgage security are liable to the \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>como bond-holders,\u2019\u2019 or that such holders have any equitable lien, or grounds for an equitable lien on them. That they took the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d without knowledge or notice of any claims thereon of any holders of \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and deny all knowledge or notice of the representations as to further security for \u201cincome bonds\u201d charged in the bill to have been made by the company or themselves, and each of the respondents denies having made such representations, or any tiling to the like effect in regard to \u201cincome bonds.\u201d That the holders of \u201cincome bonds\u201d aro not entitled to priority over the third mortgage as against them, or entitled in any way to the benefit of the third mortgage. That they know of no such law in Ohio as is mentioned in the hill making \u201cincome bondholders\u201d legal mortgagees of the company\u2019s property and income, and that the allegation thereof is ad variance with the rest of the bill, and destructive of its equity. That they never hare cast any cloud on, or impaired the rights of \u201cincome bond-holders,\u201d or set up any claim in conflict with their rights. The answer then pleads the statute of frauds, the want of jurisdiction on several specified grounds, that the complainants are not entitled to file a creditor\u2019s bill, and that they have adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">The answer of the Central Ohio Bail Road Company is as follows: It protests against the exorcise of jurisdiction over it, and sets up the same defences of law which, are relied on in the answer of the Garretts. It adopts that answer as to the details of the sale to Oelrichs, and avers that no demand outside the bill has been made on it, by any of the complainants, for any other bonds than those which they received. It says that the Garretts were never authorized by it to enter into any agreement by which the company was to be liable to the holders of \u201cincome bonds\u201d in any other manner than as appears on the bonds themselves, and that they have always understood from the Garretts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u25a0that they so sold them, and that it never agreed with any of the complainants, or authorized the Garretts to substitute \"third mortgage bonds\u2019 \u2019 for <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018income bonds, \u2019 \u2019 or make provision by \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d for the convertibility \u25a0or security of \u201cincome bonds.\u201d And it denies that the Garretts are or ever have heen its general agents, or have ever been held out as such, and says that they were 'agents only to sell its bonds and negotiate loans for it, and that their only power in regard to \u201cincome bonds,\u201d was to sell them as they were, without adding to, or taking from, the obligation imported by their terms when they left the company\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">The complainants filed under the commission, as their evidence, four mortgages executed by the company; of these the 1st and 2nd are not connected with the issues presented \u25a0on this appeal. The 3rd mortgage is dated the 1st of March 1855, and purports to secure the sum of $950,000; the 4th, dated the 28th of September 1855, is to Robert Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Sons, and the amount intended to be secured, \u25a0$500,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The original \u201cincome bond,\u201d marked C.

The Courts of Maryland have no jurisdiction of a creditor\u2019s bill, where the debtor resides and all his property lies out of the State. (See authorities above cited.) The question' of priority arises only ujion distribution, and it cannot be settled hypothetically before the distribution comes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">Putting aside the extra-territorial difficulty, the statute of frauds is a bar to the attempt, directly or indirectly, to get by parol an interest in land, as security. A party has lent money, and now asks, that by <em>parol, </em>an agreement giving an interest in land may bo enforced. This cannot be done. The same statute is a bar to the attempt to interpolate into the \u201cincome bond\u201d a provision not contained in it, being the varying of a written instrument by parol.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\">If the alleged representations were made, there was adequate remedy at law for non-compliance with them. On such a contract, a suit at law would lie.

No proof is offered of any representations made by Garrett to any of the \u201cincome bond-holders\u201d now suing\u2019, except in regard to May, and as to him, the only proof is that May said John Garrett made representations to him. This was excepted to, and amounts to nothing\u2019.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-5\"><em>Jrl. May </em>and <em>JS. J. Brent </em>for the appellees:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-6\">I. The \u201cincome bonds\u201d held by the complainants, constitute, as between the rail road company and the holders, an equitable lien upon the whole income or revenues of the rail road. An idea has been entertained that the expression in these bonds, \u201cin preference to the payment of dividends on capital stock,\u201d &amp;c., makes them nothing but a preferred stock. Such an idea would destroy the \u201cincome bond\u201d as an evidence of debt, and enable the debtor to deprive the creditor of his stipulated security, by creating new debts <em>ad infinitum, </em>to be preferred to that very security which the senior class of creditors had solemnly been promised. The proposition on the other side, is simply this, that the debt clearly evidenced by the obligatory part of the bonds held by the complainants, is virtually without any security whatever, notwithstanding these bonds specifically pledge for that debt <em>all the income of the road and its appurtenances. </em>Undoubtedly the charter of this company never authorized such an idea, as paying creditors with preferred dividends on stock, when, by its 12th section, it declares that dividends shall be made among the stockholders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\">The appellants construe this contract erroneously. 1st. Because the contract should be supported, and not defeated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>ub res magis valeat cjuam per eat. </em>2 <em>Parsons Con., </em>15. <em>Broom\u2019s Maxims, </em>853. 2nd. Because, in cases where the contract bears a double construction,- it should receive that sense which will mate it efficacious. 2 <em>Parsons Con., </em>16. 3rd. Because such a construction should be placed on it as will mate it just and reasonable. 2 <em>Parsons Con., </em>16. 4th. Because their construction regards only the clause which provides a preference over stockholders, and ignores the clause which specifically pledges the whole income for a debt. 2 <em>Parsons Con., </em>17. How, then, should the clauses of this bond be reconciled so as to give effect to the whole context? It will be observed that the whole income is pledged to meet the principal and interest as they fall due; and the exclusion of dividends to stockholders until these bonds are paid, looks to an accumulation of the income, so as to prevent dividends being paid to stockholders at any time before the maturity of the bonds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-5\">In equity, parties can always contract for a lien on future earnings or property to be acquired, and such liens will be enforced. <em>Redfield on Railways, </em>587, 591. 3 <em>Leading Cases in Eq., </em>307, 308. It will be seen that the charter of this company expressly authorized the issuing of \u2018'\u201cincome bonds.\u201d (See 21 <em>How., </em>422, 424.) And this power exists unless restrained by the charter. <em>Redfield on Railways, </em>575. <em>Susquehanna Bridge and Bank Co. vs. Gen. Ins. Co., </em>3 <em>Md. Rep., </em>311. But we insist that such a pledge of all the income or revenues of the road, amounts, in equity, to a'pledg.e of the road itself, creating therefore an equitable mortgage on the road, its franchises and revenues. <em>Red-field on Raihoays, </em>587. <em>Pierce on Railways, </em>512. <em>Casilly &amp; Wife, et al., vs. Meyer, et al., </em>4 <em>Md.

Such an attempt to overreach their antecedent creditors who held these \u201cincome bonds,\u201d by the creation of junior but preferred liabilities, is, in itself, a -fraud on the part of the company,.which merits the sternest treatment at the hands of a Court of Equity. The company, a-s the maker of these \u201cincome bonds,\u201d having express notice of their equitable lien on its whole corporate property, ought to be restrained by injunction from the execution of its designs, thus to overreach the elder but unrecorded lien created by its \u201cincome bonds,\u201d because, unless restrained, the <em>bona fide </em>purchasers of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d without notice of these unrecorded liens, would be preferred; and thus irreparable injury would be indicted on the confiding purchasers of the income bonds. These are familiar principles of equity. 2 <em>Waterm. Eden on </em>Inj., 341, <em>and notes.

Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Sons are co-defendants, and the question is, whether <em>quoad </em>the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>held by them, they are not equally affected in good conscience by the superior equities of tbe holders of the \u201cincome bonds. \u2019 \u2019 It appears, not only from the evidence in the case, but from the answer of the Garretts, that they received the \u201cincome bonds\u201d from the company, as its financial agents, and put them in circulation through the community. Therefore they had express notice of the equities created by these bonds. It also appears from the evidence, and the answer of the Garretts, that they received and held, at the date of this injunction, a very large amount of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d and that these bonds were placed in their hands by the Railroad Company. Their own answer admits that they were privy to the preparation and execution of the third mortgage and its bonds, and the same fact is abundantly proved by the evidence in the cause. We therefore confidently maintain, that the Garretts are in no better predicament than the Railroad .Company, whose financial agents they were, but they took the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d not only for the improper uses of the company and themselves, but with express notice of our prior equities, and of the necessary repugnancy between those known equities and the \u2018 \u2018third mortgage bonds\u201d they designed using to our detriment. Such notice fastened on the Garretts, makes them trustees of the title derived by the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d for the benefit of the \u201cincome bonds.\u201d 1 <em>Story\u2019s Eq., secs. </em>395, 399. <em>Hudson vs. Warner &amp; Vance, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>415.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">III. The representations' of John Garrett, made to different parties at the time of issuing the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d are proved to have been expressly to the effect that the \u201cincome bonds\u201d would be retired or absorbed by the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d as soon as they should be prepared and issued. These declarations, though not proved to have been made to any of the complainants at the time of acquiring their \u201cincome bonds,\u201d except in the case of J.

What relief are the complainants entitled to? Wo have the right to a supplemental decree, requiring the Garretts to hold the bonds now in their hands as a security for the benefit of these complainants, thus giving them nearly two dollars of \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d as security for one of \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and so the decree maybe modified in any way by this Court. 1 Yol. of Code, Art. 5, sec. 28. Or a receiver may be appointed to hold the $190,000 of \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d for the security of these complainants. <em>Recljield on Railways, </em>573, <em>sec. </em>5. The decree appealed from, was only final so far as it settled the priority of our \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and it shows, on its face, that the Court contemplated further 'proceedings to carry out the decree practically.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">Y. We maintain that the parol evidence tending to show that the \u201cincome bonds\u201d were agreed to be soon substituted by \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d does not contradict <em>the </em>terms and effect of said \u201cincome bonds,\u201d but shows simply that the purchasers took them as collateral security for the due delivery of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d then in a course of preparation for issue. Such evidence relates merely to the tenure of the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d which were delivered in part execution of this parol agreement to take them up in a short time with new securities. 10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>404. We want specific performance of this partly executed agreement, as it was the inducement held Out to the public, by the Garretts, to facilitate the sale of the \u201cincome bonds;\u201d and they ought to be held to the performance of their own promises, when the means.are in their control.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">Finally, we submit that this case, as against the company and their agents, the Garretts, should be ruled by the broad principles affirmed in 23 <em>Howard, </em>397, 398, and 400.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Reverdy </em>Johnson, for the appellants, in reply:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-5\">1st. The only representation charged to have have been, made by the bill, as amended by the agreement, is that made to May alone. Was there, then, any representation made to May at all? The bill does not allege that any representation was made with a fraudulent design and purpose. It is consistent with the bill that the representation was made in good faith. In the absence of such an allegation, this Court cannot consider the question of fraud, even if the evidence establishes fraud. But the case need not be put on this ground, for there is, in fact, no evidence of such a representation. The sale was made on the 24th of March 1855, and the <em>ivritten contract of sale </em>contains no such representation. In making the sale, Oelrichs is acting as May\u2019s agent, and the agent of the Garretts. There is no pretence that the Garretts said to Oelrichs any thing in regard to the bonds, at the time of the sale. He testifies that May said Garrett made the representation. This evidence is excepted to. The case in 1 <em>Moody &amp; Malkin, </em>does not sustain the admissibility of this proof. Strike out this part of Oelrichs\u2019 testimony, and there is not a particle of proof of the representation. But there is no proof of any agency on the part of the Garretts to make any such representations. Oelrichs\u2019 only agency was to sell the \u201cincome bonds.\u201d There was, thou, no representation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-6\">2nd. A question of law, then, arises, viz. To what relief are the holders of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d entitled? What is the nature of the bond, and what right and what security does it give? The word <em>income, </em>here, means <em>net income </em>from the road and its appurtenances. The holder is thus made only a <em>preferred stockholder. </em>The money borrowed, afterwards furnished the means for making the income; for it was applied to the construction and working of the road. It was the food on which the \u201cincome bonds\u201d lived.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Goldsborougii,- J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajo\">delivered the opinion of this Oonrt:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On the 8th day of May 1841, the General Assembly of the State of Ohio passed an Act incorporating the Central Ohio Railroad with perpetual succession, and with authority to construct a Railroad, commencing at or near the city of Columbus, and extending eastward' to such point on the Ohio river as the directors might select.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">By the 14th section of said Act, the company was empowered to borrow money on its credit, and to make and execute such bonds, promissory notes and other evidences of debt, payable, transferable and redeemable at such times and places and in such form as might be therein designated. By the 15th section, it is provided, \u201cthat for the security of the payment of such monies so borrowed, and the interest thereon, said directors may pledge, by mortgage or otherwise, their entire road, franchises, fixtures and equipments, with the income and resources thereof, together with the capital stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In pursuance of this authority, the company proceeded to construct the Railroad; and, with a view of obtaining funds, executed a first and second mortgage, the provisions of which are not involved in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">After the execution of the above mortgages, the Railroad Company issued certain bonds, denominated \u201cincome bonds.\u201d The material part of which is as follows: \u201cEor the punctual payment of the interest and principal of said obligations, and of others of like tenor, issued or to be issued, <em>in preference to the payment of dividends on the capital stock of said </em>company, <em>the income arising from the road and. its appurtenances is hereby specifically pledged. \u2019 \u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">A portion of these bonds were entrusted to the appellants, \u2022Robert Garrett, Henry S. Garrett and John S. Garrett, for sale or hypothecation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">The appellee, Henry May, by his agent, Henry Oelrichs, purchased five of these bonds,' on the 24th day of March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>1855, for which he paid, through his agent, the consideration money to the appellants, the Garretts. Josiah Lee <em>&amp; </em>Go. also purchased fifty of these bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The Railroad Company executed a third deed of mortgage on the first day of March 1855, in favor of the appellants, Thomas Swann, Johns Hopkins and Gustav W. Lurman, as mortgagees and trustees. The purpose of which deed was \u201cto provide for the funding of the floating debt, and to raise money therefor, by loan, to an amount not exceeding $850,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The appellees, Henry May and Josiah Lee &amp; Co., feeling themselves aggrieved \"by the conduct of the Railroad Company, in executing this third mortgage, filed their hill of complaint in the Superior Court of Baltimore city, on the 29th day of .February 1856, and this bill was so filed in behalf of themselves and all other creditors of the Railroad Company. The complainants prayed for an injunction to restrain the appellants, the Garretts, from selling the bonds issued in pursuance of the power conferred by the third deed of mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">By an agreement of the parties, filed on the 6th of February 1858, \u201cthe original complainants constituting the firm of Josiah Lee &amp; Co., and all allegations relating thereto, are to be stricken out of said bill of complaint. The bill is to be considered as the bill of complaint of Henry May, Bonus Barnum, William Carstangan, Daniel W. Warneken, Edward Boninger and Robert Letor, tbe last two trading as Boninger Brothers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Tbe grounds on which relief is sought, are, that the five \u201cincome bonds\u201d of the appellee, May, were bought by him from the appellants, the Garretts, who had been for a long time previously the <em>agents </em>of the Railroad Company, and, as agents, entrusted with the custody and disposal of these \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and of others of like tenor and effect, and, with a view to bettor negotiation of them, the company, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>well as its agents, especially John S. Garrett, did declare and affirm that the said \u201cincome bonds\u201d <em>were to be secured </em>or <em>provided for </em>by a deed of mortgage, then about to be executed by the company, on all its imoperty and effects, subject to two preceding mortgages; and that the manner in which the \u201cincome bonds\u201d were to be secured or provided for, in the third deed of mortgage, was by converting the \u201cincome bonds\u201d into bonds secured by the third mortgage. That similar representations were made to others than the appellant, May.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">That when this mortgage was executed, no provision was made for the better securing the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d as the company was bound to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">' That the company, being insolvent, delivered to the Garretts all, or nearly all, the bonds secured by the third mortgage, and that they then held them either as agents of the company, to raise money thereon, or as collateral security for, or in satisfaction and discharge of, the company\u2019s indebtedness to them or others; but that, in either case, these \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d are liable, in the hand's of the holders, to the equitable lien thereon of the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">That independently of any agreement for further security in respect to the \u2018 \u2018income bonds, \u2019 \u2019 they were issued under authority of a law of Ohio, and, by virtue of that law, the holders of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d are legal mortgagees of the entire property and income of the company, and, as such, entitled to priority over the holders of the \u201cthird mortgage bonds,\u201d and that the Garretts pretend that the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d are entitled to priority over the \u201cincome bonds;\u201d and the complainants allege that such pretences prevent the sale or disposition of their bonds at their proper value'.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The complainants then prayed for an injunction restraining the defendants from disposing of, or parting with, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>bonds now held by them, and securred by the third mortgage, or from sotting up the said bonds as entitled to priority or preference over the \u201cincome bonds;\u201d and that the complainants and holders of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d may be substituted as preferred creditors, to the security of said deed of mortgage. The injunction was issued as \u00a1orayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">At the final hearing, the Superior Court passed a decree in conformity with the prayer of the complainants, and perpetuated the injunction. From this decree an appeal was prayed and taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In view of the opinion entertained by this Court, upon the merits of the case, as developed by the bill, exhibits, answers and depositions, we do not deem it material to decide the question of jurisdiction raised by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Although the allegations in the complainants\u2019 bill may have justified the Court below in granting the injunction, yet, upon the coming in of the answers and depositions, we think the Court erred in passing' its final decree, granting the relief prayed for, and perpetuating the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The answers of the defendants are not only responsive to the bill in every material allegation, but expressly deny the <em>general agency </em>of the Garretts, the representations of their intention to substitute the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d for the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and especially deny that any authority was given or exercised to sell the \u201cincome bonds\u201d upon any other terms than those appearing upon the face of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Looking then to the depositions, and excluding from our view the connection of Josiah Lee &amp; Co. with the bill and subsequent proceedings, wo find no testimony, whatever, tending to show that any of the present appellees were induced to purchase the \u201cincome bonds\u201d under any other considerations than those terms stated on the face of them, except Mr. May; and we are of opinion that his declarations, made to his agent, Mr. Oelrichs, were not admissible, and were properly excepted to by the appellants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>And further, if any representations were made by the appellants, the Garretts, that the \u201cthird mortgage bonds\u201d would be substituted for the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d there is no-evidence to show that the Railroad Company gave any authority to make such representations, or, if they were made, that they came to the knowledge of Mr., May, and that he was influenced by them to make the purchase of the bonds, he now holds..</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We are therefore constrained to decide that the appellees have wholly failed to establish the general agency of the appellants, the Garretts, or that they made the representations charged in the bill; and further, that no authority was vested in them to sell the \u201cincome bonds\u201d upon any terms other than those on the face of them. That to superadd others, would have been in conflict with that well settled rule of law, that no written instrument can be explained, altered <em>or added to </em>by parol, which, in its application to-this case, must be observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The point was especially urged, in argument, that the? Railroad Company, having issued the \u201cincome bonds.,\u201d had no legal right to execute the third mortgage, and, by so doing, committed a fraud upon, the purchasers of the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d and deprived them of every means of deriving any pecuniary advantage from their possession. We have maturely considered the force of this point, and axe of' opinion that it is untenable..</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We can perceive nothing in the stipulations of the \u201cincome bonds\u201d which in any way precluded the Railroad Company from, executing other obligations to obtain means to complete their road. The terms of the ''\u2018income bonds\u201d are specific, and the holders of these bonds must be confined to the preference given thereby. The procurement of funds other than those realized by the sale of the \u201cincome bonds,\u201d' was but increasing the ability of the company to render the road available for the reception of income, thereby en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>abiing it to moot the payment of the interest and principal of these bonds. The third mortgage indicates none other than a legitimate purpose to resort to such means as would promote the ultimate purpose for which the company was created.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b205-7\">( Decided December 5th, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><em>Order </em>reversed, <em>and bill dismissed, with costs to appellants.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
