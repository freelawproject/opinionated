Hambleton, damages sustained by tbe appellee in tbe loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>of a horse, alleged to have been hired by him to the appellants. The declaration contains but one count, and is :\u2014 \u201cThat the defendants hired from the plaintiff a horse, to drive from Baltimore city to the distance of twenty or twenty-one miles, in Baltimore county, and thence back to Baltimore city, in a proper manner, and the defendants drove said horse so immoderately that he died from the effects of said immoderate driving, and the plaintiff claims,\u201d ,&amp;c. The defendants pleaded that they did not commit the wrong alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>1st Exception. </em>The defendants\u2019 first prayer, offered at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and rejected by the Court, with a summary of said testimony, will be found in the opinion of this Court, and constitute the first exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-6\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>The defendants then offered in evidence an agreed statement of the testimony of Victor Holmes, a competent witness, as follows : \u201cOne of the defendants,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-7\">Francis H. Hambleton, arrived at the residence of Victor Holmes, at about seven o\u2019clock, P. M., on the evening of the 4th of July 1858, having driven from the city of Baltimore, a distance of twenty-two miles, with a horse hired from the plaintiff; that the weather was warm; that the horse was very fat, and seemed much exhausted; that every care was taken to prevent the servants from giving him too much water or food, in his heated condition ; that he was tied under a tree until sufficiently cooled to be put in the stable ; that the defendants left the house of said Holmes at five o\u2019clock, A. M., the following morning, on their return to the city; that the horse was then lame, but not too much so, in the opinion of said Holmes, to have been used for such journey; and that the time usually taken to go from Baltimore to said Holmes\u2019 residence, is about three hours.\u201d The defendants also proved, by J. Douglas Hambleton, that the defendant, Thomas Edward Hambleton, had not been in the city on the 4th of July, and then sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>xnitted to the Court two prayers, wliicb were rejected; and no exception having been taken to the ruling of the Court, as appears from the record, said prayers are here omitted. The Court then instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIf the jury believe, from the evidence in the cause, that the defendants, hired the horse, spoken of in the evidence, from the plaintiff, at the time stated by the witnesses, and that the said horse was used by the defendants for the purposes for which he was hired, and that in the said use of the said horse, he suffered and was injured without any neglect or ill-usage, or want of reasonable and proper care on the part of the said defendants, then their verdict must be for the defendants. If, on the contrary, they shall believe that the said defendants, so hiring and using the said horse, or their servants or agents, did not use ordinary, reasonable and proper care in the said use of the said horse, then their verdict will be for the plaintiff. If they shall believe that only one of the defendants so hired and used the said horse, and by reason of his neglect or want of ordinary, reasonable and proper care, the said horse was injured, then they will find their verdict for the defendant whom they shall find not concerned in the said hiring and use of the said horse, and for the plaintiff, as against the other whom they shall find so negligent and wanting in reasonable and proper care.\u201d To this instruction of the Court the defendants excepted, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, they appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-5\">The cause was argued before Bartol, Goldsborougi-i and Cochran, J.</judges>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-6\"><em>William A.

Hambleton, and that they must find a verdict in his favor.\u201d The refusal of the Court to grant this instruction forms the subject of the first bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In actions for tort against several defendants, if, at the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s' case, there is no evidence against one of the defendants, he is entitled to be acquitted; \u201cso that all defendants, not fixed by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, are to be acquitted before any part of the defence is gone into.\u201d This, said Parke, J., was the unanimous opinion of all the judges. <em>Child vs. Chamberlain, </em>6 <em>Car. &amp; Payne, </em>213. (25 <em>Eng. C. L. R., </em>362.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Such practice is conformable to reason, and necessary for the furtherance of'justice; otherwise, it would be in the power of a plaintiff to deprive a defendant of the benefit of materia] and competent witnesses, by joining them in the action. See <em>Brown and others, vs. Howard, </em>14 <em>Johns., </em>119. <em>Van Deusen vs. Van Slyck, </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>225. <em>Beasley vs. Bradley, </em>2 <em>Swan\u2019s (Ten.) R., </em>180. But the rule on this subject, laid down in the books, as correctly stated by Oh. J. Thompson, in <em>Brown vs. Howard, </em>is, \u201cthat if there is any, even the slightest evidence against a party defendant, he cannot be discharged as a party, and received as a witness.\u201d And he adds, \u201cthat the want of evidence against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>a party, in order to entitle him to be a witness, should be so glaring and obvious as to afford strong grounds of belief that he was arbitrarily made a defendant to prevent his testimony.\u201d 14 <em>Johns. </em>R., 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Applying this rule to the case before us, avo are of opinion that the decision of the Court of Common Pleas, as \u2022stated in the first bill of exceptions, was correct. The evidence on the part of the plaintiff, showed that the horse was hired on the 4th day of July, by Francis H. Hambleton. On the next day both the defendants, riding together, stopped, on their Avay to the city of Baltimore, at the house \u2022of John 0. Price, in Baltimore county. The witness, Price, was unable to say which of them was driving. The horse at that time was foundered ; the witness advised <em>them </em>to go on, as he thought that with care the horse would be able to go to Baltimore, but offered to let <em>them </em>have another horse. On that evening both the defendants went to the livery stable of the plaintiff, and informed him where the horse then was. He was badly foundered, was placed in the hands of a veterinary surgeon, and died in a few days. From these facts, it was competent for the jury to infer that the contract of hiring, though made by one of the defendants, Avas in fact made on behalf of both ; or, if not, there Avas evidence from which the jury might find that both the defendants participated in the tortious act complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">After all the evidence was concluded, the defendants offered two prayers, which were refused ; but no exception being taken to their rejection by the Court, they are not properly before us for consideration. Exception was taken by the defendants to the instruction girmn by the Court to the jury, and their second bill of exceptions brings up that instruction for review. It will be found <em>ante page </em>45.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We find no error in this instruction. It is not objectionable, as urged, on the ground that the facts of the hiring and use of the horse Avere assumed by the Court. Nor was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>it erroneous in leaving to the jury to find that the defendants hired and used the horse. We have already said that there was evidence from which the jury might find that the horse was hired for and on behalf of \"both defendants, and was used by thorn. The chief objection made in the argument, was that there was no evidence whatever to go to the jury in proof of any \u201cill-usage or neglect on the part of the defendants, or the want of, ordinary, reasonable and proper care,\u201d in using the horse.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b57-8\">( Decided December 3rd, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We agree with the appellants\u2019 counsel, that the <em>onus </em>of proving want of diligence, and reasonable and proper care, was on the plaintiff. This is the general rule, as stated in <em>Story on Bailments, sec. </em>410 ; and there is nothing in the instruction to relieve the plaintiff below of that <em>onus. </em>But surely it cannot he said there was no evidence from which the jury might find a want of reasonable care in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The horse, when hired, was sound and in good condition; on the following evening, when returned, he was \u201cbadly foundered, hardly able to walk,\u201d and died in a few days. One of the witnesses stated that, in his opinion, the horse was foundered by \u201cbard driving.\u201d On this last point several witnesses testify that a horse may he foundered when properly and carefully used. But that was a question for the jury, properly left to them by tbe Court\u2019s instruction, and they found the fact against the appellants. We see no reason for disturbing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
