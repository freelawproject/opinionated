data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b247-13\">Under the Act of I860, ch. 326, directing the State\u2019s Attorneys of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>counties to institute proceedings in the name of the State, to ascertain whether the charter and corporate powers and franchises of an incorporated turnpike company \u201cought, by reason of non-user or abuser, to be declared to be vacated and annulled,\u201d no form of proceeding being prescribed by the said Act\u2014Held: that scire facias is the appropriate remedy whereby to attain the object of the Act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b248-5\">The Act of 1832, ch. 306, though prescribing the mode of proceeding by <em>scire facias, </em>created no new remedy, but was merely declaratory of the law as it then was, and its repeal by the Code took rio jurisdiction from the Courts of Common Law, but left that jurisdiction undisturbed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b248-6\">Where a <em>scire facias </em>setting forth the obligation of a defendant under an Act of incorporation, expressly charges a violation of that obligation, and the mode and manner in which it was violated, and, in the language of the Act, seeks \u201cto ascertain whether the charter and corporate powers and franchises of the defendant ought not, by reason of non-user <em>and abuser </em>of said powers and franchises, to be declared vacated and annulled\u2014Held: that such <em>scire

data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b248-7\">Where the 1st and 2nd pleas to the foregoing <em>scire facias </em>presented, in substance, the following defence: that because the State, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, had authorized the building of a railroad between the same <em>termini </em>as those of a turnpike company previously incorporated by her, and because the building of said railroad was followed by a serious loss of revenue by the turnpike company, therefore the said turnpike company is relieved from the obligations imposed upon it by its charter, and the State disabled from instituting and prosecuting proceedings to vacate and annul its charter, unless in violation of the Constitutions of the State of Maryland and the United States\u2014Held: that such pleas do not offer a legal defence to the allegations of the <em>scire facias, </em>if those allegations are sustained by competent evidence, sufficient to justify the jury in finding for the plaintiff, on the issue of <em>not guilty.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b248-8\">It may be true, as alleged in the 3rd plea to said <em>scire facias, </em>that the Act of 1838, ch. 54, recognized the corporate existence of the turnpike company, and admitted that its road was then maintained and kept in sufficiently good order and repair, and that during the whole of the year next preceding the issuing of said <em>scire facias, </em>it was kept in as good order and repair as when said Act was passed ; or, as is alleged in the 4th plea, that the State, by its Acts of Assembly and the conduct of its officers, admitted that until 1858, the said road was kept in sufficiently good order and repair, and that while in that condition, the company was enabled to effect, by agreement, a sale of stock, from the proceeds of which sale the said road was put in better order during the year next preceding the issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of said <em>scire facias, </em>than it was at the date of said agreement and sale'; yet it cannot bo successfully contended that the State, by its action set forth in said pleas, deprived itself of the right to institute the proceeding in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-5\">Notwithstanding the Act of 1833, recited in the 5th plea, and the privilege to charge tolls on steam-carriages, and the resolution passed by the turnpike company, to contract for the loan of money upon the security of the tolls, and though the said company may have applied all the tolls (as stated in the 7th plea) to the repair of the road, the State is not barred by the matters so pleaded, of its right to institute the proceedings in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-6\">A plea of limitations not filed within the time prescribed by the rules of Court, was properly stricken out by the Court below, and in the absence of the rule from the record, it must be presumed that the Court acted in conformity with its own rule.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-7\">The proceeding under the <em>scire facias, </em>in all its stages in this case, is essentially a civil action, and within the cognizance of the Superior Court of Baltimore city.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-8\">A witness, examined upon his <em>voire dire, </em>stated that he constantly used said turnpike road, sometimes commuting his toll by the year, and sometimes paying by the trip; and that if said road he condemned in the present proceeding, he will travel over it free of toll, because, in his opinion, it will then he a county road. Held : That the interest disclosed by the answer of the witness, is not such as to disqualify him; and that if it appears to the Court that a witness is not, though he thinks himself interested, he shall be sworn in chief.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-9\">The plaintiff offered in evidence to the jury the want of repair of the defendant\u2019s road, in parts thereof lying outside of the limits of the city of Baltimore, the defendant objecting to the offer\u2014Held: That the objection was not tenable, because the road was an unit, and the evidence should be co-extensive therewith. \u2019</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-10\">Where the evidence offered by the plaintiff and objected to by the defendants, was a want of repair of the defendants\u2019 road, \u201cexisting more than one year before the commencement of this prosecution,\u201d the Court held as follows: Conceding that a defence under Art. 57, sec. 10, of the Code, may bo availed of under the general issue, without being specially pleaded, (though not so deciding,) the provision of the Code referred to does not apply to the proceeding in this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-11\">Although the result of a decision on the <em>scire facias, </em>against the defendant, will involve a forfeiture of its franchise, it. cannot be said that this is a prosecution for a fine or forfeiture, within the meaning of the sec. and Art. of the Code referred to.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b249-12\">Questions propounded to a witness, on cress-examination, as to what were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the calculations upon which were based certain expectations of profit from a contemplated purchase of the road by a new company, in the event of its condemnation, are wholly irrelevant to the issue in the case, and inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-5\">The plaintiff having offered evidence tending to show the wilful neglect of the defendant to keep its road in repair, the defendant sought to rebut this evidence by proof of its inability to keep said road in repair, in consequence of certain legislation by the State\u2014Held : That such rebutting evidence was inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b250-6\">A prayer submitting to the jury to find whether the defendant had failed and neglected to maintain and keep its road, or parts thereof, and the bridges over the streams crossing the road, in good order and repair, and whether the same were maintained in the manner prescribed by the Act of 1812, eh. 326, and presenting to the jury the subject of inquiry, in conformity with the requirements of the Act, was properly granted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b250-7\">Appeal from tbe Superior Court of Baltimore city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-8\">This is a <em>scire </em>facias, issued by order of tbe appellee against tbe appellant, in pursuance of tbe Act of Assembly of 1860, cb. 326, entitled, \u201cAn Act to authorize and direct tbe State\u2019s Attorneys for Baltimore city, Baltimore county, Anne Arundel county, and Prince George\u2019s county, to institute proceedings to forfeit tbe charter\u201d of tbe appellants.

When we are told that, although section 26 of the charter gives a specific remedy, and there is no general statute giving any other; yet, nevertheless, the other side claim that a <em>scire facias </em>lies, alleging the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s franchise, (3 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig., tit. </em>27, <em>p. </em>250; 5 <em>Id., lit. </em>34, <em>p. </em>39,) we answer that this claim is inconsistent, not merely with the general rule, that the performance can be enforced only in the mode prescribed by the statute creating the obligation, but also with a rule no less general, that a <em>scire facias </em>is a writ founded on matter of record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>In England, the King may proceed by <em>scire facias </em>to annul letters patent for an office. <em>Rex vs. Eston, </em>2 <em>Dy., </em>198.

R., </em>244, cited in <em>Slee vs. Bloom, 5 Johns. C. R., </em>380, was delivered before the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench, in <em>The King vs. Amery, </em>2 <em>T. R., </em>515, was reversed by the Plouse of Lords, (2 <em>Broion\u2019s Par. Gas., </em>336,) and may not have been expressed quite so carefully as it would probably have been if delivered after that reversal; but it may well be satisfied by applying it to the case of letters patent granted by the King. There is no occasion to construe it\u2014nor should it be construed\u2014as in disregard of the distinction, well established in England, between the case of one claiming merely under such letters patent, and a corporation created by an Act of the Legislature. <em>Grant on Corp., </em>42, <em>note (h;) </em>also 301. If so construed, it would be nothing more than an <em>obiter dictum. </em>Upon no better foundation than this <em>dictum </em>rests the <em>dictum </em>of Buchanan, C. J., in the <em>Canal Co. vs. Railroad Co., </em>4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>121, unless, indeed, the Act of 1832 was in force at the time of his opinion, as it was at the time of the decisions in the <em>Regents of University vs. Williams, </em>9 <em>Id., </em>326, and in the <em>Board of Com. vs. The State, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>403. In the last case, by mutual consent of parties, it was agreed that a <em>scire facias </em>be issued to try the alleged forfeiture. In the present case, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>no such consent, and for the first time the Court of Appeals of Maryland is called on judicially to decide whether, without such consent, and without any such Act as that of 1882, a <em>scire facias </em>is the proper remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">The position that the Act of 1832 was \u201cdeclaratory only,\u201d and that without it the <em>quo warranto </em>was not, and the <em>scire facias </em>was, the proper remedy, is opposed to cases before cited, and to <em>Com. vs. James River Co., </em>2 <em>Va. Cas., </em>190. The further position, that in Maryland there arc \u201cno other corporations except those chartered by the Legislature,\u201d may not he entirely accurate, if it he true that there are general statutes under which there are records of corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">When, as in this caso, a corporation claims to he created hy a direct Act of the Legislature, it is the misfortune of the other side that there is in Maryland no general statute under which there may he prosecuted against it such a <em>scire facias </em>as lies at common law against one claiming under letters patent. To say that there ought to he such a statute, will not avail them; for, as this Court has said, \u201cit is the province of Courts of Justice to expound laws, and not to legislate; that, is a duty which belongs to a different department of the Government.\u201d <em>Mitchell vs. Mitchell, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>83, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">In the absence of any statute of Maryland changing the common law rule, it is for this Court to decide according thereto, and hold that a <em>scire facias </em>will not lie against a corporation aggregate to vacate or annul a charter created hy statute, there being in the Court from which the <em>scire facias </em>issues, no record on which to found it. <em>Bynner vs. Regina, </em>9 <em>Adol. &amp; El., </em>553, 58 <em>Eng. C. L.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\">Even supposing a <em>scire, facias </em>would lie, \u201cstill legal causes must be stated.\u201d \u201cFor every <em>imaginable </em>breach, the law does not design that the charter of a corporation must be revoked.\u201d <em>Board of Com. vs. The State, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>403. Here there is no breach at all as to the <em>bridges, </em>for the 13th section of the charter, giving power to erect bridges, is permissive only, not mandatory. <em>\u201cShall have power to,\u201d </em>means no more than <em>\u201cmay,\u201d </em>and in the charter this is plainly distinguished from <em>\u201cshall.\u201d </em>Moreover, as to the road itself, the plaintiff \u201cmust set out the substance of a good cause of forfeiture, in its essential circumstances of time, place and overt acts. That rule belongs to all pleading, and especially is it proper in reference to a proceeding, in its nature criminatory, to insist upon a forfeiture of valuable franchises, which cost a great outlay of capital.\u201d Ruffin, C. J., in <em>Atty. Gen. vs. Petersburg &amp; Roanoke R. R. Co., </em>6 <em>Iredell, </em>465. Here that rule is not complied with. As there was judgment for the defendants on the 7th, 8th and 10th replications in <em>The People vs. Bristol &amp; Rensselaerville T. P. Co., </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>231, so there should be judgment for the defendants here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">II. If, looking at the charter and allegations of the plaintiff, a <em>prima facie </em>case were shown for a <em>scire facias, </em>that remedy appears quite inappropriate, when the allegations in the 5th and 6th pleas are considered in connection with section 31 of the charter. The State must be held to have contracted with the company, in contemplation of such a demise as is authorized by that section, and the State cannot maintain this proceeding when it is not \u201cacting up to the terms of its charter, and complying with its obligations.\u201d Effect must be given to the demise to the full extent contemplated by the statute. The subject authorized to be granted, must be held to pass for the full term of seven years, and during the time for which the State has authorized the demise, it cannot, through any tribunal, impair that demise. How, then, on this <em>scire facias, </em>can there be a judgment of forfeiture? In England there are many turnpike Acts, giving power to mortgage the tolls. <em>Doe vs. Booth, </em>2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul., </em>219, <em>Doe vs. Lediard, </em>4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Barn. &amp; Adol., </em>137, 1 <em>New. &amp; Man., </em>683. <em>Doe vs. Penfold, </em>3 <em>Adol. &amp; El., N. S., </em>757, 43 <em>Eng. C. L. </em>Each mortgagee is held entitled, if not paid, to possess himself of the mortgaged premises. But we find in England no instance of a proceeding by <em>scire facias </em>or <em>quo warranto </em>under such circumstances. Seeing the number of turnpike Acts with mortgage powers, the absence of such proceedings there, is itself suggestive. It is thought there, that what is proper in such a case, is not a forfeiture of the charter, but obedience to its provisions; and tito remedy to procure such obedience, is very different from a <em>scire facias </em>or <em>quo warranto. Grant on Corp., </em>308. Buller, J., tells us that to enforce obedience to Acts of Parliament, a <em>mandamus </em>is the proper remedy. <em>Bull., N. P., </em>199. It was the remedy in <em>The King vs. Severn &amp; Wye Railway Co., 2 Barn, &amp; Ald., </em>646, and <em>The Queen vs. Bristol Dock, </em>2 <em>Adol. &amp; El., N. S., </em>64, 42 <em>Eng. C. L. </em>If there it was the proper remedy, <em>a fortiori, </em>no other remedy can be proper here, in view of the peculiar provision as to a demise of the tolls. Nor is this argument answered by imputing to us the doctrine \u201cthat the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force upon it a perpetuity of existence, contrary to public policy, and the nature and objects of its charter.\u201d On the contrary, what we contend for is quite consistent with <em>Mumma vs. The Potomac Co., </em>8 <em>Peters, </em>286, 287, as understood in <em>Bacon, &amp;c., vs. Robertson, &amp;c., </em>18 <em>How., </em>486, 487. We say that the doctrine of the latter case will he carried out in the best and most simple manner by holding, in accordance with the English authorities, that the <em>scire facias </em>is not to he maintained upon the case disclosed by these pleas, but the plaintiffs are to he left to resort to the writ of <em>mandamus. </em>On a <em>mandamus, </em>the Court would consider not one section merely, hut all the sections of the charter. Obedience to those sections of the charter on which the State relies, would he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>enforced so far as consistent with the rights arising tinder the section authorizing the demise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">III. The act \u201cto furnish ground of forfeiture,\u201d must be <em>wilful. </em>It must be something more than accidental negligence. Lewis, C. J., in <em>Erie &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. vs. Casey, </em>1 <em>Grant, </em>285. Woodward, J., considers there must be \u201csomething, more than involuntary misconduct, or mere technical wrongs-\u2014something that implies a high degree of turpitude\u2014a wilful malfeasance\u2014a species of misdemeanor,\u201d S. <em>C., </em>293; and Black, J., in delivering the opinion of the majority of the Court, lays down \u201cthat it must be <em>wilful, </em>that is, not involuntary.\u201d <em>S. C., </em>2 <em>Casey, </em>(26 <em>Penn.,) </em>319. Not only is this a rule of law, but in the <em>scire facias </em>it is alleged that the defendants have <em>wilfully </em>neglected and failed to keep their road in good order and repair. This allegation is well answered by the plea which states that, although the stockholders have not had what they are entitled to under the 19th, 20th, and 21st sections of the charter, yet \u201call of the tolls and duties received for passage upon and along said road, have been applied to maintain and keep said road in good order and repair,\u201d thereby showing that, if there has been such failure, it has not been the fault of the defendants, but, on their part, wholly involuntary. On <em>general </em>demurrer, the objection that the plea is an argumentative denial of not guilty, is of no avail, when the facts alleged in the plea, and admitted by the plaintiffs, show that, there has been no breach of duty. <em>Brass vs. Maitland, </em>6 <em>El. &amp; Bl., </em>486, 88 <em>Eng. C. L.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">IV. 'The allegation in the <em>scire facias </em>is still more conclusively answered by the 1st and 2nd pleas.

On this plea the cases of <em>The People vs. Kingston &amp; Middleton T. P. Co., </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>193, and <em>The People vs. Phoenix Bank, </em>24 <em>Wend., </em>432, cannot avail them. If they refer to particular Acts of Assembly, and argue that they do not amount to such admission, or if they argue that there was, in fact, no admission beyond what is contained in the Act of February 10th, 1839, the answer is, that any such matter of fact might have been inquired into on a replication, but is not open to inquiry on a demurrer. On the demurrer to the fourth plea, the Appellate Court must consider it to be matter of <em>fact, </em>that the <em>State of Maryland, </em>by Acts of its General Assembly, and conduct of its officers, <em>has admitted, </em>that until the \u2014 day of --, 1858, said turnpike road was maintained and kept in sufficiently good order and repair, and <em>has admitted </em>that until the time last mentioned, no sufficient cause existed for vacating and annulling its charter and corporate powers and franchises. And on this demurrer the Appellate Court must consider it to be also matter of <em>fact </em>that \u201cby sucli admissions stockholders in the said turnjuko company were, at the time last mentioned, enabled to make an agreement to sell, and other persons were, at the same time, induced to make an agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>inent to purchase, at a large price, to wit: the price of $16,000, 1,540 shares of stock in the said turnpike company, and pursuant to such agreement, to wit: on the 1st day of October 1858, the said price was paid, and the' said 1,540 shares of the stock transferred.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-5\">Now it is a rule of law, that \u201cwhere one, by his words or conduct, wilfully causes another to believe the existence of a certain state of things, and induces him. to act on that belief, so as to alter his own previous position, the former is concluded from averring against the latter a different state of things as existing at the same time.\u201d <em>Pickard vs. Sars, </em>&amp;c. 6 <em>Adol. </em>&amp; <em>El., </em>469, 33 <em>Eng.

What, then, is shown here?</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">The fourth plea expressly alleges, and the demurrer admits it to be matter of <em>fact, </em>\u201cthat the said transfer was made and the purchase money paid upon the faith of the admission by the State of Maryland, that while the said turnpike ro'ad was maintained and kept in as good order and repair as it was at the time of the agreement to purchase, the State of Maryland would consider that no sufficient cause existed for vacating and annulling the chartered and corporate powers and franchises. \u2019 \u2019 And then the fourth plea avers, and the demurrer thereto admits, \u201cthat soon after the said transfer, the said turnpike road was put in better order and repair, and during the whole of the year next preceding the commencement of this suit, the said turnpike road has been in better order and repair than it was at the time of the said agreement to purchase.\u201d Upon these facts, alleged by the defendants, and admitted by the plaintiff to be true, the language of Ruffin, C.

The second and fifth pleas also draw in question the construction of a clause of the Constitution of the United States, as well as of the Constitution of the State of Maryland; and the validity of authority exercised under the State of Maryland, on tlie ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. In connection with these pleas, it may he proper to refer to the Acts of 1828, ch. 139, sec. 20, and 1812, eh. 78, see. 11, and the case of <em>Erie &amp; N. E. R. R. Co. vs. Casey, </em>1 <em>Grant, </em>294, 295 and 298. Barely tlie right claimed by the defendants could be effectually set up against a statute of tlie State of Maryland, which, in plain and direct terms, either repealed our charter, or prohibited tolls from being received on the turnpike. Suppose, in the latter case, that after taking from the company the means of keeping its road in good order and repair, the State had, upon the ground of its not being kept in good order and repair, proceeded by <em>soire facias </em>to vacate and annul the charter, might wo not \u25a0well say that, under such circumstances, to forfeit the charter would he to impair the obligation of the contract, and take private property for public use, without just compensation? Could this defence he met by telling us Uhat such a term is never applied to the judgment of a Court over a subject matter within its jurisdiction?\u201d The answer is, that the obligation of the contract is impaired by a law of the State, when by means of an authority exercised under that law there is, without our consent, taken from us what we were entitled to under the contract. What the company was entitled to, under its contract with the State, is taken away, when the State, through one department of its government, deprives the company of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>means of keeping its road in order, and then, through another department, pronouiices judgment of forfeiture against the company for'not keeping it in order. Such a judgment would be forbid by the first principles of justice, as well as by the Constitution of Maryland and the Constitution of the United States. And if, after taking from the company, its whole income, the State would have no ground to complain of it for not keeping its road in order, neither has it any better ground of complaint, when it has taken from the company part of its income, and with the remainder the road cannot be kept in any better order than It now is. If the former would not be consistent with the Constitution of Maryland, or of the United States, neither would the latter. And the case is still stronger, when we look to the allegations as to the demise in the fifth plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">Nor will this doctrine require the existence of roads impassable and dangerous, or prevent better improvements, either by the State herself or by another company. <em>Boston Water Power vs. Boston &amp; Worcester Rail Road, </em>23 <em>Pick., </em>393. <em>Central Bridge Corp. vs. City of Lowell, </em>4 <em>Gray, </em>481. \u201cIf it come to this, that public faith is to be violated, or the benefit of such improvements lost,\u201d the Supreme Court of Connecticut has well said, \u201cbanish the improvement! The community will profit more by preserving public faith, than they will gain by its violation; although 'for a time it may seem otherwise.\u201d But the Court believes that neither course need bo taken. It thinks \u201cthere is a conservative principle by which the improvement may be made, and good faith preserved.

But tlie present is Arery different from those cases. In such a case as this\u2014a proceeding to enforce a forfeiture\u2014the plea, under tlie circumstances appearing on tlie record, should bo regarded as a plea to the merits. And even if the other pleas had been previously filed, the 8th should have been received under the broad power (given by the Acts of 1785, ch. 80, and of 1809, ch. 153, sec. 1, and extended by the Code) to allow amendments before verdict, so as to bring the merits fairly to trial.

Whether the proceeding be a prosecution or a suit, the Code (p. 397, Art. 57, sec. 10) requires it to be commenced within one year from the time of the offence.

But there is no such statute in Maryland; and hence decisions upon the common law rule, as to competency, are as pertinent in Maryland now, as they were in England before such statute. Moreover, the rule of <em>Hockley vs. Lamb </em>was affirmed in 1 Q-eo. I, in <em>Beeves vs. Symonds, </em>10 <em>Mod., </em>292. Again, in 10 Qeo.

Having answered that he had not, defend-ant's counsel proposed to ask witness whether plaintiff did not buy witness' real property at his instance. The Court below erred in not permitting the question to be put; and for this error the judgment was reversed. The Court said: \u201cIf the plaintiff did buy the defendant's property at his instance, it was a circumstance which might show that the Avitness was under an obligation to him, and this might have some effect on his evidence.

Moreover, the ansAver might have been material, not only as to credibility, but also as to competency.

So to hold, would he a forced construction of the thirteenth, and utterly inconsistent with the fourteenth section of the charter ; a duty is only prescribed with regard to the <em>road </em>itself.

The writ of <em>scire facias </em>is the a2&gt;propriate 23roceeding whereby to ascertain whether a corporation has forfeited its charter by <em>non-user </em>or <em>abuser </em>of its corporate powers and franchises. <em>Mandamus </em>will not answer, for there the object is to corcel a corporation <em>in esse </em>to 23erform some duty inrposed u2&gt;on it by its charter. Here the object of the proceeding is not to compel the corporation to repair its road and maintain it in good order, but to vacate and annul its charter, because of its failure to do so. <em>Quo warranto </em>is not the proper proceeding, because that properly applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>where there is a corporate body, <em>de facto </em>only, but which taires upon itself to act, though from some defect in its constitution or organization, it cannot legally exercise its powers. <em>Scire facias, </em>on the other hand, is resorted to to ascertain and enforce the forfeiture of a charter, when there is a legally existing body capable of acting, but which has abused its powers.

We have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>in this State no other corporations except those chartered by the Legislature, and if <em>scire facias </em>were not a proper form of proceeding to ascertain whether they have forfeited their charters, they would be entirely beyond the reach of judicial inquiry into their acts. All that is necessary in Maryland to authorize such a proceeding, is the assent of the Legislature. Suoh assent has been expressly given by the Act of 1860, ch. 326; and though it does not specify in terms the precise form of proceeding to be adopted, the practice and authorities all show that the one resorted to here is the only appropriate one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-4\">\u2022 II. The first six pleas do not profess to deny that the road is not in the condition of repair required by the charter. That is done by the ninth plea. But they set up, 1st, excuses for their failure to maintain it in good order; 2nd, a waiver on the part of the State of that breach of their charter; and 3rd, it is averred that because\u2019 of the hypothecation by the company of its tolls and revenues to parties who had become its creditors upon the faith of that hypothecation, it is exempted from all liability for that breach.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">A demurrer admits what is pleaded, provided it is well pleaded. <em>Neale vs. Clautice, </em>7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>378.

The first and second pleas present the proposition, that because the State, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, undertook to authorize the building of a railroad between the same termini as those of a turnpike company previously incorporated by her, and because the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of said railroad was followed by a loss of revenue by tlio turnpike company, therefore tlio turnpike company is relieved from tlio obligations imposed upon it by its charter, and the State is disabled from instituting and prosecuting an inquiry whether the company has complied with those obligations, or disregarded them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">We do not understand that the appellants question the right of the State to charter as many railroads or turnpikes as she sees tit, between any termini within her jurisdiction. Such right has been authoritatively settled, and is now universally conceded. <em>Charles River Bridge vs. Warren Bridge, </em>11 <em>Peters, </em>420. <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. R. Co. vs. Washington &amp; Balto.

In other words, the State cannot exercise one of her admitted rights in a case like this, without stripping herself of another right, which would otherwise be equally indisputable. We, on the contrary, maintain that the State cannot, by exercising one right, lose the benefit of another right; that the surrender by her of a great police power, is never to be presumed, and that the exercise of such a power cannot be attended with the restrictions with which the argument of the appellants would fetter her; that the contract entered into with her by the appellants was absolute; that their poverty, tlieir loss of revenue, and their consequent inability to keep their road in the repair required by the terms of their charter, (no matter whether that inability be indirectly caused by the act of the State, or be an inability <em>per se,) so </em>far from being an excuse for a failure to comply with the conditions of their oharter, is a cogent argument why their corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>rights and franchises should be vacated; that it is immaterial whether their failure be wilful or unintentional, the effect in either case is the same, the conditions of their contract are equally broken, the end of the institution is defeated, and the charter must cease to exist. The consequence of the argument, that an inability to keep the road in good order, owing to want of means, relieves the company from the duties imposed upon it by its charter, would be that the State would be obliged to permit the existence of roads impassable and even dangerous. Such, it may safely be asserted, is without support from authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\">In fact, the conclusion would seem to be inevitable, that if (as is conceded) the State can authorize the construction of a' railroad anywhere within her jurisdiction, such authority is absolute, and can impose upon her no restriction, no loss of any other of her sovereign rights and powers, and cannot operate to close the doors of her own Courts against her, when she wishes to inquire into the delinquencies of a corporation created by her, and responsible to her. <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, sec. </em>776. <em>People vs. Bristol Turnpike Co., </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>236. <em>Charles River Bridge vs. Warren Bridge, </em>11 Peters, 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">2nd. Assuming the road not to be in repair, and the excuses set up not sufficient, and their inability, even with the use of all their means, not a good defence to the action, the third and fourth pleas set forth facts going to show a waiver by the State of all causes of forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">An examination of them will disclose no sufficient ground for presuming a waiver. It is plain that such was not the intention of the Act of 1839, relied on in the third plea\u2014 and even if it were, it would not apply to and cover violations of the charter happening long afterwards. The rule is, that as against the State, no waiver can be 'presumed, unless a clear intention to rvaive the forfeiture, with a full knowledge\u2019 of the facts, can be gathered from the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tion relied on to prove such, intention. A simple \u2018recognition of the existence of the corporation is wholly insufficient. The Act of 1839 makes no allusion to the condition of the road, but merely directs the Court of Appeals, at its first term thereafter, to hear and determine the then pending appeal between the railroad company and the turnpike' company. It is unreasonable to infer that thereby the State designed to disable herself from the inquiry as to-whether the turnpike company had or had not complied' with the terms of its charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">Moreover, to maintain that such an act is a waiver of any cause of forfeiture happening up to th\u00e9tt time, and then to-argue that the charter cannot he vacated, because the road is now (as the plea states) in as good order as it was then, is to make the condition of the road at that time, and not the charter, the standard of the obligations of the appellants for all time. Such, of course, cannot he the true measure of their liability. It is to the charter, and the charter alone, that we must look for the character and extent of their rights and duties. Nor would it by any means follow, that because the State did not choose, in 1839, to enforce a forfeiture, she designed to declare that so long as the road was maintained as it then was, the company should be unmolested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The fourth plea insists that the conduct of the State, up to 1858, amounts to a waiver; that is, that the silence of the State, her failure to authorize proceedings against the company, is to he hold equivalent to a declaration that no cause of forfeiture liad occurred. This, obviously, does not come up to the terms of the rule we have stated above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">To give to the Act of 1839 the eonstriiction contended for by the appellants, would he to invest a collateral act, done, it may be, in ignorance of tlie true condition of the road, with a character which such an act, done by an individual, woul d not possess, and to hold the silence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>State from 1839 up to 1858, to be a conclusive argument against her present right to revoke franchises, when the conditions are forfeited on which those franchises were granted, would be to make the long continued clemency and forbearance of the State, the means of <em>destroying her </em>rights and restricting her powers. <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, sec. </em>777. 6 <em>Iredell, </em>470, <em>Atty.

The hypothecation of the tolls and revenues of the company to certai# creditors, is, in the fifth and sixth pleas, asserted to be a bar to the action. These pleas aver that it \\vould be taking private property for public uses, without just compensation, for the State to vacate the charter during the continuance of the contracts with the creditors named therein, and that therefore the action cannot be maintained. On the contrary, it will be contended for the appellee that Messrs. Robinson <em>&amp; </em>Savage must be held to have contracted with the company with a knowledge of the liability of the company to be subjected to such a proceeding as this. It is not a taking of private property for public uses without compensation, for a Court in a proceeding authorized by the State, to adjudge a forfeiture of a charter. Such a term is never applied to the judgment of a Court over a subject matter within its jurisdiction; it is in no sense a judicial act. Besides, it is always in the power of a corporation to prevent such a forfeiture, by acting up to- the terms of its charter, and complying with its obligations. The' destruction of its franchises is the legitimate fruit of a wilful and persistent or an unintentional failure to answer the ends of its creation; and if such destruction carries with it a loss to any parties who have incurred liabilities for the corporation, or become its creditors, it is a result with reference to which' they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>nrast be presumed to have contracted, and they cannot complain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-4\">If the existence of such a contract as is averred in the 5tli and 6th. pleas, can shield a corporation from the consequences of the abuser or non-user of its franchises, all it has to do in order to perpetuate itself, and to give itsel f a license to disregard and set at naught its obligations, is to involve itself in debt, and when called on to answer for its failure to perforin its corporate duties, its indebtedness will be received as a conclusive bar to any attempts to vacate its charter. The propriety of the action of the Court below in sustaining the demurrer to these pleas, is fully supported by the decision in <em>Mumma vs. The Potomac Company, </em>8 <em>Peters, </em>287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">The seventh plea also furnishes no reason why the charter should not be annulled. The Act of incorporation imposes certain obligations upon the appellants, and does not in any of its sections contemplate releasing them from such obligations, because of their failure to receive tolls sufficient to enable them to meet them. The charter was accepted by the appellants, and no good reason can be assigned why they should enjoy its benefits without bearing its burdens. If they cannot keep the road in repair, they have no right to exact tolls; if it yields no sufficient revenue, if the expenditure <em>oi all </em>its tolls is inadequate to maintain the road as the charter required it to be maintained, it surely is no hardship to deprive the appellants of that which is only a burthen to them.- For these reasons the demurrer to the first seven pleas was properly sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">III. The eighth plea was properly stricken out, for the reason assigned in the motion. <em>Cherry vs. Baker, </em>17 <em>Md. Rep., </em>75. Moreover, limitations will not run against the State. Art. 57, sec. 10, of the Code, relied on by the appellants, does not apply to a case like this. <em>People vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>Bristol Turnpike Co., </em>23 <em>Wend., </em>236. <em>Commonwealth vs. Wray, </em>3 <em>Dallas Penn.

The reasons already given under our first point, to show that <em>scire facias </em>is the proper remedy, are sufficient to maintain the correctness of this ruling. It is not a criminal proceeding, but is a civil case, instituted only by the State, and prosecuted as other civil suits are. The Act of Assembly authorizes the action to be begun, and being a civil suit, it is in the city of Baltimore, according to the Constitution, properly brought in the Superior Court. Constitution, Art. iv., secs. 10 and 11. <em>Commonwealth vs. Wray, </em>3 <em>Dallas Penn. Rep., </em>490. <em>Commonwealth vs. Comms. of Philad. Co., </em>1 <em>Sergt. &amp; Rawle, </em>335.

The Act of Assembly did not give the Court jurisdiction; it simply directed the proceeding to be instituted, and having been once instituted,, and the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>regularly upon trial, the question involved was <em>forfeiture vet non, </em>and the Court had a right to inquire into the condition of the road through its entire length and breadth. A franchise is an entirety. There is no reason why the inquiry should ho limited to the city of Baltimore. With quite as much reason might it he contended, that where the Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Railroad Company was in Court as defendant, it would be incompetent to prove anything occurring on the road beyond the city limits. Moreover, the Legislature never intended that the proceeding should he so restricted, for it authorized the suit to be brought in Anne Arundel county, through which no part of the road passes at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-5\">VII.

The evidence offered, in the 5th exception, and rejected by the Court, is simply evidence of the facts recited in the first, second and seventh pleas, admitted to he true by the demurrer, and held to he no bar to the action. Of course the evidence here offered and rejected, was properly rejected, if the ruling of the Court on the demurrers was correct. That such ruling was correct, we have already endeavored to establish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-8\">X. The sixth exception brings up the instruction given by the Court below. It is wholly free from error, for it merely puts to tlie jury, that if they find from the evidence that the defendants had failed to comply with the terms of the 13th section of their charter, then the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. It is regular in form and substance, places the facts before the jury for their decision, and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>mits no question to them which it was not their province to decide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\">XI. The motion in arrest was properly overruled. In support of the motion, it is argued that the writ of <em>scire facias </em>is invariably founded upon a record, and inasmuch as there is in this case no record, the action is not well taken. In reply to this, it is only necessary for us to refer to what has been already said under our 1st point. From that it will appear that the form of proceeding instituted is the only one which reaches the case. This view is fully borne out by the authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-6\">It is further argued, that the only jurisdiction which the Court has over the case, is conferred upon it by the Act of 1860, ch. 326; that this jurisdiction is limited, and must be strictly pursued; and that inasmuch as the terms of the Act only authorize \u201cthe State's Attorneys to institute proceedings in the name of the State, to ascertain whether the charter and corporate powers and franchises of said President, Managers and Company ought, by reason of nonuser or abuser of such powers or franchises, to be declared to be vacated and annulled,\u201d the duty of the Court is limited to the simple inquiry into that fact; that having done, that the power of the Court is exhausted, and it cannot proceed to enter up a judgment on the verdict; that the object of the proceeding was not intended to be an enforcement of a forfeiture, but merely an inquiry whether any cause of forfeiture existed, leaving the Legislature hereafter to declare what the result shall be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">In reply to this view, it will be contended for the appellee, that the Court below sits in virtue of its common law jurisdiction, to hear and adjudge this case, precisely as it would any other brought before it; that the only object of the Act of 1860, ch. 326, was to give the assent of the State to the institution of the proper proceedings, leaving them, of course, to be selected by her law officers, and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to confer a special limited jurisdiction upon the Court; that the power to hear necessarily involves the power to adjudge, and that the jury having found the issue of fact for the appellee, and the Court having decided the issues of law in her favor, it was bound to carry the case to its close, by rendering the judgment of <em>ouster. </em>The intention of the Legislature is, besides, made abundantly manifest by the title of the Act, wherein it is called an Act to authorize <em>\u201cproceedings to forfeit the charter\u201d </em>of the company. The judgment entered up is free from objection, and is similar to that entered up in writs of <em>scire facias </em>to repeal letters patent granted by the Crown in England. <em>Hindmarch on Letters Patent, </em>8 <em>Library of Law &amp; </em>Equity, 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">The case is one of importance and interest, and was carefully considered by the Court below. Eor a long series of years, as the pleadings show, the turnpike has been maintained by the appellants in such a condition as at times to amount to a positive nuisance; until at last the State, yielding to the petitions of her citizens, authorized this proceeding to be begun.</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">The defences are wholly technical, none of them go to the merits, nor does the record contain a particle of testimony to show that the appellants have not utterly failed to comply with their chartered obligations. It is submitted that the rulings of the Court below are wholly free from objection, and the judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-7\"><em>O.

Standing on the immutable principles of justice, it is impossible to forfeit this franchise. It being a case of forfeiture, there must be <em>moral </em>and <em>voluntary </em>culpability, and in this view this corporation is conceded to be innocent.

The Act does not say that a <em>scire facias </em>must issue, but \u2018 \u2018proceedings <em>to inquire,\u201d </em>not to judge. It means an <em>inquiry at bar, </em>as provided in certain contingencies in the Act of 1832, ch. 306. The Act of 1845, relating to the Frederick Female Seminary, prescribes the character of the judgment, and says what it shall be. The Act of 1860 stops short of this, and does not say what the judgment shall be. 9 <em>Gill, </em>403, dismisses the proceedings, because they were not of the character and in the mode described in the Act of Assembly. <em>Grant on Corp., </em>318, <em>t. p. in </em>80 <em>Law Lib. </em>The <em>dictwn </em>in the railroad case of C. J. Buchanan, is strictly <em>obiter. </em>It is a mere citation from <em>King vs. Pasmore, </em>a case upon a royal grant. The cases in 23 <em>Wend, </em>do not sustain the position for which they were cited. At page 233 of that authority, it is said that the duty must be designedly omitted, to justify the forfeiture. See, also, 1 <em>Grant on Corp., </em>295. <em>Erie &amp; N. E. Railroad vs. Casey, </em>26 <em>Penn.

But we do not rely on this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-7\">The question of limitations is in our favor. 2 <em>Saund., </em>62 c., <em>note </em>6.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Goldsborough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUPC\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">By the Act of 1812, ch. 78, the appellant was incorporated with authority to make a turnpike road from the District of Columbia to the city of Baltimore. By the 16th section of the Act, the company was authorized to charge the tolls specified therein, as a compensation for their expenditure in establishing the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It cannot he doubted that the Legislature, in making this grant, sought to promote the public convenience \"by the increased facility of travel incident to such an improvement; and the company, in accepting the grant, obliged itself to establish the road to effect this object, and keep the same in repair, in accordance with the requirements of the 18th section of the Act of incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">True it is, that by the 26th section, provision is made for the punishment of the company and its agents, if it shall neglect to keep the road in good and perfect repair; yet it is manifest that this provision was intended to apply only to-temporary neglect, and cannot ho held to deprive the State of its sovereign power to annul a grant, when the purposes of it have failed through the positive or negative act of the party upon which the grant was bestowed, and when by a proper, legal proceeding, the Court having jurisdiction shall determine, upon evidence, the issue-lor the State. In 23 <em>Wendell\u2019s R., </em>244, the Supreme Court of New York said: \u00a3\u00a3But it is a rule of almost universal application, that if a statute fixing a penalty for an offence, do not either expressly or by necessary implication, cut off the common law prosecution or punishment for the same of-fence, it shall be taken to intend merely a cumulative remedy. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">It was contended by the appellant, that the Legislature, in bestowing the power granted in the 81st section of the Act, could not, through any tribunal, impair a demise made in- view of the grant. This proposition is clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>erroneous. In 8 Peters, 287, it is laid down, that <em>\u201ca </em>corporation, by the very terras and nature of its political existence, is subject to dissolution by a surrender of its corporate franchises, and by a forfeiture of them for wilful mis-user and non-user. Every creditor must be presumed to understand the nature and incidents of such a body politic, and to contract with reference to them. And it would be a doctrine new in the law, that the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force upon it a perpetuity of existence contrary to public policy, and the nature and objects of its charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We have confined ourselves thus far to the consideration of the privileges, immunities and liabilities of the appellant under the Act of 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The company continued to enjoy these privileges and immunities, undisturbed, until the institution of the suit in this case, under the provisions of the Act of 1860, ch. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">By this Act, the State\u2019s Attorneys therein named were directed to institute proceedings in the name of the State against the appellant, to ascertain whether its charter and corporate powers and franchises ought, by reason of nonuser or abuser of those powers and franchises, to be declared vacated and annulled. To carry into effect this Act, a writ of <em>scire facias </em>was issued out of the Superior Court of Baltimore city, in the name of the State as plaintiff, against the appellant as defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">To this writ the appellant appeared and pleaded the nine ' pleas mentioned in the record. The appellee demurred to the first seven pleas, moved the Court that the eighth be stricken from the record, because it was not filed within the time required by the rules of Court, and joined issue on the ninth.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">The Court sustained the demurrer, and granted the plaintiff\u2019s application to strike out the 8th plea. The defendant then filed a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>alleging in its plea that tlie action instituted was a criminal information, and shoulcj have been instituted in the' Criminal Court of Baltimore city. -To this plea the plaintiff also demurred, and the Court sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">At the trial of the cause, upon the ninth plea of <em>not y witty, </em>the defendant toot six exceptions to the ruling of the Court. The first, to the admissibility of the evidence of Michael Waterman. The second, to the proposal of the plaintiff to offer evidence to show a want of repair of the defendant\u2019s road, in parts thereof lying outside of the limits of the city of Baltimore. The third, to the admissibility of evidence of a want of repair of defendant\u2019s road, existing more than a year before the commencement of this suit. The fourth, to the refusal of the Court to allow the defendant to ask the witness, Bittenlioiise, the questions stated in this exception. The fifth, to the refusal of tlio Court to allow the defendant to offer the evidence mentioned in this exception, to rebut the evidence offered by the plaintiff to maintain the issue on her part. And the sixth, to the plaintiff\u2019s prayer granted by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Upon the rendition of the verdict by the jury, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment; which motion the Court overruled, and entered judgment for the plaintiff, as stated in the record, including costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s demurrers, we deem it proper to say, that to the proposition of lav*' stated by the appellant, that a general demurrer to a plea confesses all the facts in the plea, must bo added the qualification that they be well pleaded. 7 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>372. 2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>143. Upon a general demurrer, the Court will render judgment against the party which commits the first error in pleading. 1 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>G., </em>471. 10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>27. And as the demurrers, according to the well established rule, carry us up to the first fault, wo must resort in this case to the <em>scire facias, to </em>see if there be a sufficient cause of action stated to entitle the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>appellee to recover. If so, our attention is next directed to tbe pleas, and we are to determine whether any or all of them are sufficient in law to entitle the appellant to judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In reference to the motion in arrest, we find that in the case of <em>Charlotte Hall School vs. Greenwell, </em>4 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>416, the Court said: \u201cThe motion in arrest of judgment serving, in some measure, the office of a demurrer, we must consider that the whole record was brought to the view of the Court. The motion in arrest of judgment must be governed by the principles of a demurrer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The plaintiff, relying on its demurrers to the defendant\u2019s pleas, and the defendant on its pleas and motion in arrest, so far as the pleadings are concerned, has induced us to set out the above ingredients of a general demurrer and motion in arrest, that we may correctly dispose of this case,, so far as it is affected by these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Does the <em>scire facias </em>in this case, being in the nature of an original action, set out a substantial cause of action, and with such certainty that the defendant is fully informed of the grounds on which the plaintiff seeks to recover? Our opinion is, that it does. The <em>scire facias </em>sets forth the obligation of the defendant under the Act of incorporation, and expressly charges a violation of this obligation, and the mode and manner in which it* was violated; and, in the language of the Act, seeks to ascertain whether the charter and corporate powers and franchises of the defendant ought not, by reason of <em>non-user and abuser </em>of said powers and franchises, to be declared vacated and annulled. The writ fully discloses the plaintiff\u2019s cause of complaint, and affords the defendant the opportunity of defense, of which it has availed itself fully in its several pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">We shall next consider whether the writ of <em>scire facias </em>was the appropriate remedy to obtain the object intended by the Act of 1860, eh. 326. Of this, we think there can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>be no doubt. In the case of <em>The Canal Co. vs. The Rail Road Co., 4 G. &amp; J., </em>121, 122 ; in the case of the <em>Regents of the University vs. Williams, </em>9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>425; and. in <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, </em>743, <em>3rd-American Edition; scire facias </em>was held the appropriate remedy in a case like this. But it was contended by the appellant, that as the Act of 1860 prescribed no form of proceeding, and the Act of 1832, ch. 306, which did prescribe the proceeding by <em>scire facias, </em>was repealed by the Code, the Superior Court, if it could entertain jurisdiction, was restricted to the ascertainment, \u201cwhether the charter and corporate powers and franchises of the President, Managers and Company <em>ought, </em>by reason of non-user or abuser of such powers and franchises, to be declared to bo vacated and annulled,\u201d without power to enter judgment upon the ascertainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The answer to this is, not only that the appellant prays <em>judgment </em>in every plea, if sufficient to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action, but it could not be deprived of its charter, except upon full hearing and <em>judicial </em>judgment of forfeiture. The theory of the appellant would render the Act of 1860 nugatory. And if the Legislature passed a law predicated upon the ascertainment, declaring the charter of the appellant annulled and forfeited, it might be exercising judicial functions contrary to the Constitution and Bill of Eights, about which, however, we need express no opinion. The Act of 1832, though prescribing the mode of proceeding by <em>scire facias, </em>created no new remedy, but was merely declaratory of the law as it then was, and its repeal hy the Code, took no jurisdiction from the Courts of Common Law, hut left that jurisdiction undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Testing the appellant\u2019s pleas hy the rule, that the facts set out in them must he well pleaded, we do not find that those in the first and second pleas offer a legal defence to the allegations charged in the appellee\u2019s writ of <em>scire facias, </em>if those allegations are sustained hy competent evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>clence to justify the jury in finding for the plaintiff on the issue of not guilty. The State, through its legislative department, may have impaired the value of -the franchise of the appellant by the Acts mentioned in those pleas, yet it was <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>It was a misfortune. See <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. vs. Washington &amp; Baltimore Turnpike Road, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>392. <em>Charles River Bridge vs. Warren Bridge, </em>11 <em>Peters, </em>420. The Acts of the Legislature by no means released the appellant from the fulfilment of its obligation unde}: its charter. It was still enjoying the privilege of charging tolls upon its road, and was bound to render a full equivalent to the community to justify the chatge,</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">As to the allegation in the <em>scire facias, </em>that the appellant failed to keep the bridges over the streams crossing the turnpike road in good order and repair, it is no sufficient answer to say, that the 13th section of the Act of 1812, giving power to erect bridges, was permissive only, and not mandatory. If the bridges were an essential part of the road, and the road was impassable without them, it was a part of appellant's duty, having erected them, to keep them in repair. See 23 <em>Wendell\u2019s Rep,, </em>259.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As to the third and fourth pleas, and the facts therein stated, it may be true that the Act referred to was passed, recognizing the corporate existence of the appellant, and admitting that the road was <em>then </em>maintained and kept in sufficiently good order and repair, and that during the whole of the year next preceding the commencement of this suit, it was kept in as good order and repair as it was when the Act of 1839 was passed; - or, as in the fourth plea, that the State, by the Acts of the Legislature, and the'conduct of its officers, admitted that until 1858, the turnpike road was kept in sufficiently good order, and while in that condition, was enabled to make the agreement stated in this plea, and in consequence of this agreement and sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>of stock, tlie road was put in better order during the year next preceding tlie commencement of this suit than it was at the time of the agreement to purchase. Yet it cannot be successfully \"contended that the State, though tacitly waiving, during the time above stated in <em>these </em>pleas, the enquiry into the condition of tlie road, deprived itself of the right to ascertain whether the appellant had been guilty of non-user or abuser of its franchises, and to direct that ascertainment to he made in view of the requirements of the Act of incorporation, which was the true and only standard of the appellant\u2019s responsibility. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Notwithstanding the Act of 1833, mentioned in the fifth plea, and the privilege to charge tolls on steam carriages, the resolution of the company to contract for tlie loan of money upon the security of the tolls, and though the appellant may have applied all tlie tolls (as stated in the seventh plea) to the repair of the road, yet the conclusion arrived at by this Court, in reference to the third and fourth pleas, is equally applicable to the fifth and seventh; and as to the sixth, our opinion of that may he found in our review of the rights of the appellant under the 31st section of the Act of 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">We are of opinion that the action of the Superior Court was right in striking out the eighth plea, if it was not filed within the time prescribed by the rule of Court, and we must presume that tlie Court acted in conformity with its own rule, in the absence of the rule from this record. See <em>Cherry vs. </em>Baker, 17 <em>Md. Rep., </em>75.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Whatever might be said of the conduct of tlie appellant, in delaying to file 'the tenth plea until the decision of the Court upon the demurrers and plea of limitations, we are at liberty to presume, that as the appellant joined issue on the demurrers, it took the chance of a judgment in its favor on some one or all of them, and we doubt not, if the Court had so decided, no exception would have been urged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>as to its jurisdiction. But apart from this, in our opinion, the proceeding under the <em>scire facias, </em>in all its stages, in this case, is essentially a civil action, and within the cognizance of the Superior Court, that Court having civil common law jurisdiction, under the Constitution of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We proceed to consider the appellant\u2019s several exceptions :</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">As to the first exception, the rule is, where evidence is offered to the Court, who are to determine whether the witness is interested, if it appear to the Court that he is not, though he thinks himself interested, he shall be sworn. See <em>6 H. &amp; J., </em>172. In view of this rule, we think that Wartman was a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The proposal to offer evidence to the jury, as mentioned in the second exception, could not be objected to by the appellant on the ground stated in this exception; because the road was an unit, and the evidence should be co-extensive with the limits of it, as established by the Act granting the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The third exception presents the question of limitation, and involves the construction of the 10th section of the 57th Article of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Conceding that a defence under that provision of the Code may be availed of under the general issue, without being specially pleaded, but without so deciding, still we are of opinion that the provision of the Code referred to, does not apply to a proceeding like this. Although the result of a decision on the <em>scire facias, </em>against the defendant, will involve a forfeiture of its franchise, yet it cannot be said that this is a suit for a fine or forfeiture, within the meaning of this section of the Code. A reference to the original Act of 1777, ch. 6, containing the same provisions as that found in the Code, will show the meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Code, and that the appellee was not confined to evidence of want of repair within the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The refusal of the Court to allow the appellant to ask the questions of the witness, Eittenhouse, stated in the fourth exception, was correct. The contemplated speculations of the witness, in the event of the' condemnation of the road, were wholly irrelevant to the issue before the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The appellee having offered evidence tending to show the wilful neglect of the appellant in keeping its road in repair, the appellant sought to rebut this evidence with the evidence stated in the fifth exception. Upon the objection of the appellee to this evidence, the Court sustained the objection, and we think correctly. All the facts relied on by the appellant, in this exception, might tend to prove an inability to keep the road in repair, and yet its responsibility was not removed by such inability. The objection made by the appellant to the charge of <em>wilful </em>neglect, in our opinion, is misconceived. The. term does not, in this case, imply criminality, but must be construed to mean permissive, voluntary neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">We see no objection to the ruling of the Court in granting the appellee\u2019s prayer mentioned in the sixth exception. The prayer submits to the jury to find whether the appellant had failed and neglected to maintain and keep its road, or parts thereof, and the bridges over the streams crossing the road, also in good order and repair, and whether the same were maintained in the manner prescribed by tfio Act of 1812, ch. 326, and incorporates info the prayer the very requirements of the Act as the subject of enquiry for the jury. We therefore sustain the ruling of the Superior Court upon all the exceptions taken by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Having approved of the action of the Court upon the demurrers, in which we regarded the applicability of the <em>scire facias </em>to this case, and also the sufficiency of the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>legations set out in the writ, we deem it unnecessary to say anything in reference to the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b304-7\">( Decided December 17th, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
