These notes bear date the 3rd of May 1854, each being for the sum of \u00a720, in favor of William Orumrine, and are payable, respectively, in eight days, six months and one year from date. The first of them states that it is given \u201cfor a good right and title of the property of Eve Steffey, wife of John Steffey;\u201d the second, that it is \u201cfor a good right and title of all claims ;\u201d and the third, that it is \u201cfor good right and title of the real property of Eve Steffey, wife of John Steffey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">Jacob Munche proved that William Orumrine had stated to him, since the death of Michael Steffey, that he had received \u00a7325, on account of the purchase money of said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">Both of said witnesses proved, on their cross-examination, that the land, at the date of the agreement, was about \u00a71200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-7\">In the decree passed after a hearing of the cause, the Court below (Nelson, J.) says : \u201cAlthough'the agreement for the sale of Mary Orumrine's moiety of the land, in the proceedings mentioned, to Michael Steffey, is obscurely drawn, yet the intention of both the vendors, William Orumrine and wife, is perfectly manifest, and the full purchase money having been paid, Orumrine and wife have no further interest in said land, and that Oecelia Steffey is clearly entitled to the whole of the land, subject to the dower right of her mother therein,\u201d and then goes on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>pass a decree for the sale of the same, for the purpose of distributing the whole proceeds between the said Cecelia and her mother, <em>\u201cto </em>the exclusion of the defendants, William Crumrine and Mary, his wife.\u201d From this decision and deeree the defendants, William Crumrine and Mary Crumrine, his wife, appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">The cause was argued before Bowie, C.

A decree for specific performance is not <em>ex debito justitice, </em>but rests in the sound discretion of the Court, to be given or refused, as the particular circumstances of each case may demand. The contract sought to be specifically executed, must be fair, just, reasonable, <em>bona fide, </em>mutual and certain in all its parts; and if any of these ingredients are wanting, or if there be a doubt upon any one of these points, it is enough to refuse relief. 6 <em>Gill, </em>66, <em>Dorsey vs. Wayman, et al. </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>59, <em>Wardsworth vs. Maning, et al. </em>4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>459, <em>Mundorf &amp; Wife, vs. Kilbourn, et al. </em>5 <em>Md.

Rep., </em>282, <em>Rider &amp; Trotter, vs. Gray, et al.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-8\">2nd. Testing this contract by these rules, it is not such an one as a Court of Equity will enforce. It is, to say the least of it, obscurely drawn, it is vague and uncertain, and doubtful in its terms, and from all the circumstances to which the Court can loot for its construction, it is doubtful whether the parties meant to contract to the extent of conveying the wife\u2019s inheritance. The rule is clear, that a contract \u2022'\u2018must be fair, just and reasonable in all its parts,\u201d and it must not appear doubtful, from the circumstances, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the party meant to contract to the extent to which he fe sought to be charged. 4 <em>Gill, </em>475. <em>Story\u2019s Eq. sec. </em>751. 2 <em>Sch. &amp; Lef., </em>554, <em>Harnet vs. Yielding. </em>10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>285, And in this connection it is to be noted, that though in equity, in a case in which it is clear that the parties understood their bargain, specific performance will not be refused on the mere ground of inadequacy of consideration, (9 Gill, 34,) yet such inadequacy may properly be looked to in construing the contract in reference to the extent to which the parties intended to contract. And especially is this the case where one of the contracting parties is a married woman, and it is- insisted that she has parted with her' whole inheritance in real estate for less than half its-value. The Court, in construing the contract, will look to all these matters\u2014the parties, the subject matter of the contract, the circumstances under which, and the consideration upon which, it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">3rd. But apart from all considerations in relation to the specific performance of contracts,- this contract upon its face, and upon the true construction thereof, cannot be regarded as a contract on the part of Mrs. Crumrine, to pass her' interest in the land. Looking to the whole contract, and giving to it,, and every part of it, due consideration, the true construction is, that it operates to pass only the interest which the husband had by virtue of his marital rights-in the land,</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">4th. This- contract cannot operate to bar the wife of her inheritance, because it is not executed according to the requirements of our Acts of Assembly. The Act of 1715, chapter 47, sec. 11, expressly provides, that a <em>feme covert </em>shall not be barred of her dower or inheritance, except by an acknowledgment of a deed, on separate and private examination, in the mode therein specified. See also the Acts of 1807\", ch. 52; 1808, ch. 73; 1825, ch. 58; and 1830, ch, 164. These laws prescribe the form and the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>mode in which a <em>feme covert </em>can be barred of her dower or inheritance. At common law she could make no contract, much less could she contract to convey her real estate. These Acts of Assembly provide a mode in which she can dispose of her inheritance and bar her dower. Their requirements are binding as well in Courts of Equity as of Law; they say she <em>\u201cshall not </em>othenuise\u201d be barred of her inheritance or dower. It may also be well argued that the provision of our Constitution, (Art. 3, sec. 28,) which declares that the Legislature \u2018 \u2018 shall pass laws necessary to protect the property of the wife from the debts of the husband during her life, and for securing the same to her issue after her death,\u201d restores the common law disability of the wife, so far as the conveyance or contract for the conveyance of her inheritance is concerned. At all events, it shows that no greater power of conveying or contracting to convey her real estate, was to be given her ; for instance, a law enabling her to convey by such a contract as this, would be against the plain provisions of the Constitution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-5\"><em>W. N. </em>Hayden, for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">The only questions in controversy in this case, arise on the contract in writing, and under seal, marked exhibit B. Will the Court decree a specific performance of that contract? It is fair, just, reasonable, <em>bona fide, </em>mutual and certain in all its parts. Although it is inartistically drawn, yet, in the language of the Judge who passed the decree below, \u201cthe intention of both the vendors, William Crumrine and Avife, is perfectly manifest.\u201d It is certain as to the parties, as to the consideration, as to the land sold, and as to the quantity of the estate to be conveyed. It is mutual; as, for the money paid by Steffey he Avas to have the land. It is fair, just and <em>bona fide. </em>It must be presumed to be so, until the contrary is proved. It is alleged, in the appellants\u2019 ansAver, to have been obtained by fraud; but there is no proof of it, and fraud is neArer presumed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>defendants are not required by tbe bill to answer undef oath, and tbe answer is not therefore evidence. Defensive averments in an answer, not responsive to the bill, unsupported by proof, are disregarded at the hearing. 3 <em>Gill, </em>408, <em>Fitzhugh vs. McPherson. </em>Every allegation in the answer, not responsive to the bill, but setting forth matter in avoidance, is denied by the general replication, and must be fully proved, or have no effect. 3 <em>Bl., </em>125, <em>Salmon vs. Claggett. Ibid., </em>551, <em>Neal vs. Hagthrop.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\">The only fact or circumstance proved, tending to show\" fraud, is that the property was worth more than Steffey agreed to pay for it; but mere inadequacy of consideration, is not a sufficient ground for refusing to decree the specific performance of a contract under seal, containing mutual stipulations. 5 <em>Gill, </em>287, <em>Young vs. Frost.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-6\">Cannot this contract bar the wife of her inheritance, although it is not executed according to the requirements of the Acts of Assembly of 1715-, ch. 47 ; 1807, ch. 52, <em>&amp;c.Y </em>These several Acts of Assembly were intended to provide1 a more easy, cheap and expeditious mode for .conveying the-wife\u2019s interest in land, than the forms and modes of the1 common law. 3 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>376, <em>Lawrence vs. Heister. </em>They\" were not intended to secure the wife\u2019s property more effectually than by the forms of the common law, viz: common! recovery and levying a fine. The private examination was observed in levying a. fine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\">Art. 3, sec- 38, of the Constitution, which declares that \u201cthe Legislature shall pass laws necessary to protect the property of the wife from the debts of the husband, during: her life, and for securing the same to her issue, after her death,\u201d imposes a dut}*- on the Legislature, but cannot operate oh the community until the Legislature shall have acted. This principle is settled in the case of <em>Bandel vs. Isaac, </em>13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>202. Indeed the Act of 1856, simplifying the forms of conveyance, and also the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the Code of Public General Laws, on the same subjeet, have dispensed with the private examination altogether. Why, then, should not a Court of Equity decree against <em>a </em>wife when she unites with her husband in the execution of an agreement in writing, under seal, and in her answer in the case admits the execution of the agreement? The \u00a1covenant in the agreement is in general terms, and shall be taken to mean a legal title in fee. 8 <em>Gill, </em>337, <em>Owings vs. Baldwin. A. </em>Court of Equity would decree a specific performance of this covenant, especially as it was made by \u25a0the wife\u2019s consent. 1 <em>Roper on Prop., </em>532, and eases there -cited. 3 <em>Peere Wms., </em>187, <em>Hall vs. Hardy. </em>5 <em>Vin. Abr., </em>547, <em>Barrington vs. Horn. </em>7 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>475, <em>Withers vs. Pinchard. Ibid., </em>474, <em>Morris vs. Stephenson. </em>Also, 1 <em>Br. on Husb. and Wife, </em>183, where all the cases on this subject are collected and commented on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">The only cases in the Maryland books that appear to have any bearing on the main question involved in this cause, are those of 11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>469, <em>Johns vs. Reardon, </em>and 3 <em>Gill, </em>327, <em>Chaney vs. </em>Tipton, By a careful analysis of these cases, it will appear that the question involved in the ease at bar, was not decided in either of them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b19-6\">Bowie, C, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">In form, the bill filed by the complainants (the appellees) En this case, was an application to the Circuit Court of Carroll county, as a Court of Equity, for the sale of certain real estate, the proceeds to be invested for the benefit of a minor heir,, one of the complainants. In effect, however, it is a bill for the specific performance of a supposed contract of sale, made by the appellants with Michael Steffey, (the father of one of the appellees,) through whom, and by which contract, she claimed the whole proceeds of the land, subject to the widow\u2019s dower. The lands were held by Michael Steffey and Mary Crumrine, the children and heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u25a0qf Eve Steffey, deceased, in undivided moieties, in fee. On tbe 3rd of May 1854, tbe supposed contract was entered into -in these: words :</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">\u25a0 \u201c Agreed, on the 3rd of May 1854, between Michael Steffey, of Carroll county, State of Maryland, of the one part, and William Crumrine, of the said county and State, of the other part: William Crumrine has bargained and sold unto Michael Steffey all his rights, claims and interest for three hundred dollars, and did receive on it two hundred dollars, and the said William Crumrine is to give the said Michael \u25a0Steffey a good right and title, and the said Michael Steffey is to pay, half yearly, twenty dollars, until the hundred dollars is paid. Given under our hands and seals, this 3rd \u25a0day of March 1854, it being all his and her rights, titles and claims of Eve Steffey, wife of John Steffey. Being the seal property of sixty-seven acres and a half. As witness \u25a0our hands and seals, this 3rd of May 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">William Crumrine, (Seal.)</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">Mart. Crumrine, (Seal.)</p>\n<p id=\"Al7\">Signed, sealed and delivered in presence <em>of\u2014EU Euhrman.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">The obligors in the contract, are husband and wife ; the property to be disposed of, the inheritance of the latter, in fee, with the marital rights of the former. As far as the interest and rights of the husband are involved, the contract, aided by the parol proof, and connected with the notes given for the purchase money, (two of which indicate with certainty the subject of the contract,) is sufficient to convey, in equity, William Crumrine\u2019s estate, whatever it may be, although it does not appear, from the testimony, whether he is merely entitled <em>jure mariti, </em>or has a tenancy by the curtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">As to Mary Crumrine\u2019s interest, the question is not what she.intended to sell or convey, but whether she is competent, in law or equity, to bind her estate or interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>land, in the mode adopted. The date of the contract brings it within the operation of the Acts of Assembly prescribing the manner in which married women shall be barred of their inheritance or dower at that time. The Acts of 1715, ch. 47, sec. 11; 1807, ch. 52; 1808, eh. 73; 1825, ch. 58; 1830, ch. 164, control such conveyances. These Acts have \"been heretofore rigidly construed, for the protection of that large and interesting class of society. The cases in which - they have been applied, are too numerous and familiar to require citation. The more recent leading decisions are <em>Chaney &amp; Wife, vs. Tipton, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>327, and <em>Johns vs. Reardon, </em>11 <em>Md. Rep., </em>465. According to these authorities, the instrument signed hy Crumrine and wife is inoperative and void, as to the latter. The decree must therefore be reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b21-6\">(Decided October 17th, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">\n<em>Decree reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
