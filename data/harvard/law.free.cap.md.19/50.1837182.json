The said draft or bill of exchange was given for the purchase money of a negro wo-man, the slave of the appellee, sold by him to-said Wright.The declaration contained but one count, upon- said draft or bill. The pleas were, that the plaintiff had agreed to <em>sell and deliver </em>said slave to the said Wright,, but had faiD ed to do so-; and- had warranted said slave to be sound at the date of said' sale, but that she Was not sound at that time. The replication denied that the plaintiff had agreed, to deliver said slave to the purchaser, but' alleged that she had in fact been delivered to- him; and' also denied that the plaintiff had warranted said slave to be sound at the date of said sale, but alleged that she was in fact sound at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u00a1that time.

F. Chambers, </em>for the appellant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">1. No delivery in fact or in law was made out by the plaintiff\u2019s statement in his prayer, as was necessary to enable the plaintiff to recover. The woman was in possession of Wallace, the hirer. Finley was as much the agent of the vendor as of the vendee, and the delivery was not made by or to him. Wallace never consummated the do-&gt;livery, and never made a step towards doing so. In all those cases of sales, there must be an actual or constructive delivery, and each case must depend on its own peculiar circumstances. It is a mixed, question of <em>law </em>and <em>fact. </em>6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>10, <em>Atwell vs. Miller. </em>Here the jury have been deprived of the right of passing upon the facts, and the prayer makes it altogether a matter of law. No case can be found such as this, where constructive delivery has boon similarly made, except where the vendor was in possession of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-7\">2. The Court below was in error, in not requiring the jury to believe at the least that the woman was alive and sound, when the order of the appellee was delivered to Wallace. The receipt contains a warranty that the negro woman was sound up to the day of its*execution. It cannot be said that the words <em>Uup to this day,\u201d </em>mean any particular hour of the day; the warranty of soundness must at least have extended up to the time of the delivery, and the death occurred before the delivery could be made. The facts show that there was an agreement to deliver. The negro was not in jail, nor in the custody of a <em>general bailee, </em>for the benefit of the <em>vendors. </em>The vendor must do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\u2022all that by the contract is required of him, <em>Story on Sales, sec. </em>300.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-5\"><em>John M.

The acceptance of the bill of exchange by the appellee in payment of the negro woman, his receipt for the .same, his order to Wallace, and the acceptance of said order by Wright,\u2014fhe negro woman at the time being a .slave for life and sound,\u2014operated as a perfect and valid .sale, by which the title right of the property and possession passed to the purchaser, <em>Franklin &amp; Armfield, vs. Long, 7 G. &amp; J., </em>407. <em>Clary vs. Frayer, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>399, <em>Hall &amp; Long, vs. Richardson, </em>16 <em>Md.

The acceptance of the bill of exchange destroyed the lien. <em>Hall &amp; Loney, vs. Richardson, </em>16 <em>Md. Rep., </em>396. The legal title being in the purchaser, drew after it the constructive possession, which in law operated as a constructive delivery. <em>Clary vs. Frayer, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>420. \u25a0Questions of delivery are questions of law to be found by the jury upon the facts in the ease. <em>Clarke's adm\u2019r, vs. Marriott\u2019s adm\u2019r, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>331.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b62-10\">Bartol, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKS\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">This action was brought by the appellee, on a bill of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>change, or draft drawn by Clinton Wright, and accepted by the appellant; being for the stipulated price of a negro' woman sold to Wright by the appellee. The case comes' before us, upon an exception taken to the prayer of the plaintiff below, which was granted by the Circuit Court, (see <em>ante </em>53.) In the argument of the cause in this Court, the appellant has contended that \u201cno delivery in fact or in law, was made out by the plaintiff\u2019s statement in his prayer, as was necessary to entitle him to recover.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b63-9\">(Decided December 3rd, 1862.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In passing upon the case, however, it is. unnecessary for us to decide whether the facts enumerated in the prayer, constituted a delivery of the property sold, actual or constructive, to the purchaser. We are clearly of opinion that the receipt and the order on Wallace, which was accepted by the purchaser, operated as a valid sale of the property, by which the title and right of possession passed to him, and it was thereafter at his risk. On this point the case i\u00bb within the principles decided in <em>Franklin &amp; Armfield, vs. </em>Long, <em>7 G. &amp; J., </em>407, 411; <em>Clary vs. Frayer, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>399; and <em>Hall &amp; </em>Loney, <em>vs. Richardson, </em>16 <em>Md. Rep., </em>369.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In <em>Franklin &amp; Armfield, vs. Long, </em>the Court say, \u201cBut a delivery of goods actually sold, is not necessary to pass the right to the vendee, if there be any thing given in earnest, or a payment of the whole, or a part of the purchase money, or a sufficient note or memorandum in writing of the bargain.\u201d 8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>418,</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The same case is an express authority for the proposition, that the warranty of soundness in this case was complied with, if the negro woman was alive and sound <em>\u201cat the time of the execution cmd delivery of the order' and receipt,\u2019f </em>and therefore the second objection made by the appellant to the prayer, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Finding no error in the ruling of the Circuit Court, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
