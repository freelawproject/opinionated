The Common Pleas had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, it not having been taken within sixty days from rendition of judgment. The judgment was actually rendered October 14th, 1859. The petition of Kelsey <em>&amp; </em>Gray, praying an appeal, was not filed until December 15th, 1859. The number of days intervening between these dates, exclusive of October 14th, were sixty-two. The appeal of Kelsey &amp; Gray, therefore, was taken within <em>sixty-tioo </em>days after October 14th, 1859, and not within <em>sixty </em>days, as required by Act of 1852, ch. 239, sec. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-8\">II.

No appeal was taken in this case at all; because the Act of 1852, ch. 239, sec. 3, requires an entry of appeal to be made by the magistrate <em>on his docket, </em>and this must be done before the justice goes out of office. The Legislature has not provided for this case, and it alone can.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-10\">IY.

In the capacity in which the Court of Common Pleas was acting, it was competent for it, in the absence of any Act of Assembly upon the point, to determine what was a sufficient indication of a purpose to appeal, and a sufficient order of appeal; and from its discretion and decision thus exercised, no appeal will lie. <em>Wall\u2019s Ex\u2019r vs. Wall, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>79. <em>Boteler &amp; Belt, vs. The State, use of Chew, </em>7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">3rd. The decision of the Court of Common Pleas was clearly right in holding the aj&gt;peal to have been taken within sixty clays. The defendants had decided upon their course, and done what they could to render that decision effective. It wms no fault of theirs, that the appeal had not been entered on the docket of the justice, and to deprive them of the right of appeal, because it was not so entered, would have been to punish them, because tlie justice bad gone out of office or absented himself from his place of business. This case differs essentially from those in which this Court has entertained jurisdiction to reverse a judgment, when the Court below had exercised a power not conferred upon it. In this case, the Court of Common Pleas clearly had jurisdiction, if the appeal had been taken in time, and whether it had been so taken, was a question for that Court to decide; and from its decision on the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>no appeal will lie to this Court. It is a question regulated by no Act of Assembly, but left entirely to the sound judicial discretion of the Court. The decision of the justice was clearly wrong, and of the Court of-Common Pleas clearly right, on the issue raised in the cause. The promissory note sued on was barred by the statute of limitations, and the attempt to prove a recognition of the debt, or a new promise, signally failed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-5\">Bowie, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AoX\">delivered the opinion of this Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The appellants obtained a judgment before a justice of the peace of Baltimore city, on the 14th October 1859, against the appellees, for $40.50 debt, and $1.55 costs. After the rendition of the judgment, the magistrate by whom the judgment was rendered, within thirty days after its rendition, and before an appeal was taken or notified to him, went out of office. The appellees, before sixty days had expired, authorized their attorney to appeal to the -Court of Common Pleas. A petition was filed with the \u25a0clerk of that Court, praying an appeal, on the 15th December 1859.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The appellants moved the Court to dismiss the appeal, because not taken within sixty days after the rendition of the judgment; which motion the Court overruled, and proceeded to try the cause, and reversed the judgment of the justice of the peace. From which judgment of the \u25a0Court of Common Pleas, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Appeals from judgments of justices of the peace, in cases of small debts, to the County Courts, Circuit Courts, (and in the city of Baltimore to the Court of Common Pleas,) have been given by successive Acts of Legislature, the last of which, before the Code, regulating the appeal in this case, was that of 1852. Oh. 239, sec. 3, of that Act, provides: \u201cThat from all judgments of justices of the peace, the party or parties aggrieved thereby, shall be at liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>tv appeal to the Court having jurisdiction </em>to hear such appeal at any time within sixty clays after the rendition of any such judgment. * * * * And on the party signifying his intention to appeal, it shall be the duty of the justice of the peace to enter the appeal, with the elate thereof, upon his docket, and to transmit the papers in the cause to the clerk of the proper Court.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">It is admitted in the record, that the magistrate by whom the judgment was rendered, had gone out of office after the judgment, but within thirty days, after, and before the appeal was taken; that the appellees called at the magistrate\u2019s office to take an appeal, and failing to see him, subsequently, before sixty days had expired, authorized their attorney to appeal; and that the papers in the cause liad not been actually brought into the Court of Common Pleas within sixty days after the rendition of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The petition for appeal was filed on the 15th December 1859. The appellants contend, the Court of Common Pleas having \u201cunwarrantably assumed jurisdiction,\u201d this Court may review and reverse their judgment. On the other hand, the appellees move to dismiss the appeal, because, among other reasons, the Acts of Assembly of this State have given no appeal to this Court from, decisions of the Circuit Courts, or Court of Common Pleas, acting on appeals from judgments of justices of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Nearly the same authorities are referred to and relied on by the opposing counsel to maintain their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The jurisdiction of Circuit Courts and the Court of Common Pleas, is original and appellate. In the exercise of the latter, their decisions are final, unless provision is made by law for a further appeal. Their judgments, although erroneous, are nevertheless conclusive, because within their jurisdiction: \u201cthey are not unwarrantably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>.pronounced and subject to' be reviewed and reversed in this \u25a0Court,\u201d because they are not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The case of <em>Webster, et al., vs. Cockey, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>93, in which the position relied on by the appellant occurs, viz.: '\u201cBut if no such rig\u2019ht of appeal be conferred on the County '\u25a0Court, then its judgments, unwarrantably pronounced on the subject, may, by appeal, bo reviewed and reversed in \u2022this Court,\u201d when properly analyzed and considered with 'the case of the <em>State vs. Mister, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>17, in which \u2022it is interpreted and construed, bears no other construction than that we have adopted. That was an appeal from the .judgment of Baltimore County Court, reversing the judgment of the commissioners of Baltimore county, in relation to a certain road. A motion was made to dismiss the appeal, on which the learned Judge who delivered the opinion of the Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThe jurisdiction conferred by the General Assembly of Maryland, on the commissioners of Baltimore county, in regard to the opening and shutting up of public roads, is a special limited jurisdiction, and from their decisions upon the subject, no appeal will lie to the County Court, unless provided for by legislative enactment. If such right of appeal from the proceedings of the commissioners be given by the Legislature to the County Court, its judgments thereon cannot be reviewed on appeal to this Court, unless the latter right of appeal be in like manner given. But if no such right of <em>appeal be </em>conferred on the County Court, then its judgments, unwarrantably pronounced on the subject, may, by appeal, be reviewed and reversed in this Court. In deciding therefore on the motion to dismiss the <em>appeal before us, our </em>inquiries are confined to two facts, to wit, has the Legislature vested in the County Court an appellate power over the proceedings of the commissioners, in opening and shutting up jrablic roads in Baltimore county, and from the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>such appellate powers given to tlie County Court, lias tlie Tlegislature given a right of appeal to this tribunal?\u201d Finding- the first power Lad been given to the County Court, and the latter bad not been given to this Court, be concludes: \u201cAssuming the existence, of the appellate power exerted by tlie County Court in this case, for the correction of any <em>errors or irregularities in its proceedings under the same, </em>no appeal lies to this Court. In tlie <em>State vs. Mister, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., 17, this </em>Court said: \u201cAn objection lias been made in argument in reference to the appeal to the Circuit Court, because the judgment of tbo magistrate was against several parties, whereas the appeal was taken by only one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\u201cAdmitting (but without deciding) the appeal ought to have been taken by all the parties, the failure to do so was an error which should have been taken advantage of in the Circuit Court. The decision in 9 Gill, 92, was, that where no right of appeal had boon conferred on the County Court, then i Its judgments unwarrantably pronounced on the same subject, might, by appeal, be reviewed and reversed in this Court / \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">\u201cY/e have said, the Circuit Court has jurisdiction in appeals on judgments condemning tlie vessels, we therefore' cannot revise any <em>erroneous </em>decision made hj\" that Court in reference to such cases. For in the case just referred to, it is most distinctly announced, that if the right of appeal was given by the Legislature to the County Court, its judgments thereon could not be reversed on appeal to this-Court, unless the latter right of appeal was also given.\u201d The distinction is here broadly preserved, between the' right of appeal (or appellate jurisdiction) and an appeal rightfully exorcised; whore the former exists, the decision upon the regularity or irregularity of the latter, must be final. The obscurity (if any) in the case just cited, arises from the use of the words \u201cright of appeal\u201d in the sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>of appellate power, but whether interpreted by itself, or in connection with other cases, it is obvious it is not to be confounded with a rightful appeal, but wherever appellate jurisdiction exists, the Court invested with it, has the authority to decide whether it is properly exercised, from which decision there is no appeal, unless otherwise provided by law.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b466-6\">(Decided March 26th, 1863.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><em>Appeal dismissed. </em>.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
