(the \u201cYacht Club\u201d), appeal the decision by the Circuit Court of Cecil County that Tome\u2019s Landing Corporation (\u201cTLC\u201d), which is not a party to this appeal, had transferred certain expansion rights to appellee/cross-appellant West Development Company (\u201cWest\u201d). West appeals the circuit court\u2019s ruling that TLC had not transferred its riparian rights to West but, rather, that Conrad/Dommel had obtained those riparian rights by virtue of a foreclosure sale. Appellants pose five questions on appeal, which we have consolidated: <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Did West acquire the expansion rights which TLC had acquired pursuant to the Marina Cross Operating Agreement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Appellee poses one question on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">Did the circuit court err in awarding the riparian rights to Conrad/Dommel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling with respect to the issue of riparian rights, but we vacate the order with respect to the expansion rights and remand this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">This case concerns property located along the Susquehanna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>River in Port Deposit, Maryland, shown as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">All of the lots and parcels were originally owned by United Dominion Industries, Inc. (\u201cUDI\u201d), TLC\u2019s parent corporation. We have constructed a chart of the various transfers that took place and have attached it to this opinion as an Appendix. On May 20, 1993, a document entitled Declaration of Easements, Covenants and Restrictions was filed in the land records for Cecil County. In a separate document filed that same day, UDI deeded to TLC Lots 3 and 4 and Parcel A in fee simple. That deed contains the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">WITNESSETH, that in consideration of the sum of One Dollar ($1.00) (no actual consideration), Grantor [UDI] does hereby grant and convey unto Grantee [TLCJ, its successors and assigns, that certain lot[s] of ground situate and lying in Port Deposit, Maryland (the \u201cProperty\u201d) and more specifically described as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">Those parcels of land shown as Lots 3 and 4 and Parcel A on a final [recorded] subdivision plat of Tome\u2019s Landing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">SUBJECT TO all matters shown on the Plat, the terms and provisions of a Declaration of Easements, Covenants and Restrictions recorded or intended to be recorded immediately prior hereto, and all other matters of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACb\">TOGETHER WITH the buildings and improvements thereon and all rights, roads, alleys, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages to the same belonging or appertaining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">AND FURTHERMORE TOGETHER WITH all riparian rights and privileges belonging or appertaining to the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>property shown on the Plat and known as Lots 1 through 10, including Lot 6A, Parcel A-l, Parcel A, Parcel B, Parcel C and Parcel D, including all riparian rights and privileges in and to the waters of the Susquehanna River.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said property unto and to the use of the Grantee, its successors and assigns, in fee simple.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">On May 26, 1998, TLC filed a Declaration Establishing a Plan for Condominium Ownership (the \u201ccondominium plan\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That same day, TLC granted \u201ccertain limited riparian rights\u201d to the Yacht Club and entered into a Marina Cross Operating Agreement (\u201cMCOA\u201d) with the Yacht Club and the Condominium. The riparian rights agreement read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">The Developer [TLC] wishes to grant and convey to the [Yacht] Club certain limited riparian rights to construct, place and maintain certain breakwater piers, debris barrier piers and/or other marginal walkway piers and gangplanks.

The MCOA called for the creation of a \u201cClub Marina,\u201d for non-unit owners who purchased a club membership. The MCOA also granted cross-easements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">(a) The [Yacht] Club, the Condominium and the Developer [TLC] hereby grant and convey to each other an easement, right and/or privilege (the \u201ceasement\u201d), in common with each other, for the full non-exclusive beneficial use and enjoyment of the Marinas, as they presently exist and as they hereafter may be enlarged, substituted and modified, for the purpose of enabling each other to (i) develop, maintain, repair and replace the Docks, Breakwater Piers and Piers or any other portions of the Club Marina Facilities or the Condominium Marina Facilities; (ii) install, maintain, repair, and replace, extend and enjoy the use and benefit of any and all pipes, ducts, wires, piers, utilities and such other facilities and easements owned by the [Yacht] Club or the Condominium, as may be reasonably necessary for the full use and enjoyment by the [Yacht] Club, the Condominium or the Developer of the Marinas;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (iii) fully use and enjoy the Expansion Rights, and (iv) enter upon, in or over any portion of the Marinas for the purpose of ingress and egress by an Occupant to his or her Slip, and for the purpose of using and enjoying any rights, including Expansion Rights, set forth in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">(b) The [Yacht] Club, the Developer and the Condominium hereby grant, convey and assign to each other the right to use in common all riparian rights and privileges held, owned or enjoyed by any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">(c) The [Yacht] Club, the Developer and the Condominium hereby grant, convey and assign to each other the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to use in common all permits, licenses and other rights held by any of them which are reasonably necessary for the full use and enjoyment of the Marinas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The provisions of the MCOA relative to the \u201cexpansion rights\u201d at issue in this case read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>Expansion Rights.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">(a) <em>Statement of Intent. </em>It is intended that the Club Marina Facilities and the Condominium Marina Facilities from time to time may be expanded by the Developer [TLC], in order, <em>inter alia, </em>to accommodate additional Members and/or Unit Owners, to build fuel piers or transient slip piers, or for other purposes. Such expansion may take place by extension of existing Piers, by the construction of new Piers, or otherwise. Additionally, the Developer may locate Condominium Marina Facilities at the end of any existing Pier that has Club Marina Facilities, and vice-versa. The Developer may also construct new Piers, Docks or Slips which are not a part of the Marinas in the riparian areas adjacent to or part of the Marinas (herein, the \u201cDeveloper Marina\u201d). If constructed, the Developer Marina shall be entitled to the benefit of all easements granted in this Agreement. The Developer Marina may include <em>inter alia, </em>the Pier intended for transient slips which may be shown on the Marina Plat, and any other pier constructed as part of, or inside of (landward of) breakwater piers or debris barriers owned by the [Yacht] Club, the Condominium or the Developer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">The Developer and the other parties wish to provide for the efficient, integrated operation of all Slips, Piers and Docks in the Marinas, the Developer Marina and in the waters adjacent thereto, and to ensure the Developer the maximum rights to enjoy and develop such Slips, Piers and Docks (such rights as provided in this Agreement are herein collectively referred to as the \u201cExpansion Rights\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">(b) <em>Right to Build, Enlarge and Extend the Marinas or any Developer Marina. </em>The Developer shall have the easement, right and privilege from time to time to extend or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>build any Pier of the Marinas or the Developer Marina; to attach additional Piers, Slips and Docks to any Pier existing from time to time in order to expand the Marinas or to construct a Developer Marina; to increase the number of Piers, Slips and Docks in any portion of the Marinas or the Developer Marina; to use existing or install new utility lines, cables, pipes or the like in the Marinas or in the Developer Marina, and to repair, replace or reconstruct same from time to time, to the extent reasonably necessary or beneficial for the full use and enjoyment of the Expansion Rights, provided, however, that any utilities consumed by the Developer, its successor or assigns in the Developer Marina shall be paid for by the Developer in accordance with any meter or submeter or on any other equitable bases of allocating utility use; and to use any portion of the Marinas for access to Slips, Docks and Piers of the [Yacht] Club, the Condominium and/or of the Developer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">(c) <em>Repair of Damages; No Interference, Etc. </em>In the event the Developer shall exercise any of its Expansion Rights from time to time, Developer shall (a) perform all work in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with all federal, state and local laws, rules and ordinances, (b) promptly repair any damage done to the Marinas, and (c) not impair in any material way access to or enjoyment of any Slip by any Unit Owner or Member.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On September 27, 1993, UDI deeded Lot 5 to TLC in fee simple. Lot 2 was deeded to TLC in fee simple on June 15, 1994. On September 29, 1994, a number of deeds were executed by UDI in furtherance of TLC\u2019s development plan. TLC gained fee simple ownership in Lots 1, 7, 8, and 9, and Parcels A-l, B, C, and D in one deed, and Lot 6A was separately deeded to it. Lot 10 was deeded to Tome\u2019s Main Street, Inc., and Lot 6 was deeded to Tome\u2019s Commerce Center, Inc. According to those deeds, both Tome\u2019s Main Street, Inc., and Tome\u2019s Commerce Center, Inc. were subsidiaries of UDI. As a result of the conveyances to date, the ownership of the subject property was divided among TLC, Tome\u2019s Main Street, Inc., and Tome\u2019s Commerce Center, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Two deeds of trust were entered into on September 29, 1994.

The complaint focused on West\u2019s claim to the riparian rights and sought a declaration that Conrad/Dommel was the owner of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Conrad/Dommel filed a motion for summary judgment on the day it filed its complaint.

West successfully filed a motion to strike that ruling, and, on September 20, 2000, it filed its own motion for summary judgment, in which it raised the issue of the expansion rights for the first time. A hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>motions for summary judgment took place on November 15, 2000, after which both Conrad/Dommel and West filed proposed findings and conclusions. On January 17, 2001, the court issued an oral ruling granting summary judgment in favor of Conrad/Dommel on the issue of the riparian rights. The court then set the matter for a further hearing on the issue of the expansion rights.

A hearing was held on the issue of expansion rights on June 22, 2001, at which time the court issued an oral ruling granting summary judgment in favor of West.

West argues that the riparian rights had been severed by virtue of the May 20, 1993, deed from UDI to TLC and that they were never rejoined with the land from which they were severed. It also contends that, even if they had not been severed or were rejoined, TLC demonstrated an intention to reserve the riparian rights from the Columbia deed of trust. This, West maintains, rebuts the presumption that the riparian rights were included in that deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Conrad/Dommel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> argues that the trial court\u2019s decision was correct in that the language of the Columbia deed of trust was unambiguous. It also points out that well-established principles of law, namely the requirement that a grantor expressly reserve rights it does not wish to convey, are controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The circuit court made the following ruling with respect to the riparian rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">Starting in reverse order, the document [that is the] subject of this controversy, the primary document, is the foreclosure deed from the trustees of Columbia to [Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>rad/Dommel] in this case dated September 11, 1998. And, of course, the primary concern, the primary conflict is what exactly did this deed transfer to [Conrad/Dommel]. Specifically, was the transferred document sufficient to transfer the riparian rights in question here. The transfer, of course, was in fee simple and the transfer clause and this deed included the word \u201cwater.\u201d Whereas, the previous deed of trust I believe the date was September 29th of 1994, the deed of trust from Tomes to Columbia, specifically as I recall included the word \u201cwater.\u201d By September the 29th of 1994 the transfer[or] or grantor, Tomes,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had acquired all of the parcels in question with the exception of Lot No. 10 which had been transferred from UDI to DMS. We go back to the transfer prior to that which is referred to in both memoranda as the first deed dated May 20th of 1993, the transfer being from UDI to Tomes, and that particular deed in the paragraph following the \u201cTogether with\u201d paragraph specifically recites, \u201cand, furthermore, together with all riparian rights and privileges belonging to or obtaining to the real property shown on the plat known as then Lots 1 through 10, including Lots 6, 8, Parcel A(l) and Parcels A, B, C and D,\u201d that particular deed is totally clear and unambiguous and there is absolutely no question in my mind that there was any type of reservation in the grantor at all reserving the riparian rights in question. Thereafter, when Tomes entered into the deed of trust in Columbia, Columbia in my opinion was the recipient of everything that Tomes had owned and, thus, was the recipient of the riparian rights. I do not find in any manner whatsoever that these riparian rights were ever severed, so the issue of severance and merger thereafter is really not an issue before me today. And the clear and unambiguous language of the deed of trust to Columbia, the language in that deed is cleai- and unambiguous as far as I\u2019m concerned as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>and did, in fact, include the riparian rights in question here today. And, again, there was no exclusion or reservation in Tomes or any third party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-4\">Among other things as noted by [Conrad/Dommel] in the memoranda on page 12, paragraph three, and I adopt this as part of my opinion, the language of the Columbia Bank deed of trust encumbers the riparian rights because of, A, the Maryland code which provides, \u201cA deed passes to the grantee the whole interest and estate of the grantor and the land mentioned in the deed unless in limitation or reservation shows by implication or otherwise a different intent.\u201d Intent, as I indicated previously, is not a matter of consideration here because, again, the language in the documents to which I\u2019m referring to in my opinion is clear and unambiguous and I make that as a finding of fact as well as law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">A. Riparian Rights in General</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cGenerally, a riparian landowner is \u2018defined as one who owns land bordering upon, bounded by, fronting upon, abutting or adjacent and contiguous to and in contact with a body of water, such as a river, bay, or running stream.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirby v. Hook, </em>347 Md. 380, 389, 701 A.2d 397 (1997) (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Maryland Marine Mfg. Co., </em>316 Md. 491, 493 n. 1, 560 A.2d 32, 33 n. 1 (1989)). The riparian land in this case consists of Parcels A-1, A, B, C, and D, and part of Lot 10.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">The term \u201criparian rights\u201d indicates a bundle of rights that turn on the physical relationship of a body of water to the land abutting it. These rights are significantly different from each other in many respects, and yet they share a common name just as riparian landowners attempt to share the common benefits that arise from adjacency to defined bodies of water. This bundle includes at least the following rights:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">(i) of access to the water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">(ii) to build a wharf or pier into the water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">(iii) to use the water without transforming it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>(iv) to consume the water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">(v) to accretions (alluvium); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">(vi) to own the subsoil of nonnavigable streams and other \u201cprivate\u201d waters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">1 Waters and Water Rights, \u00a7 6.01(a) at 6-3, 6-4 (Robert E.

Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Conrad/Dommel argues that, to the extent any riparian rights were severed by the May 20, 1993 deed, those rights were reunified with the land at the time the Columbia deed of trust was executed. West argues that there was no reunification because intermediate estates had been created, making reunification impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">West frames its argument in terms of a merger of two estates. \u201c \u2018Under the doctrine of merger of estates in land, a lesser estate is merged into a greater estate whenever both estates meet in the same person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>352 Md. 645, 657, 724 A.2d 34 (1999) (quoting <em>Appeal of Gregor, </em>156 Pa.Cmwlth. 418, 627 A.2d 308, 310 (1993)). Conrad/Dommel argues that riparian rights do not constitute a \u201cseparate,\u201d or \u201clesser\u201d estate, like, for example, easements, and therefore that the doctrine of merger is inapplicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cMerger is the absorption of one estate in another, and takes place usually when a greater estate and a less coincide and meet in one and the same person without any intermediate estate, whereby the less is immediately merged or absorbed in the greater.

In 1 <em>Tiffany\u2019s Real Property </em>(1st Ed.), 76, the learned author states: \u201cIt is a well-settled rule of law that whenever a greater estate and a less coincide and meet in one and the same person, without any intermediate estate, the less is immediately annihilated, or, in the law phrase, it is said to be \u2018merged,\u2019 that is, sunk or drowned in the greater.\u201d (Citing 2 <em>Blackstone\u2019s Comm. </em>177, and 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>99.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Bosley v.

This argument is necessarily limited to the riparian rights associated with Parcel A, because the limited riparian rights assigned in the deed emanated from Parcel A, as shown in Exhibit A to the deed:</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Keeping the foregoing in mind, West argues that, because some of the riparian rights were assigned to the Yacht Club, an intermediate estate was created. Consequently, West argues, the riparian rights to Parcel A and the fast land of Parcel A could not be merged by virtue of the Columbia deed of trust. As stated above, however, riparian rights can be broken down into a number of different property rights. Waters at \u00a7 6.02 at 6-3, 6-4. Accordingly, a grantor may assign some of these riparian rights and retain the rest. The assignment of some of these rights, as occurred here, would not necessarily defeat a subsequent merger. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In reviewing the language of the deed of limited riparian rights, which allows for the construction, placement, and maintenance of \u201ccertain breakwater piers, debris barrier piers and/or other marginal walkway piers and gangplanks!,]\u201d we are persuaded that the entire bundle of riparian rights associated with Parcel A was not deeded from TLC to the Yacht Club, and therefore, they were not severed from the fast land in the same manner that the riparian rights were severed from the fast land by virtue of the May 20, 1993 deed from UDI to TLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Rather, the deed of limited riparian rights appears to be more in the nature of an easement, and we note that Section 2 of the MCOA, which is set forth in the Factual and Procedural Background, <em>supra, </em>actually does grant cross-easements to TLC, the Yacht Club, and the Condominium for the same purposes that TLC granted the limited riparian rights to the Yacht Club and Condominium. West itself recognizes in its brief that the rights granted by the deed were \u201creciprocal.\u201d The assignment of limited riparian rights and the cross-easements might cloud TLC\u2019s title, but they do not create an \u201cintermediate estate\u201d in those retained riparian rights that would prevent Columbia Bank or Conrad/Dommel from owning Parcel A and its associated riparian rights. Moreover, West has no assignment of whatever riparian rights that the Yacht Club acquired from TLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">West focuses on the Columbia and UDI deeds of trust to ascertain the status of the riparian rights, but we do not believe those deeds alone answer the question. We begin, instead, with the deeds transferring Parcels A-l, B, C, and D, and Lot 10, starting with the Parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Parcels A-l, B, C, and D were conveyed from UDI to TLC on September 29, 1994. Because at the time of that conveyance TLC already owned the riparian rights attendant to the newly acquired fast land, the riparian land was reunified with the riparian rights in TLC. In <em>Forbes, </em>197 S.E.2d at 199, the Virginia Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>As we have said, riparian rights related to the lots named in the deed were severed riparian rights, and so long as they remain severed, they confer no right under the statute to fill. However, when a property interest severed by an antecedent owner from the fee is acquired by a subsequent owner of the limited fee, the two property interests merge to revive the fee simple absolute. As we said in <em>Newsome v. Scott, </em>200 Va. 833, 840, 108 S.E.2d 369, 374 (1959), quoting from <em>Garland v. Pamplin, et als., </em>73 Va. 305, 315 (1879):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABs\">\u201c \u2018Merger is described as the annihilation of one estate in another. It takes place usually when a greater estate and a less coincide and meet in one and the same person, without any intermediate estate, whereby the less is immediately merged\u2014that is, sunk or drowned in the greater. To this result, it is necessary that the two estates should be in one and the same person, at one and the same time, in one and the same right. 2 Bouv. Institutes, 375, No.1989; 2 Minor\u2019s Inst.

Applying the doctrine of merger, the two property interests merged, the fee simple absolute was revived[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\"><em>See also Warfield v.

These rights were reunited with the riparian land on September 29, 1994, when UDI conveyed Parcels A-l, B, C, and D to TLC in fee simple.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Likewise, the riparian rights to Lot 10 were conveyed from UDI to TLC on May 20, 1993. Lot 10 was conveyed by UDI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>to Tome\u2019s Main Street, Inc. on September 29, 1994. The riparian rights to Lot 10, however, were owned by TLC at that point. There was no reunification as a result of that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">D. Columbia Deed of Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We now turn to the effect of the Columbia deed of trust. West argues that a deed of trust is not like a deed, and that the trustees gain only a security interest but no rights in the land. We believe that this argument reflects a misunderstanding of what occurs when a deed of trust is executed in Maryland.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">Mortgages and deeds of trust differ as to form, parties and the rights and duties created. There are two parties to a mortgage; the mortgagor (debtor) and the mortgagee (creditor). Deeds of trust are three party instruments; the grantor (debtor), the grantee (trustee) and the cestui que trust or beneficiary (creditor). When a mortgage is used, the property is conveyed directly to the creditor. With a deed of trust, the property is conveyed to a third party in trust for the benefit of the creditor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Russell R. Reno, Jr., Wilbur E. (Pete) Simmons, Jr., and Kevin L. Shepherd, Maryland Real Estate Forms, \u00a7 3.1 at 275 (1983) (hereinafter \u201cReno\u201d) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">West is correct that deeds of trust that evidence a security interest are treated as mortgages. <em>Darnestown Valley-WHM Ltd. P\u2019shp. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp., </em>102 Md.App. 577, 584, 650 A.2d 1365 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>338 Md. 201, 657 A.2d 795 (1995). Under either a mortgage or a deed of trust, however, the mortgagee or trustee actually receives legal title to the property. <em>Darnestown, </em>102 Md.App. at 586, 650 A.2d 1365 (quoting <em>Williams v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>167 Md. 499, 503-04, 175 A. 331 (1934)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">Maryland is a \u201ctitle\u201d state. This means that a mortgage or deed of trust ... will transfer legal title to the mortgagee or grantee, rather than creating a lien on the title of the mortgagor or the grantor, as is the case in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201clien\u201d state. The interest of the mortgagor is called the equity of redemption; <em>i.e., </em>the equitable right of the debtor, on payment of the debt, to compel a reconveyance of the mortgaged property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Reno, \u00a7 3.1 at 276 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The fact that a merger had occurred and TLC owned both the riparian rights and riparian land, <em>i.e., </em>Parcels Al and A D, and Tome\u2019s Main Street owned Lot 10,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> does not mean that TLC and Tome\u2019s Main Street actually transferred those rights in the Columbia deed of trust. Indeed, West argues that the intent of the parties not to transfer the riparian rights was clearly evidenced by the language of the Columbia deed of trust when read together with the UDI deed of trust. Conrad/Dommel contends that, because riparian rights are assumed to pass with the land and no express reservation was contained in the deed, they became part of the trust property to which Columbia Bank obtained legal title, and that Columbia Bank could convey the riparian rights to Conrad/Dommel after foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As we stated above, \u201ca conveyance of land bordering on navigable water presumptively carries with it the grantor\u2019s riparian rights.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>265 Md. at 162, 288 A.2d 333. <em>See also </em>Waters, \u00a7 7.04(a)(1) (footnote omitted). In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals found that the presumption was rebutted because of express reservations contained in the deed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">One commentator has written that, with respect to the creation of reservations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">at least two general rules can be identified: (1) the language of a deed must be sufficiently definite and clear in order to create a reservation or exception. (2) In accord with the general rule that deeds are to be construed against the grantor, exceptions and reseivations are to be narrowly construed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>9 Thompson on Real Property, Second Thomas Edition, at \u00a7 82.09(c)(2) 597-98 (Davis A. Thomas ed., 1999) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Conceding that there was no express reservation in the Columbia Deed of Trust, West argues that TLC\u2019s intent to reserve riparian rights was clear, because neither riparian rights nor \u201cwaters\u201d were expressly mentioned and conveyed in the Columbia Deed of Trust as they were in the UDI Deed of Trust. West appears to argue that the two deeds of trust should be read together in order to give effect to the intent of the parties, but it must be remembered that Columbia Bank was not a party to the UDI Deed of Trust and that the deed first in time governs. <em>See Laborde v. Mayeux, </em>95 So.2d 743, 745 (La.Ct.App.1957); <em>Will v. Piper, </em>184 Pa.Super. 313, 134 A.2d 41, 44 (1957); <em>Groeneveld v. Camano Blue Point Oyster Co., </em>196 Wash. 54, 81 P.2d 826, 829 (1938); 1 Black. Com., chap. 23, \u00a7 6 p. 381. Moreover, a \u201cdistinction has been maintained in the law between implied grants and implied reservations.\u201d <em>Dalton v. Real Estate &amp; Improvement Co., </em>201 Md. 34, 47, 92 A.2d 585 (1952). Whereas a grant may be implied, a reservation generally will not be implied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Here, the riparian rights to Parcels Al and A-D granted to TLC were reunified with the riparian lands from which they came prior to the execution of the Columbia deed of trust. Because Tome\u2019s Main Street, owner of Lot 10, and TLC, owner of the riparian rights to Lot 10, were both parties to the Columbia deed of trust, the riparian rights were reunited with Lot 10 and conveyed to Conrad/Dommel pursuant to the foreclosure deed. Absent an express reservation, it is presumed as a matter of law that the riparian rights were conveyed in the deeds of trust. Nothing in the Columbia deed of trust rebuts that presumption and persuades us that TLC reserved or intended to reserve the riparian rights.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Because TLC could only lawfully convey to West what it possessed, <em>Worthington v. Lee, </em>61 Md. 530, 539 (1884), West acquired no riparian rights from TLC. Subject to an entry of a declaration of the rights of the parties, as explained <em>supra, </em>we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>V. EXPANSION RIGHTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The expansion rights at issue are those set forth in the MCOA, reproduced <em>supra. </em>During the proceedings below, West spoke of \u201cdeveloper rights,\u201d but it is undisputed that the developer rights as defined in the condominium plan<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> were assigned to Columbia Bank on July 8, 1998, apparently as a prelude to the foreclosure action. The rights at issue are those contained in the MCOA and will be referred to as \u201cexpansion rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">A request for a declaratory judgment on the ownership and performance of the expansion rights was not specifically requested in Conrad/Dommel\u2019s complaint. In its complaint, Conrad/Dommel requested, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>A. That this Honorable Court determine and adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to the West Deed and the Riparian Rights associated with the Trust Land; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">B. That this Honorable Court find and declare that Conrad/Dommel is the fee simple owner of all of the Riparian Rights associated with the Trust Land; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">C. That this Honorable Court find and declare that the West Deed does not confer upon the Defendants any interest in any of the Riparian Rights associated with the Trust Land[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Conrad/Dommel, of course, sought a declaration that West had no rights of any kind. The fact that a party may not be entitled to the declaration requested does not mean that the rights, whatever they may be determined to be, are not to be declared. <em>See Bushey, </em>362 Md. at 651, 766 A.2d 598. Moreover, in its answer, West made a general request for a declaration of its rights arising out of the October 5,1999 deed and assignment from TLC. West requested that the court \u201cissue a declaration in favor of Defendant, including the retention of those rights, title and interest conveyed to it pursuant to the deed dated October 5, 1999.\u201d The motions and memoranda filed in conjunction with the summary judgment requests showed that Conrad/Dommel made specific allegations and requested a specific declaration, in the event the court found the transfer of the expansion rights to have occurred, concerning West\u2019s ability to exercise its rights. Conrad/Dommel requested the following action, in pertinent part, beginning with paragraph C of the Conclusion section of its Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">C. That this Honorable Court find and declare that Conrad/Dommel is the owner of all of the Expansion Rights associated with the Trust Land; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">D. That this Honorable Court find and declare that the [MCOA] does not confer upon the Defendant any Expansion Rights associated with the Trust Land; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>E. That, in the alternative, this Honorable court find and declare that the only Expansion Rights to which the Defendant is entitled are those adjacent to Parcels A-l and A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">G. That this Honorable Court order any and such further legal and equitable relief as the nature of the Plaintiffs cause may require or allow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Although the trial court did not believe the issue was before it, it seems clear that there was the need for a declaration of the operational effect of any rights West was deemed to have acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Appellants argue that the expansion rights were assigned to Columbia Bank as part of the Assignment of Developer Rights, but that, even if they had been conveyed to West, the description of the rights was so uncertain as to render the instrument void. Appellants also make a number of alternative arguments in their brief, which we will discuss later. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">THE COURT: Now it could very well be, as posed by [Conrad/Dommel], that by virtue of not having any riparian rights, if indeed West has the development rights, they\u2019re pretty much worthless because nothing can be done or exercised; I am seeing from [Conrad/Dommel\u2019s] perspective. Apparently and practically that must not be the case because they\u2019re fighting hard to retain what has been conveyed to them. That\u2019s not a consideration for me anyhow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">As far as the cross-operating agreement itself, and the fact that it could be construed as being vague, uncertain in its terms, this was an agreement, multi-party agreement, and apparently when it was drawn up, I presume by predecessors in interest, it was clear enough for them; whereby, they all became signatories to these agreements; and of course the present parties stand in the shoes of the predecessors. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a valid complaint from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>them\u2014from [Conrad/Dommel] at the present time to vitiate this agreement because of vagueness and uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">Of course, as far as the purpose of the agreement, and the intent, the integration, et cetera, et cetera, that\u2019s not before me today either. The only thing I have to decide is whether or not there was, in fact, a valid conveyance of the developer rights, which now are with West, according to the argument, with [West].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Now unlike the other aspects of this case, this particular aspect troubles me the least. No question that the marina cross-operating agreement was executed on May 26, 1993. Beyond any question in my mind pursuant to that agreement [T]LC was the developer. Now the developer rights as to the condominium were transferred by an assignment of developer\u2019s rights dated July 8, 1998, and then again on September 11, 1998 by the same sort of document unto [Conrad/Dommel].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">And of course by virtue of receiving these documents of transfer [Conrad/Dommel] acknowledged that they are\u2014 that is the proper method of making that type of a transfer of that type of a right; and further an admission and recognition that such right did not pass by virtue of foreclosure deed, they recognized this to be a proper vehicle in which to transfer the same type of document\u2014well, maybe not the same type of document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">In any event, pursuant to the exact wording of the marina cross-operating document it\u2019s clear from that document that the developer rights as to the marina were transferred to West Development; and therefore, [West\u2019s] motion for summary judgment as to development rights is granted. [Conrad/Dommel\u2019s] motion in that regard, of course, is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">A. Assignment to Columbia Bank</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Appellants argue on appeal, apparently for the first time, that Columbia Bank acquired all of the expansion rights by virtue of either the separate assignment of developer\u2019s rights or the Columbia deed of trust. West argues that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>appellants failed to raise these arguments below, they have waived their right to raise them. Because the issue is basically one of document interpretation, which in the first instance is generally a question of law and, thus, subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal, we will address the issue. <em>Lerner Corp. v. Three Winthrop Props., Inc., </em>124 Md.App. 679, 684, 723 A.2d 560 (1999). Our interpretation begins with the plain meaning of the contractual language. If the language is clear, we need look no further. <em>County Comm\u2019rs v. St. Charles Assocs., </em>366 Md. 426, 444, 784 A.2d 545 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\n<em>1. The Assignment of Developer\u2019s Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ab6\">The language of the July 8,1998, Assignment of Developer\u2019s Rights to Columbia Bank stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">WHEREAS, Assignor is the \u201cDeveloper\u201d under that certain Declaration Establishing a Plan for Condominium Ownership for Tome\u2019s Landing, a condominium, and recorded among the Land Records of Cecil County ..., and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM\">WHEREAS, Assignor desires to grant and assign to Assignee any and all rights, reservations, easements, interests, exemptions, privileges and powers which Assignor may have as the Developer under the Declaration, and the Assignor has the right and power to do so pursuant to Article XI, Section 19 of the Declaration!]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The language of this instrument is clear, and it purports only to convey the developer\u2019s rights under the condominium plan. No mention is made of the MCOA and its expansion rights. The expansion rights were not transferred to Columbia Bank by virtue of this instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">\n<em>2. The Columbia Deed of Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AcKc\">The pertinent language of this document is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">TOGETHER with all leases, rents, profits, and benefits to the extent they may constitute accounts, including any deposits of tenants to secure payment of the same and performance of the terms and conditions of any oral or written lease, with respect to the leasing of all or any portion of the Land or improvements thereon; and all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>accounts of Grantor, including without limitation, all notes, accounts receivable, drafts, acceptances and similar instruments and documents, and all contract rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaf\">TOGETHER with all plans and specifications, surveys and surveyor\u2019s reports, engineer\u2019s and architect\u2019s reports, diagrams and drawings; sewer and water taps, allocations and agreements for utilities, bonds, utility deposits, refunds of fees or deposits paid to governmental authorities; licenses, permits, approvals and applications therefor from governmental authorities; contracts, subcontracts, service contracts, books, records, reports, accounting records, invoices, change orders, correspondence, diagrams, drawings, schematics, sales and promotional materials, wherever located and whenever created, compiled or made with respect to the Land or the improvements thereon[.] [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">This language at least suggests that contract rights, such as those contained in the MCOA, were transferred to the trustees and subsequently to Conrad/Dommel by virtue of the foreclosure deed. In the first paragraph reproduced above, \u201ccontract rights\u201d may refer to contract rights in the context of accounts, or separate contract rights. In the second paragraph reproduced above, although \u201ccontracts\u201d appears to refer to contracts with third parties for work done at the property, the language \u201ccontracts ... wherever located and whenever created\u201d could be construed as covering the contract rights contained in the MCOA. Moreover, it is realistic to understand that the intent of the security transaction was to put Columbia and its ultimate successors and assigns in the place of the developer of this mixed-use waterfront project. To do so, the expansion rights provided by the MCOA would be important. At the very least, we believe there is an ambiguity created that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">It appears that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on this issue was based primarily on its interpretation of the MCOA and to the assignment of developer rights under the condominium plan. Because of the ambiguity in the Columbia deed of trust, and because we believe the trial court erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>finding the MCOA unambiguous, as explained below, it can determine on remand if the expansion rights passed to Conrad/Dommel by virtue of the Columbia deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">B. Ambiguities in the MCOA</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The trial court found the MCOA to be unambiguous. Although the plain language of the MCOA may appear clear, the actual operation of the agreement in the context of the applicable facts is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">For example, appellants argue that the MCOA is vague with respect to the scope of the easements, as described in the following description of the location of the area for expansion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">The Developer and the other parties wish to provide for the efficient, integrated operation of all Slips, Piers and Docks in the Marinas, the Developer Marina and in the waters adjacent thereto, and to ensure the Developer the maximum rights to enjoy and develop such Slips, Piers and Docks (such rights as provided in this Agreement are herein collectively referred to as the \u201cExpansion Rights\u201d). [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Appellants argue that the word \u201cadjacent\u201d is not specific enough to identify the area for expansion. West, on the other hand, argues that the location of development was fixed pursuant to Exhibit A of the MCOA, which is depicted <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">\u201cIt is a well-established rule of construction that a contract should be interpreted in its entirety such that a court does not dismiss or disregard any clause or phrase as meaningless.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>348 Md. 157, 169, 702 A.2d 767 (1997). Exhibit A contains a note stating: \u201cThe layout of slips is shown for purposes of illustration only. In accordance with the [MCOA], the Developer may build less than all of the slips shown hereon, may build a Developer Marina in lieu of any slips shown hereon, and may otherwise exercise rights granted in the [MCOA].\u201d Even though Exhibit A does not precisely place piers, gangplanks, and slips to be built in the future, we believe it clear that \u201cadjacent\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>context of the MCOA was intended to mean in the waters adjacent to the existing structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Although this particular portion of the MCOA, which the trial court addressed, is not ambiguous, we believe that, overall, it is. The MCOA was one piece of a larger development scheme. Therefore, it was drafted and executed on the premise that the developer of the marinas would also be the developer of the condominiums and the rest of the property. Ambiguity arises when the expansion rights under the MCOA are separated from the actual development of the project. This ambiguity includes limitations on the scope and time in which to exercise the expansion rights. The developer reserved the right to expand the condominium, but that right lasted only seven years. The MCOA does not contain a time limit for the exercise of the expansion rights, which appellants indicate raises the issue of the rule against perpetuities. In addition, Conrad/Dommel owns the riparian rights and does not appear to be inclined to cooperate and assign the necessary limited rights that West might need to expand the piers.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">These ambiguities call into question whether, assuming West acquired the expansion rights, it can effectively exercise those rights. Although we need not decide, it may be that these matters cannot be resolved on summary judgment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, because this issue remains open, there is an ongoing controversy, and the probability of further litigation seems almost certain. Accordingly, we remand this case for further proceedings, and the entry of a written declaration of the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY WEST.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b309-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-11\">.

Although it was titled as a motion for joinder, the motion was to intervene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\">. The grant of summary judgment handed down on January 17, 2001, with respect to the issue of the riparian rights was not meant to be a final judgment because the court continued the case for further hearing on the issue of the expansion rights. The docket entries clearly reflected the circuit court's intent that its oral ruling on June 22, 2001, be the final judgment, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment: Motion Granted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment: Motion Denied[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1V\">Maryland Rule 2-601(a), however, requires each judgment to be entered on a separate document. For that reason, the case was remanded to the circuit court on September 30, 2002. After the circuit court entered final judgments on December 11 and 12, 2002, on the issues of riparian rights and expansion rights, the case was returned to this Court on December 19, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b288-12\">. Neither the Yacht Club nor the Condominium was a party to the case at the time the ownership of the riparian rights was decided. Although these entities have adopted Conrad/Dommel\u2019s arguments on this issue, it is undisputed that the riparian rights owned by the Yacht Club and the Condominium are those limited rights granted in the deed dated May 26, 1993, the language of which is reproduced <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\">. This reference to Tome's appears to be to the Tome's entities generally, because, at the time the deeds of trust were signed, the lots were owned by three different Tome's entities: TLC, Tome\u2019s Main Street, Inc., and Tome\u2019s Commerce Center, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\">. We agree with Conrad/Dommel that the grant of the riparian rights to Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6A, 7, 8, and 9 was without effect, because they are not riparian lands. Riparian land \u2018'relat[es] to, or [is] located on the bank of a river or stream[.]'' Black's Law Dictionary 1328 (9th ed.1999). Lots 1-9 do not touch the water, because Parcels A, Al, B, C, and D are located between those lots and the river. Consequently, the parcels and Lot 10 are the riparian land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">The word \"grant\u201d, the phrase \"bargain and sell,\u201d in a deed, or any other words purporting to transfer the whole estate of the grantor, passes to the grantee the whole interest and estate of the grantor in the land mentioned in the deed unless a limitation or reservation shows, by implication or otherwise, a different intent.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\">. We point out that the both Parcel A and its riparian rights were transferred by the May 20, 1993 deed. Because both the land and its riparian rights were transferred at the same time, the riparian rights to Parcel A were not severed by the conveyance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">. This transaction was subject to the MCOA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b298-10\">. If the riparian rights were intended to be conveyed, Lot 10\u2019s riparian rights would be reunited as a result of the Columbia deed of trust as conveyed to Conrad/Dommel by the trustees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">. As a practical matter, and contrary to West's position, it is inconceivable to us that the lead commercial lender of a mixed use waterfront development would not expect the applicable riparian rights associated with the property securing the loan to be part o\u00ed its security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. Those rights are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">A. The Developer hereby reserves, for a period of seven (7) years after the date hereof, the right (which shall be exercisable at its sole discretion) to expand the Condominium by subjecting to the Condominium Regime, and thereby adding to the Condominium, any one or more of those parcels of land in Cecil County which are designated on the Condominium Plat as Future Parcel 1, Future Parcel 2, Future Parcel 3, Future Parcel 4, Future Parcel 5, Future Parcel 6, Future Parcel 7, Future Parcel 8, Future Parcel 9 respectively, and are more particularly described in Exhibit E [which is not in the record provided to this Court], together with all of the respective improvements thereon and all of the respective rights, alleys, ways, waters, privileges, appurtenances and advantages, to the same belonging or in any way appertaining (each of which parcels, together with such improvements thereon and appurtenances thereto, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as a \"Future Parcel\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">In addition, the Developer reserves the right to expand the Condominium by adding to the Condominium from time to time as Limited Common Elements riparian rights, docks, slips and other improvements or rights appurtenant to or constituting the Marina or any portion thereof. Any such expansion shall occur in the portion of the Susquehanna River shown on the Condominium Plat.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">. We note that the MCOA contained the following arbitration provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">(d) <em>Enforcement by Developer. </em>In the event either the [Yacht] Club or the Condominium shall breach or obstruct any of the Expansion Rights or other right or benefit of Developer [TLC] under this Agreement, the Developer shall be entitled (i) to refer such matter to binding arbitration in the manner provided by, and in accordance with Section 5 above, and/or (ii) pursue any other remedy available to Developer at law or in equity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
