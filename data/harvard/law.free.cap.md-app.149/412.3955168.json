That court found that the respondent, Andrew A., was not a child in need of assistance (CINA) under the definition of that phrase that was enacted by Chapter 415 of the Acts of 2001, effective October 1, 2001, and that is codified as Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-801(f) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ). The sole issue before us is whether the juvenile court\u2019s construction of CJ \u00a7 3-801(f) is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Andrew A. is the fourth child of Sarah A. She was born in Ghana, West Africa, live d in England, and was brought to this country at age twelve by her mother. They lived in Boston where Sarah A.\u2019s mother was her source of support, but her mother died sometime ago. Sarah A.\u2019s oldest child, Margaret, born in 1988, and her next oldest child, Christina, bom in 1991, now reside in England. When Christina was three months old she was removed from Sarah A.\u2019s care by Massachusetts authorities, and it is Sarah A.\u2019s understanding that her parental rights as to Christina were judicially terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In 1993 Sarah A. married Ernest A., but the couple separated in 1996. Sarah A.\u2019s third child, Isaac, was born of that marriage in 1994. According to Ernest A., Sarah A. had many \u201cmental problems\u201d and that it was due to his presence in the home that Isaac was not removed from Sarah A.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Sarah A. and Isaac moved to Maryland in February 2001. In May of that year, Child Welfare Services (CWS) received a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>report from the social services agency in Worcester, Massachusetts alleging neglect of Isaac by his mother. Acting on the Massachusetts referral, CWS staff met with Sarah A. on May 21, 2001. She needed financial assistance and assistance in finding housing. Thereafter, Sarah A. has changed addresses a number of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">For several months in the summer of 2001 Sarah A. had a sexual relationship with Alhalji K. He is the biological father of Andrew A, the infant who is the subject of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In August 2001 the State of Maryland petitioned to have Isaac found CINA. By a Montgomery County Juvenile Court order of September 17, 2001, Isaac was so adjudicated and placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Andrew A. was born May 14, 2002. He was placed in protective care at the hospital and in foster care on May 17, 2002. The State petitioned that Andrew A. be found CINA on June 10, 2002. Thus, at the juvenile court hearing on June 12 and 13, 2002, the evidence dealt with Sarah A.\u2019s prior conduct, particularly as it had affected Isaac. Under those circumstances the juvenile court concluded, based on its interpretation of CJ \u00a7 3\u2014801(f), that Andrew A. was not CINA.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">That statute, enacted in 2001, sets forth the following definition applicable to Subtitle 8, <em>\u201cJuvenile Causes-Children In Need of Assistance.\u201d</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">\u201c \u2018Child In Need of Assistance\u2019 means a child who requires court intervention because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-10\">\u201c(1) The child has been abused, has been neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMD\">\u201c(2) The child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and the child\u2019s needs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The juvenile court, focusing on the words, \u201c[t]he'child ... has been neglected,\u201d concluded that there was no evidence that Andrew A. had been neglected. Specifically, the juvenile court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument based on <em>In re Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>liam B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 533 A.2d 16 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>311 Md. 719, 537 A.2d 272 (1988), where this Court held that \u201cthe parents\u2019 ability to care for the needs of one child is probative of their ability to care for other children in the family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 533 A.2d at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The juvenile court presented the following rationale for its construction of CJ \u00a7 3\u2014801(f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">\u201cThe holding in <em>William B. </em>I think applies to the old statute. I think that the legislature changed the statute, and it says that there has to be a finding that the child has been neglected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">\u201cThat is not here. Neglected is defined\u2014and while people have been talking, I have been looking at this phrase, \u2018has been neglected,\u2019 meaning that this child has been neglected, and neglect means leaving a child under-attended, or other failure to give proper care and attention to a child, and that means the child that we are talking about in this case and not a prior child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cAll the arguments about <em>William B. </em>I think are very apposite under the old definition of CI\u00d1A. The old definition of CINA just says child in need of assistance because the child\u2019s parents, guardian or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\"><em>\u201cWilliam B. </em>said you don\u2019t have to wait to find inability or unwillingness until a child is actually injured. Here it certainly looks like the legislature intended to say that you have to show that the child has been neglected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">\u201cThere is not evidence that this child has been neglected. Now, unless I want to just torture the language and pretend that the legislature didn\u2019t mean it, I can\u2019t find that this child has been neglected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can find the child a child in need of assistance. Everything that the Department says, all their concerns, all of the arguments about risk are all well taken, except I come back to what the law is, and the law says \u2018has been neglected,\u2019 and it may well be that this is a very unfortunate result for this child, but I think the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>intended \u2018has been neglected\u2019 means things have happened which show neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cNeglect is defined as leaving a child unattended or other failure to give proper care and attention, and it doesn\u2019t say or a risk based upon prior actions with other children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say that. Believe me, I am not at all comfortable with this decision, but I didn\u2019t change the law. They did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">In this Court Sarah A. submits that the definitional element that \u201cthe child has been ... neglected,\u201d is unambiguous and that, under the rules of statutory construction as recently repeated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Langston v. Langston, </em>366 Md. 490, 784 A.2d 1086 (2001), this Court may not look beyond those words to determine the legislative intent. In <em>Langston, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cWhere the General Assembly has enacted an unambiguous statute, we cannot, and will not, divine a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or judicially insert language to impose exceptions, limitations or restrictions not set forth by the legislature. <em>See Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Assn. v. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>361 Md. 196, 204, 760 A.2d 1087, 1091 (2000)(\u201cwe neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in a forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning\u201d); <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 515-16, 784 A.2d at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">In determining ambiguity, <em>vel non, </em>however, the statute must be considered as a whole. <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 175, 783 A.2d 169, 179 (2001) (quoting <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997)). <em>See also Cunningham v. State, </em>318 Md. 182, 185, 567 A.2d 126, 127 (1989). Absence of ambiguity cannot be predicated on selecting a few words from the body of the entire statute. Here, the words, \u201chas been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>neglected,\u201d in \u00a7 3\u2014801(f) must be read in light of the definition of \u201cneglect\u201d set forth in CJ \u00a7 3-801(s). That definition reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">\u201c \u2018Neglect\u2019 means the leaving of <em>a </em>child unattended or other failure to give proper care and attention to <em>a </em>child by any parent or individual who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of the child under circumstances that indicate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201c(1) That the child\u2019s health or welfare is harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201c(2) That the child has suffered mental injury or been placed at substantial risk of mental injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In the definition of \u201cneglect\u201d the class under consideration is children. Members of that class are individuals under the age of eighteen years. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-801(e) (defining \u201cchild\u201d). The Revisor\u2019s Manual of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Revise the Annotated Code of Maryland (2d Ed.1973) at 51, establishes as a style guideline that \u201c[ojnce the class has been defined, indicate a member of the class by use of \u2018every\u2019 or \u2018a.\u2019 \u201d Consequently, \u201cneglect\u201d in \u00a7 3-801(s) is an abstract concept, not limited to the child who is the subject of the CINA proceeding. Proof of neglect of some child other than the child who is the subject of the proceeding raises a question of evidentiary relevance, dependent on the circumstances of the particular case, but \u00a7 3-801(s) does not create a statutory exclusion of evidence of neglect simply because the child directly affected by the neglect is not the subject of the CINA proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Further, it is clear from \u00a7 3-801(s)(l) and (2) that there may be neglect of a child without actual harm to the child. A \u201csubstantial risk of harm\u201d constitutes \u201cneglect.\u201d Thus, if there are two children involved in a parent\u2019s act or omission, but only one child is harmed, there nevertheless may be neglect of the second child if, depending on the facts, the act or omission created a substantial risk of harm to the second child.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>When the definition of \u201cneglect\u201d is read into the definition of a \u201cchild in need of assistance\u201d in \u00a7 3\u2014801(f), it would seem to be clear that the child who is the subject of the CINA proceeding need not have suffered actual harm. The child may be CINA if \u201cplaced at substantial risk of harm.\u201d In any event, CJ \u00a7 3\u2014801(f), when read in conjunction with \u00a7 3-801(s), is, at best from Sarah A.\u2019s standpoint, ambiguous on whether evidence of neglect must be restricted to conduct directed to the child who is the subject of the CINA proceeding, or whether evidence of a substantial risk of harm to the subject child may lie in conduct directly affecting one or more siblings of the subject child.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In <em>Langston, </em>the issue was whether an award of alimony could be retroactively modified, an issue on which the relevant statute was silent. Essentially the Court of Appeals held that it would not insert a prohibition against retroactive modification when there was no prohibition in the statute. <em>Langston, </em>366 Md. at 516, 784 A.2d at 1100. Similarly, here, we will not insert a prohibition excluding competent evidence relevant to whether the child who is the subject of the proceeding has been placed at substantial risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Further, when the conventional aids to statutory construction are consulted, the ambiguity, if any, in CJ \u00a7 3\u2014801(f) disappears. In this case those aids are the language of the predecessor statute, and its judicial interpretation; the committee notes that accompanied the statutory language of Senate Bill 660 which was enacted as Chapter 415 of the Acts of 2001; and the Report of the Judicial Proceedings Committee on Senate Bill 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In the immediate predecessor statute, Maryland Code (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), CJ \u00a7 3-801(e), a child in need of assistance was defined to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201ca child who requires the assistance of the court because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201c(1) the child is mentally handicapped or is not receiving ordinary and proper care and attention and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201c(2) the child\u2019s parents, guardian, or custodian are unable 'or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and the child\u2019s problems.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">This definition did not utilize any form of the word, \u201cneglect,\u201d and \u201cneglect\u201d was not a defined term in the predecessor of Subtitle 8. In the predecessor statute the language analogous to \u201chas been neglected\u201d in the current statute is the language, \u201cis not receiving ordinary and proper care and attention.\u201d Under the predecessor statute the present progressive tense of the verb could have been read to relate exclusively to the subject of the proceeding, just as Sarah A. contends that the words, \u201chas been neglected,\u201d relate exclusively to that subject child under the current statute. But that is not the judicial construction of the predecessor statute. <em>In re William B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 533 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">That case involved two brothers, the older, age seven or eight, and the younger, age nearly five years old. The younger brother suffered from fetal alcoholism, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and visual problems. His motor skills were those of a three to four month old infant. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 533 A.2d at 20. The evidence at the CINA hearing related almost exclusively to the lack of care to the younger brother by the alcoholic parents of the children. When the juvenile court found both boys to be CINA, the parents appealed, contending only that the order should be reversed as to the older child on the ground that the evidence as to the younger was not relevant to whether the older was neglected. This Court rejected that contention, holding that \u201cthe differences between the children do not negate the reasonableness of an inference that the parents\u2019 inability to care for [the younger boy] is evidence of an inability to care for [the older boy].\u201d Further, the court reasoned that the purpose of the CINA statute, to protect children, would be impaired if the statute were construed to require a juvenile court to \u201cwait until the child suffers some injury before determining that he is neglected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 533 A.2d at 21. Thus, language in the prior definition of a \u201cchild in need of assistance\u201d which, if applied literally, could have limited evidence of the lack of care only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the child directly affected was not applied to exclude use of that evidence in order also to show a risk of harm to a sibling of the child directly affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The reasoning of <em>In re William B. </em>was applied in <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 614 A.2d 999 (1992). There the child had been born to a drug addicted mother. He was placed in temporary foster care within days after his birth and was found to be CINA about one month after his birth. Not only was the drug use by the mother harmful to the child during pregnancy, but the past conduct of the mother evidenced that there would be a substantial risk of harm to the child if the newborn were left in his mother\u2019s care. This Court said that \u201cthe lower court\u2019s function was to assess whether Dustin was placed at risk of significant harm; the court need not wait until he suffered some injury before determining that he is a C.I.N.A. <em>In re William B., </em>73 Md.App. at 77, 533 A.2d [at 21].\u201d 93 Md.App. at 736, 614 A.2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The legislative history of the statute reveals that Senate Bill 660 was proposed by the Foster Care Court Improvement Implementation Committee of the Maryland Judicial Conference (the Committee). The bill as introduced carried notes from the Committee, although uncodified SEC. 8 of the bill provides that \u201cthe Committee Notes contained [in] this Act are not law and may not be construed to have been enacted as part of this Act.\u201d Consequently, the Committee Notes do not appear in the Maryland Code. Nevertheless, they were presented to the Legislature in order to explain the intent of the Committee and, thus, where, as here, the Legislature agreed with the Committee, the Committee Notes are evidence of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Committee Note to \u00a7 3-801 (f) in relevant part reads that \u201c[t\u2019Jhis language was substituted for former CJ \u00a7 3-801 (e) and revised for clarity.\u201d Sarah A. contends that the substitution and revision indicate that a substantial change was intended, so that the rule of <em>In re William B. </em>does not apply under the new statute. The revision, however, includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>concept of \u201cneglect,\u201d a definitional term. The Committee Note to that definitional section, \u00a7 3-801 (s), in part reads that \u201c[t]his definition was added to coincide with the definition in FL [Family Law] \u00a7 5-701 and reflects practice in this area of law.\u201d FL \u00a7 5-701 is the definitional section for the subtitle dealing with the reporting, investigation, and results of investigations of child abuse and neglect. FL \u00a7 5-701(p) defines \u201cneglect\u201d in language identical to that later used in CJ \u00a7 3-801(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It appears that the clarification effected in CJ \u00a7 3-801 (f) by the 2001 legislation was defining \u201cneglect\u201d in the same way in the CINA statute and in the child abuse and neglect statute. The General Assembly thereby avoided possible confusion as to whether different standards were intended between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Further, the opinion in <em>In re Dustin T. </em>quoted the definition of neglect from FL \u00a7 5-701, with emphasis on the alternative form of neglect, <em>i.e., </em>placing the child at risk of harm. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 614 A.2d at 1003. By looking to the Family Law Article definition of \u201cneglect\u201d in that CINA case, this Court concluded that the CINA petitioner \u201chas a right\u2014and indeed a duty\u2014to look at the track record, the past, of [the mother] in order to predict what her future treatment of the child may be.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, we do not agree with Sarah A.\u2019s contention that the 2001 amendment effected a substantial change from the law as it was reflected in <em>In re Dustin T. </em>As the Committee Note states, the new definition in CJ \u00a7 3-801 (s) reflects how the statute was being applied in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Finally, the floor report of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee on Senate Bill 660 explicitly states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABB\">\u201cThe definition of \u2018child in need of assistance\u2019 has also been revised for clarity; the revision is not intended to alter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>existing caselaw holding that a child can be declared a CINA based on evidence of neglect or abuse of siblings in appropriate cases. <em>See In re William B., </em>73 Md.App. 68, 533 A.2d 16, 21 (1987) (\u2018The judge need not wait until a child suffers some injury before determining that he is neglected.\u2019); <em>In re Dustin T., </em>93 Md.App. 726, 614 A.2d 999, 1003 (1992) (\u2018MCDSS has a right\u2014and indeed the duty\u2014to look at the track record, the past of Ms. H. in order to predict what her future treatment of the child may be.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">For these reasons, we hold that the juvenile court applied a legally erroneous construction of CJ \u00a7 3\u2014801 (f) in deciding this CINA petition. Because of its legal conclusion, the court did not evaluate the facts to determine whether the conduct of Sarah A. demonstrated a substantial risk of harm to Andrew A. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.
