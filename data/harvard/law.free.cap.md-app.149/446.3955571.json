Appellees CareFirst of Maryland, Inc. (\u201cCareFirst\u201d) and Group Hospitalization &amp; Medical Services, Inc. (\u201cGHMSI\u201d)(together referred to as \u201cthe insurers\u201d) challenge the IC\u2019s right to venture outside strict actuarial concerns (1) in deciding to disapprove the insurers\u2019 proposed rate increases as excessive, and (2) in treating as income the benefit of a subsidy or discount earned by the insurers because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>willing to offer certain open enrollment insurance known as \u201cSAAC products\u201d to high risk individuals. The insurers also challenge the method that the IC used to set new rates after he disapproved the rates they proposed. We hold that the IC acted within his authority, both in disapproving the rate increases requested by the insurers, and in modifying those rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">FACTUAL AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The history of a Maryland independent agency known as the Health Services Cost Review Commission (\u201cHSCRC\u201d) provides the backdrop to this case. The HSCRC was established by the General Assembly to regulate the rates charged by hospitals and other related institutions. <em>See Health Svcs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n v. Franklin Square Hosp., </em>280 Md. 233, 234-38, 372 A.2d 1051 (1977). It reviews such rates to determine whether they are reasonable, and if so, approves them. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol, 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 19-211(a)(1), \u00a7 19-219 of the Health-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In 1974, the HSCRC observed that \u201csome practices of major third parties either reduced hospital costs or averted bad debts.\u201d At that time, Maryland Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Care-First\u2019s predecessor, offered an \u201copen enrollment\u201d health care policy for individuals, which enabled an applicant to obtain health insurance without regard to his or her health condition. The HSCRC concluded that the availability of such insurance coverage for high risk individuals resulted in a reduction in the amount of uncompensated or \u201cbad debt\u201d care that hospitals would otherwise have been required to provide if those high risk individuals had not been able to obtain insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In order to encourage other insurers to offer such open enrollment coverage, the HSCRC developed the \u201cSAAC\u201d program. The acronym \u201cSAAC\u201d stands for \u201cSubstantial, Available, and Mfordable Coverage.\u201d Under this program, any insurer wdio offers a product meeting the SAAC criteria is entitled to a 4% discount from HSCRC-approved hospital rates for the services that Maryland hospitals provide to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>subscribers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amount of this discount, known as the \u201cSAAC differential,\u201d was \u201cdesigned to reflect the cost savings to hospitals by carriers offering ... SAAC.\u201d Once an insurer qualifies for the SAAC differential, the 4% discount applies, not only when health services are provided to those patients purchasing the qualified insurer\u2019s SAAC product, but also when services are provided to other persons insured by that carrier under non-SAAC policies. A carrier is required to apply for the SAAC differential each year, and, in doing so, to demonstrate that it meets the criteria specified by the HSCRC. <em>See </em>COMAR 10.37.10.26A(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Interestingly, the cost savings to the hospitals from having SAAC insurance available dramatically exceeded the loss that the insurers incurred in providing insurance to these high-risk individuals. Because the 4% discount was predicated on the hospital\u2019s savings resulting from SAAC coverage, rather than the cost to the insurers, the latter received a large \u201cprofit\u201d from the SAAC differential. According to a 2001 HSCRC staff report, the value of the SAAC differential to CareFirst was $26,089,900 in 2000, and was projected to be $27,000,000 for the year 2001. The value of the SAAC differential to GHMSI was $4,600,190 in 2000, and was projected to be $4,900,000 for the year 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In 2001, the General Assembly, recognizing this differential, funded a Short-Term Prescription Drug Subsidy Plan by requiring each insurer receiving the SAAC differential to contribute 37.5% of the discount to the Plan. <em>See </em>2001 Md. Laws ch. 135; <em>codified at </em>Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 15-606(c) of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d). With a 37.5% reduction, the net SAAC differential still avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>able to CareFirst would be $16,875,000 for 2001. The net SAAC differential still available to GHMSI would be $8,062,500 for 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The dispute in this case arose when the IC took the SAAC differential into consideration in disapproving the insurers\u2019 proposals to increase premiums for their SAAC products. Rates charged by a non-profit health insurer to its subscribers must first be \u201csubmitted to and approved by the\u201d IC. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1997, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 14-126(a) of the Insurance Article (\u201cIns.\u201d) Alter evaluating a proposed change in rates, the IC \u201cshall disapprove or modify the proposed [rate] change\u201d whenever, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe table of rates appears by statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions to be excessive in relation to benefits[.]\u201d Ins. \u00a7 14\u2014126(b) (3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On March 9, 2001, the insurers submitted to the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d) new rate filings that contained substantial rate increases for certain SAAC products. In support, the insurers provided extensive actuarial information relating to the costs and expenses of the SAAC products. According to these filings, the insurers proposed two contracts, the first to existing SAAC subscribers, with the same level of benefits that had been provided in the past (\u201cthe old SAAC product\u201d). The second was offered to new subscribers after June 1, 2001 (\u201cthe new SAAC product\u201d), which contained additional benefits required by the Maryland Health Care Commission. All new subscribers would be required to purchase the new SAAC product, which contained more benefits and carried a higher premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Under the new scheme, the proposed monthly rates increased as the age of the insured increased, a practice known as \u201cage banding.\u201d Depending on the age of the insured, the increases for new CareFirst SAAC customers ranged from 65% to 578%. The rate changes for new GHMSI SAAC customers ranged from a 5.7% decrease to a 270% increase. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The following percentages of increase were proposed by the insurers:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">EXISTING [CAREFIRST!

In rejecting the proposed rates, the MIA \u201cdetermined that the proposed rates were excessive in relation to the benefits provided, considering the value received by [the insurers.]\u201d At the insurers\u2019 request, a hearing was held before the IC, Steven B. Larsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The insurers\u2019 actuary testified that, under the rate schedules proposed by the insurers, the premium revenues would be less than the expected expenses and cost of claims. Thus, the actuary said, the \u201closses\u201d to the insurers would be even greater under the lower rates approved by the MIA. He calculated that under the rates approved by the MIA, Care-First would suffer a \u201closs\u201d of $1,400,000 on SAAC contracts in 2001, while GHMSI would suffer a \u201closs\u201d of $2,100,000. In his calculations, however, the insurers\u2019 actuary did not include the value to the insurers of the SAAC differential generated by the 4% discount that would be applied to its non-SAAC insureds. Once the value of the SAAC differential was accounted for, the losses on the SAAC policies disappeared, because the SAAC differential greatly exceeded the amount of the \u201closses\u201d as the actuary had calculated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">At the hearing before the IC, the statistical data was not in dispute. Rather, the insurers challenged the IC\u2019s authority to consider the SAAC differential in reviewing the SAAC rates. They presented the testimony of Harold Cohen, who was the Executive Director of the HSCRC from 1972 to 1987. Cohen explained the development of the SAAC differential and opined that \u201cthe proper application of cost savings realized as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>a result of SAAC should be left to either the [HSCRC] or the Maryland General Assembly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Cohen\u2019s testimony, however, was contradicted by the HSCRC\u2019s February 1986 29-page Final Decision that was issued while Cohen was Executive Director (the \u201cFinal Decision\u201d). In this Final Decision, the HSCRC set forth the final amount of the SAAC discount, expressly concluded that it was the job of the IC, and not that of the HSCRC, to consider the amount of the SAAC differential in setting insurance rates, and expressly recommended that the IC \u201cconsider whether premium adjustment should be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In this document, the HSCRC discussed the purposes of the SAAC program, and recognized that \u201c[i]t would not be equitable ... for Blue Cross to charge higher rates that more than cover the claims of this class of insured <em>and </em>receive a differential for providing this coverage. This practice amounts to a double reward.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The Final Decision also recognized that the SAAC differential may give an \u201cexcessive competitive advantage\u201d to the insurers who receive it, by allowing them to lower the price of all their products rather than lowering only the price of the SAAC product. In the Final Decision, the HSCRC expressed its view that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKf\">[i]t is within the authority of the Insurance Commissioner to adjust and/or limit the premiums which Blue Cross/Blue Shield may charge its customers for SAAC policies in order to adjust its ultimate revenue.... The [HSCRC] does not wish to overstep its jurisdictional bounds as it relates to the business of insurance; therefore, it <em>recommends </em>that the Insurance Commissioner consider whether premium adjustment should be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The IC also heard testimony fi-om Robert Murray, the Executive Director of the HSCRC at the time of the hearing. Murray testified that HSCRC intended that the SAAC differential would subsidize the cost of the SAAC product, and that the HSCRC \u201cwant[ed] there to be a subsidy for the product itself to make sure that it remained affordable.\u201d In Murray\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he differential was applied company-wide under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>expectation that the entire value or a portion of the value of the differential would be transferred to the open enrollment product and the other qualifying products at the time in order to keep these products substantial and affordable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">In a written opinion, the IC upheld the MIA\u2019s determination that the requested rate increases were excessive. The IC concluded that the \u201cHSCRC intended the SAAC product to be \u2018affordable\u2019, and that the model for the program w;as the historical practice of CareFirst of Maryland to offer a product priced at or near the level of medically underwritten products.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthe record shows a clear recognition by the HSCRC of the ongoing jurisdiction of the MIA to review SAAC rates.\u201d Rejecting the insurers\u2019 argument that the imbalance between the SAAC differential and the losses sustained by a SAAC carrier ought to be addressed by the HSCRC, the IC determined that the MIA was the agency with the authority to review insurance rates and to determine whether they were \u201cexcessive in relation to benefits\u201d under section 14-126 of the Insurance Article. He found that the HSCRC intended that \u201cthe MIA should take into consideration the policy underlying the SAAC program and the value of the discount received by a carrier when reviewing the rates of a SAAC product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The IC also rejected the insurers\u2019 argument that the HSCRC\u2019s power to disapprove a carrier as a participant in the SAAC program addressed any concerns about affordability of rates for SAAC customers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">It is true that the HSCRC has provided little guidance on what would appear to be a key element of the SAAC program; namely, that the product be affordable. However, the fact that the HSCRC has, from its perspective as a hospital rate regulator, approved the SAAC applications of GHMSI and CareFirst of Maryland in no way trumps the ... statutory authority of the MIA to separately review rates and to consider all relevant factors.... The regulation of SAAC is clearly joint regulation, with each agency charged to oversee those aspects of the program for which it has the requisite expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The insurers appealed the IC\u2019s rate decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The circuit court reversed, holding that the IC had acted outside of his authority in disapproving the insurers\u2019 proposed rates. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Section 14-126 of the Insurance Article, titled \u201cFilings of amendments and rate changes,\u201d is the exclusive source of the IC\u2019s authority to approve or disapprove rates charged by nonprofit insurers. <em>See The Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 411, 419-20, 488 A.2d 942 (1985). It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">(a) <em>Approval by Commissioner </em>required.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(1) A corporation subject to this subtitle may not amend ... the terms and provisions of contracts issued or proposed to be issued to subscribers to the plan until the proposed amendments have been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">(b) ... (3)(i) The Commissioner shall disapprove or modify the proposed change if ... the table of rates appears by statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions to be excessive in relation to benefits ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">(ii) In determining whether to disapprove or modify the ... table of rates, the Commissioner shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">1. past and prospective loss experience within and outside the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-11\">2. underwriting practice and judgment to the extent appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">3. a reasonable margin for reserve needs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-13\">4. past and prospective expenses, both countrywide and those specifically applicable to the State; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-14\">5. any other relevant factors within and outside the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">The insurers offer several arguments to support the circuit court\u2019s decision to reverse the IC, and in each they invite us to circumscribe the IC\u2019s authority under section 14-126. Addressing each argument in turn, we decline this invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Insurers\u2019 Arguments That the IC Must Limit His Consideration To Statistical Analysis of Actuarial Factors, And That He Exceeded His Authority In Relying On Policy Concerns In Disapproving The Insurers\u2019 Proposed Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The insurers\u2019 primary argument is that the IC exceeded his authority under section 14\u2014126(b)(3)(i)(l) to disapprove rates if \u201cthe table of rates appears by statistical analysis and reasonable assumptions to be excessive in relation to benefits[.]\u201d The insurers first assert that the IC failed to exercise this statutory authority because he did not perform any statistical analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Statistical Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The insurers contend that the legislature, in using the terminology \u201cstatistical analysis\u201d and \u201creasonable assumptions,\u201d \u201cclearly ... intended to limit the [IC] to considering actuarial factors when exercising his power to disapprove rates.\u201d The insurers invoke the familiar statutory construction doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to define and limit the broad language in section 14-126(b)(3) allowing the IC to consider \u201cany other relevant factors\u201d in disapproving and modifying the proposed rate changes. Under this doctrine, they assert, the IC\u2019s consideration of other factors is limited to items that are similar in nature to the enumerated factors in items 1 though 4 of subsection 14\u2014126(b)(3)(ii), all of which, they contend, are actuarial. <em>See, e.g., Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 295, 558 A.2d 399 (1989)(the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>means that when general words in a statute follow the designation of particular things, the general words are construed to include only those things of the same class or general nature as those specifically enumerated). The IC\u2019s consideration of the intent and policy of the HSCRC in creating the SAAC differential was not actuarial, they argue, but rather a policy concern that the IC was forbidden to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>We shall hold in section II that the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>does not preclude the IC from considering non-actuarial factors pursuant to section 14\u2014126(b). Analysis of that issue is not required yet, however, because we preliminarily conclude that consideration of the SAAC differential is both statistical and actuarial. We reach this conclusion simply by reference to legal and English language dictionaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u201cStatistics\u201d means \u201cthe science that deals with the collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of numerical facts or data, and that, by use of mathematical theories of probability, imposes order and regularity on aggregates of more or less disparate elements.\u201d <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language </em>1389 (unabr. ed.1973). A \u201cstatistic\u201d is defined as \u201ca numerical fact or datum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Clearly, the SAAC differential, a concrete and definite dollar figure determined by taking a fraction (4%) of the cost of hospital services to the insurers\u2019 subscribers, is statistical information.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cactuary\u201d as \u201c[a] statistician who determines the present effects of future contingent events; esp., one who calculates insurance and pension rates on the basis of empirically based tables.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>37 (7th ed.1999). <em>Random House Dictionary </em>defines \u201cactuary\u201d as \u201ca person who computes premium rates, dividends, risks, etc., according to probabilities based on statistical records.\u201d <em>See Random House Dictionary, supra, </em>at 15. We have no doubt that data reflecting the amount that the insurers saved in hospital charges because of the SAAC differential is information that can be used in actuarial analysis because it is statistical, is empirically based, relates to the cost of providing SAAC policies, and can be used to predict the amount of subsidy to be received by the insurers in the upcoming year. It relates to the SAAC policies because, indisputably, the insurers would lose the 4% discount from the hospitals if they did not offer the SAAC policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">That a substantial portion of the SAAC differential is received when non-SAAC subscribers obtain hospital services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>does not deprive the SAAC differential of its status as a statistic used in an actuarial analysis. We therefore hold that, in considering the SAAC differential in his decision, the IC used \u201cstatistical analysis\u201d within the meaning of section 14-126(b)(3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conclusion does not necessarily mean that the statistical analysis performed by the IC was free of the policy concerns that appellants consider inappropriate. We turn next to that aspect of the insurers\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Policy Concerns</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The insurers insist that, even if the SAAC differential is statistical and actuarial in nature, the IC could not consider it in deciding that the proposed SAAC rates were excessive because, in doing so, he was making a policy decision, which goes beyond his actuarial role. His policy decision favored the interests of the high risk subscribers by making their premiums lower. We agree with the insurers that the IC took into account the policy decision of the HSCRC to give insurers incentives to offer affordable insurance to high risk individuals. We do not agree that in doing so, he exceeded his authority. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">As the IC points out, \u201c[i]f the insurers stopped offering the SAAC product, they would no longer be eligible for the SAAC differential, and would have to pay the hospital charges that the SAAC differential represents.\u201d The IC merely recognized the undisputed causal relationship between the insurers\u2019 offering of SAAC differential policies and the insurers\u2019 receipt of benefits in the form of a discount. This simple reality reinforces the logic that the SAAC differential should be credited to the SAAC product.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Nor is the IC\u2019s concern about providing affordable coverage to SAAC subscribers an improper policy consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ation outside of his jurisdictional realm. The IC has a legitimate interest in seeing that the insurance provided by nonprofit health service plans provides the best insurance at a reasonable cost to the most people. The IC\u2019s power to advance this interest is implicit in his authority to disapprove rates if they are \u201cexcessive in relation to benefits,\u201d and his authority to disapprove insurance forms that are \u201cunjust or unfair.\u201d <em>See </em>Ins. \u00a7 14\u2014126(b)(3)(!)(1)\u2014(2). <em>See also </em>1-3 <em>Holmes\u2019 Appleman on Insurance 2d </em>\u00a7 3.7 (2002)(\u201cRate regulation is designed to generate premium charges that are equitable for each policyholder-insured as well as yield insurers a fair return for the risks undertaken\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">When a large economic benefit accrues to the insurers as a result of a state program designed to promote affordable insurance for high risk individual subscribers, it can be considered inequitable to ignore that benefit when calculating rates for those high-risk individuals. This is particularly so when the proposed rates substantially exceed those charged group insurance subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The Court of Appeals made it clear' in <em>The Johns Hopkins Hosp., Inc. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>302 Md. 411, 488 A.2d 942 (1985), that the insurance commissioner may consider a State policy regarding health care that was established by another agency as a \u201crelevant factor\u201d within the meaning of section 14-126(b)(3). In <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>the insurance commissioner had approved a form of insurance contract submitted by Blue Cross of Maryland, Inc., that excluded from coverage \u201chigh cost\u201d hospitals, as defined in the contract. A number of hospitals challenged this approval, claiming that it was the job of the HSCRC, and not the insurance commissioner, to regulate the rates charged by hospitals. Rejecting this contention, the Court of Appeals broadly interpreted the \u201cany other relevant factors\u201d language of section 14-126(b)(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cIn today\u2019s complex society it is not possible, nor is it desirable, so to limit the area of concern of one administrative agency that, it does not touch upon that of other agencies. It is not only appropriate but in many instances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>necessary, in pursuing state policy goals that two or more agencies of State government take action within the ambit of their express powers to accomplish the desired objective. Certainly, if health care cost containment is State policy, such would be among the \u2018relevant factors\u2019 which the Commissioner is enjoined by [\u00a7 14\u2014126(b)(3)] to consider.... The Commissioner has not exceeded the scope of his authority nor has he attempted to exercise power and authority delegated to other agencies. In light of the limited judicial role, coordination of the efforts of separate State agencies in seeking to achieve common goals is beyond the responsibility, authority and power of the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACK\"><em>Id. </em>at 419-20, 488 A.2d 942 (quoting trial court)(emphasis added and citations omitted). The Court\u2019s broad interpretation of the \u201cany other factors\u201d language as permitting the insurance commissioner to consider cost containment policies adopted by the HSCRC instructs us that, in this instance, the scope of the IC\u2019s inquiry is not as \u201cpolicy-limited\u201d as the insurers contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Here, the IC relied on the historical record of the HSCRC, including its 1986 Final Decision, and the testimony of its Executive Director, Robert Murray.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">A review of the entire record does not support the narrow reading of the statute advanced by CareFirst. First, the testimony by the current Executive Director of the HSCRC, as well as the decisions of the HSCRC, confirm that it has been accepted and understood] that the MIA would regulate the rates of SAAC products with consideration of the purpose of the SAAC program as well as the value of the discount to a particular SAAC carrier.... [T]he record shows that the HSCRC intended the SAAC product to be \u201caffordable,\u201d and that the model for the program was the historical practice of CareFirst of Maryland to offer a product priced at or near the level of medically underwritten products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The IC quoted from the HSCRC\u2019s 1986 Final Decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201c[T]here is substantial testimony that [the non-profit insurer] charges two to three times as much for a policy issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>during open enrollment as it does for the same coverage obtained through group or with evidence of insurability. It would not be equitable, the Commission believes, for [this insurer] to charge higher rates that more than cover the claims of this class of insureds <em>and </em>receive a differential for providing this coverage. This practice amounts to a double reward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">In relying on administrative decisions of the HSCRC when he considered the SAAC differential to set rates, the IC was not drawing upon the HSCRC\u2019s power. He was acting cautiously to ensure that he did not encroach upon the authority of the HSCRC to regulate the SAAC program. We think that one agency has the authority to consider administrative decisions of another agency, and the policy reasons underlying those decisions, in deciding whether and how to exercise its own authority over an overlapping subject matter. <em>See Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>302 Md. at 419-20, 488 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The Insurers\u2019 <em>Ejusdem Generis </em>Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The insurers\u2019 invocation of the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>does not dissuade us from our view that the IC acted within his authority. This tool of statutory construction is more commonly used to interpret criminal statutes because they must be narrowly construed. <em>See In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. 186, 191, 634 A.2d 53 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201cThe doctrine ... applies when the following conditions exist: (1) the statute contains an enumeration by specific words; (2) the members of the enumeration suggest a class; (3) the class is not exhausted by the enumeration; (4) a general reference supplementing the enumeration, usually following it; and (5) there is not clearly manifested an intent that the general term be given a broader meaning than the doctrine requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 190, 634 A.2d 53 (quoting 2A <em>Sutherland Stat.

Belcher, </em>315 Md. 111, 121, 553 A.2d 691 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">The doctrine often has been applied to statutes featuring lists of specific \u201cthings.\u201d For example, in <em>In re Wallace W., </em>a statute prohibited the unauthorized use of \u201c \u2018any horse, mare, colt, gelding, mule, ass, sheep, hog, ox or cow, or any carriage, wagon, buggy, cart, boat, craft, vessel, or any other vehicle including motor vehicle as defined in the laws of this State relating to such, or property whatsoever[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Wallace W, </em>333 Md. at 190, 634 A.2d 53 (citation omitted). A juvenile was adjudged delinquent for violating this statute by taking money from a classmate\u2019s purse. The Court of Appeals held that <em>ejusdem generis </em>applied because the list created two groups\u2014\u2022 livestock and vehicles that travel on land or water\u2014and the \u201cother property\u201d mentioned in the statute should be understood to be other property \u201cin the \u2018same class or general nature\u2019 as livestock and land or water vehicles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 634 A.2d 53. It rejected the State\u2019s argument that the juvenile\u2019s unauthorized use of the money in the purse fell within the statute because that reading would mean that <em>\u201call </em>property would be subject to the unauthorized use statute,\u201d contrary to the recognized purpose of the statute to single out \u201cmobile\u201d personal property for special treatment. <em>See id. </em>at 193-94, 634 A.2d 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In another criminal case, <em>Choi v. State, </em>316 Md. 529, 547, 560 A.2d 1108 (1989), the governing statute made it a misdemeanor \u201c \u2018to make a false statement, report, or complaint\u2019 \u201d to police \u201c \u2018with intent to cause an investigation or other action to be taken as a result thereof.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) The Court of Appeals held that \u201cor other action\u201d meant an action \u201cof the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>same general nature as the initiation of an investigation,\u201d and did not mean making a false statement in response to a question from a police officer who was already investigating. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The doctrine was applied in a civil licensing case in <em>Linkus v. Md. State Bd. of Heating Ventilation, Air-Conditioning, Refrigeration Contractors, </em>114 Md.App. 262, 689 A.2d 1254 (1997). There, the statute permitted the licensing board to deny an application for a license for any one of 11 listed reasons. One of the enumerated reasons was if the applicant \u201c \u2018willfully or deliberately disregarded and violated building codes, electrical codes, or laws of the State or of any municipality, city, or county of the State[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 689 A.2d 1254 (citation omitted). When the Board denied Linkus\u2019 application based on his prior rape conviction,- the Court of Appeals applied <em>ejusdem generis </em>in holding that \u201cother laws of the State\u201d did not include all criminal laws, but meant laws similar to electrical and building codes. <em>See id. </em>at 280-88, 689 A.2d 1254. The Court noted that the purpose of the statute was to ensure that contractors \u201cpossess[ed] the technical qualifications necessary competently to install and service HVACR systems.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 280, 689 A.2d 1254. The long list of other factors in the statute was consistent with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In <em>Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 558 A.2d 399 (1989), another civil case, the statute at issue provided that \u201c \u2018[t]he government of each county shall furnish an office for the sheriff and pay the necessary expenses for telephones, stationary] and for other purposes[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Rucker, </em>316 Md. at 294, 558 A.2d 399 (citation omitted). The Court of Appeals rejected the Attorney General\u2019s argument that \u201cother purposes\u201d included claims for tortious actions by deputy sheriffs. <em>See id. </em>at 295-96, 558 A.2d 399. Applying <em>ejusdem generis </em>to the statute, the Court held that the statute contemplated only office-related expenses comparable to those listed in the statute, all of which were \u201cnecessary for the operation of the sheriffs function.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The doctrine often has been rejected. <em>See, e.g., Wesley Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n v.

Most importantly, as we previously discussed, the <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp. </em>Court already has given a broader construction to the IC\u2019s power, holding that the IC may consider State policies regarding health care set by other agencies as a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in disapproving and modifying rates. <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp. </em>teaches us that the legislature did not intend that the enumerations in subsection (b)(3) would preclude the IC from considering State policy regarding health care that was not enumerated in those sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Although <em>ejusdem generis </em>was not explicitly argued in <em>Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>reasons for rejecting the doctrine are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>readily apparent. First, if the General Assembly had intended that \u201cother relevant factors\u201d included only actuarial factors, it could easily have so stated by using the phrase, \u201cother relevant actuarial factors.\u201d Second, the four factors listed in subsection (b)(3)(ii) differ in character from the readily identifiable list of \u201cthings\u201d or \u201cpersons\u201d featured in many other instances when <em>ejusdem generis </em>has been applied. <em>Cf., e.g., In re Wallace W., </em>333 Md. at 190-91, 634 A.2d 53 (specific nouns itemized different livestock and vehicles). The listed factors are not \u201cconcrete\u201d \u201cpersons, places, or things\u201d but rather general types of information. Nor is the list long or detailed enough to establish. that the legislature was attempting to restrict the IC to considering only \u201cother relevant actuarial information.\u201d <em>Cf. Linkus, </em>114 Md.App. at 280-81, 689 A.2d 1254 (list of 11 different findings that justified denial of license application, with no \u201ccatchall\u201d category listed.) We found no cases that applied the doctrine to such a short list of generalized information.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Insurers\u2019 Argument That HSCRC Has Exclusive Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Nor are we persuaded by the insurers argument that the HSCRC\u2019s authority to deny an insurer\u2019s application for the SAAC differential when its SAAC rates are not affordable curtails the IC\u2019s right to consider the SAAC differential in disapproving or modifying that insurer\u2019s rate proposal. Two agencies may take action within the ambit of their own powers to accomplish the same objective. <em>See Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>302 Md. at 419-20, 488 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">In disapproving the proposed rates, the IC acted strictly -within the confines of his authority to approve or disapprove rates of non-profit insurers, and did not encroach on the HSCRC\u2019s authority to establish hospital rates in doing so. We see no reason why the IC, acting within the scope of his legitimate power to approve insurance rates, cannot further the policy goal of the HSCRC to provide affordable health care to high risk individuals. <em>See id. </em>at 419, 488 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>942 (\u201c \u2018[h]is decisions are limited to that which he is directed to do by \u00a7 [14\u2014126(b)(3)(ii)]\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. La. Ins. Rating Comm\u2019n, </em>79 So.2d 888, 894 (La.Ct.App.1955) (in setting rates, insurance commissioner could take notice of deceptive advertising regarding premiums, even though Secretary of State had responsibility to enjoin deceptive practices); <em>In re Rate Filing of Blue Cross Hosp. Svc., Inc., </em>158 W.Va. 725, 214 S.E.2d 339, 344 (W.Va.1975)(although he could not set hospital rates, insurance commissioner could consider the rates charged by hospitals to Blue Cross in his rate approval capacity). We hold that, because the policy decision of the HSCRC related to the cost of health insurance to the insureds, it could be considered by the IC as one of the \u201cother relevant factors\u201d in the IC\u2019s exercise of his rate approval authority. <em>See </em>Ins. \u00a7 14-126(b) (3) (ii) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We do not agree with the insurers that the HSCRC improperly delegated authority over the SAAC differential to the IC. Although the IC considered Murray\u2019s testimony regarding the HSCRC\u2019s intent to subsidize the cost of the product, and the HSCRC\u2019s 1986 Final Decision recommending that the IC consider premium adjustments to accomplish this result, the IC\u2019s authority does not rest on this evidence. The IC\u2019s authority to consider the SAAC differential derives from the IC\u2019s authority under section 14-126(b)(2) to disapprove or modify insurance rates and to consider \u201cany other relevant factors\u201d in doing so, not from the HSCRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Nor are we persuaded by the insurers\u2019 argument that the HSCRC\u2019s authority to deny an insurer\u2019s application for the SAAC differential if its proposed rates are not affordable curtails the IC\u2019s authority to consider that insurer\u2019s rates, or to take into account the SAAC differential in that consideration. The HSCRC acted within its powers in setting hospital rates to establish and regulate the SAAC differential program, and the IC acted within his powers over insurance premium rates to disapprove a premium proposal that ignored the benefit the insurers received from this program. <em>See Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>302 Md. at 419-20, 488 A.2d 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Insurers\u2019 Out-of-State Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The insurers cite a handful of out-of-state cases that they claim \u201cdemonstrat[e] that an insurance commissioner\u2019s rate-making authority is limited to considering actuarial data and does not extend to public policy considerations unless expressly authorized by statute.\u201d <em>See Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Del., Inc. v. Elliott, </em>479 A.2d 843 (Del.Super.Ct.1984); <em>Med. Malpractice Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass. v. Comm\u2019r of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 43, 478 N.E.2d 936 (Mass.1985); <em>Am.

Jump, </em>44 Ohio St.2d 78, 337 N.E.2d 783 (Ohio, 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">To be sure, these cases all enforce limitations on the statutory authority of those insurance commissioners, and strike down actions that exceed such limitations. We have no quarrel with the proposition that insurance commissioners must observe statutory limitations on their authority. But the limitations enforced in the cited cases are not present in the Maryland statutory scheme or in the circumstances presented in this case. In particular, none of these cases address whether an insurance commissioner can consider as part of his ratemaking authority the economic benefit from a subsidy-like program such as the SAAC differential. Consequently, these cases do not dissuade us from our view that the IC acted properly in disapproving the rates proposed by the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Insurers\u2019 Argument That IC Improperly Considered The SAAC Differential As A Subsidy</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">The insurers also attack the IC\u2019s analysis as resting on the allegedly faulty premise that the SAAC differential is a subsidy for the SAAC products:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>As part of his endeavor to make it appear as though he engaged in a statistical analysis, the Commissioner refers to the value of the SAAC differential as income and as a subsidy, concluding that he is \u201crequired to consider all of the income earned by an insurance company as a result of the insurance contracts at issue, and there is no logical reason to distinguish revenue received as a subsidy for a product from revenue received by means of a premium payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The insurers insist that the IC is wrong in characterizing the SAAC differential as a subsidy and income, because it is instead a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">discount on hospital rates offered by the HSCRC as an incentive for carriers to participate in the HSCRC\u2019s substantial, available and affordable coverage program. The value of the differential is based on the amount of hospital bad debt averted by SAAC contracts, and bears absolutely no relationship to the rates charged by insurers or the cost to insurers of offering SAAC contracts.... Although the hospital-rate discount results in a financial benefit to the participating carrier, it is not income and it is not a subsidy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The insurers\u2019 argument elevates terminology over substance. Although the SAAC differential may not be a direct \u201csubsidy\u201d because it comes in the form of a discount, rather than a direct payment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the concept of the SAAC differential is very similar to that of a subsidy. The very structure of the program\u2014discounts in return for offering SAAC products\u2014 makes it clear that the HSCRC designed the program with the intent that insurers who offered a SAAC product would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>receive a financial benefit to better enable them to offer the SAAC product at an affordable price. Indeed, the SAAC differential may more properly be characterized as an incentive program, designed to encourage insurers to offer a SAAC product. In our view, however, what is critical is not the terminology, but rather, the fact that the insurers collectively received approximately $30 million in value because they offered insurance for high risk individual subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The IC properly treated the SAAC differential as an indirect subsidy, and considered it similar to income in comparing the insurers\u2019 premium income to its loss experience and its expenses. This was a proper method for determining whether the proposed rates were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The Insurers\u2019 Argument That the IC Did Not Consider The Proposed Premiums In Relation To Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The insurers also focus on the requirement in section 14-126 that the IC, in evaluating whether the proposed rates are excessive, must measure them \u201cin relation to benefits.\u201d They argue that \u201cthe [IC] did not find the rates to be excessive \u2018in relation to\u2019 the benefits purchased, the [IC] found the rates to be excessive in light of the value derived by a hospital purchaser differential offered by the HSCRC.\u201d We think that the insurers, in making this argument, ignore important aspects of the IC\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The IC quoted the MIA finding that the \u201cproposed rates were excessive in relation to the benefits provided, considering the value received by CareFirst of Maryland and GHMSI from the 4% SAAC discount.\u201d In his opinion, he also made it clear that he considered the premium increases to be excessive in relation to the premiums approved at the last filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">After setting forth the chart showing the premium amounts and percentage increases, broken down by age of the insured, the IC concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The proposed rates would have involved large increases if the existing SAAC enrollees had not been allowed to continue in the old product. For example, under CareFirst of Maryland\u2019s proposed rates, a <em>55 </em>year old single enrollee would have experienced a $491 dollar a month increase, (374%) if forced to purchase the new product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">There is no doubt that the IC was familiar with the terms of the insurance offered, for he must approve every form of insurance that the insurers offer. <em>See </em>Ins. \u00a7 14\u2014126(b)(3)(i).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Discerning the terms of the coverage, therefore, is a matter within his area of expertise. <em>See In re N.C. Auto. Rate Admin. Office, </em>278 N.C. 302, 180 S.E.2d 155, 167 (N.C. 1971)(\u201cin making what must be considered in large measure a policy or judgment decision, the Commissioner [has] the benefit of his own continuous study and knowledge of changing conditions\u201d). Given this expertise, for example, we can infer that in deciding that a $491 monthly increase for a 55 year old single enrollee was excessive, the IC was taking into account that cost in relation to the benefits offered under the contract. The same is true of the proposed rates for the other categories shown on the chart set forth in the IC\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The Insurers\u2019 Criticism Of The IC\u2019s Methodology In Setting New Rates</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In challenging the IC\u2019s methodology for setting new rates, the insurers return to their \u201cno statistical analysis\u201d theme, insisting that the IC acted outside his authority because he engaged in no statistical analysis in setting a new rate. They argue that he \u201cselected a rate increase that he felt was affordable in light of the price of other products in the market.\u201d According to the insurers,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the sum total of the [IC\u2019s] analysis to arrive at the level of premium approved is set forth on page 15 of the Order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac-\">As has been noted there is no guidance in the HSCRC regulations concerning the \u201caffordability\u201d component of the program, and thus the MIA exercised some discretion in determining what rate to approve for the new SAAC product. The decision involved the balancing of affordability concerns, which weigh toward keeping the rates comparable to other \u201cmedically underwritten\u201d products, but at the same time ensuring that the SAAC product is not priced so low as to undercut or destabilize other regulated products by attracting not just high risk individuals but healthy ones as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">This is not a statistical analysis, much less one that compares the rates to the benefits available under the contract. The Commissioner clearly departed from statistics and into the realm of public policy when he decided to disapprove CareFirst\u2019s rates based on affordability concerns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">To avoid confusion, we pause here to clarify the difference between this argument and the insurers\u2019 previously rejected argument that the IC acted outside his authority and failed to use statistical analysis in determining that the proposed rates were excessive. As we understand it, the instant argument is that the IC, having decided that the rates were excessive, used improper methodology in setting a new rate. We again reject the insurers\u2019 argument, however, because the insurers have not met their burden to show that the methodology was improper and because market factors are \u201cother relevant factors.\u201d We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Dissatisfied with the analysis performed by the IC in setting the SAAC rates, the insurers call for more statistical analysis. Unfortunately, however, they do not offer suggestions as to what the proper statistical analysis should be. They say only that \u201c[t]he statute requires a comparison of the rates and contract benefits,\u201d citing no cases or other authority to explain how that should be done. They criticize the IC because he \u201cfound the rates to be excessive in light of\u2019 the SAAC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>differential, saying that when done properly, \u201cthe [IC\u2019s] analysis is an actuarial one.\u201d Their only explanation of this rather broad assertion appears in a footnote in which they compare the IC\u2019s power under section 14-126 to his power when setting rates for products offered by \u201cfor profit\u201d insurers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">The term \u201cexcessive\u201d in general ratemaking [principles] means excessive from an actuarial standpoint, even when there is no statutory language directly tying the determination of whether rates are excessive to the contract benefits as in \u00a7 14-126. For example, in Maryland\u2019s general rate-making statute the term \u201cexcessive\u201d means a rate that is \u201cunreasonably high for the insurance provided.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Ins, \u00a7 11\u2014306(b). This is typical of the definition of \u201cexcessive\u201d found in ratemaking statutes in other jurisdictions, which define excessive rates as those that are unreasonably high for the risk involved or the insurance provided. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">This elaboration offers us no edification about the sort of statistical analysis the insurers perceive to be more appropriate under section 14-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The only methodology the insurers even remotely suggest for deciding whether rates are excessive in relation to benefits appears in a quote from a leading insurance authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">In setting rates, the commissioner generally employs a basic formula for determining the ratio between net premium and expense loading, the two component parts of the premium. This ratio can only be established after determining expense requirements and what constitutes a reasonable profit. The formula applied by the commission must be mathematically sound, and deviations therefrom may only be made when justified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">5 <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>\u00a7 69:13 (1996)(footnotes omitted). The insurers fail to articulate, however, how the IC\u2019s analysis falls short of that recommended in <em>Couch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">To the extent that the insurers are complaining that the IC did not determine what the expense requirements were, the record refutes that contention. As the passage from the IC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>opinion excerpted below demonstrates, the IC did take into account the expenses and loss experience of the insurers. He also took into account premiums received by the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">It is also fair to infer that, as <em>Couch </em>recommends, the IC determined what would be a \u201creasonable profit\u201d or, in nonprofit terms, a reasonable margin for reserve needs. The IC computed the net benefit to the insurers from the SAAC differential over the last several years, after taking into account the losses on the SAAC contracts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">[D]ata from CareFirst and HSCRC show that for the year 2000, the value of the SAAC discount, <em>i.e., </em>the value of the 4% reduction in hospital rates, was approximately $26 million for CareFirst of Maryland, Inc. and $4.6 million for GHMSI. According to the CareFirst of Maryland 2001 SAAC application, in 2000 incurred hospital claims attributable to the 848 SAAC contracts were $1.3 million. Care-First\u2019s testimony was that total medical expenses plus administrative expenses for these 848 contracts were $2.2 million. Taking into account the $1.4 million in premiums collected from the SAAC subscribers, CareFirst of Maryland lost approximately $800,000 on these 848 contracts, but received hospital discounts worth $26 million. For 2001, CareFirst of Maryland projects a loss on both new and old SAAC products of about $1.4 million in 2001 based on the rates approved by the MIA. In 2000, GHMSI collected $2.9 million in premiums from 979 contracts, paid claims and incurred expenses of $4.1 million, for a loss of approximately $1.2 million, but received discounts worth $4.6 million. In 2001 GHMSI losses on the old and new products are expected to be almost $2.1 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">In summary the MIA disapproved the requested rate increases not because it disagreed that both the existing and new SAAC products had and would continue to lose money, but because any such losses, collectively projected to be about $3.5 million in 2001, were well below the value of the SAAC discount to CareFirst of Maryland and GHMSI, which totals about $30 million.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>There is no contention by the insurers that the millions of dollars in benefits from the SAAC differential, combined with the premium revenue, would be even close to offset by the expenses of the SAAC program, even at the lower rates set by the IC. Indeed, aside from their insistence that the SAAC differential cannot be counted by the IC because it is not \u201ca relevant factor,\u201d the insurers do not contend that the rates set by the IC deprive them of the ability to either meet expenses or accrue a reasonable margin for reserve needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">We think it incumbent upon the insurers, when challenging the quasi-legislative action of the IC in setting insurance rates, to show clearly how the IC deviated from his authority. <em>See Pub. Svc. Comm\u2019n of Md. v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. </em>Co., 273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691 (1974) (because ratemaking is a legislative function, a court will not substitute its judgment for a public service commission \u201cexcept upon clear and satisfactory evidence that it is unlawful or unreasonable\u201d). <em>See also Office of People\u2019s Counsel v.

In the absence of any showing of what a more statistical analysis would entail, and what the IC failed to do in this case, we hold that the insurers did not meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">To be sure, the IC did not select a particular profit margin, and determine the new rates based on that margin. As the IC said, his decision in setting the new rates involved the \u201cbalancing of affordability concerns, which weigh toward keeping the rates comparable to other \u2018medically underwritten\u2019 products, but at the same time ensuring that the SAAC product is not priced so low as to undercut or destabilize other regulated products by attracting not just high risk individuals but healthy ones as well.\u201d This comparison to other rates is the only thing about the IC\u2019s methodology that the insurers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>identify as objectionable. Ironically, however, the IC\u2019s decision to take into account the price of other insurance products resulted in the IC setting the rates for the SAAC products higher than he would have set them using traditional methods such as that suggested in <em>Couch.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Given the size of the SAAC differential (at least $26 million for CareFirst, and $4.6 million for GHMSI), it is evident from the IC\u2019s opinion, and the insurers do not contend otherwise, that if the rate were simply set to insure a reasonable profit margin for the insurers, the SAAC rates would be lower than the IC actually set them. We explain, starting with a review of the standards for setting rates.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">As the Supreme Court of North Carolina articulated: Various standards exist for the making and use of insurance rates.... Three basic principles of law pertain to the setting of insurance rates: (1) the Commissioner must set rates that will produce a fair and reasonable profit and no more; (2) what constitutes a fair and reasonable profit \u201cinvolves consideration of profits accepted by the investment market as reasonable in business ventures of comparable risk\u201d; and (3) the underwriting business, which includes the collection and investment of premiums, is the only basis for calculating the profit provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-6\"><em>N.C.

The amount of business done is measured by the total premiums actually received. <em>See id.; see also In re N.C. Fire Ins.

Auto. Rate Admin. Office, </em>180 S.E.2d at 164 (reasonableness of profit governed by margin for underwriting profit; 5% margin had been \u201cgenerally approved in the industry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The record shows that the insurers received far more than a reasonable profit, or, more accurately in this non-profit context, far more than a reasonable amount to add to reserves. In 2000, CareFirst\u2019s total medical expenses and administrative expenses for the SAAC products were $2.2 million. It collected $1.4 million in premiums on those products. If we calculate the value of the SAAC differential based on the figures for CareFirst\u2019s costs and expenses through December 31, 2000, which were the most recently available figures when Care-First presented its rate filing to the IC, the SAAC differential was worth at least $26 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">When that $26 million SAAC differential is reduced by the maximum amount that CareFirst could be obligated to use as funding for the Short-Term Prescription Drug Subsidy Plan, the net SAAC differential, plus premium income, minus expenses, leaves a \u201cbalance\u201d for CareFirst to add to its reserve that equals a double-digit multiple of premium income, and therefore grossly exceeds what would be \u201caccepted by the investment market as reasonable in business ventures of comparable risk.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(5% of premium provided a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>reasonable and adequate profit); <em>N.C.

L.Rev. 97 (1982)(discussing cases).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like CareFirst, the return for GHMSI\u2019s SAAC products also would be a multiple of premium earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In treating the SAAC differential as part of the income earned on the SAAC policies, we recognize that the SAAC differential, because it was a discount on hospital bills for all of the insurers\u2019 subscribers, was affected by the volume of non-SAAC policies sold by them. On the other hand, as we have said before, there would be no discount, and the insurers would have been charged the full standard hospital rate, if the insurers had not made SAAC coverage available. More importantly, the SAAC differential program was created to insure the availability of affordable insurance for high risk individual subscribers. Under these circumstances, we consider it logical, reasonable, and within his statutory authority for the IC, in setting rates, to include the SAAC differential in his analysis of the income derived from the SAAC policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We recognize that, in setting the exact rates, the IC did take into account the market rates of underwritten products. The IC\u2019s reason for doing so\u2014his concern that he not create a market situation in which the SAAC rates were more attractive to consumers than the underwritten rates\u2014was a legitimate one. Although market pricing is, in the first instance, the province of the insurance company, section 14-126 gives the IC the authority to modify rates, and thus he becomes the rate-setter. Under these circumstances, the IC was faced with the problem of setting insurance rates in an unusual situation\u2014a subsidy-like benefit to the insurers created an anomaly in the market. Pricing the SAAC product so that those subscribers qualifying for group rates remained as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>group subscribers, rather than becoming SAAC subscribers, achieved the legitimate goal of normalcy and stability in the insurance market.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Insurers\u2019 Argument That Other Legislation Reflects The General Assembly\u2019s Intent That The IC Not Regulate The SAAC Differential</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The insurers would have us find that the legislature, in enacting a 2000 statute and defeating a 2002 House Bill, intended that the IC disregard the SAAC differential in his review of rates. For the reasons we explain below, neither of these legislative events persuades us that the General Assembly intended that the IC be precluded from considering the SAAC differential as an \u201cother relevant factor\u201d in his review of rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The insurers point out that the General Assembly did not enact any legislation directly relating to the SAAC program until 1997, when it authorized the Maryland Health Care Access And Cost Commission (the \u201cHCC\u201d) to develop a uniform set of benefits for SAAC contracts. <em>See </em>1997 Md. Laws ch. 245. In 1999, the General Assembly established the Task Force to Study the Non-Group Health Insurance Market in Maryland (the \u201cTask Force\u201d), to evaluate the SAAC program and make recommendations to the General Assembly. <em>See </em>1999 Md. Laws ch. 602. The Task Force recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IC should \u201c[r]equire a SAAC carrier\u2019s open enrollment premiums to be <em>at least 5% </em>higher than the small group market premiums or benefit-equivalent medically underwritten, individual product premiums[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Legislation codifying the Task Force recommendations with respect to the SAAC program was proposed in 2000; under that legislation, a carrier desiring to issue a SAAC contract would have been required to submit an application for approval by the Commissioner, and to comply with any regulation promulgated by the Commissioner. <em>See </em>H.B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1199, 2000 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md.2000). The proposed legislation was defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Instead, in 2000, the General Assembly established the Short-Term Prescription Drug Subsidy Plan, funded with a portion of the value of the SAAC differential. <em>See </em>2000 Md. Laws ch. 565. That legislation required carriers receiving the SAAC differential to contribute $5.4 million attributable to the benefits from the differential to a prescription drug plan for Maryland\u2019s senior citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In 2001, the General Assembly again enacted legislation concerning the SAAC differential. <em>See </em>2001 Md. Laws ch. 135. The 2001 legislation changed the amount of the contribution to the Short-Term Prescription Drug Subsidy Plan, requiring each carrier to contribute an amount equal to 37.5% of the value of the differential. <em>See </em>Ins. \u00a7 15-606(c)(2). Also in 2001, the General Assembly (1) required carriers that deny coverage under a medically underwritten plan to provide the individual with information regarding the availability of substantial, available and affordable coverage, and (2) directed the Commissioner to adopt regulations to implement this requirement. <em>See </em>2001 Md. Laws ch. 389, <em>codified at </em>Ins. \u00a7 15-606.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The insurers contend that we should read this pattern of legislative action adversely to the IC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">Through the legislative enactments of the past five years, the General Assembly has taken steps to remove certain portions of SAAC from the exclusive regulatory power of the HSCRC. The General Assembly delegated to the HCC the authority to establish minimum standards for substantial coverage, placed certain notification requirements on carriers participating in SAAC, directed that a portion of the value of the SAAC differential be used to subsidize a prescription drug plan, and rejected an amendment that would have required SAAC rates to be set at a certain level and increased the [IC\u2019s] regulatory authority over SAAC contracts. This legislative history amply demonstrates that the General Assembly did not intend for the [IC] to have regulatory authority over the use of the SAAC differential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The insurers also rely on 2002 legislation, House Bill 1207, which proposed adding language to section 14-126, giving the IC the authority to consider the value of the SAAC differential in setting rates. <em>See </em>H.B. 1207, (.3, 2002 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Md.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We do not find the insurers\u2019 legislative history argument persuasive. First, only 37.5% of the differential was diverted to the Short Term Prescription Drug Plan, and as the IC points out, \u201c[e]ven after devoting [this amount], ... the insurers retain the remaining 62.5% of the SAAC differential, in the projected amount for 2001 of $16.9 million for CareFirst and $3.1 million for GHMSI.\u201d As the IC readily recognizes, any amount used for the Short Term Prescription Drug Plan could not be considered by the IC as a subsidy to the insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Second, the defeat of House Bill 1207 cannot be read to mean that the General Assembly intended to restrict the scope of the IC\u2019s authority. As the IC points out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATB\">that Bill would have enacted sweeping changes to the governance structure of non-profit health services plans, far beyond any amendments that it would have made to \u00a7 14-126. Most significantly, the Bill would have enabled the Governor to appoint eight of seventeen Board members for every Board of Directors of a non-profit health services plan, allowed the Governor to select the Chairman of the Board ..., limited the compensation for the Board and its Chairman, and provided new authority to the Attorney General to seek judicial control over the plan\u2019s assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axs\">We agree that, given the multiple provisions of this defeated bill, we should draw no inference about the General Assembly\u2019s intent regarding the IC\u2019s authority to consider the SAAC differential in exercising his rate approval and rate setting functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the IC acted within his authority, both in disapproving the rates proposed by the insurers, and in modifying those rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.
