(the \u201cPost\u201d), was public information pursuant to the Maryland Public Information Act (\u201cMPIA\u201d), Md.Code Ann. (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), \u00a7 10-611, <em>et seq., </em>of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The Post, in turn, contests certain limitations on the records to be disclosed. The County presents six questions and the Post two,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have distilled into one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Did the circuit court err in its determinations regarding the Post\u2019s requests for information pursuant to the MPIA?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We affirm the circuit court\u2019s decision as to the Commanders\u2019 Information Reports, the closed Human Relations Commission records that were the subject of public hearings, the eight closed Police Department investigative reports, and the risk management database contents and fields; and we vacate, in part, the circuit court\u2019s decision regarding the police roster.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">This case involves numerous Post requests for police-related records made pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-611, <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The County\u2019s denial of those requests resulted in two lawsuits, filed pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-623(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which are the subject of this appeal. The parties are in agreement that there are no material facts in dispute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The following factual summary is not in chronological order. It is organized according to the subject matter of the Post\u2019s MPIA requests to the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">On January 12, 2000, a Post staff writer requested copies of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Commanders\u2019 Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Reports (\u201cCIRs\u201d), also known as the daily Commander\u2019s Log, for the period between December 10, 1999, and January 10, 2000. The County denied that request on March 24, 2000, stating that the purpose of the CIRs was \u201cto provide a vehicle for Police Department supervisors to inform Police Department management of matters that management must be made aware of to effectively manage the affairs of the Police Department.\u201d The County went on to state that CIRs were only retained for thirty days. It cited SG \u00a7 10-615(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a basis for the County\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">On July 14, 2000, the same staff writer requested a \u201croster of all sworn officers employed by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, including each officer\u2019s full name, rank, badge number, job assignment and date of hire.\u201d By letter dated August 16, 2000, the County denied the Post\u2019s request, stating that the request was \u201ccontrary to the public interest\u201d and sought \u201cpersonnel information ... not subject to public inspection.\u201d The County cited SG \u00a7 10\u2014616(i)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as the justification for its denial. In the alternative, the County offered the Post \u201cdocuments that detail the number of sworn officers, the allocation of sworn officers to the various districts and other assignments, and the number of sworn officers holding the various ranks.\u201d Further, the County indicated that it could provide to the Post \u201ca list of all County employees without the job classification of the employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In May 2000, the staff writer obtained access, without filing an MPIA request, to a box of Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission (\u201cHRC\u201d) records containing citizen complaints of police misconduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> HRC permitted the report<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>er to look at closed cases that had resulted in public hearings. The staff winter subsequently requested unredacted copies of a subset of those records. Instead, the County provided redacted copies of HRC\u2019s records, excluding the identity of the officers, the complainants, the witnesses, and investigatory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On August 11, 2000, the Post requested investigative reports from eight cases related to \u201cpolice-involved shootings and in-custody death cases\u201d compiled by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, Criminal Investigations Division (\u201cCID\u201d). The County orally advised the Post that its request had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On June 28, 2000, the Post requested an electronic copy of the County\u2019s risk management case tracking database, including \u201call records included in the database and all fields in the database.\u201d The County denied that request on July 21, 2000, citing interagency communications and attorney work-product exemptions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>On July 25, 2000, the Post requested \u201c[a] printout of the file layout of the risk management case tracking database, listing the fields by name and description.\u201d The County denied this request on August 21, 2000, stating that it did not own or maintain the database and that the owner, Trigon Administrators, Inc. (\u201cTrigon\u201d), considered the database \u201cconfidential proprietary information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In response to the County\u2019s denials, the Post filed two lawsuits in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The first lawsuit (Case No. CAL 00-20465), filed against the County and the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department on September 5, 2000, sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on the County\u2019s failure to make the CIRs public.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The second lawsuit (Case No. CAL 00-22133) was filed on September 28, 2000, against the County, the County Police Department, and HRC. It sought declaratory and injunctive relief based on the County\u2019s refusal to make public the roster of all sworn officers; HRC\u2019s documents relating to police misconduct; the investigative reports compiled by CID; and documents relating to the risk management case tracking database.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The circuit court consolidated the two cases on December 19, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">On August 30, 2001, following oral argument on the Post\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYq\">But suffice it to say, as far as the Commander\u2019s Information Reports are concerned, these are generated and they\u2019re circulated, and they\u2019re circulated to individuals within the department. And I understand their circulation, their circulation are not restricted to a small cadre of people who are in only a need-to-know venue. It\u2019s passed from person to person. And obviously people who don\u2019t need to know see these reports. Therefore, this Court finds that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>reports are public information. So long as they are going to be created by a Commanders [sic], it is the Court\u2019s view that they are available to the Washington Post or any other entity who operates pursuant to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Therefore, I\u2019m going to grant the Motion with respect to the Commander\u2019s Information Report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">As to the police roster, I also grant the movant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment but with this caveat and this restriction. For the protection of individuals who may be in sensitive positions, the County may disclose separately all the names of all individuals who work for Prince Georges County in a public safety role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">As far as the Humans Relations records are concerned, I meant that very clearly that the horses are out, they\u2019re running around. Unfortunately for [the County counsel] and his boss they had nothing to do with it. The protocol was not followed by [the Post staff writer] who looked at things, and things that he saw that were within his universe of request by the Washington Post, I grant their Motion that they be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">Investigatory files, I have grave concerns about the investigatory files. I find that I am going to deny to [sic] the Motion for Summary Judgment. I don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s been enough information brought forth by the movant to say that the Court should grant that motion, and I would note that 10-618 doesn\u2019t require that the custodian give any explanation for why to deny what they deny. They have a right to deny it if they feel it\u2019s in the public interest and investigatory files are very sensitive files, and I find that they have\u2014they, meaning the County\u2014has sustained its burden for showing that it\u2019s in the public interest that these files not be disclosed, and that burden has not been overcome by the movant in this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">The closed cases give me some concern. I do not know legally what would be the value to the public of nondisclosure of closed files, and the County has not sustained its burden in that, so I grant the Motion for Summary Judgment as to those closed investigative files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The Risk Management database, I grant the Washington Post Motion in part and I deny in part. And here\u2019s what I mean by that. Any attorney/client information or work product of attorneys that\u2019s included in that database is not subject to disclosure. As far as intellectual property is concerned and the proprietary rights, I understand it is easier for the County to say, well, we have contracted with X company and therefore X company has said that you can\u2019t have it, and that\u2019s not on us, that\u2019s on X company. I think that\u2019s a sham. And the Court doesn\u2019t like that type of sham because the party who contracts with another party can, by contract language, build in what may be disclosed and what may not be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">On the other hand, at no time would I wish to put a company at risk as far as intellectual property is concerned. Therefore, the order of this Court is that any information that\u2019s not attorney/client information is not privileged as to work product and is not intellectual property that resides within the Risk Management database may be disclosed to the Washington Post.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">Now I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be back again arguing what qualifies for that, and I don\u2019t mind that because I need to see specifically what it is. But we cannot place a vendor at risk with intellectual property, nor do I intend for this Court to place the attorneys in the Office of Law at risk by disclosing their work product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Based on the Post\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court issued a written order on October 3, 2001, granting summary judgment in favor of the Post with regard to the CIRs; the names of all individuals who work for the County in a public safety role; the unredacted HRC records; the eight closed CID records; and the requested information from the County risk management case tracking database contents and fields that were not protected by the attorney-client privilege,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the attorney work-product doctrine, or that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Trigon\u2019s proprietary intellectual property. The County filed a notice of appeal on October 24, 2001. On October 24, 2001, the County filed, and the Post contested, a motion to stay enforcement of the court\u2019s October 3, 2001 order, which was granted on November 7, 2001. The Post filed a cross-appeal on October 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">This case was decided by the circuit court based on the Post\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Summary judgment \u201cis used to dispose of cases when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cA genuine issue of material fact is a factual dispute that is real and not imagined.\u201d <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>139 Md.App. 470, 483, 776 A.2d 80 (2001), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>368 Md. 434, 795 A.2d 715 (2002). A material fact is one that would \u201caffect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). \u201cSummary judgment may not be defeated by a dispute as to a fact that is immaterial.\u201d <em>Schmerling, </em>139 Md.App. at 483, 776 A.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">When reviewing a court\u2019s decision on summary judgment, we \u201cmust review the facts, and all inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable\u201d to the nonmoving party. <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 695, 785 A.2d 726 (2001). \u201cEvidentiary matters, credibility issues, and material facts which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>in dispute cannot properly be disposed of by summary judgment.\u201d <em>Underwood-Gary v. Mathews, </em>366 Md. 660, 685, 785 A.2d 708 (2001) (quoting <em>Frederick Road Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 93-94, 756 A.2d 963 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Because there is no dispute of material fact, \u201cour review is limited to whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 227, 783 A.2d 206 (2001) (citation omitted). We must look to whether the court correctly interpreted and applied the relevant law to the uncontested material facts. <em>Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194 (2001). \u201cAs with all questions of law, we review this matter <em>de novo.\u201d Fister, </em>366 Md. at 210, 783 A.2d 194. Moreover, \u201c[i]n appeals from grants of summary judgment, Maryland appellate courts, as a general rule, will consider only the grounds upon which the lower court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>PaineWebber Inc. v. East, </em>863 Md. 408, 422, 768 A.2d 1029 (2001). In cases interpreting an MPIA request, \u201c[f]acts necessary to the determination of a motion [for summary judgment] may be placed before the court by pleadings, affidavit, deposition, answers to interrogatories, admission of facts, stipulations and concessions.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Davison, </em>135 Md.App. 152, 157, 761 A.2d 1013 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The MPIA, originally enacted and codified in 1970, was modeled after the federal Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. 552, enacted by Congress in 1966. In FOIA cases, the trial court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">may grant summary judgment on the basis of government affidavits or declarations that explain why requested information falls within a claimed exemption, as long as the affidavits or declarations are sufficiently detailed, non-conclusory, and submitted in good faith, and as long as a plaintiff has no significant basis for questioning their reliability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\"><em>Center for Nat\u2019l Sec. Studies v. United States Department of Justice, </em>215 F.Supp.2d 94, 99 (D.D.C.2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">A. MPIA</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The MPIA provides that \u201c[a]ll persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> SG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00a7 10-612(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals in <em>Fioretti v. Maryland State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258, 262 (1998) (citation omitted), reiterated that \u201c \u2018the provisions of the [MPIA] reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u2019 \u201d \u201cThe intent of the MPIA in favor of disclosure of public records is unmistakable.\u201d <em>Baltimore v. Burke, </em>67 Md.App. 147, 153, 506 A.2d 683, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 118, 507 A.2d 631 (1986). Therefore, as the Court of Appeals has further explained, the provisions of the statute \u201cmust be liberally construed ... in order to effectuate the [MPIA\u2019s] broad remedial purpose!,]\u201d <em>A.S. Abell Pub. Co. v. Mezzanote, </em>297 Md. 26, 32, 464 A.2d 1068 (1983), and in favor of permitting inspection of a public record,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cwith the least cost and least delay to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>person or governmental unit that requests the inspection.\u201d <em>Kirwan v.

If, however, the custodian denies public access to the requested information, the public agency \u201chas the burden of sustaining a decision to deny inspection of a public record[.]\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> SG \u00a7 10-623(b)(2)(1); <em>see Office of the Governor v.

This is a legitimate and necessary task essential to the operation of a democratic system. In accomplishing this goal, members of the news media will be performing their duties at many of the events in which the Department participates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">1/300.10 ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmW\">The Department shall actively seek a cooperative climate in which the media may obtain information on matters of public interest in a manner which does not hamper police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>operations.

Generally, a description of those circumstances which are not legally privileged and which will not prejudice the rights of suspects or interfere with an investigation will be offered.

It further contends that disclosure of the CIRs is exempt under the personnel records exemption, SG \u00a7 10\u2014616(i), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the investigations exemption, SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(l)(i).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The County explains that the release of the CIRs to the public would be contrary to public policy, because their disclosure would induce a chilling effect on the production of \u201cfrank and honest reporting\u201d in CIRs. The County also asserts that the CIRs are destroyed after thirty days. Instead of providing CIRs to the media, the County explains that it provides the Post with a weekly \u201clist of every crime that has occurred\u201d and press releases regarding any \u201cserious incidents that require police action or involvement\u201d within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, depending on the day the incident occurred.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The Post argues that the CIRs do not contain exempted information and that no evidence suggests that they contain \u201cconfidential advice or deliberations\u201d that satisfies the executive privilege doctrine. It asserts that the CIRs contain \u201cfactual summaries of events ... and contain[ ] no information whatsoever about the County\u2019s deliberative process.\u201d In the event that any exempt material is included within the CIRs, the Post contends that the County has an obligation to redact those portions, pursuant to SG \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(3)(iii), rather than deny the entire MPIA request.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that the executive privilege doctrine is \u201crooted in the separation of powers principle set forth in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d <em>Office of the Governor, </em>360 Md. at 557, 759 A.2d 249. Accordingly, \u201cif the records here at issue, or any part of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>are non-disclosable under the executive privilege doctrine, then such records or parts of records are exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615(1) of the [MPIA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that case, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">The doctrine of executive privilege, in addition to protecting military and diplomatic secrets, is chiefly designed to protect confidential advisory and deliberative communications to government officials. This Court in the <em>Hamilton </em>case thus explained (287 Md. at 558, 414 A.2d at 922):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK8\">\u201cThe necessity for some protection from disclosure clearly extends to confidential advisory and deliberative communications between officials and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon future governmental action. A fundamental part of the decisional process is the analysis of different options and alternatives. Advisory communications, from a subordinate to a governmental officer, which examine and analyze these choices, are often essential to this process. The making of candid communications by the subordinate may well be hampered if their contents are expected to become public knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">After reviewing cases in the United States Supreme Court and other courts, we pointed out in <em>Hamilton [v. Verdow, </em>287 Md. 544, 414 A.2d 914 (1980) ] that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">\u201cthe cases throughout the country, both federal and state, have recognized the doctrine of executive privilege which, in addition to state and military secrets, gives a measure of protection to the deliberative and mental processes of decision-makers.\u201d [Hamilton,] 287 Md. at 561, 414 A.2d at 924.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The Court went on in <em>Hamilton </em>to hold that the privilege \u201cis for the benefit of the public and not the governmental officials who claim the privilege\u201d (287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 924), that the privilege is not absolute, and that in \u201cmany situations the courts have, engaged in a balancing process, weighing the need for confidentiality against the ... need for disclosure and the impact of nondisclosure upon the fair administration of justice.\u201d 287 Md. at 563, 414 A.2d at 925. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>We also held in <em>Hamilton </em>that when a government official makes a formal claim of executive privilege for confidential communications \u201cof an advisory or deliberative nature, there is a presumptive privilege, with the burden upon those seeking to compel disclosure.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Turning to factual documents as opposed to documents of an advisory or deliberative nature, we held in <em>Hamilton </em>that \u201cordinarily, \u2018memoranda consisting only of compiled factual material\u2019 \u201d are disclosable, 287 Md. at 564, 414 A.2d at 925, quoting <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 87, 93 S.Ct. 827, 836, 35 L.Ed.2d 119, 132 (1973). We recognized in <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 564-565, 414 A.2d at 925-926, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVA\">\u201cmaterial cannot always \u2018easily be separated into fact finding and decision making categories,\u2019 <em>Boeing Airplane Company v. Coggeshall, supra, </em>280 F.2d 654 at 662. Moreover, some factual material is entitled to a degree of protection under the privilege, although not to the same extent as opinions and recommendations. This would include facts obtained upon promises or understandings of confidentiality, investigative facts underlying and intertwined with opinions and advice, and facts the disclosure of which would impinge on the deliberative process. In these situations, the government\u2019s asserted reasons for nondisclosure are weighed against the litigant\u2019s need for discovery in light of the particular circumstances of each case. <em>Frankenhauser v.

Rarely, however, will a given document reflect purely deliberative or policy-making processes with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>out factual matters.... The [MPIA] similarly requires agencies to utilize the principle of severability in responding to requests for public records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In fact, the MPIA provides that a custodian shall \u201cpermit inspection of any part of the record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d SG \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(3)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We find no evidence that the information contained in the CIRs would be considered \u201cconfidential advisory and deliberative communications between officials and those who assist them in formulating and deciding upon future governmental action.\u201d <em>Hamilton, </em>287 Md. at 558, 414 A.2d 914. Based on those cases, we perceive no error in not recognizing executive privilege as a basis for a blanket denial of the CIRs and therefore we must consider other exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The \u201cinteragency and intra-agency\u201d exemption cited by the County permits the denial of public information when \u201cany part of an interagency or intra-agency letter or memorandum ... would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the unit.\u201d SG \u00a7 10\u2014618(b). As explained in <em>Office of the Governor, </em>360 Md. at 551, 759 A.2d 249, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">permissible exemption for interagency and intra-agency letters or memoranda to some extent reflects that part of the executive privilege doctrine encompassing letters, memoranda or similar internal government documents containing confidential opinions, deliberations, advice or recommendations from one governmental employee or official to another official for the purpose of assisting the latter official in the decision-making function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u201cUnder the language of the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), which contains an exemption for interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters and which is worded the same as \u00a7 10-618(b) of the [MPIA], the courts have held that the exemption is limited to documents created by government agencies or agents, or by outside consultants called upon by a government agency \u2018to assist it in internal decisionmaking.\u2019 \u201d <em>Office of the Governor, </em>360 Md. at 552, 759 A.2d 249 (quoting <em>County of Madison v.

Attached to that letter was a copy of a CIR that included descriptions of the suspects, the general area where the alleged crime took place, and the responding officers\u2019 names and identification numbers. Redacted were the names and addresses of the victims and witnesses. In light of the above-summarized principles, and the fact that those reports contain factual information concerning alleged criminal incidents, the CIRs, or at least some portion of them, would appear to be discoverable to \u201ca private party in litigation with the unit.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-618(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">With regard to the personnel records exemption, SG \u00a7 10-616(i), the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">The term \u201cpersonnel record\u201d is not expressly defined in the statute. Nonetheless, the language of subsection (i) discloses what type of documents the Legislature considered to be personnel records. The statute lists three categories of documents which are: (1) an application for employment; (2) performance rating; and (3) scholastic achievement. Although this list was probably not intended to be exhaustive, it does reflect a legislative intent that \u201cpersonnel records\u201d mean those documents that directly pertain to employment and an employee\u2019s ability to perform a job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 82-83, 721 A.2d 196.

The County opines that the disclosure of such detailed information would provide no benefit to the public, but would jeopardize the lives of the police officers and compromise both current and future police investigations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The Post asserts that the County \u201croutinely provides the press and the public with officers\u2019 names, rank, badge number, job assignment, and number of years on the job. In addition, the Police Manual, \u00a7 3/209.20, permits an officer to release his or her name, rank, I.D. number, work telephone number, and duty assignment address. The Post contends that the County misreads SG \u00a7 10\u2014618(f) in its attempt to shelter a police roster under the \u201cinvestigations\u201d exemption. Therefore, in its cross-appeal, the Post argues that it is entitled to the police roster, including all names, ranks, badge numbers, job assignments, and dates of hire, rather than a roster of public safety employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We are satisfied that the personnel records exemption relied on by the County, SG \u00a7 10\u2014616(i), does not govern with regard to the request for a police roster. As we discussed above, records that do not directly \u201crelate to [the employee\u2019s] hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee ... do not fit within the commonly understood meaning of the term \u2018personnel records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d 196. Therefore, we are unpersuaded by the County\u2019s argument based on a personnel records exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Records of investigations are governed by SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(l)(i), which provides that records of investigations \u201cconducted by the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff\u201d may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>exempt from public disclosure if their release would \u201cbe contrary to the public interest.\u201d Moreover, the Court of Appeals has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">[Sjimply because an agency asserts that its files were compiled for law enforcement purposes is insufficient under the language of the exemption. The agency must, in each particular [MPIA] action, demonstrate that it legitimately was in the process of or initiating a specific relevant investigative proceeding in order to come under the aegis of the exemption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 82, 716 A.2d 258. The Court of Appeals has further held: \u201c \u2018[Wjhere an agency fails to \u201cdemonstrate that the ... documents [sought] relate to any ongoing investigation or ... would jeopardize any future law enforcement proceedings,\u201d \u2019 the exemptions would not prevent disclosure.\u201d <em>Fioretti, </em>351 Md. at 87, 716 A.2d 258 (quoting <em>NLRB v.

The Attorney General has previously opined that the following are public records: a complaint, including the name and address of the victim, filed with a law enforcement agency; a police investigative report and arrest log that are found not contrary to the public interest;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and a police record. <em>See </em>77 Op.

Office of the Att\u2019y Gen., </em>141 Md.App. 664, 672, 787 A.2d 777 (2001). The record extract includes press releases that include summaries of events, including a police officer\u2019s name, rank, identification number, and the number of years he or she served with their current section or division. In addition, the Prince George\u2019s County Code, \u00a7 18-158 (1999 ed.)(\u201cPGCC\u201d) mandates: \u201cEvery member of the Police Department shall furnish his or her name and identification number to any person who requests this information.\u201d Police Manual, \u00a7 3/209.20 also permits the release of an officer\u2019s \u201cname, rank, [identification] number,\u201d and \u201cduty assignment address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the Post\u2019s request for a police roster is not automatically shielded from disclosure pursuant to the investigations or personnel exemptions. Here, the County failed to provide particularized justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to deny the request for a roster. Instead, it made a blanket denial of the request because \u201cdisclosure of the names and job assignments would jeopardize the life of officers!..]\u201d The court restricted the release of information to the Post to only \u201cthe names of all individuals who work for [the County] in a public safety role.\u201d That restriction appears too broad, considering that the officers\u2019 full name, rank, badge number and date of hire would ordinarily be disclosed and the fact that this information is, in many instances, included in County press releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We believe, however, that in certain instances the disclosure of an officer\u2019s identity and job assignment might need to be considered on a case by case basis pursuant to the \u201cinvestigations\u201d exemption provided by SG \u00a7 10-618(f). For example, the County may not be required to include information regarding those officers who operate in an undercover or covert manner, or perhaps, in some instances, if an officer is assigned to a particular assignment or division. <em>See Nunez v. DEA, </em>497 F.Supp. 209, 212 (S.D.N.Y.1980) (finding that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(F), which exempts from disclosure records that \u201ccould reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of [a law enforcement] individual,\u201d precluded the disclosure of names of DEA personnel). In some situations, to disclose the number of officers assigned to a particular task force or division may be counterproductive from an investigations viewpoint and contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">E.

As stated above, the Court of Appeals has asserted that records that \u201cdo not relate to [the employee\u2019s] hiring, discipline, promotion, dismissal, or any matter involving his status as an employee ... do not fit within the commonly understood meaning of the term \u2018personnel records.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kirwan, </em>352 Md. at 83, 721 A.2d 196.

More specifically, the County contends that the court erred in drawing a distinction between open and closed investigatory files and that the Post is not a \u201cperson in interest\u201d who has access to such files. It was only in the County\u2019s reply brief that it first asserted that the release of CID\u2019s files \u201cwill reveal investigative techniques and procedures\u201d and that the \u201cfiles contained the mental impressions and approaches employed by investigators to ascertain the validity of claims and events under investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It argued that \u201c[t]he release of these files could endanger the lives of several individuals including officers, investigators, and witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The Post responds that the \u201cinvestigations\u201d exemption does not permit a blanket denial of all'requests that involve investigatory information. Instead, the Post cites <em>Cranford, </em>300 Md. at 772, 481 A.2d 221, contending that \u201cwithholding [investigative reports] might serve no public interest\u201d and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>should be produced.

CID investigative reports generally fit the criteria of the investigations exemption and their release in certain instances could be contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The County, however, only argued that the release of the eight closed cases would be contrary to the public interest, arguing the investigations exemption and that the investigations exceptions fails to provide a distinction between open and closed public record. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Although the County is correct that SG \u00a7 10-618(f) does not differentiate between open and closed investigatory records, SG \u00a7 10-618(a) might permit that distinction in determining whether inspection \u201cwould be contrary to the public interest.\u201d In this instance, the County failed to demonstrate that disclosure of the eight closed investigatory files would be contrary to the public interest. The County merely argued to the circuit court that it did not \u201csee any exception in the MPIA about closed and active cases.\u201d The record is absent any information concerning the public harm that might be caused by the release of the closed CID records. Therefore, based on the record in this case, we find that the circuit court did not err in releasing the closed investigatory files. This decision would not preclude the County from demonstrating in the future that the release of other such files would be contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">G. Database Contents &amp; Fields</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The County argues that the court erred in permitting the release of database contents that is \u201cnot protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or attorney work-product doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>trine and is not proprietary intellectual property of a third party.\u201d It explains that the release of the County\u2019s risk management case tracking database contents is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the \u201cinteragency and intra-agency\u201d exemption, SG \u00a7 10\u2014618(b), in addition to the attorney-client privilege, Md.Code Ann. (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-108 of the Ct. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article, and the attorney work-product doctrine, Rule 2-402(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">With regard to the database field layouts,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the County contends that they are not public records pursuant to SG \u00a7 10\u2014611(g), <em>supra, </em>because they were not produced by the County, but rather it was created by Trigon, a Virginia company. It further asserts that, if it is deemed a public document, it is exempt from public access based on the \u201ccommercial information\u201d exemption, SG \u00a7 10-617(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The Post counters that the County merely made a blanket claim to the circuit court of why the records should not be released and failed to demonstrate that the database contents meet the exemptions cited by the County. It further contends that although the \u201clist of fields\u201d is not created by the County, it was a public record because it was documentary material \u201creceived\u201d by the County pursuant to SG \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i). In addition, the Post claims that the County failed to demonstrate that the \u201clist of fields\u201d was \u201cconfidential commercial information\u201d exempted by SG \u00a7 10\u2014617(d), and therefore it should be accessible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">According to Maryland statutory law, a \u201cpublic document\u201d is defined as a record \u201cmade by a unit or instrumentality of the State government or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business.\u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(g)(l)(i) (emphasis added).
