(\u201cRMS\u201d). Approximately thirteen months after her diagnosis, Ms. Pope Payton filed suit against RMS in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County alleging that RMS, in violation of section 2-222 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, discriminated against her in various ways because of her physical disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">RMS filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the appropriate venue was Montgomery County. RMS contended that venue was governed by article 49B, sections 42(a) and (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of the Maryland Annotated Code (1957, 1998 RepLVol.), which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\">\u00a7 42. Civil actions for discriminatory acts-Montgomery County, Prince George\u2019s County, and Howard County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">(a) Authorized-In Montgomery County, Prince George\u2019s County, and Howard County, in accordance with this subtitle, a person who is subjected to an act of discrimination prohibited by the county code may bring and maintain a civil action against the person who committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">(b) <em>Limitations </em>periods.-{1) <em>An action under subsection (a) of this section shall be commenced in the circuit court for the county in which the alleged discrimination took place </em>not later than 2 years after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The narrow question presented to us is whether the discrimination alleged in Ms. Pope Payton\u2019s complaint \u201ctook place\u201d in Prince George\u2019s County. The answer to that question depends on the resolution of a subordinate issue, <em>i.e., </em>whether discrimination \u201ctakes place\u201d only in the county where the decision to discriminate is made or whether discrimination may also take place in the county where the decision to discriminate was implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The matter was considered by a motions judge in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County who ruled that the proper venue was Montgomery County; accordingly the case was transferred from Prince George\u2019s County to Montgomery County. After filing a motion to alter or amend the judgment, which was denied, Ms. Pope Payton filed this timely appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>I. <em>ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPLAINT</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In April 2000, Ms. Pope Payton was hired as a \u201cleasing consultant\u201d by a property management company known as Equity Management. Her job was to lease apartments, review leases, and handle complaints by renters. She performed these duties at Jefferson Hall, an apartment complex located in Riverdale, Maryland, and at Cambridge Crossing (another apartment complex) located in New Carrollton, Maryland. Both Riverdale and New Carrollton are in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">RMS assumed control of some of the rental properties formerly managed by Equity Management on September 1, 2000. Two of the properties taken over by RMS were Jefferson Hall and Cambridge Crossing. Ms. Pope Payton became an RMS employee on September 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Approximately one month after Ms. Pope Payton commenced employment with RMS, she began to experience headaches, slurred speech, and difficulty in walking. She consulted her family doctor who, on October 6, 2000, diagnosed her as having M.S. Ms. Pope Payton was off from work for one month after that diagnosis was made. She returned to work at Jefferson Hall on November 6, 2000. One day after her return to work, Jamie Russell, who was RMS\u2019s general manager, asked Ms. Pope Payton to meet her at RMS\u2019s main office in Bethesda and to \u201cbring all her doctor\u2019s notes\u201d with her. The two met in Bethesda (Montgomery County), Maryland, on November 8, 2000. Ms. Russell told Ms. Pope Payton at that meeting that while the latter was out sick, RMS had decided to downsize its staff at both Jefferson Hall and Cambridge Crossing; as a consequence of that decision, Ms. Pope Payton\u2019s position was being eliminated. Ms. Russell, nevertheless, assured Ms. Pope Payton that she could still work for RMS at two other apartment buildings it managed in Prince George\u2019s County, <em>i.e., </em>Shadyside Gardens in Suitland, or Kennebec House in Oxon Hill. Ms. Russell said she would give her the choice between those two work sites but that she wanted Ms. Pope Payton to make her choice within the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>two days. Ms. Russell also informed Ms. Pope Payton that she was expected to begin work at the apartment building she chose on Monday, November 18, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The day after the meeting with Ms. Russell, Ms. Pope Payton called the assistant manager at Park Place (another residential apartment building managed by RMS) and was told that Park Place had an opening for a leasing consultant. Because Park Place was in Bladensburg, Maryland, near Ms. Pope Payton\u2019s home, this position was attractive to her. On Friday, November 10, 2000-the deadline for a decision set by Ms. Russell-Ms. Pope Payton sent a letter to Ms. Russell telling her that, because of her illness, coupled with the short notice, she could not decide where she wanted to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Ms. Pope Payton wrote to Ms. Russell again on November 15, 2000; this time she requested accommodations for her handicap by allowing her to work at Jefferson Hall or Cambridge Crossing for 30 hours per week; she also demanded that RMS supply her with ergonomic equipment consisting of a high back chair with cushion, a footrest, a headset, and a glare screen filter for her computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The director of human resources for RMS (the \u201cDirector\u201d) wrote Ms. Pope Payton on November 16 and told her to report for work at Kennebec House on November 17 at 8:30 a.m. Ms. Pope Payton did not report to work as directed; instead, on November 17, she wrote to the Director and asked once again to be allowed to work at Jefferson Hall or Cambridge Crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">On December 4, 2000, Ms. Pope Payton\u2019s attorney notified RMS that his client was willing to work full-time and was able to perform the essential job duties of a leasing consultant. The attorney also notified RMS that his client could work at Jefferson Hall, Cambridge Crossing, Park Place, \u201cor anywhere else that his client could find transportation to and from work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Ms. Pope Payton has not worked for RMS since November 8, 2000. According to her complaint, her physical handicap makes it necessary that she work close enough to her home so that she can \u201cfind transportation\u201d to and from work. Several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>job sites managed by RMS were close enough to her home so that she could have found transportation and worked there. These sites were: Jefferson Hall and Eastdale Apartments (Riverdale); Cambridge Crossing and Lenox Court Apartments (New Carrollton); Park Place Towers (Bladensburg); Cypress Creek, Kings Park Plaza, Overlook Apartments, and Prince George\u2019s Towers (Hyattsville).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In addition to the allegation that she was constructively discharged by RMS by its failure to accommodate her disability, Ms. Pope Payton alleged that RMS never provided her with health insurance but, \u201cupon information and belief,\u201d provided health insurance to other non-handicapped employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The complaint alleged that RMS engaged in several acts of discrimination that were prohibited by the Prince George\u2019s County Code. Ms. Pope Payton\u2019s rights under the Code were alleged to have been violated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">By subjecting [her] to less favorable terms and conditions of employment based on her status as a person with a physical handicap....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">By failing to reasonably accommodate [her] physical handicap by allowing her to work in her current position and location, or another location that she could reach....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">By discharging [her] in response to her request for reasonable accommodation,....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">II. <em>DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS OR TO TRANSFER VENUE AND PLAINTIFF\u2019S RESPONSE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">RMS\u2019s motion to dismiss was filed pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(a). In the memorandum of law that accompanied the motion, RMS asserted that all</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aas\">the discriminatory decisions affecting [plaintiffs employment with RMS, the unlawful acts undertaken by RMS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>employees, and the relevant meetings between [pjlaintiff and the regional general manager of RMS \u201coccurred\u201d at, or from RMS\u2019[s] main office in Bethesda, Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">According to RMS\u2019s motion, the complaint alleged discrimination by virtue of the \u201cadverse employment decisions\u201d made by it. RMS argued that, even if Ms. Pope Payton suffered the effects of these adverse employment decisions in Prince George\u2019s County, suit must nevertheless be brought in the county where the plaintiff alleges that the \u201cdiscriminatory decisions were made.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">III. <em>ANALYSIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Ms. Pope Payton interprets the \u201cwhere the discrimination takes place\u201d language contained in article 49B, section 42(b), to mean that venue is proper in the jurisdiction where the effects of the alleged discriminatory decision are felt, not where the decision to discriminate is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Prior to 1990,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Montgomery County, Prince George\u2019s County, and Howard County each enacted county ordinances creat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ing a private cause of action for claims of employment discrimination arising in those counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The Court of Appeals held in <em>McCrory Corporation v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 570 A.2d 834 (1990), that Montgomery County\u2019s statute was \u201cnot within the power of Montgomery County to enact\u201d because the creation of a private cause of action for employment discrimination had not been allowed by the General Assembly and the ordinance did not otherwise qualify as a \u201clocal\u201d matter within the meaning of the Maryland Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 570 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In response to the <em>McCrory </em>decision, the General Assembly, in 1992, authorized the passage of the ordinance previously enacted by the Montgomery County Council. <em>See </em>H.B. 722, 1992 Leg., 406th Sess. (Md.1992); <em>see also </em>Stanley Mazaroff, <em>Maryland Employment Law, </em>\u00a7 7.01, 466 (2d ed.2001). H.B. 722 .was codified in article 49B, section 42, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">(A) In accordance with this subtitle, a person who is subjected to an act of discrimination prohibited by the Montgomery County Code may bring and maintain a civil action against the person who committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">(B) (1) An action under subsection (A) of this section shall be commenced in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County not later than 2 years after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Md.Code Ann., Art. 49B, \u00a7 42 (1957, 1991 Repl.Vol. &amp; Supp. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The General Assembly, in 1993, expanded article 49B, sections 40 and 42, to include the laws (authorizing private lawsuits against employers who discriminate) previously enacted by the county councils in Prince George\u2019s and Howard Counties. H.B. 330, 1993 Leg., 407th Sess. (Md.1993). The 1993 amendment to article 49B, section 42(b)(1) deleted \u201cCircuit Court for Montgomery County\u201d and replaced it with the phrase \u201cCircuit Court for the County in which the alleged discrimination took place.\u201d No further amendments have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>since been made to the language of article 49B, section 42(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The phrase, \u201ctake place,\u201d is defined as \u201cto happen\u201d or \u201coccur.\u201d The American Heritage College Dictionary 1383 (3d ed.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Both parties support their position concerning venue by referring us to federal cases interpreting the venue provision found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Each United States district court and each United States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this title. <em>Such an action may be brought in any judicial district in[: (i)J the State in ivhich the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, </em>[ (ii)] in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or [ (iii)] in the judicial district in which the aggrieved person would have worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, [ (iv)] such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office. For purposes of sections 1404 and 1406 of Title 28, the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office shall in all cases be considered a district in which the action might have been brought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In our view, the place where the discriminatory acts \u201chave been committed\u201d would usually be the same place where the discriminatory act \u201ctook place\u201d or where the act \u201coccurred\u201d or \u201chappened.\u201d Thus, cases interpreting the phrase \u201cin any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>judicial district in the state in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed\u201d are useful.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In support of its contention that discrimination takes place where the alleged discriminatory decision is made, RMS refers us to three federal cases, <em>i.e., </em>(1) <em>Hayes v. RCA Service Company, </em>546 F.Supp. 661 (D.D.C.1982); (2) <em>Johnson v. Washington Gas Light Company, </em>89 F.Supp.2d 45 (D.D.C.2000); and (3) <em>Gwin v. Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Company, </em>2001 WL 775969, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9520 (N.D.Ill.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In <em>Hayes v. RCA, </em>the plaintiff, Hayes, filed suit in the District of Columbia alleging employment discrimination in violation of Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. 546 F.Supp. at 662-63. Hayes, an African American, was employed by the defendant in Hyattsville, Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 663. He alleged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">(1) ... [he] was not promoted to a managerial position, even though less qualified white employees were advanced to such positions; (2) ... [he] was placed on involuntary leave of absence ... because of a physical handicap, while white employees with similar physical limitations were retained and given \u201clight duty\u201d positions; (3) ..., due to his race, [he] was assigned to work in high crime areas, denied training opportunities necessary for promotion, and denied a permanent assignment to the Hyattsville, Maryland shop; and (4) ... the defendants compensated black employees, including [him], at rates lower than comparable white employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Hayes\u2019 employer took the position that venue in the District of Columbia was improper under Title VII. <em>Id. </em>at 662. Noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\u20145(f)(3)(i)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides for venue \u201cin any judicial district ... in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed,\u201d Judge Sirica said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">In the first of these situations, the proper district is the one where the alleged unlawful employment practice was committed. <em>Therefore, the Court must look to the place where the decisions and actions concerning the employment practices occurred. </em>In the present instance, the decisions which are said to have wrongfully denied the plaintiff promotions, light duty work, training opportunities and equal pay all took place in the defendant\u2019s Hyattsville, Maryland service center. While the plaintiff does complain of being assigned to routes located in the District of Columbia, the decision to assign those routes was made in Hyattsville, Maryland, at the service center. As such, this first situation does not provide a basis for finding proper venue as to the Title VII cause of action in the District of Columbia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Judge Sirica ultimately ruled that the alternative grounds for venue set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(3)(ii) and (iii)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were also inapplicable; as a consequence, he ruled the District of Columbia was not the proper venue. Accordingly, the case was transferred to Maryland. <em>Hayes, </em>546 F.Supp. at 665-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The language used in <em>Hayes </em>is somewhat favorable to RMS in that proper venue is to be where \u201cthe decision and actions concerning the employer\u2019s practices occurred.\u201d It should be noted, however, that decisions and actions do not necessarily occur in the same venue. <em>See Cox v. National Football League, </em>1997 WL 619839, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 29, 1997). In any event, the <em>Hayes </em>case is factually distinguishable from the one at bar because in <em>Hayes </em>the forum chosen by the plaintiff-employee was not the place where he was exclusively employed or where all of the discriminatory decisions were implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The plaintiff in <em>Johnson v. Washington Gas </em>filed suit in the District of Columbia alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violation of \u201cfederal and state race discrimination\u201d statutes. 89 F.Supp.2d at 45. The defendant sought to transfer venue to Virginia. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff lived in Maryland and had worked in both Virginia and Maryland. <em>Id. </em>Washington Gas Light Company was incorporated in the District of Columbia and had operations in the Washington metropolitan area. <em>Id. </em>Over the course of seventeen years the plaintiff applied for four positions within the Washington Gas Light Company but was unsuccessful due (allegedly) to his employer\u2019s discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Judge Robertson denied the defendant\u2019s motion to transfer venue, but in doing so noted that under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f) (3) (i) and (ii),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the District of Columbia court did not have venue. <em>Id. </em>at 46. Judge Robertson explained his reasoning in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">Plaintiff contends that he was assigned to one of defendant\u2019s District of Columbia locations in 1995 where \u201cthe discriminatory activities, retaliation, and reprisal which Plaintiff has complained, have taken place and continue to take place,\u201d but the inquiry for this venue provision turns on where the allegedly discriminatory decision was made,.... The selections for the positions that plaintiff sought were made at the [Springfield Operations Center] in Springfield, VA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 46 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">As authority for that view, Judge Robertson relied on Judge Sirica\u2019s opinion in <em>Hayes, supra, </em>and upon <em>Milburn v. Stone,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>1991 WL 7660 at *1 (D.D.C. Jan.7, 1991). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>In <em>Gwin v. Reynolds &amp; Reynolds, </em>the plaintiff sued the defendant in Illinois under Title VII and the defendant filed a motion to transfer venue. 2001 WL 775969, at *1, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9520, at *1. The plaintiff in Gwin was a resident of Maryland who had never worked for the defendant in Illinois. <em>Id. </em>at *1, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9529, at *2. The defendant\u2019s principal place of business was in Ohio but it had branch offices located in Illinois. <em>Id. </em>Judge Hibbler granted the defendant\u2019s motion to transfer venue, explaining why the plaintiff had failed to meet his burden under 42 U.S.C.2000e-5(f)(3)(i),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">First, to determine where the alleged practice occurred, this Court must look to the location of where the <em>decisions and actions regarding the employment practices took place. </em>Defendant claims that [plaintiff] can in no way assert that [defendant\u2019s] decisions concerning the alleged discrimination occurred in Illinois. Because [plaintiff] never worked in Illinois, Defendant argues that he cannot satisfy the first element of \u00a7 5(f)(3). [Plaintiff] has failed to sufficiently counter Defendant\u2019s argument. Therefore, this Court finds that the first element of \u00a7 5(f)(3) has not been satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au5\"><em>Id. </em>at *1, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9520, at *4 (citations omitted)(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">RMS\u2019s reliance on <em>Gwin </em>is misplaced. Here, unlike <em>Gwin, </em>the plaintiff worked for the employer in the venue (Prince George\u2019s County) she chose, whereas in <em>Gwin, </em>the reason given for finding improper venue was that the plaintiff-employee never worked for the defendant-employer in the venue selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In addition to the federal cases, RMS relies on <em>Barnes v. IBM Corporation, </em>212 Mich.App. 223, 537 N.W.2d 265 (1995). In <em>Barnes, </em>the plaintiff sued his employer in the Wayne County, Michigan, Circuit Court, alleging racial discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 537 N.W.2d at 265. The illegal action sued upon was described in the <em>Barnes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>opinion cryptically as \u201cadverse employment decisions,\u201d and Wayne County was said <em>not </em>to be the \u201clocus of [the plaintiffs] employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266 (White, J. Helene, concurring). The defendant in <em>Barnes </em>sought a change of venue from Wayne County to Oakland County, which was denied by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 265-66. That decision was reversed by the Michigan Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The venue provision discussed in <em>Barnes </em>was the Michigan Civil Rights Act, which provided that an action</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiY\">may be brought in the circuit court for the county where the alleged violation occurred, or for the county where the person against whom the civil complaint is filed resides or has his principal place of business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 265. Michigan\u2019s venue provision for tort actions (such as the intentional infliction of emotional distress action brought by the <em>Barnes </em>plaintiff) provided that a plaintiff could file suit in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">\u201c[a] county in which all or part of the cause of action arose and in which either\u201d defendant resides, has a place of business or conducts business, or where defendant\u2019s registered corporate office is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 600.1629(l)(a) (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The <em>Barnes </em>court\u2019s majority opinion noted that venue would be proper (under either statute) in Oakland County because the defendant\u2019s corporate office in Michigan was located there and the allegedly discriminatory and tortious decisions were made there. <em>Id. </em>at 266. The plaintiff, however, contended that venue was proper in Wayne County because \u201cthat is where he experienced at least some of the effects of the defendants\u2019 decisions and where he suffered resulting damages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Two of the three judges on the <em>Barnes </em>panel rejected the plaintiffs argument and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">[Allowing an action to be brought where its effects or damages occur would encourage forum shopping in contravention of the goals of the venue provisions. Further, the civil rights statute clearly provides that venue is proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>where \u201cthe alleged violation occurred,\u201d not where its effects were felt or where the damages accrued. The violations alleged are adverse employment decisions. Although plaintiff performed some work in Wayne County, he has provided no credible factual evidence that any of the allegedly discriminatory decisions were made in Wayne County, as distinguished from their effects being felt there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">But, in a concurring opinion, Judge Helene N. White wrote: Discrimination also \u201coccurs\u201d in the county where the decision is implemented and the discrimination is inflicted. In the instant case, however, while plaintiff performed some work activities in Wayne County, that was not the locus of his employment, so that it does not appear that decisions made elsewhere were implemented, and discrimination was inflicted, in Wayne County, as distinguished from effects being felt there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 266 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The language used in the majority opinion in <em>Barnes </em>supports RMS\u2019s position, although (1) the language of Michigan\u2019s venue statute concerning discrimination suits is not identical to that used in article 49B, section(b)(l), and (2) the plaintiff in <em>Barnes, </em>unlike the plaintiff in the case <em>sub judice, </em>did not regularly work in the county where suit was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Ms. Pope-Payton rejects the reasoning of the Michigan Court of Appeals and the three federal district court cases just discussed. She relies on two federal district court cases and a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">In <em>McDonald v. American Federation of Musicians, </em>308 F.Supp. 664, 665-66 (N.D.Ill.1970), members of a local musicians union in Chicago brought suit in Illinois against the international union because the international union imposed a fee on local members in violation of Title VII. The defendant raised the defense that venue was improper in Illinois because the decision to impose the fee was made in Florida and because its principal office was in New York. <em>Id. </em>at 670. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>court held that the defendant\u2019s contention was without merit. <em>Id. </em>The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">The plaintiffs live and work in this district and were required to repay the fees here. The fact that the decision that required them to do so was made elsewhere does not necessitate the conclusion that no alleged act of discrimination occurred in this district. <em>It taxes common sense to suggest otherwise.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">In <em>Cox v. National Football League </em>(\u201cNFL\u201d), 1997 WL 619839, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 29, 1997), Bryan Cox, a Chicago Bears football player, filed suit in New York, alleging that the NFL and Commissioner Tagliabue breached their duty under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by failing to maintain a work environment that was free from \u201cracial harassment, intimidation, or insult.\u201d 1997 WL 619839, at *1, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307 at *2. While the New York action was pending, the NFL and Tagliabue fined Cox one game check (over $80,000) for football-related misconduct on Cox\u2019s part. 1997 WL 619839, at *1, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307, at *2. Once the Chicago Bears were notified of the league\u2019s action, the team deducted the fine from Cox\u2019s pay check. 1997 WL 619839, at *1, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307, at *2</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Cox filed a second suit against the NFL and Commissioner Tagliabue, alleging that the large fine was imposed in retaliation for his filing of the prior suit. 1997 WL 619839, at *1, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307, at *3. The second suit was filed in Illinois. <em>Id. </em>at *1-2, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307, at *2-3. According to the complaint, the NFL had previously imposed no fine or a small fine for conduct similar to Cox\u2019s. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The NFL and Commissioner Tagliabue filed a motion in the second case in which they argued that the Illinois suit should be dismissed for improper venue because the Commissioner\u2019s decision to impose the fine was made in New York and therefore Illinois was not the state in which the unlawful employment practice was alleged to have been committed. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>at *1, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15307, at *5. The defendants also argued that management\u2019s act of forwarding monies from Cox\u2019s check to the NFL was only an effect of the unlawful practice of the commissioner\u2019s decision to impose the fine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The Coa; court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">In determining where the unlawful practice is alleged to have happened, a court \u201cmust look to the place where the decisions and actions concerning the employment practices occurred.\u201d <em>Hayes v. RCA Serv. Co., </em>546 F.Supp. 661, 664 (D.D.C.1982). In this case, although the decision to impose a fine on Cox was made by [the Commissioner] in New York, the acts of imposing the fine and paying a fine by mailing Cox\u2019s game check to the NFL was performed by the management of the Chicago Bears in Illinois.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">[T]he defendants\u2019 argument is without merit. First, we find the defendants\u2019 formalistic decision-versus-effect dichotomy unpersuasive. As stated above, <em>a court looks to where the decision and actions concerning the employment practices occurred. </em>The Chicago Bears Club of the NFL imposed the fine on Cox in Illinois by mailing his game check to New York. Cox lives and works in ... Illinois and, thus, was required to pay the fine here. To hold otherwise would encourage employers to make their decisions to terminate and discipline in far away offices in order to protect themselves from litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\"><em>Id. </em>at *3, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *5-7 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also reached a conclusion similar to that reached in <em>Cox </em>in <em>Passantino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Consumer Products, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 493 (9th Cir.2001). Ms. Passantino worked in Washington state, and her employer\u2019s office was located in New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>at. 499-501. After Ms. Passantino complained to her superiors about disparaging comments made by her male coworkers, her employer passed her over for several job promotions. <em>Id. </em>at 502-03. The employer then offered Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Passantino positions that she considered to be demotions. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Passantino filed a Title VII suit in Washington, complaining about the aforementioned actions of her employer. <em>Id. </em>at 508. The defendant moved for a change of venue to New Jersey, which was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On appeal, the employer contended that venue was improper in Washington because the employer made the decisions not to promote the plaintiff in New Jersey; therefore, according to the defendant, venue was proper only in New Jersey. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff countered by asserting that the \u201cunlawful action occurs where its effects are felt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The <em>Passantino </em>court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">[T]he statute itself and analogous case law suggest that venue should be found where the effect of the unlawful employment practice is felt: where the plaintiff works and the decision to engage in that practice is implemented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">[Defendant], however, would have us reject such a rule, at least for cases involving failure to promote, in favor of one that would allow venue only where the decision to commit the unlawful employment practice is made. We find this theory unpersuasive for several reasons. First, [defendant\u2019s] theory would require us to draw a distinction between promotional claims and other types of Title VII claims-which allow venue where the plaintiff is employed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Had [plaintiff] been wrongfully discharged or subjected to a hostile work environment, she could have sued in the district where she worked. Nothing in the text or history of the statute\u2019s venue provision suggests that a different rule should apply in failure-to-promote cases. Plaintiffs unlawfully denied a promotion, like those discharged, feel the effects of their injury where they actually work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">[Defendant] suggests that the rule advanced by Passantino would leave corporations which employ people in far<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>away home offices vulnerable to suit in distant fora, a problem which it warns will increase in the internet age. [Defendant] is concerned that \u201cpotential plaintiffs could evaluate their preferred locations for bringing a lawsuit and simply relocate their home offices within that jurisdiction.\u201d This forum shopping scenario seems fanciful; .... It is of more concern that national companies with distant offices might try to force plaintiffs to litigate far away from their homes, as [defendant] seeks to do here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">Thus, <em>we hold that venue is proper in both the forum ivhere the employment decision is made and the forum in which that decision is implemented or its effects are felt.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 505-06 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As mentioned earlier, the phrases \u201ctook place\u201d and \u201cto happen\u201d have equivalent meanings. In our view, the discrimination, which Ms. Pope-Payton alleges, happened in Prince George\u2019s County because it was there that RMS\u2019s alleged decision to discriminate was implemented. If the decision had not been implemented, no discrimination could be said to have \u201ctaken place.\u201d The decision by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Passantino, supra, </em>and by the federal district court judges who authored the opinions in <em>Cox, supra, </em>and <em>McDonald, supra, </em>support that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Aside from the wording used in the statute and our agreement with the reasoning of the <em>McDonald, Cox, </em>and <em>Passantino </em>decisions, additional grounds exist to reject the interpretation of article 49B, section 42(b)(1), advocated by RMS. Unlike <em>all </em>of the cases cited by RMS, the plaintiff here worked (and lived) exclusively in the venue where suit was brought. And, as demonstrated <em>infra, </em>the effect of the discriminatory action upon the employee was exclusively in the venue chosen by the employee. Moreover, the ordinance the plaintiff sought to enforce was one enacted by the legislative body of the venue plaintiff chose. Under these circumstances, we believe it would produce an absurd result to interpret the statute <em>as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>requiring </em>the transfer of this case to Montgomery County so that a circuit court of that jurisdiction could interpret and enforce an ordinance passed by the Prince George\u2019s County Council. <em>Cf. Adamson v. Corr. Med. Serv., Inc., </em>359 Md. 238, 252, 753 A.2d 501 (2000)(Statues should be interpreted so as to \u201cavoid unreasonable or illogical results that defy common sense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We turn now to the allegations in Ms. Pope-Payton\u2019s complaint to determine where RMS\u2019s alleged discriminatory decisions were implemented. As noted earlier, Ms. Pope-Payton alleged that RMS discriminated against her: (1) by failing to accommodate her physical handicap, <em>i.e., </em>not allowing her to work in her prior position and at the place of her prior work location or at other locations that she could reach; (2) by subjecting her to less favorable terms and conditions of employment because of her physical handicap, <em>e.g., </em>not providing her with health insurance but providing it to other non-handicapped employees; and (3) by constructively discharging her in response to her request for reasonable accommodation. These discriminatory decisions were all implemented in Prince George\u2019s County (the locus of her employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR TRIAL;</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">.

In its brief, RMS concedes that the motions judge did not transfer the case based on Maryland Rule 2-327(c).
