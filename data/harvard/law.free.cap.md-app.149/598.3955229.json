On November 9, 2001, a hearing was held on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s motion was denied by way of a written memorandum and order, on November 30, 2001. On March 20, 2002, appellant was convicted of the firearm count after a not guilty plea on an agreed statement of facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 24, 2002, appellant was sentenced to five years in prison without the possibility of parole on the firearm conviction. On that same day, appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Appellant now presents the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">DID THE TRIAL COURT ERR IN UPHOLDING A \u201cNO-KNOCK\u201d ENTRY WHEN THE POLICE PURPOSELY DID NOT SEEK A \u201cNO-KNOCK\u201d WARRANT BUT, INSTEAD, LATER DECIDED ON THEIR OWN TO FORCIBLY ENTER WITHOUT KNOCKING AND ANNOUNCING?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cyes\u201d and reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Appellant, a 22-year old resident of Columbia, in Howard County, lived with his parents in a single-family home at 5738 Margrave Mews. During the month of March, 2001, the Howard County Police Department received information from an undisclosed source that there were five handguns and some marijuana in appellant\u2019s house. Appellant was not permitted to possess those firearms because of a prior conviction for third degree burglary. Acting on that information, the police sought, and were granted, a search and seizure warrant for the premises of 5738 Margrave Mews. The warrant specifically authorized the seizure of marijuana and firearms. The police did not seek, and were not granted, permission to dispense with the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement when executing that warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">On March 6, 2001, the police executed the warrant without knocking and announcing their presence. The police assembled a team of \u201ctactical\u201d officers who \u201cstaged\u201d near the house in a \u201ctactical vehicle.\u201d These officers\u2014a total of 12\u2014had just come from a \u201cbarricade\u201d situation and were dressed in blue \u201cBDU\u2019s\u201d or \u201cBattle Dress Uniforms.\u201d These uniforms are similar to what people wear in the armed services, only they are all blue. The uniforms said \u201cPolice\u201d on the front and back; and the officers wore police badges. Each officer also wore a ballistic vest, a Kevlar helmet, and a black \u201cbalaclava\u201d or fire resistant hood. This equipment almost completely obscured the faces of the officers. Three of the officers carried \u201cballistic shields\u201d which were three feet tall and two feet wide. The officers were also armed with either handguns or rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The police gained entry through the side door with the use of a two-man battering ram. Once the door was open, the battering ram team \u201cpeeled to the side of the door\u201d to allow the entrance of the \u201cpoint teams.\u201d Once inside, each of the three \u201cpoint teams,\u201d led by the shield-bearing \u201cpoint officer,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ran to a different floor so that it would take just \u201c12 to 15 seconds to have the whole residence cleared and everyone secured.\u201d While running through the house, the \u201cpoint officers\u201d were \u201cyelling\u201d as \u201cloud as they can, \u2018Police search warrant, Police search warrant.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s father was the only person in the residence. He was found sitting in a chair at a computer terminal. The police \u201cput down [the father] on the ground and secured [him]\u201d at gunpoint. After a thorough search, one firearm was found in the house in what was later established as appellant\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Hearing on the Motion to Suppress<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">During the suppression hearing, Sergeant Merritt Bender testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">[The State]: Now, drawing your attention back to March 6th, of 2001, Sergeant, can you tell us what information you were provided with, by fellow members of the Police Department, and what investigation you did, regarding the execution of the warrant at 5738 Margrave Mews.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">[Sergeant Bender]: That\u2019s correct. I was contacted\u2014we were\u2014we had actually been called up by patrol to handle a barricade situation or a quasi-barricade situation they were having up on Montgomery Road, when I was first contacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">I was contacted about 4:20 in the afternoon by Corporal Verderaime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">He advised me that he had a search warrant for the residence you named, 5738 Margrave Mews. He advised that the suspect in the\u2014in the\u2014in the case was Mr. Kevin Powers Carroll, the Defendant seated to my right, in the green shirt, <em>and that he had\u2014he had past arrests </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>for felony burglary, possession of marijuana and robbery. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">He advised that the search warrant was for five handguns, which had been stolen in a B &amp; E, and marijuana. He said that\u2014he advised, me that Mr. Powers [Carroll] lived in the residence with his parents. His father is outside in the hall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">[Sergeant Bender]:\u2014and that Mr. Carroll had associates\u2014 or associated with a defendant who I\u2014not a defendant, but a person who I know as Gregory Daniel Price, who I was familiar with from my time in narcotics, as well as my time working on other assignments with the Department, who had prior arrests for first degree assault, several robberies, CDS offenses, and is\u2014was currently believed at that time of carrying a handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">And that Mr. Carroll also associated with George Johnson, who had\u2014who had multiple prior arrests for CDS, and that these subjects may or may not be in the search warrant\u2014I mean may or may not be in the residence at the time that the search warrant was executed\u2014and, that he was requesting we execute the search\u2014execute the search warrant as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">[The State]: Now, did you, in fact, have occasion to look at the search warrant and review that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">[Sergeant Bender]: Yes. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">[The State]: If I may, Your Honor, approach and review\u2014 State\u2019s Exhibit A, and do you recognize this sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">[Sergeant Bender]: Yes, this is the\u2014this is the search warrant that I was provided with and viewed prior to executing the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">[The State]: And, did you note, not only the address, but also the probable cause that was set forth by the affiant, Detective Verderaime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-14\">[Sergeant Bender]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>[The State]: So, in addition to the information provided by Detective Verderaime, to you, over the telephone, you had occasion to read through the affidavit and search warrant itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">[Sergeant Bender]: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[The State]: And the subject matter of the search warrant was what, sir, in terms of what was being sought in the residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">[Sergeant Bender]: Handguns and marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">[The State]: And the particular suspect that was suspected to be residing and tied to those pieces of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">[Sergeant Bender]: Mr. Kevin Powers Carroll, the Defendant to my right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">[The State]: Now, when you learned the information from Detective Verderaime, regarding the subject matter of the warrant, the five guns, and the possible\u2014possibility of recovery of marijuana, you then conducted the further investigation to determine who may have associated with Mr. Carroll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">[Sergeant Bender]: Actually, Corporal Verderaime gave me all this information while we were there, talking to him on the phone, initially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">[The State]: Once you gathered that all\u2014that information, Sergeant, what steps did you then take to determine what method of entry would be conducted by the Howard County Police Department Tactical Section?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">[Sergeant Bender]: I contacted\u2014actually, again, we were at an operation\u2014barricade thing\u2014we were actually stationed at Rockburn Park off of Montgomery Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">I verified or I asked if there was a\u2014if it was\u2014if there was a\u2014if there was a no-knock exclusion in the search warrant. Corporal Verderaime said there was not. I asked if he had applied for it, and he said, no, he had not applied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">I then verified\u2014I spoke with my Captain about it, and you know, basically Mr. Carroll\u2019s past, his associates past for crimes of violence, the fact that we were going after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>handguns. I spoke with\u2014I spoke [to] my Captain in reference [to] it\u2014and said, if we are going into a residence after handguns, the guy has a past record for one robbery, and his associates have a past for several, it\u2019s not safe for us to\u2014to go up and do a knock entry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">I contacted Corporal Verderaime\u2019s Lieutenant\u2014Lieutenant Craig Marshall. I spoke with him about it, and\u2014 and, if\u2014if, in fact\u2014you know\u2014they thought that there was a problem, or any problem with us going in on a no knock basis, based on the fact that we were going after guns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">I also contacted the State\u2019s Attorney here in\u2014here, at Circuit Court. I contacted the State\u2019s Attorney and ran it by him, saying\u2014explained everything that I have already explained to Your Honor, that was given to us on the background and the\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">On cross-examination, Sergeant Bender acknowledged that, although he was told that appellant had once been charged with the crime of robbery as a juvenile, he was unaware if the alleged offense involved a weapon. Sergeant Bender also stated that he had no information regarding appellant \u201cusing guns, pointing guns, threatening people with guns, or aiming guns at anybody.\u201d Sergeant Bender testified that he had no specific information that Gregory Price would even be in the house and that neither Price nor his car were seen at appellant\u2019s house during surveillance prior to the execution of the search and seizure warrant. In addition, Sergeant Bender testified that he \u201cdid not have any information that he [Price] would point a gun at [the police].\u201d Sergeant Bender also testified that he had no information that George Johnson, another friend of appellant, had ever carried a weapon or threatened to \u201cshoot a policeman if he came into [appellant\u2019s] house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The Honorable Dennis M. Sweeney, in his Memorandum and Order filed on December 3, 2001, denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Sergeant Bender, at the time of the execution of the warrant, had reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing his presence would increase the likelihood of danger to himself and the other officers ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW7\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">Here, Sergeant Bender knew that Defendant, [was] previously convicted of third degree burglary, was in possession of firearms and drugs, had a previous arrest for robbery (a crime of violence), and associated with individuals with extensive criminal records, including crimes of violence. The [c]ourt is convinced that Sergeant Bender had a reasonable suspicion of danger sufficient to allow the Howard County Police officers to enter the house without a knock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Appellant argues that Judge Sweeney erred in denying his suppression motion and upholding a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry by the police.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In response, the State argues that the criminal records of Carroll and his alleged cohorts, in conjunction with the presence of firearms and marijuana, was sufficient to provide the officers serving the warrant with a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing would put them in harm\u2019s way.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Before thinking about a cure, it is necessary to consider the etiology, which begins with a careful empirical observation of the disease. Although it is tedious to tell again tales already plainly told, police, at common law, were entitled to break into a house to arrest after announcing their authority and purpose for demanding admission. The leading American case of <em>Read v. Case, 4 </em>Conn. 166 (1822), stands for the proposition that a police officer may dispense with the notice requirement when compliance with the rule would expose him to danger. The Court reasoned that \u201c[I]mminent danger to human life, resulting from the threats and intended violence of the principal towards his bail, constitutes a case of high necessity; and it would be a palpable perversion of a sound rule [requiring knock and announce] to extend the benefit of it to a man ... who wanted only for a demand, to wreak on his bail the most brutal and unhallowed vengeance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The modern restatement of the logic in <em>Read </em>occurred in <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997), in which the United States Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">In order to justify a \u201cno-knock\u201d entry, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence. This standard\u2014as opposed to a probable cause requirement\u2014strikes the appropriate balance between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests affected by no-knock entries. <em>Cf., Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 337, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990)(allow-ing a protective sweep of a house during an arrest where the officers have \u201ca reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene\u201d); <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)(requiring a reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify a pat-down search). This showing is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>high, but the police should be required to make it whenever the reasonableness of a no-knock entry is challenged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0aP\"><em>Richards, </em>520 U.S. at 394-95, 117 S.Ct. 1416.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Richards, </em>and aware that we do not have a unified theory of constitutional interpretation, this Court considered two cases in which we were asked to order suppression of evidence seized as a result of no-knock entries: <em>Wynn v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 133, 699 A.2d 512 (1997), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>351 Md. 307, 718 A.2d 588 (1998), and <em>Lee v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 79, 774 A.2d 1183, <em>cert. granted, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001). In <em>Wynn </em>and <em>Lee, </em>the search warrant did not include a no-knock provision. However, the officers serving the warrant elected not to knock and announce their presence before entering the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Like the devious labyrinth in which the voracious Minotaur is hidden, Fourth Amendment law is complex and contradictory. Even under what some may consider a superficial probing of the Fourth Amendment, we reviewed in <em>Wynn </em>the history of the no-knock requirement and its exceptions under Maryland law. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">The reasonableness of the officers\u2019 conduct hinges on the facts within their knowledge indicating exigency, that is, whether the officers held an objectively reasonable belief that an emergency situation existed. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>867 F.2d 581, 584 (10th Cir.1993). The State bears the burden of establishing that exigent circumstances excused its noncompliance with the knock and announce requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 167, 699 A.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Wynn had a long criminal background, including drug convictions, assault, burglary, and handgun convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d 512. In addition, Wynn was on parole and had pulled a concealed weapon on police, in the past, to avoid arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Another factor the Court considered in reaching its decision was the presence of another dangerous criminal in the house, namely Wynn\u2019s wife, Angela Kenyon. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>512. The <em>Wynn </em>court, affirming the lower court, held that \u201csufficient particularized evidence existed to support the conclusion that the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that their personal safety was in danger because of appellant\u2019s and Kenyon\u2019s prior violent and criminal actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167, 699 A.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The other end of the spectrum is <em>Lee. </em>In <em>Lee, </em>Judge Sonner, writing for this Court, pellucidly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">It is clear that, although Maryland law and the opinions of the Supreme Court of the United States presumptively require knocking and announcing before entry when searching with a proper warrant, the law also forgives the failure to do so when there are legally sufficient exigent circumstances. It is equally clear that there is no blanket or per se exception for drug searches. Rather, in each case, the police must articulate a reasonable suspicion, based upon, particularized facts, that exigent circumstances exist which justify not knocking and announcing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 89, 774 A.2d 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In <em>Lee, </em>we reached the conclusion that the \u201crecord failed to show anything more than that Lee was a drug dealer whom the police observed on two previous occasions selling a small amount of a controlled dangerous substance ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 89, 774 A.2d 1183, and stated that \u201c[t]he record is bare of any evidence of exigent circumstances that could possibly eliminate the constitutional necessity to knock and announce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 774 A.2d 1183. The <em>Lee </em>Court held that the circuit court erred in ruling that there was justification for the police to enter without knocking and announcing. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 774 A.2d 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">There is no evidence that the actual manner in which the police conducted their search exceeded the bounds specified in their affidavit. They searched only those places specifically authorized by the warrant and seized only those items that were relevant. They neither \u201crummaged\u201d through the defendant\u2019s belongings nor seized evidence which they did not have probable cause to seize. We are not dealing with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>manner in which the search itself was executed, nor are we dealing with a facially defective warrant. We are dealing with the absence of subsequent exigent circumstances to justify a no-knock entry<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>. In attempting to meet its burden, the State relied solely on the testimony of Sergeant Bender, a 15-year veteran, to establish that there were exigent circumstances that made it necessary to dispose of the knock and announce requirement. \u201cThe meaning of exigent circumstances is that the police are confronted with an <em>emergency\u2014circumstances so imminent that they present an urgent and compelling need for police action.\u201d Stackhouse v. State, </em>298 Md. 203, 220, 468 A.2d 333, (1983) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Sergeant Bender testified that his concern about knocking and announcing was based on the criminal backgrounds of appellant and the two known felons with whom he associated and the fact that the search was for an unspecified quantity of marijuana and five handguns. The criminal records of Carroll and his alleged cohorts did not create a reasonable suspicion that they would act in a dangerous manner toward the police, as contemplated in <em>Richards </em>and <em>Wynn.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In addition, we have stated before \u201cthat a reasonable belief that firearms may be within the residence, standing alone, is clearly insufficient to excuse a knock and announce requirement.\u201d <em>Wynn, supra, </em>117 Md.App. at 167, 699 A.2d 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">What is absent is the absolute lack of material change in the facts or circumstances surrounding the execution of the warrant between the time it was issued and served. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>words, the officers serving the warrant had no \u201cparticularized knowledge\u201d. Sergeant Bender\u2019s testimony clearly demonstrated that the \u201cparticularized knowledge\u201d was already known at the time they secured the warrant. No additional facts giving rise to a sudden emergency were shown other than what they previously had learned from the officers who secured the warrant, namely Detective Verderaime. <em>See, e.g., Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 90, 774 A.2d 1183. Moreover, the record indicates that the officers did not witness any suspicious activities or events while surveilling Carroll\u2019s residence that would lead them to believe that the climate had changed and that would give rise to exigent circumstances. Thus, the officers serving the warrant based their decision not to knock and announce on the information previously given to them by Detective Verderaime that was known at the time they secured the search warrant, rather than on exigent circumstances that may have arisen at the time they executed the warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, there was no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>of exigent circumstances that could possibly eliminate the constitutional requirement to knock and announce.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">In <em>Davis v. State, </em>144 Md.App. at 156, 797 A.2d 84, Chief Judge Murphy explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">If at the time he or she is applying for a search warrant, a law enforcement officer believes that the circumstances under which the warrant will be executed justify dispensing with the knock and announce requirement, <em>the officer should seek no-knock authorization from the warrant issuing judge. </em>If the judge is satisfied that the request for a no-knock entry is reasonable, the judge should include in the warrant a mandate that, in substantially the following form, provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Good cause being shown therefor, the executing law enforcement officers are authorized to enter the premises to be searched without giving notice of their authority and purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Sergeant Bender testified that prior to the execution of the warrant he spoke with his Captain about the no-knock exclusion from the warrant as well as Corporal Verderaime\u2019s superior, Lieutenant Craig Marshall, and lastly with an assistant state\u2019s attorney. Unfortunately, the one party who must be consulted, was not\u2014a disinterested magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>As Judge Moylan pointed out in <em>State v. Riley, </em>147 Md.App. 113, 121, 807 A.2d 797, (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">The fundamental policy undergirding the warrant requirement is just as strong with respect to the no-knock increment as it is with respect to the underlying entry into the home itself. The constitutional concern is that the police should eschew making unilateral decisions both 1) as to <em>whether </em>the threshold should be crossed and 2) as to <em>how </em>the threshold should be crossed and should, instead, defer to the disinterested judgment on those questions of a neutral and detached judicial figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Thus, we find that the suppression court erred in ruling that there was justification for the police entry without knocking and announcing and reverse its decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The State, in the alternative, hoping to strike a balance between the constitutional imperatives of the warrant clause and the harsh consequences of invoking the \u201cupside-down\u201d incentives created by the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, argues that the evidence seized during the search would still be admissible under the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule that allows evidence that would have been discovered by independent means to be admitted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>As in <em>Lee, </em>the State insists in its brief that had the police properly knocked on Lee\u2019s door and announced their presence the cocaine would have inevitably been discovered and seized, despite the method of entry.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Applying the inevitable discovery exception to this evidence allows the State to use the exception to wrongfully circumvent the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. Essentially, the State is arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201cWe realize that we illegally executed the warrant. But we had probable cause, and had we bothered to, we could have obtained a no-knock warrant that surely would have issued. We then would have searched pursuant to it and discovered the evidence. Therefore all the evidence should be admissible under the inevitable discovery exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">As we pointed out in <em>Lee, </em>the doctrine of inevitable discovery applied to this case would forgive the police for their unconstitutional entry. Judge Sonner, writing for the Court in <em>Lee, </em>opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">To apply the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule in this instance would render the knoek-and-announce provision of the Fourth Amendment meaningless. The application of inevitable discovery in such cases negates the rule against per se exceptions to the knock-and-announce requirement. The United States Supreme Court has twice unanimously affirmed the requirement to knock and announce. In light of two rulings from the nation\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>highest court, finding this requirement to exist in both our common law and the Constitution, it would be wrong and utterly inconsistent for Maryland, in effect, to expunge this requirement and establish such an exception as was created in Michigan, by attaching the doctrine of inevitable discovery to violations of the well established knock-and-announce requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-5\"><em>Lee, </em>139 Md.App. at 94, 774 A.2d 1183.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABm\">Thus, the application of the inevitable discovery exception to evidence, in this case, permits the exception to swallow the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>exclusionary rule and disembowel the Fourth Amendment. We hold that applying the inevitable discovery rule would amount to a post hoc rationalization of the initial wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY HOWARD COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">.

Moreover, we will accept the facts as determined by the suppression hearing judge, unless those facts are clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>In addition, we are limited to considering only those facts that are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. <em>See Riddick </em>v. <em>State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990); <em>see also Simpler v.

The police were still searching for the body when an arrest was made. Detectives transported the suspect, Mr. Williams, from Davenport, Iowa to Des Moines after he had retained counsel.
