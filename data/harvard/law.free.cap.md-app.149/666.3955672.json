EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The Maryland Commission on Human Relations (\u201cCommission\u201d), the appellant, challenges a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City reversing the Commission\u2019s decision that Kaydon Ring &amp; Seal, Inc. (\u201cKaydon\u201d), the appellee, terminated Andre Henry from employment because of his race, thereby committing an unlawful employment practice. The Commission presents two issues on appeal, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">I. Did the circuit court err in failing to apply the correct standard of review and in exceeding its authority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">II. Was there substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s decision?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">For the following reasons, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court, vacate the Commission\u2019s decision, and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">On September 2, 1994, Andre Henry filed with the Commission an employment discrimination complaint against Kaydon. Henry, who is black and was born in Jamaica, alleged that Kaydon had discriminated against him by terminating his employment on the basis of his race and national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The Commission investigated Henry\u2019s complaint and on November 16, 1995 issued a finding of probable cause. On May 21, 1996, after conciliation efforts failed, the Commission filed a statement of charges against Kaydon with the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\n<em>The First ALJ Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">On January 7 and 8, 1997, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held an evidentiary hearing on the charges. The Commission called as witnesses Henry; a Commission supervisor; and six present or former employees of Kaydon. Kay-don called two of its employees. Numerous documents were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">On August 28, 1997, the ALJ issued a written decision making factual findings, listed numerically, including the following. Kaydon is a Baltimore company that manufactures seals and gaskets. On June 1, 1994, it hired Henry to work as a machine shop operator in Intermediate Shop B, section 708 of its plant. Henry had some previous machine operating experience and held an associate\u2019s degree in aviation maintenance technology and a master of mechanics certificate from Eastern Airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">Upon being hired, Henry was placed on probation, as are all new employees at Kaydon. Kaydon\u2019s rules require that new employees serve a probationary period of between 60 and 120 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Larry Fiddler, a white male, worked as the \u201clead man\u201d in Intermediate Shop B. Fiddler\u2019s duties included telling the machine operators which machines to run. Steve Skinner, also a white male, was the foreman in two sections of Interme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>diate Shop B, including section 708. When Henry was hired, Skinner had held the foreman\u2019s position for nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">As foreman, Skinner was Henry\u2019s immediate supervisor and was solely responsible for evaluating his performance. The criteria Skinner used to evaluate employees were safety, quality of work, productivity, and attitude. Skinner assessed employees based on what he was told about their performance and what he observed first hand. Sixty percent of the people Skinner supervised and evaluated were black. Skinner had full authority and discretion to fire the probationary employees he was charged with supervising.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">New employees at Kaydon received little formal training. Instead, they were immediately put to work manufacturing products, and were assigned to various machine operators who showed them the proper methods for operating the machines. Thus, new employees received \u201con the job\u201d training. During his period of probation, Henry operated the cam-turn machine, the outside diameter machine, the inside diameter machine, and the auto vent machine. Several of the employees who testified at the hearing trained him to operate those machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Kaydon imposed production goals and efficiency requirements on all employees, including probationary employees. Kaydon officials talked to the machine operators about the productivity requirements they were supposed to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Skinner expected the employees he supervised to perform their jobs well. He had a short temper, and would become upset with employees who were not performing up to his expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Henry had problems with his job performance, including low productivity and gross efficiency ratings, sitting down on the job, leaving his assigned work area without permission, and leaving early for breaks and lunch. Henry\u2019s productivity ratings and gross efficiency ratings were significantly lower than those of other employees in the same department. Skinner discussed these performance problems with Henry. Skinner was not satisfied with the quality of Henry\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>On August 12, 1994, Skinner extended Henry\u2019s probationary period for 60 days, for additional training. At the same time, Skinner and Arnold Ford, a Union Representative, met with Henry and told him his performance was unsatisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">When Kaydon hired Henry, it also hired two other machine operators: Steve Butz and Tom Morgan. Both men are white and American born. Like Henry, Butz and Morgan were put on probation and received \u201con the job\u201d training.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Butz had previous experience as a machine operator. He performed satisfactorily during his probationary period at Kaydon. After 60 days, Skinner decided, based on Butz\u2019s performance, that Butz had successfully completed his probation. Butz completed his probation by outperforming Henry and Morgan.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Unlike Butz, Morgan was not an efficient employee and did not perform satisfactorily, in Skinner\u2019s view. For that reason, Morgan did not successfully complete his probationary period.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Morgan\u2019s father also was employed by Kaydon. At Kaydon, it was not unusual for an employee to be given special treatment because one of his parents was a Kaydon employee. This preferential treatment, a form of nepotism, was extended to Kaydon employees of all races and national origins.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">During his probationary period as a machine operator, Morgan applied for a trucker\u2019s job at Kaydon. The job, which paid less than the machine operator\u2019s job, was advertised plant-wide. Morgan was the only person who made a bid for the trucker\u2019s job. He did not apply for any other jobs at Kaydon. Morgan was qualified for the trucker\u2019s job, and was offered the job for that reason. Morgan accepted the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Henry did not apply for the trucker\u2019s job or any other job at Kaydon.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Ten days after Henry\u2019s probation was extended, Skinner fired him. Skinner did so \u201cbecause he was angry that a lot of production was lost as a result of [Henry\u2019s] not operating all the machines Skinner had assigned him to operate that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>After Henry was discharged, Kaydon offered the next machine operator\u2019s job to a black man. That person did not appear for his physical examination, however, and therefore was not hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Black and white employees and employees of various national origins were hired by Kaydon to work in the departments supervised by Skinner. Skinner fired employees who were black, white, and of various national origins. From September 1992 to September 1994, in addition to Henry, four employees were discharged in section 708: a white American female fired for attendance problems; a white American male fired for missing time; a white Russian bom male who was terminated for inability to perform; and a black American male who was terminated for inability to perform. Both white and black employees successfully completed probation while being supervised by Skinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Skinner did not consider race or ethnicity when he trained or terminated employees. No one ever told him that Henry felt harassed or discriminated against based on race or national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">After making those findings, the ALJ proceeded to address the Commission\u2019s charges, under Md.Code (1994), article 49B, section 16(a), that Kaydon had terminated Henry\u2019s employment because of his race or national origin. The ALJ decided the charges by applying the analytical framework for evaluating claims of employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, applicable when the complainant does not have direct proof of an intent to discriminate, the complainant first must establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Prima facie </em>proof gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of discrimination, which shifts the burden of production to the employer to state a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the action complained about. When the employer does so, the complainant then must prove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer\u2019s stated reason for the termination was a pretext. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Killian v. Kinzer, </em>123 Md.App. 60, 68, 716 A.2d 1071 (1998); <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>Molesworth, </em>104 Md.App. 167, 188, 655 A.2d 1292 (1995), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>341 Md. 621, 672 A.2d 608 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The ALJ decided that the Commission had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of intentional discrimination and that Kaydon then met its burden of production by stating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Henry: namely, that Henry\u2019s job performance, including his performance on the day he was fired, was unsatisfactory, both independently and relatively, that is, in comparison to other employees in the same position. The ALJ concluded that the Commission did not meet its burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the reason articulated by Kaydon for firing Henry was a pretext. In particular, the ALJ found unpersuasive the testimony of Henry\u2019s co-employees that they were surprised about his termination because they thought he was performing up to par. The ALJ noted that the employees were not charged with evaluating Henry\u2019s performance and, unlike Skinner, were not in a position to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The ALJ found that the evidence about Henry\u2019s productivity and efficiency ratings, especially when compared to such data for other employees, supported Skinner\u2019s assessment that Henry was not performing satisfactorily. The ALJ also rejected arguments by the Commission that Kaydon had treated Butz and Morgan preferentially to Henry, thus evidencing that the company\u2019s decision to terminate Henry was motivated by his race or national origin, and not by his poor performance. The ALJ found that Butz had graduated from probation because he had performed well and that Morgan had been hired in the trucker\u2019s job because he was qualified for it and was the son of another Kaydon employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The ALJ found no evidence at Kaydon of a pattern of hirings or terminations based on race or national origin over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the nine year period in which Skinner had acted as foreman, up to the time Henry was fired. The ALJ stated, \u201cI find it clear, from the testimony and the documentary evidence produced at the hearing, that [Henry\u2019s] low productivity and unsatisfactory work performance led to his termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">On these findings, the ALJ dismissed the discrimination complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><em>The First Administrative </em>Appeal\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AEe\">\n<em>Unlawful Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The Commission appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Appeal Board of the Commission (\u201cAppeal Board\u201d), which reviewed the matter on the record. On June 9, 1998, the three member Appeal Board issued a memorandum opinion and order vacating the ALJ\u2019s decision and remanding the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The Appeal Board found that all of the ALJ\u2019s enumerated findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence in the record and \u201caffirmed ... and adopted\u201d them. The Appeal Board stated, however, that the Commission\u2019s regulations governing decisions of an ALJ in an employment discrimination case require the ALJ\u2019s order to \u201cinclude \u2018findings of fact and conclusions of law upon <em>each material issue </em>of fact and law presented in the record[,]\u2019 \u201d (quoting Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 14.03.01.09H(1)) (emphasis in Appeal Board\u2019s opinion), and concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision did not meet that standard because it omitted findings about evidence the Commission had presented about \u201cracial animosity on the part of Steve Skinner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In particular, the Appeal Board cited testimony by several current and former employees of Kaydon who had been supervised by Skinner that Skinner treated black employees more harshly than white employees by cursing and yelling at them, talking down to them, and reprimanding them for infractions that he would overlook when committed by whites; and testimony by Henry that Skinner had treated him with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>disrespect, by not calling him by name, snapping his fingers and whistling at him, and shouting and yelling at him.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In addition, the Appeal Board pointed out evidence in the record that Skinner \u201cmay have singled out Henry to be terminated\u201d on the day he was fired. According to Henry\u2019s testimony, he was operating two of the three machines he was assigned that day because Fiddler had told him to operate only two of them. When Skinner confronted him about operating only two machines, he told Skinner he was acting under Fiddler\u2019s orders. Skinner did not check with Fiddler to verily whether that was the case. Instead, Skinner became angry and fired him.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The Appeal Board concluded that because the ALJ\u2019s decision did not address these items of evidence, which the Appeal Board characterized as \u201cmaterial,\u201d the decision could not be reviewed and required a remand for the ALJ \u201cto prepare legally adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law....\u201d The Appeal Board acknowledged that the ALJ\u2019s decision included a statement that he had considered and rejected all proposed findings of fact <em>not </em>included in his opinion but stated that \u201con the crucial factual issues presented by the Commission pertaining to racial animosity on the part of Skinner and disparate treatment of Henry based on his race, a general, catch-all ruling ... does not satisfy the principles of review of ALJ decisions by the Appeal Board or the Commission\u2019s own regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\n<em>The Second ALJ Decision\u2014Unlawful Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On remand, the ALJ reviewed the evidence adduced at the January 1997 hearing and issued a second decision, dated December 2, 1998. The ALJ\u2019s enumerated findings of fact included all those in his first decision and the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u2022 Skinner extended Henry\u2019s probation because he had to speak to him numerous times about his poor performance; and Skinner was not obligated to extend Henry\u2019s probation at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u2022 On the morning of the day he was fired, Henry was assigned to work three machines. When Skinner walked by and saw that one of the machines was not running, he thought nothing of it. Later, at about 2:30 p.m., Skinner walked by and saw that one of the machines still was not running. He asked Henry why, and Henry replied that Fiddler had said not to run the machine. Skinner again told Henry to operate the machine. Skinner was angry, and walked away to try to cool off. Instead, he decided to terminate Henry\u2019s employment, because he believed that a lot of production had been lost as a result of Henry\u2019s not running all the machines he had been assigned. Skinner terminated Henry without checking with Fiddler to see if Fiddler in fact had told Henry not to operate one of the machines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">\u2022 In dealing with black employees on a daily basis, Skinner often treated them less favorably than white employees. \u201cHe had a tendency to yell and scream at some blacks in a way that he would not do with whites.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">\u2022 Skinner did not consider race or ethnicity when he trained or terminated employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The ALJ proceeded to analyze the employment discrimination claim much as he had done in the first decision, under <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green. </em>He concluded that the Commission had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination, for the same reasons he originally so concluded; that Kaydon had articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory business reason for terminating Henry\u2019s employment, to wit, his unsatisfactory job performance; and that the Commission had not met its burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the reason articulated by Kaydon was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">With respect to the latter issue, the ALJ found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">Based upon its Remand Order, it appears [the Appeal Board] has inferred from the record that [Kaydon] has engaged in unlawful employment discrimination with regard to [Henry]. It is reasonable to infer that because Skinner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>generally treats blacks in the work place with less dignity than he does whites, he is biased toward blacks. One could also infer that from the evidence that because Skinner treated blacks less favorably than whites he would be more likely to fire a black employee due solely to the employee\u2019s race. Such inferences, however, must be tempered by the other evidence of record. Mere rhetoric is not evidence. In the instant case, the Commission did not support its allegations with credible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">Whether [Henry] was terminated for poor performance or due to the color of his skin raises a genuine issue of fact. The Commission seems to believe that because Skinner treated blacks with less respect than he did whites, it has proven that Skinner engaged in unlawful employment discrimination by terminating [Henry] for a discriminatory purpose. As noted above, that is one possible inference. However, I do not believe that a fair view of the totality of the evidence supports such an inference. While there was some general testimony that blacks were sometimes kept on probation longer than whites, other evidence of specific acts of unlawful employment discrimination was not present. No creditable [sic] evidence was presented that black employees were disciplined, not promoted or otherwise subjected to unlawful employment discrimination by [Kaydon], None of those to whom these alleged practices occurred verified the testimony in that regard. In fact, Mr. Watkins testimony was less than convincing____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">[Henry] testified that on the day of his firing Skinner told him to leave the work floor and that he was being fired because he could not \u201ccut it.\u201d That testimony is, I believe, consistent with Skinner\u2019s testimony that he fired [Henry] after a specific incident following a history of performance problems. Skinner was angry that, in his view, [Henry] was not following instructions and his failure to do so caused production deficiencies. It is also unrefuted that Skinner was under no obligation to extend [Henry\u2019s] probation. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>better supervisor might have attempted to verify [Henry\u2019s] reason for not running all of the machines, but Skinner did not. This does, in fact, support the other evidence that Skinner was the kind of person who angers quickly and does not always react in a calm rational manner. However, it does not show that his reason for terminating [Henry] was pretextual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The ALJ issued a second order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><em>The Second Administrative </em>Appeal\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Unlawful Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">The Commission again appealed to the Appeal Board. On September 15, 1999, the Appeal Board, by a two-to-one vote, issued a decision and order reversing the ALJ\u2019s decision that Kaydon did not engage in unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of race; affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision that Kaydon did not engage in unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of national origin; and remanding the case for further proceedings to determine the appropriate relief to which Henry might by entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The Appeal Board\u2019s decision was made from a review of the record, after oral argument of counsel. The Appeal Board determined that all the findings of fact made by the ALJ, as set forth in the \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d section of his opinion (including the ALJ\u2019s original factual findings), were supported by substantial evidence in the record, and therefore were \u201caffirmed.\u201d It noted, however, that it did not consider \u201cconclusive\u201d the ALJ\u2019s factual findings that Skinner fired Henry because he was angry and believed a lot of production had been lost and that Skinner did not take race or ethnicity into consideration when he trained or terminated employees, even though there was evidence in the record to support those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">After describing the \u201cultimate issue\u201d in the case as \u201cwhether the evidence in the record as a whole supports a finding that Kaydon ... unlawfully discriminated against Andre Henry on the basis of his race and/or national origin[,]\u201d the Appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Board found, \u201chaving considered the entire record, ... that the Commission in this case did sustain its burden of proof with respect to unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">We shall discuss the Appeal Board\u2019s second decision in depth in our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>The Third ALJ Decision\u2014Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On second remand, the ALJ held an evidentiary hearing at which Henry testified for the Commission and Kaydon called its director of human resources. The ALJ incorporated by reference his prior findings and made additional findings, including extensive findings relevant to the issue of economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The ALJ found the Commission had \u201cpresented virtually no evidence to establish that [Henry] would have been retained by [Kaydon] in another capacity or what economic loss [Henry] may have incurred, if any, as a result of benefits he did not received [sic] by virtue of his termination by Kaydon.\u201d On that basis, the ALJ concluded that the Commission had not met its burden of proving actual economic loss resulting from discrimination. The ALJ further found that even if he assumed that, absent unlawful discrimination, Henry would have stayed at Kaydon and been hired in a trucker\u2019s job, as Morgan had been, the evidence showed that Henry would not have earned as much money as he actually earned from employment he obtained elsewhere after Kaydon discharged him. The ALJ concluded that Henry was not entitled to back pay or to the remedy of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">\n<em>The Third Administrative Appeal\u2014Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">The Commission filed a third appeal with the Appeal Board. The Appeal Board concluded that Henry was entitled to $20,328.60 in back pay but was not entitled to reinstatement. The Appeal Board\u2019s back pay award equaled the difference between the sum Henry would have earned had he continued work in the machine operator\u2019s job at Kaydon for 36 months after his termination date and the sum he actually earned at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>other employment during that period. The Appeal Board issued an order directing Kaydon to pay that sum to Henry.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">On February 7, 2001, the Commission adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s decision as its final agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>The Action for Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">On March 6, 2001, Kaydon filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City an action for judicial review and a motion to stay enforcement of the administrative order. The motion to stay was granted after the Commission consented to it and Kaydon posted a bond. In the meantime, a petition the Commission filed in the same court for enforcement of the administrative order was consolidated with the action for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The parties filed memoranda and on November 27, 2001, the court held a hearing at which it entertained argument of counsel. On February 28, 2002, the court issued a memorandum decision and order reversing the decision of the Board and the Commission and ordering that judgment be entered in favor of Kaydon.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The Commission is a state agency established by section 1 of article 49B of the Maryland Code and having as one of its duties the adjudication of claims of unlawful discrimination. Art. 49B, \u00a7 3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Section 16 of article 49B prohibits discriminatory employment practices, including discharging a person from employment because of his race or national origin. A person claiming employment discrimination may file a complaint with the Commission, <em>see </em>art. 49B, section 9(a), which will conduct an investigation. Art. 49B, \u00a7 10(a). If the investigation reveals \u201cprobable cause for believing a discriminatory act has been or is being committed within the scope\u201d of article 49B, the Commission\u2019s staff must undertake to eliminate the discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>nation by agreement, <em>see </em>section 10(b) and, if no agreement is reached, enter a finding to that effect and issue a written complaint to the respondent. The case then is set in for a hearing before a hearing examiner. \u00a7 11(a). Under section 2, the Commission is authorized to appoint hearing examiners, who shall be attorneys, and the hearing examiners \u201cshall conduct hearings, make findings of fact, and draw conclusions of law in discrimination cases assigned\u201d to them. Section 2(b). Pursuant to COMAR 14.03.01.09A, the Commission has delegated to ALJs with the Office of Administrative Hearings the role of acting as hearing examiners.

Before then, the regulation provided that the Appeal Board could \u201caffirm, reverse, or modify\u201d the hearing examiner\u2019s decision \u201cin accordance with the standards as set forth in State Government Article, \u00a7 10-222(h), Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d <em>See Maryland Register, </em>Vol. 25, Issue 4, at 269 (setting forth proposed action on COMAR 14.03.01.10F(1). That section sets forth (and set forth then) the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard that governs judicial review of factually based decisions of administrative agencies, under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, prior to October 9, 1998, the Appeal Board reviewed decisions of hearing examiners using the same \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard governing judicial review of agency decisions. Thereafter, and at the time relevant to this case, the Appeal Board has reviewed decisions of hearing examiners upon consideration of the \u201centire record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">In this case, the outcome of the Appeal Board\u2019s \u201centire record\u201d administrative review (that is, the Appeal Board\u2019s second decision) was that it found, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s determination, that Kaydon had intentionally discriminated against Henry by terminating him from employment because of his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In the second administrative appeal, the Commission posed three questions to the Appeal Board: 1) \u201cWhether the Appeal Board may vacate the [ALJ\u2019s] decision ... and issue a decision of its own finding that Kaydon discriminated against ... Henry in violation of Article 49B and order[] the relief sought by the Commission in its Statement of Charges?\u201d; 2) \u201cWhether the [ALJ] erred in his decision upon remand by the Appeal Board by failing to make a finding of fact as to each material issue of fact such as to require the Appeal Board to vacate the decision?\u201d and 3) \u201cWhether the ALJ erred in his decision upon remand by the Appeal Board by failing to make legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law such as to require the Appeal Board to vacate the decision?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">With respect to the first issue, the Commission argued that the new \u201centire record\u201d standard of review applicable to administrative appeals under article 49B gave the Appeal Board broad discretion to substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ, including discretion to resolve credibility issues not resolved by the ALJ or to resolve those issues differently than did the ALJ. The Appeal Board ruled that it did not have to address that issue because its decision was being made \u201cbased on its consideration of the entire record including the [ALJ\u2019s] assessment of the credibility of witnesses\u201d and \u201cdiffer[ed] from that of the [ALJ] because the [Appeal] Board believe[d] that the application of the law to the facts in the record, and the inferences to be drawn therefrom, require[d] a different result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The Appeal Board rejected the Commission\u2019s second issue, ruling that the ALJ\u2019s second decision met the requirement of COMAR 14.03.01.09H(1), that the proposed order contain findings of fact and conclusions of law on each material issue of fact and law presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The Appeal Board then turned to the third and final issue, stating: \u201cThe ultimate issue for the Appeal Board to resolve in this case is whether the evidence in the record as a whole supports a finding that [Kaydon] unlawfully discriminated against ... Henry on the basis of his race and/or national origin.\u201d The Appeal Board acknowledged the record contained evidence tending to support Kaydon\u2019s claim that Henry was discharged for legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, namely his record of poor performance. It found, however, that, notwithstanding that evidence, \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence supported] the Commission\u2019s argument that Henry was terminated intentionally due to the fact that he is black.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The Appeal Board identified two primary factors supporting its conclusion: \u201c(1) the evidence of Steve Skinner\u2019s racially motivated treatment of black workers on the job, and (2) the differential treatment afforded a white employee, Tom Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>gan, who was similarly situated to Henry.\u201d With respect to the first factor, after quoting the ALJ\u2019s observation that it would be possible to infer from Skinner\u2019s poor treatment of blacks in the workplace that he might fire a worker for being black (without then quoting the next portion of the ALJ\u2019s opinion, in which he found that the evidence considered as a whole did not support a finding that Skinner had terminated Henry on account of his race), the Appeal Board commented: \u201cSkinner\u2019s pattern of treating black workers less favorably than white workers on the job suggests that any decision by Skinner to terminate the employment of a black employee should be subjected to close scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">With respect to the second factor, the Appeal Board reviewed the evidence about Morgan\u2019s having bid for, and received, the trucker\u2019s job at Kaydon. Citing the testimony of employee Ralph Lane, the Appeal Board stated that there was evidence in the record that Skinner had responded to Morgan\u2019s performance problems by suggesting he apply for the trucker\u2019s job but had responded to Henry\u2019s inquiries about transferring to the trucker\u2019s job by saying it would be against the union contract for a probationary employee to transfer to another job at Kaydon. At the evidentiary hearing, Skinner had denied telling Henry that. The Appeal Board acknowledged Skinner\u2019s testimony but found he had treated Henry differently than Morgan by not standing in Morgan\u2019s way when Morgan applied for the trucker\u2019s job but firing Henry abruptly \u201cwithout investigating whether a firing was justified or not\u201d that is, whether Fiddler had told him not to run one of the machines on the day of the firing.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The Board finished its opinion by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">The [Board] concludes that Skinner\u2019s different treatment on the job of black employees and white employees who worked under his supervision, the company\u2019s award of a trucker\u2019s job to Morgan, a white employee similarly situated to Henry, and Skinner\u2019s different response to and treatment of Morgan and Henry, both of whom were not, in Skinner\u2019s view, performing satisfactorily, constitute proof by a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ponderance of the evidence that Henry was unlawfully terminated by Kaydon because of his race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The Appeal Board reversed the ALJ\u2019s second decision dismissing the complaint, and remanded the matter for a decision on the appropriate remedy. Once the remedy was decided (by the Appeal Board, upon review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, and reversing it), the Commission adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s decision as the final agency action, <em>see </em>COMAR 14.03.01.10H(5), and the final agency action became subject to judicial review in the circuit court under section 10-222 of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Under SG section 10-222(h)(3), in a circuit court action for judicial review, the court may reverse or modify the agency\u2019s final decision \u201cif any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision\u201d was unconstitutional; \u201cexceeded] the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency\u201d; \u201cresult[ed] from an unlawful procedure\u201d; was \u201caffected by any other error of law\u201d; was \u201cunsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted\u201d; or was \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In <em>Stover v.

Once it is determined that the agency did not err in its determination or interpretation of the applicable law, the reviewing court next examines the agency\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>sion.

Finally, the reviewing court must examine how the agency applied the law to the facts.

Despite that procedural posture, it remains the agency\u2019s final decision, not the ALJ\u2019s decision, that we review for substantial evidence.

The agency itself makes factual findings, taking into consideration the factual findings made by the ALJ. When the ALJ\u2019s factual findings are the product of assessing the credibility of the witnesses, \u201c \u2018the agency should give appropriate deference to the opportunity of the [ALJ] to observe the demeanor of the witnesses,\u2019 and the agency should reject credibility assessments only if it gives \u2018strong reasons.\u2019 \u201d 100 Md.App. at 298, 641 A.2d 899 (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>330 Md. at 213, 623 A.2d 198). In other words, while the agency ordinarily must not defer to the ALJ\u2019s findings, it should give substantial deference to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations to the extent they are critical to the outcome of the case <em>and </em>they are demeanor-based, that is, they are the product of observing the behavior of the witnesses and not of drawing inferences from and weighing non-testimonial evidence. <em>Berkshire Life Ins. v.

In making this judgment, the ALJ\u2019s findings are, of course, part of the record and are to be considered along with the other portions of the record. Moreover, where credibility is pivotal to the agency\u2019s final order, [the] ALJ\u2019s findings based on the demeanor of witnesses are entitled to substantial deference and can be rejected by the agency only if it gives strong reasons for doing so. If, however, after giving appropriate deference to the ALJ\u2019s demeanor-based findings there is sufficient evidence in the record to support both the decision of the ALJ and that of the agency, the agency\u2019s final order is to be affirmed\u2014even if a court might have reached the opposite conclusion. This approach preserves the rightful roles of the ALJ, the agency, and the reviewing court: it gives special deference to both the ALJ\u2019s demeanor-based credibility determinations and to the agency\u2019s authority in making other factual findings and properly limits the role of the reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABr\">100 Md.App. at 302-03, 641 A.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In its first question presented, the Commission contends the circuit court erred by applying an incorrect standard of review. We need not address this issue. As we have explained, on appellate review of an action for judicial review of a final agency decision, we perform precisely the same task as the circuit court. Thus, regardless of whether the circuit court applied a correct or incorrect standard of review, it only is necessary that in performing our review, we apply the correct standard. Accordingly, the sole issue for resolution in this appeal is the Commission\u2019s second question presented: Whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the final agency decision?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>The Commission contends the final agency decision must be affirmed because it is supported by substantial evidence in the entire record and is not arbitrary or capricious or otherwise subject to reversal for any of the reasons set forth in SG section 10~222(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">Kaydon contends the final agency decision cannot be affirmed, for several reasons. First, the evidence in the record cannot support a <em>prima facie </em>finding of discrimination, under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test as applied to discriminatory discharge cases. Second, the Commission\u2019s finding of a pretextual firing is not supported by substantial evidence because there is not evidence from which a reasoning mind reasonably could find disparate treatment and because the Commission, through the Appeal Board, did not give adequate deference to the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and itself made credibility determinations that necessarily were demeanor-based. Finally, with respect to the issue of remedy, Kaydon maintains there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s finding of economic loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In its reply brief, the Commission argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that Kaydon waived its argument respecting proof of a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>Prima Facie Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Although the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>case concerned an unlawful refusal to hire, the framework of proof adopted in that case has since been applied to other employment discrimination claims, including those alleging discriminatory terminations. <em>Douglas v.

The parties agree that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework applied to this case and required the Commission first to present <em>prima facie </em>proof that Kaydon terminated Henry from employment because of his race; and then, after Kaydon produced evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the termination, to show that that reason was a pretext for Henry\u2019s termination, with Kaydon\u2019s actual reason for firing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Henry being his race. <em>Burdine, supra, </em>at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089; <em>Killian, supra, </em>at 68, 716 A.2d 1071; <em>Brandon, supra, </em>at 188, 655 A.2d 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In the termination context, a <em>prima facie </em>case is made out upon proof that the employee is a member of a protected minority; was discharged from employment; was qualified for the job in which he was working; and was discharged under circumstances raising a reasonable inference of intentional discrimination. <em>See Sengupta v.

Rather, at the conclusion of the Commission\u2019s evidence, Kaydon went forward and produced evidence to show that it had terminated Henry\u2019s employment due to poor performance, not due to race or national origin. In his first decision, the ALJ addressed whether the Commission had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of unlawful discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>tion and found that it had done so. Later, upon remand, but on the same record, the ALJ reached the same conclusion on the issue of <em>prima facie </em>case. As explained above, however, the ALJ\u2019s ultimate decision (both in his 1997 decision and his 1998 decision) favored Kaydon, in that he found that Henry in fact had performed poorly and that Kaydon in fact had terminated Henry for that reason and not because of his race or national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">In <em>United States Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>460 U.S. 711, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983), the Supreme Court explained that in a Title VII discriminatory employment practice case tried under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework of proof, when, after the complainant has introduced evidence intended to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the employer responds by introducing evidence of a legitimate reason for the conduct at issue, <em>e.g., </em>termination from employment, the question of whether a <em>prima facie </em>case was established is no longer viable. In the context of a failure to promote case, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">[WJhen the [employer] fails to persuade the district court to dismiss the action for lack of a <em>prima facie </em>case, and responds to the [employee\u2019s] proof by offering evidence of the reason for the [employee\u2019s] rejection [for promotion], the factfinder must then decide whether the rejection was discriminatory within the meaning of Title VII. At this stage, the <em>McDonnell </em>... presumption [of discrimination] \u201cdrops from the case,\u201d [Texas <em>Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248], 255 at n. 10, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 [(1981)] and \u201cthe factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">The \u201cfactual inquiry\u201d in a Title VII case is \u201c[whether] the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burdine, supra, </em>at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089. In other words, is the employer ... treating \u2018some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u2019 <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v.

United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 335, n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). The prima facie case method established in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>was \u201cnever intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.\u201d <em>Furnco, supra, </em>at 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943. <em>Where the defendant has done everything that would be required of him if the plaintiff had properly made out a prima facie case, whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevant. The \u00a1factfinder </em>] has before it all the evidence it needs to decide whether \u201cthe defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Burdine, supra, </em>at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">460 U.S. at 714-15, 103 S.Ct. 1478 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In the case at bar, at the evidentiary hearing, Kaydon responded to the Commission\u2019s proof by producing evidence of what it contended was the true, non-discriminatory reason for its having terminated Henry\u2014that Henry was not performing satisfactorily. Its evidence of poor performance on Henry\u2019s part was thus directed to the question of whether Henry\u2019s termination was for a prohibited, discriminatory reason (his race) or a legitimate reason (because he was performing poorly). Indeed, Kaydon did not argue that the Commission did not present a <em>prima facie </em>case. Under the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Aikens, </em>which was followed by this Court in <em>Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., Inc. v. Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>70 Md.App. 538, 546-47, 521 A.2d 1263 (1987), whether the Commission made out a <em>prima facie </em>case became irrelevant once Kaydon went forward with its evidence, and therefore is not an issue properly before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Kaydon argues that recently, in <em>Nerenberg v. RICA, </em>131 Md.App. 646, 750 A.2d 655 (2000), this Court in some manner rejected the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Aikens </em>and our prior holding in <em>Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>Drydock Co., Inc. </em>and held in the context of an employment discrimination/discharge case that whether the complainant in such a case presented <em>prima facie </em>proof remains relevant on appeal, even after the ultimate issue of whether the discharge from employment was a product of intentional discrimination has been addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Kaydon misreads <em>Nerenberg. </em>In that case, an employee\u2019s estate sued her former employer in circuit court, alleging that she had been discharged in violation of the two federal anti-discrimination statutes: the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>and the Rehabilitation Act of 1978, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, <em>et seq. </em>The appeal followed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the former employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Because of the posture of the case, this Court evaluated whether the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the estate/employee generated a genuine dispute of material fact either on the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case or on the issue of pretextual firing, and concluded that it did not. Had the case gone to trial, and the former employer presented evidence of a non-discriminatory reason for the termination, then under <em>Aikens </em>and <em>Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock </em>whether a <em>prima facie </em>case had been made out would not have been relevant on appeal. The issue was relevant on appeal because, given the posture of the case, the absence of a genuine dispute of material fact on the elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case supported the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Not only is Kaydon precluded from challenging at this stage of the proceedings the existence <em>vel non </em>of <em>prima facie </em>proof of discrimination under <em>Aikens </em>and <em>Maryland Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock, </em>it also failed to preserve the issue for review in any event by not raising it before the ALJ at all and not raising it before the Appeal Board until after the issue of unlawful discrimination was decided by the Appeal Board. In the administrative phase of this case, the first and only time Kaydon raised the sufficiency of the proof of a <em>prima facie </em>case was in a motion for reconsideration on the issue of remedy. The Appeal Board denied the motion without com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ment. By not arguing before the ALJ that the Commission did' not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case and by not challenging before the Appeal Board the ALJ\u2019s decision that the Commission in fact made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, Kaydon failed to preserve the issue for judicial review. <em>Cicala v. Disability Review Bd., </em>288 Md. 254, 263, 418 A.2d 205 (1980) (\u201cBecause the issue ... was not raised during the administrative proceeding, it was not properly raised in the judicial review proceeding, and therefore is not properly before us.\u201d); <em>Severn v. Baltimore, </em>230 Md. 160, 170, 186 A.2d 199 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Even if we were to consider Kaydon\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case argument on its merits, however, we would reject it. Kaydon maintains that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support a finding in the Commission\u2019s favor on the third and fourth elements of a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">With respect to the third element\u2014that the employee was meeting his employer\u2019s expectations at the time of discharge\u2014 Kaydon argues that the evidence overwhelmingly established that Henry was not qualified for the machine operator\u2019s job when he was discharged from employment. In his decision on that issue, the ALJ relied on evidence introduced by the Commission to conclude that the element was satisfied. Specifically, the Commission called several of Henry\u2019s co-workers who testified that he was able to handle the machines he was assigned to operate and was improving in his job. The ALJ observed: \u201cThe testimony of [Henry\u2019s] co-employees that in their view [Henry] was making progress and performing adequately is enough to demonstrate that [he] was qualified for the position at this <em>[prima facie </em>] stage of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">We think the evidence the ALJ relied on was substantial enough to support his finding that Henry was qualified for employment when he was discharged, notwithstanding that the evidence further showed, and the ALJ further found1, that Henry was not performing his job satisfactorily. In the <em>prima facie </em>case phase of the hearing, the primary evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Henry\u2019s performance at the time he was fired came from co-employees who observed his work and from Henry, who, while acknowledging that his performance could improve, maintained he was not performing deficiently. Ultimately, in deciding the issue of qualification at the time of termination, the ALJ placed far greater weight on Skinner\u2019s testimony and statistics that showed that Henry was performing at a lower level than other employees. The fact that the ALJ made that ultimate finding does not mean, however, that the Commission\u2019s evidence was not adequate to show <em>prima facie </em>that Henry was performing up to Kaydon\u2019s expectations. Assuming, as we must, that the Appeal Board implicitly adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision on this point, we conclude there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commission\u2019s decision that the third element of <em>prima facie </em>proof under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standard was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">With respect to the fourth element, Kaydon argues there was no evidence presented by the Commission from which to draw a reasonable inference that race played a role in Henry\u2019s firing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In its second decision, the Appeal Board explained that one could draw a general inference from the evidence that Skinner routinely disparaged black employees but did not treat white employees that way, that he would be more likely to fire a black employee than a white employee; and for that reason, his decision to fire a black employee warranted close scrutiny. We read the Appeal Board\u2019s comment on this point as a finding on the fourth element of <em>prima facie </em>proof under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework. Viewing only the Commission\u2019s evidence, as introduced in the opening phase of the hearing, Henry was black, was discharged from employment, was not performing deficiently when he was fired, and was fired by Skinner, a white supervisor who routinely treated black employees disparagingly, in contrast to his treatment of white employees. In addition, the Commission presented proof, through Henry\u2019s testimony, that Skinner had treated Henry in that manner. Viewed in totality, this evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>enough to support a reasonable inference that Henry\u2019s termination was a product of intentional discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">\n<em>Pretext and Ultimate Finding of Intentional Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Most of Kaydon\u2019s other contentions concern the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the reason it gave for discharging Henry\u2014that he was not performing satisfactorily\u2014was a pretext and that Henry really was fired because of his race. Kaydon challenges that conclusion as either being unsupported by substantial evidence or arbitrary and capricious. Applying the standard of review articulated in <em>Shrieves, </em>we conclude that a reasoning mind could not reach the decision the Commission reached in this case for the reasons it gave, <em>i.e., </em>those stated by the Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">When we review the decision of an administrative agency, our \u201cappraisal or evaluation must be of the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and not an independent original estimate of or decision on the evidence.\u201d <em>Ins. Comm\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 309, 236 A.2d 282 (1967). In other words, we may affirm the decision of an administrative agency only for the reasons relied upon by the agency. <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Brandywine Enter., Inc., </em>350 Md. 339, 348, 711 A.2d 1346 (1998) (citing <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>329 Md. 494, 507, 620 A.2d 886 (1993), in turn citing <em>Harford County v. Preston, </em>322 Md. 493, 503, 588 A.2d 772 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Proof of an intent to discriminate based on race may be shown circumstantially by proof of disparate treatment by an employer of similarly situated employees of different races. <em>Nichols v. Harford County Bd. of Educ., </em>189 F.Supp.2d. 325, 340 (D.Md.2002). <em>See generally, Callwood v. Dave &amp; Busters, Inc., </em>98 F.Supp.2d 694, 706 (D.Md.2000). For instance, in the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>case, in which the complainant alleged that the employer had refused to rehire him because he was black, and the employer claimed that it had rejected the complainant because he had engaged in unlawful protests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>against it, the Court explained that \u201cevidence that white employees involved in acts against the [employer] of comparable seriousness to [the complainant\u2019s acts] were nevertheless retained or rehired\u201d would be relevant to the question of whether the stated reason for rejection given by the employer in fact was a pretext. 411 U.S. at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. <em>See also Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977) (explaining that \u201c[disparate treatment\u201d employment discrimination \u201cis the most easily understood type of discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Proof of discriminatory motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences in treatment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In the case at bar, the Appeal Board found that Henry and Morgan were similarly situated employees but were treated differently by Kaydon based on race. Both men were probationary employees who were performing poorly. Henry (a black man) was fired while Morgan (a white man) was allowed to apply for a transfer to another section of the company. The Appeal Board found from this disparate treatment, the evidence of Skinner\u2019s generally disparaging treatment of black employees, and Skinner\u2019s failure to verify whether Henry was not following a command because he had been directed otherwise by Fiddler that Henry was fired because he was black, not because he was performing poorly.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Both Skinner and Henry testified, and the ALJ found, that when Skinner fired Henry, he did so in anger and remarked that Henry could not \u201ccut it,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>could not perform. Moreover, the evidence that Skinner generally treated blacks disparagingly but did not treat whites that way, although he was quick tempered and demanding of employees of all races, was not contested and resulted in findings to that effect made by the ALJ and adopted by the Appeal Board. Also, the Appeal Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s finding that Henry\u2019s performance, as measured by production and efficiency ratings, was deficient. It was the Appeal Board\u2019s finding of disparate treatment, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding, and on a contested issue, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>was crucial to its ultimate finding that despite Skinner\u2019s \u201ccan\u2019t cut it\u201d remark, he in fact fired Henry because Henry is black.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The evidence of disparate treatment in this case was conflicting and only could be resolved by a demeanor-based credibility assessment of certain witnesses. It was the Commission\u2019s and Henry\u2019s position that Skinner greased the path for Morgan to apply for another job at the company, and thus save himself from being terminated due to poor performance, but stood in the way of Henry\u2019s doing so. It was Kaydon\u2019s position that nothing of the sort happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Employee Ralph Lane, called by the Commission, testified that he understood that Skinner responded to Morgan\u2019s performance problems by suggesting that Morgan take the trucker\u2019s job. Henry testified that he saw postings for other job positions at Kaydon but did not apply for any of them: \u201cI could not apply for any position, because Mr. Skinner made it clear that the probationary employee cannot transfer or apply for another job.\u201d Skinner, called by Kaydon, testified that Henry never asked him about bidding on any other job and never talked to him about the trucker\u2019s job that Morgan applied for and was given. Morgan did ask him about the trucker\u2019s job, however, and Skinner told him that if he wanted to bid for it, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t block him in any way from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Depending upon which of these witnesses is believed, and what parts of their testimony are credited, a fact finder reasonably could conclude that Skinner treated Henry and Morgan differently by telling Henry or leading him to think he could not apply for other jobs at Kaydon while leading Morgan to think he could, and then not standing in his way\u2014or reasonably could conclude that Skinner did not do so. Precisely what Skinner said or did, and did not say and do, in this regard is not something that can be determined without a credibility judgment about the witnesses that only can come from observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">The ALJ did not make a finding about what if anything was said by Skinner to Henry and/or Morgan about the opportunity or lack of opportunity for probationary employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>to transfer to other jobs. Under the \u201centire record\u201d standard of administrative review, if the ALJ had made such a finding, the Appeal Board would have owed it substantial deference, but could have rejected it for sound reasons. The Appeal Board did neither, because there was no finding, and instead made a finding of its own. In our view, the Appeal Board erred both by failing to recognize that a finding on this issue was material, and therefore should have been made by the ALJ, and by itself making a finding on the issue when it depended on a demeanor-based credibility assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The Appeal Board properly should have remanded the case to the ALJ for him to make findings that resolved the conflict in the evidence over whether Skinner led Henry, a black employee, to think he could not apply for a transfer, while leading Morgan, a white employee, to, think he could, and indeed helping him do so. We disagree with Kaydon that the fact that Morgan\u2019s father was employed there made the situations in which the two probationary employees found themselves so inherently different that a fact finder could not reasonably infer that Skinner\u2019s conduct in treating them differently with respect to the transfer issue, if that conduct indeed occurred, was based on race. While the nepotism practice at Kaydon may have resulted in Morgan\u2019s having an advantage over Henry in being awarded the trucker\u2019s job, it could not logically explain Henry\u2019s being told he could not apply for any job at Kaydon (again, if that is what happened).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The disparate treatment finding made by the Commission was integral to its ultimate finding that Henry was fired due to his race, not due to his poor performance. The disparate treatment finding was not based on substantial evidence, however, because it depended upon resolutions of factual disputes that were not made at all, and should have been made by the ALJ, based on credibility assessments of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We note, contrary to the argument posed by Kaydon, that the ALJ\u2019s finding, ultimately adopted by the Appeal Board, that Henry indeed performed poorly as a probationary ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>chine operator did not dictate a ruling in favor of Kaydon. If there had been substantial evidence of disparate treatment, together with the evidence of generally racially disparaging conduct by Skinner and of Skinner\u2019s not taking steps to verify the reason Henry was not operating his third machine, the Commission well could have reasoned that even though Henry was performing poorly, he was not fired for that reason; rather, he was fired because he was black. There was not substantial evidence of disparate treatment, however, because the record on that issue was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">For these reasons, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court. We shall remand the case with instructions to vacate the Commission\u2019s decision; and to further remand the case to the Commission with instructions to remand it to the ALJ for further findings on the issue of disparate treatment, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\n<em>Remedy: Economic Loss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Finally, Kaydon challenges the Commission\u2019s decision to award Henry back pay based on the difference between the wages he would have earned had he remained in the machine operator\u2019s job for 36 months after the date of discharge and the wages in fact earned during that period in other employment. Because of our disposition of the case, it is not necessary to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED AND DECISION OF THE COMMISSION ON HUMAN RELATIONS VACATED.
