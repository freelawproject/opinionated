Code (1993, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-701 of the State Personnel <em>&amp; </em>Pensions Article (\u201cSP &amp; P\u201d), but that Rideout had waived any right to \u201cother benefits\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c) by receiving temporary total disability benefits under the Maryland Work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ers\u2019 Compensation Act. On appeal, the parties present three questions, which we have reworded and consolidated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\">1. Did the ALJ err, as a matter of law, in finding that the Department incorrectly denied appellant\u2019s request for work-related accident leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">2. Did the ALJ err, as a matter of law, in concluding that appellant waived any right to \u201cother benefits,\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c), by receiving temporary total disability benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to the first question and \u201cyes\u201d to the second. We shall remand the case to determine the length of time Rideout is entitled to receive \u201cother benefits\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">In 1998, Rideout injured her left shoulder in a work-related accident and did not return to the Maryland House of Correction-Annex in Jessup, where she worked as a Correctional Officer II, until September 20, 1999.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The following day, she \u201cwas sent to the firing range to qualify with the 12-gauge shotgun.\u201d In order to qualify, she had to fire twenty \u201crounds.\u201d After firing two rounds, the shotgun \u201cjumped out\u2014 slipped out of the socket, ... hit me on the right side of my cheek, down on the right side of my neck area, shoulders, and down to my forearms.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She reported the incident to a sergeant at the range, and then continued firing the shotgun, which \u201cslipped ... two or three more times.\u201d After qualifying, Rideout reported her injuries to Sergeant Spencer, who \u201cwas the sergeant from [her] agency.\u201d She was then \u201csent home for that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Rideout went to work on September 22 and reported her injuries to Lieutenant Dorn and Captain Smith. Because of a \u201cshortage of personnel\u201d that day, she could not leave work to seek medical treatment. She returned to work the next day and again met with Captain Smith. She provided a written report relating to her injuries and then the two met with Assistant Warden William Smith. According to Rideout, \u201cthey did not like the report that I had written. That I had to rewrite the report and then, and only then, [could I get medical treatment], I rewrote the report and I did it under distress[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Afterwards, she was sent to Concentra, a medical services provider to which the \u201cMaryland House of Correction-Annex sends all the officers ... when they have a job related injury.\u201d There, she was examined by Colleen Vogele, a physician assistant working under the supervision of Dr. Roger Mehl pursuant to a delegation agreement. Vogele diagnosed the injuries as contusions to the right shoulder and upper arm and determined that Rideout could return to \u201cregular duty on 9/23/99\u201d because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">[s]he had no functional deficit during [the] exam, she had full range of motion of both extremities. Actually, upper and lower. No complaints of pain throughout the examination. The only physical finding on exam was a large bruise on the right upper bicep area, looking like from the butt of a rifle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">She also recommended that Rideout\u2019s orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Raymond Drapkin, determine any work restrictions resulting from the prior injury to her left shoulder. Although Dr. Mehl \u201csigned off at the end of the day ... [on Rideout\u2019s] chart,\u201d he did not examine her. Thereafter, the Department did not have its own physician examine Rideout.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On September 24, Dr. Drapkin examined Rideout and determined that she could not work because of injuries to her right side. Rideout stated that \u201c[Drapkin] believed that I had a tear, so he scheduled an MRI. He did x-rays of the upper right side face, neck and shoulder, and upper inner forearm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>And then he referred me to off work status.\u201d At the hearing, Rideout was still on \u201coff work\u201d status.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">As a result of Dr. Drapkin\u2019s diagnosis, Rideout requested work-related accident leave from the Department. According to Rideout, she telephoned several persons at the Department, over a three month period, to inquire about that request but did not learn until December that it had been denied by Assistant Warden Smith. She then filed a grievance disputing that denial and, after two hearings before the Department, was denied again. She then appealed the Department\u2019s denial to the OAH.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In the meantime, Rideout filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) because she was not \u201c[getting] any pay.\u201d On March 13, 2000, the Commission determined that she had suffered a disability to her right shoulder and neck from an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment. It awarded her compensation for temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) from September 22, 1999, to the present, as well as continuing medical expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Rideout\u2019s appeal to the OAH was heard by an ALJ on May 31 and June 20, 2001. She argued that the Department incorrectly denied her request for accident leave pursuant to SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701(a). Addressing subsection (a)(1), she contended that the Commission\u2019s award of TTD established that she sustained \u201ca disabling personal injury that [was] compensable under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d As to subsection (a)(2), she maintained that Dr. Drapkin examined her and certified that she was \u201cdisabled because of the injury.\u201d Rideout indicated that she was not seeking payment for accident leave pursuant to SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(a) but, instead, was seeking \u201cother benefits\u201d as set forth in SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c)(1) &amp; (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The Department, relying upon SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-702(a)(2)(i), contended that the accident leave ended on September 23, 1999, because Dr. Mehl \u201csigned off\u2019 on Vogele\u2019s determination that Rideout could return to work on that day. In support, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>relied upon two declaratory rulings issued by the Department\u2019s Secretary of Personnel, one in 1984 (the \u201c1984 ruling\u201d) and the other in 1995 (the \u201c1995 ruling\u201d). The 1984 ruling provided that the agency\u2019s physician, not the employee\u2019s, determines the date upon which accident leave ends. The 1995 ruling was that accident leave ended on the date certified by a physician, not the date determined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The ALJ issued a written decision on August 8, 2001, concluding as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">[the Department\u2019s] initial denial of accident leave constituted a misinterpretation or misapplication of a policy or regulation over which [the Department] had control. Nevertheless, once [Rideout] accepted the Commission\u2019s retroactive award of temporary total disability benefits, she waived any entitlement to accident leave for the same period [of] time, along with any leave accumulation or retirement credits she would have obtained incident to the award of accident leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In so concluding, the ALJ noted that the Department could not rely upon a diagnosis by a physician assistant, even if it was \u201csigned off\u2019 by a physician, because SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701(a)(2) required that a physician examine Rideout. The ALJ found the 1984 ruling inapposite because the question addressed by the Department concerned employees who were examined by physicians, not physician assistants. Relying on the 1995 ruling, however, the ALJ stated that the Commissioner\u2019s award of TTD did not establish Rideout\u2019s \u201centitlement to accident leave\u201d under SP &amp; P 9\u2014701(a)(1), but rather, a \u201cphysician\u2019s certification ... [was] controlling.\u201d Finally, the ALJ found that SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) precluded Rideout from receiving both TTD benefits and accident leave and, therefore, \u201conce [Rideout] accepted and collected the TTD award, she waived any right thereafter to recover accident leave for the same period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Rideout sought judicial review of that decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. After a hearing on January 18, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>the circuit court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">We review the decision of an administrative agency to determine if it is \u201c \u2018in accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u2019\u201d <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t v. Ives, </em>136 Md.App. 581, 585, 766 A.2d 657, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 462, 773 A.2d 514 (2001) (quoting <em>Moseman v. County Council, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 262, 636 A.2d 499 (1994)). We are \u201c \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999) (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). In applying the substantial evidence test, we must decide \u201c\u2018 \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d 376 (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)). When reviewing the agency\u2019s legal conclusions, \u201cwe may substitute our judgment for that of the agency if there are erroneous conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 585, 766 A.2d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">The Department argues that the ALJ erred, as a matter of law, in finding that it could not rely upon the diagnosis of a physician assistant (\u201cassistant\u201d) in denying Rideout\u2019s request for work-related accident leave (\u201caccident leave\u201d). Essentially, the Department contends that \u201cphysician,\u201d as used in SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701(a)(2), should be read in conjunction with Md.Code (1981, 2000 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 14-101 <em>et seq. </em>and 15-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health Occupation Article (\u201cHealth\u201d). It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>maintains that, because an assistant \u201cis an agent of the supervising physician in the performance of all practice-related activities,\u201d SP &amp; P \u00a7 9\u2014701(a)(2) \u201cmust be interpreted to mean that the examination required therein may be performed\u201d by an assistant. It also argues that the 1984 ruling controls, because \u201cany conflict between the State\u2019s physician and an employee\u2019s personal physician may properly be resolved in favor of the State\u2019s physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">When we interpret a statute, our \u201cinquiry begins with the words of the statute and, ordinarily, also ends there.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 586, 766 A.2d 657. \u201cIf the words of the statute are clear and free from ambiguity, we need not look further.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 586-87, 766 A.2d 657. In <em>Ives, </em>we found that SP &amp; P \u00a7 9\u2014701(a)(1) did not permit State employees to use accident leave for treatment of an occupational disease. In so finding, we noted that the plain language of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701 was \u201cclear and unambiguous,\u201d but, \u201cin the interest of completeness,\u201d we examined the purpose of that statute to ascertain the meaning of the phrase \u201cdisabling personal injury.\u201d <em>Ives, </em>136 Md.App. at 589, 766 A.2d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Here, the plain language of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9\u2014701(a)(2) is clear and unambiguous. It provides that an employee is entitled to accident leave if \u201ca <em>physician </em>examines the employee and certifies that the employee is disabled because of the injury.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, a physician, not an assistant, must examine an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">We are not persuaded that SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701(a)(2) must be read in conjunction with Health \u00a7\u00a7 14-101 <em>et seq. </em>and 15-101 <em>et seq. </em>Even if it were, however, an examination by an assistant would not satisfy the requirements of (a)(2) because an assistant is not a physician, but rather, \u201can individual who is certified under this title to perform delegated medical acts under the supervision of a physician.\u201d Health \u00a7 15-101(m). In the Health Article, an assistant is not included in any definition for physician. For example, in \u00a7 1\u2014101(i), a physician \u201cmeans, except in Title 14 of this article, an individual who is authorized by a law of this State to practice medicine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>this State.\u201d \u00a7 14\u2014101(j) defines physician as \u201can individual who practices medicine.\u201d And, a \u201clicensed physician\u201d is a \u201cphysician ... who is licensed by the Board to practice medicine.\u201d \u00a7 14-101(g). Although, pursuant to a delegation agreement, a physician may delegate certain medical acts such as taking patient histories, reviewing patient records, and performing physical examinations, Health \u00a7 15-301 (c), the delegated performance of such acts by an assistant does not negate the plain language of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-701(a)(2) that a physician examine an employee and certify that the employee is disabled as a result of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The 1984 ruling is also unpersuasive because it provides that the agency\u2019s physician, not the employee\u2019s, determines the date upon which accident leave ends. Again, it is a physician, not an assistant, who makes that determination. Thus, we conclude that the ALJ did not err, as a matter of law, in finding that the Department could not rely upon the diagnosis of an assistant to deny Rideout\u2019s request for accident leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Rideout argues that the ALJ erred, as a matter of'law, in concluding that she waived any right to \u201cother benefits,\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c), by receiving TTD benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In support, she contends there was no waiver because the \u201crecord is replete with testimony ... evidencing her continued efforts to secure work-related accident leave together with her incidental benefits.\u201d She also maintains that while SP &amp; P 9-704(d) does not allow an employee to \u201ccollect both sick pay and workers\u2019 compensation,\u201d it does not preclude an employee, who is receiving TTD benefits, from \u201ccontinuing leave accruals and health benefits.\u201d The Department contends that Rideout would collect a \u201cdouble recovery as a result of the same injury\u201d if permitted to receive TTD benefits and accident leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In <em>Correctional Pre-Release System v. Whittington, </em>119 Md.App. 436, 443, 705 A.2d 78 (1998), we held that SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) precluded a \u201cState employee who receives accident leave ... from receiving [TTD] while receiving such accident leave.\u201d In <em>Whittington, </em>the employee had been awarded accident leave and was accruing \u201cleave and retirement credit as a full-time state employee.\u201d <em>Whittington, </em>119 Md.App. at 439, 705 A.2d 78. Relying on Md.Code (1991), \u00a7 9-610 of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article (\u201cLabor\u201d), Whittington argued that, because his \u201cnet\u201d accident leave payment was lower than the payment he would have received from the Commission, he was entitled to the difference between those benefits. In that context, we held that the plain language of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) governed and that Whittington could not receive TTD benefits. We did not address whether SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) precluded an employee, who was receiving TTD benefits, from receiving \u201cother benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"> Because Rideout only asks us to reverse the Department\u2019s decision based on an erroneous conclusion of law, we limit our review to the statutory construction of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704. As the Court of Appeals reiterated in <em>Dyer v. Otis Warren Real Estate Co., </em>371 Md. 576, 581, 810 A.2d 938 (2002) (quoting <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore et al. v. Chase et al., </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000) (quoting <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Co. of Maryland v.

By Chapter 800 of the 1978 Laws of Maryland, which was codified at Md.Code (1957, 1972 Repl.Vol., 1978 Supp.), Article 64A, \u00a7 37(g), accident leave was extended to all state employees. Section 37(g)(1) awarded accident leave with full pay to an employee who, \u201cin the actual performance of his job duties,\u201d sustained an accidental personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>injury that \u201cwould be compensable under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d 1978 Maryland Laws, Ch. 800 at 2337. Section 37(g)(2) provided that an employee could receive accident leave for \u201cone year from the injury date.\u201d 1978 Maryland Laws, Ch. 800 at 2337. Section 37(g)(3) precluded an employee from receiving temporary total benefits \u201cunder Workmen\u2019s Compensation while receiving full pay under this section.\u201d 1978 Maryland Laws, Ch. 800 at 2337.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">As part of a code revision in 1993, the General Assembly added a new article, SP &amp; P, to the Annotated Code of Maryland, which repealed Art. 64A and recodified \u00a7 37(g) at SP &amp; P \u00a7 7-601 <em>et seq. </em>1993 Maryland Laws, Ch. 10, \u00a7 2 at 609-10, 751-54.

Section 7-605(a) provided that payment for accident leave was \u201cbased on two-thirds of the employee\u2019s regular pay.\u201d 1993 Maryland Laws, Ch. 616 at 3030. In \u00a7 7-605(c), the General Assembly provided that \u201can employee receiving work-related accident leave shall continue to accrue leave, seniority, and health care benefits.\u201d 1993 Maryland Laws, Ch. 616 at 3030.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In 1994, SP &amp; P \u00a7 7-605(c) was repealed and reenacted, with amendments, for the purpose of \u201cclarifying the existing practices for the continuation of certain employee benefits during work-related accident leave.\u201d 1994 Maryland Laws, Ch. 471, \u00a7 3 at 2255. That section provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">(c) Notwithstanding the reduced rate that an employee is paid while using work-related accident leave, the employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">(1) continues seniority and leave accruals based on the employee\u2019s regular pay; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(2) does not lose health care benefits ... solely because of use of the work-related accident leave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The following year, the General Assembly repealed and reenacted, with amendments, SP &amp; P \u00a7\u00a7 7-602 and 7-603 to \u201cclarify!] the circumstances in which an employee is entitled to work-related accident leave with sick pay.\u201d 1995 Maryland Laws, Ch. 540 at 3139. Section 7-602(a)(l) provided that an employee who sustained a disabling personal injury in the course of employment was entitled to accident leave. 1995 Maryland Laws, Ch. 540 at 3140. \u00a7 7\u2014603(a) (2)(ii) changed the amount of time that an employee could remain on accident leave from one year to six months. Finally, \u00a7 7-603(c) provided that accident leave could \u201cbe granted for up to an additional six months\u201d if certain conditions were satisfied. 1995 Maryland Laws, Ch. 540 at 3140.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Finally, in 1996, the legislature repealed SP &amp; P \u00a7\u00a7 7-602 through 7-606 and reenacted those sections, with amendments, at SP &amp; P \u00a7\u00a7 9-701 through 9-705. Those amendments are not relevant to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">c. \u00a7 9-610 of the Labor Article</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Although we determined in <em>Whittington </em>that the plain language of SP &amp; P \u00a7 9\u2014704(d) precluded an employee from receiving additional TTD benefits under Labor \u00a7 9-610, the rationale used to determine whether workers\u2019 compensation benefits may be offset against other benefits is instructive. Labor \u00a7 9-610 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">(a)(1) If a statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, regulation, or policy, regardless of whether part of a pension system, provides a benefit to a covered employee of a governmental unit ..., payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability of the employer ... for payment of similar benefits under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">(2) If a benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than the benefits provided under this title, the employer ... shall provide an additional benefit that equals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the difference between the benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection and the benefits provided under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The purpose of that section \u201cwas to allow the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to prevent an employee from receiving a double recovery for the same injury.\u201d <em>Whittington, </em>119 Md.App. at 441, 705 A.2d 78; <em>see State Retirement &amp; Pension System of Maryland v. Thompson, </em>368 Md. 53, 70, 792 A.2d 277 (2002); <em>Fikar v. Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. 430, 435, 635 A.2d 977 (1994); <em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 659, 399 A.2d 250 (1979). It accomplished its purpose by providing an offset of workers\u2019 compensation benefits against the benefits provided by an employer, so long as the benefits were \u201csimilar.\u201d <em>Fikar, </em>333 Md. at 435, 635 A.2d 977; <em>see Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>311 Md. 721, 724, 537 A.2d 274 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In <em>Frank, </em>the employee retired from the Baltimore County Police Department because of a work-related injury and received disability pension benefits from his employer. Subsequently, the Commission awarded him compensation for a permanent partial disability, but determined that the \u201cobligation had been fully discharged ... because the pension benefits that were provided by Baltimore County were \u2018equal to or better than any benefit\u2019 ... under the workmen\u2019s compensation statute.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 658, 399 A.2d 250. The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that workers\u2019 compensation benefits could be offset against disability pension benefits because the two were similar in that both were payments made as a result of a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">In contrast, an employer may not offset workers\u2019 compensation benefits against \u201cordinary\u201d retirement benefits because the benefits are not similar. <em>Newman, </em>311 Md. at 728, 537 A.2d 274; <em>see Blevins &amp; Wills v. Baltimore County, </em>352 Md. 620, 644, 724 A.2d 22 (1999) (stating that the employer \u201cis not entitled to set off Wills\u2019s retirement benefits against her workers\u2019 compensation benefits\u201d). In <em>Newman, </em>the Commission awarded Newman permanent partial disability compensation and, thereafter, Newman retired and began receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>benefits under \u201cthe county pension plan.\u201d <em>Newman, </em>311 Md. at 723, 537 A.2d 274. The Court of Appeals held that Newman\u2019s employer was not entitled to an offset because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-4\">[she] was awarded workmen\u2019s compensation because of the impairment of the industrial use of her body as a result of her work-related injury. On the other hand, it appears that she was entitled to the benefits under the retirement plan merely because she had elected to retire after attaining a prescribed age and 20 years service with the county. The payment of these benefits had no relation whatsoever to her injury and the disability resulting therefrom ... In short, her retirement payments were an age and length of service benefit; her workmen\u2019s compensation award was a disability benefit. The two benefits were not similar and not comparable. Therefore, the offset provisions ... were not applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Newman, </em>311 Md. at 724, 537 A.2d 274.</p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">d. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">When an employee receives TTD benefits, he or she receives two-thirds of his or her average weekly wage. Labor \u00a7 9-621(a)(l). Likewise, payment to a state employee for accident leave is based upon two-thirds of his regular pay. SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(a). The payment benefits are similar because they compensate an employee for a personal injury sustained in the course of employment. Thus, to prevent an employee from recovering twice for the same injury, SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) precludes the receipt of TTD benefits while receiving payment for accident leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">There is no language in SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704, however, that prevents an employee who receives TTD benefits from also receiving \u201cother benefits\u201d under SP <em>&amp; </em>P \u00a7 9-704(c). Indeed, SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(d) provides that an employee may not receive TTD benefits while receiving <em>payment </em>for accident leave. In SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c), \u201cpayment\u201d refers to compensation based upon two-thirds of an employee\u2019s regular pay, not the continuation of \u201cother benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Moreover, \u201cother benefits\u201d do not arise as a result of an employee\u2019s injury. In the absence of an injury, the employee would receive those benefits as an incident of employment. In 1993, SP &amp; P \u00a7 7-605(c) was enacted to \u201cclarify[] that employees receiving work-related accident leave continue certain benefits\u201d such as leave, seniority, and health care benefits. The following year, SP <em>&amp; </em>P \u00a7 7-605(c) was reenacted, again, to \u201cclarifyO the existing practices for the continuation of certain employee benefits during work-related accident leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">We conclude that SP &amp; P \u00a7 9\u2014704(d) does not preclude an employee who receives TTD benefits from receiving \u201cother benefits\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-7Q4(c). In receiving such benefits, the employee does not recover twice for the same injury. Rather, the employee is assured those benefits to which he or she would have been entitled, in the absence of the work-related injury. In light of that conclusion, we reverse the l\u00e9gal conclusion of the ALJ with respect to this issue, and remand the case to determine the length of time Rideout is entitled to receive \u201cother benefits\u201d under SP &amp; P \u00a7 9-704(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED WITH RESPECT TO QUESTION ONE.
