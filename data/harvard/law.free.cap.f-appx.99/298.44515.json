Caldarola v. County of Westchester, </em>343 F.3d 570, 573 (2d Cir.2003). The critical, undisputed facts are these: When defendant-appellee Lt. Richard Shore presented the photographer and reporter from the <em>Times Herald Record </em>with an envelope containing plaintiff-appellant Joel Olivera\u2019s so-called international driver\u2019s permit, Shore merely told them that the envelope contained examples of inauthentic identification. On his own, the photographer chose Olivera\u2019s fake ID from a collection that included photos of Hispanic and non-Hispanic (appearing) people. There is no evidence in the record that Shore suggested that the identification cards were used in connection with shoplifting or that Olivera was suspected of that crime. Any assumptions to the contrary by the photographer or others at the <em>Record </em>were wholly unwarranted, notwithstanding the fact that the \u201c[p]redominant[ ] ... theme\u201d of Shore\u2019s interview concerned shoplifting. The photographer and the <em>Record\u2019s </em>decision to portray Olivera in a false light as a shoplifter, therefore, was not the \u201cnatural consequence[ ] of [Shore\u2019s] actions,\u201d <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 187, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), and Shore cannot be presumed to have intended it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Accordingly, although we sympathize with Olivera for the embarrassment he suffered, there is no basis for inferring that Shore acted with any intent to discriminate against Olivera based on his race or for any other reason, and Olivera\u2019s equal protection claims, whether viewed through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or \u00a7 1981, fail. <em>See Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 391, 102 S.Ct. 3141, 73 L.Ed.2d 835 (1982); <em>African Trade &amp; Info. Ctr., Inc. v. Abromaitis, </em>294 F.3d 355, 362-63 (2d Cir.2002). Olivera\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim fails because it was not unreasonable to present Olivera\u2019s identification to the <em>Record </em>for what it was: fake. The police have a legitimate interest in reporting the types and appearances of inauthentic identification cards, and although there are limits on how the police may publicize their law enforcement efforts, <em>compare Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 695, 712-13, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976) <em>with Lauro v. Charles, </em>219 F.3d 202, 203 (2d Cir.2000), Olivera has failed to show that his privacy interests outweighed the legitimate government purposes served by <em>Shore\u2019s </em>actions (as distinct from the <em>Record\u2019s), see Caldarola, </em>343 F.3d at 572. Finally, because Shore\u2019s behavior did not amount to a \u201c \u2018conscience-shocking\u2019 exercise[] of power by [a] government actor[],\u201d no substantive due process claim lies against the defendants, either. <em>Johnson v. Newburgh Enlarged Sch. Dist., </em>239 F.3d 246, 252 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
