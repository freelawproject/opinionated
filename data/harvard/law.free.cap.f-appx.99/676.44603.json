Barret Trust, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the United States on Cave Hill\u2019s action seeking a refund of taxes paid on income from the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Oral argument, the parties\u2019 briefs, and our study of both the appellate record and the applicable law, convince this court that the Barret Trust is not exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(13). We agree, for the reasons the district court set forth in its memorandum opinion, that the Trust is not a cemetery company. Furthermore, the Barret Trust primarily benefits Barret-family grave sites; any benefit to Cave Hill Cemetery as a whole occurs only incidentally to the benefits that are purely individual. The Trust\u2019s cause is therefore not helped by an IRS Revenue Ruling stating that a trust, \u201cthe funds of which are irrevocably dedicated to the perpetual care of a non-profit cemetery, <em>as a whole, none of the earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual, </em>may qualify\u201d for exemption under \u00a7 501(c)(13). Rev. Rul. 58-190, 1958-1 C.B. 15, 1958 WL 10627 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
