Because we lack jurisdiction, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>dismiss the appeal and deny the motion for injunction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">\u201cOrdinarily, denial of a temporary restraining order is not appealable.\u201d <em>Populist Party v. Herschler, </em>746 F.2d 656, 661 n. 2 (10th Cir.1984). There are, however, two exceptions to this general jurisdictional prohibition: when the order is appeal-able as a final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and when the order has the practical effect of denying a preliminary injunction. <em>Id. </em>The first exception is not implicated in this case: the district court\u2019s denial of the TRO was not a final appeal-able order under \u00a7 1291. That leaves us to determine whether the order may be appealed because it was a <em>de facto </em>denial of a preliminary injunction. <em>See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO, </em>473 U.S. 1301, 1305, 105 S.Ct. 3467, 87 L.Ed.2d 603 (1985). To come within this exception, in addition to having the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of denying an injunction, the consequences of the order must be irreparable and the only effective means of challenging the order must be by immediate appeal. <em>United States v. Colorado, </em>937 F.2d 505, 507 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In this case, appellant\u2019s rights will not be irretrievably lost absent immediate review, and immediate appeal is not the only effective means of challenging the order. In fact, the matter of appellant\u2019s rights is still squarely before the district court in the question of preliminary injunctive relief. And there is every indication that the district court \u201ccontemplate[s] a prompt hearing on a preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>See Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>473 U.S. at 1305, 105 S.Ct. 3467. Further, we cannot say that \u201cfurther interlocutory relief is unavailable\u201d here, nor is it clear that the hearing held by the district court within two days of the case being transferred was a \u201cfull adversary hearing.\u201d <em>See Populist Party, </em>746 F.2d at 661 n. 2 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">This court has no jurisdiction to review the denial of the TRO in this case; the order does not have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of the denial of a preliminary injunction, the consequences of the denial are not irreparable, and immediate review is not the only effective means of challenging the order. The appeal is DISMISSED. The motion for injunction pending appeal is DENIED as moot. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b875-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-6\">. After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
