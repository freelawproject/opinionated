First, he challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike all deposition testimony elicited from his former wife, Dawn Lynn Lang, as violative of the marital confidential communications privilege. Second, he challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the government. He argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to support its assessments for tax years 1981 through 1985. We have jurisdiction over this appeal by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\">We review the district court\u2019s ruling on the motion to strike Ms. Lang\u2019s deposition testimony for abuse of discretion, <em>see Lighton v. Univ. of Utah, </em>209 F.3d 1213, 1227 (10th Cir.2000). However, we review the district court\u2019s application of the law respecting the marital confidential communications privilege <em>de novo. See Conkle v. Potter, </em>352 F.3d 1333, 1335 n. 4 (10th Cir.2003). We also review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as did the district court in determining whether the government provided the minimal evidentiary foundation required to support the tax assessments. <em>See Mann v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1012, 1015-16 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. McMullin, </em>948 F.2d 1188, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>1192 (10th Cir.1991). Having carefully reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs in light of these standards and the applicable law, we conclude that the district court\u2019s rulings were correct. For substantially the same reasons contained in the district court\u2019s orders, dated February 3, 2003, and March 25, 2003, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b220-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
