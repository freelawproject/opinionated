Calderon, </em>Bergman is only entitled to habeas relief for a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel free from conflicts of interest if he can \u201cshow: (1) that counsel actively represented conflicting interests, and (2) that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">As in <em>Bonin, </em>the facts of this case do not establish an actual conflict of interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court faulted Bergman\u2019s lawyer for not getting an agreement in writing confirming Bergman\u2019s potential release on bail and the return of $4,550 in exchange for his accompanying authorities on a trip to Lake Mead. But often an agreement binding on the government is not available. The lack of an explicit agreement was precisely why no actual conflict was found in Bonin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bergman\u2019s lawyer only stood to receive $100 of the funds, had they been returned, as the rest of his fees were to be paid primarily from the deed to Bergman\u2019s house, which is not to imply that a lawyer\u2019s interest in getting paid establishes an actual conflict of interest with the client. A client has an interest in having his lawyer be adequately compensated. The expectation of Bergman\u2019s lawyer to be paid did not \u201cby itself create the type of direct \u2018actual\u2019 conflict of interest\u201d that Bergman must demonstrate to prevail on his claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bergman\u2019s interests included a favorable bail recommendation, so his lawyer\u2019s actions in attempting to secure bail were not inconsistent with Bergman\u2019s interests. Unless the interests of a lawyer and a client actually diverge, there is no actual conflict of interest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That information gathered from the trip to Lake Mead was ultimately used at trial to convict Bergman does not demonstrate that an actual conflict existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Because Bergman has not, under current law, established an entitlement to relief, we need not decide whether Teague<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would bar relief,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or whether <em>Teague </em>was waived.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">The petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANP\">. <em>Alcala v.

There is, however, an additional reason why I would deny the habeas petition. Even if there were an actual conflict of interest, this is not a case, I believe, to which the rule of <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), would apply. <em>Cuyler </em>holds that the prejudice inquiry required under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), for ineffective assistance claims is not necessary where there was an actual conflict between the trial lawyer and her client that affected the representation at trial. 446 U.S. at 349-50, 100 S.Ct. 1708 (citing <em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 487-91, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978)). The reason for this rule is that where one has a conflicted lawyer at trial, there is no sensible way to determine which decisions may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>have been influenced by that conflict, and therefore no way to assess the prejudice due to the conflict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Here, the trial lawyer was not the attorney with the conflict. And we do know <em>precisely </em>the impact of any conflict on the trial \u2014 the prosecution obtained and used at trial the evidence that Bergman purported to know where the body was. As Bergman has abandoned his <em>Strickland </em>claim, he has conceded that the introduction of that evidence, judged on <em>Strickland </em>standards, did not result in a sufficient degree of prejudice to call his conviction into question. This is an understandable position for Bergman to have adopted, given that his story at trial \u2014 that he had participated in the disposal of the body but not in the murder \u2014 was not inconsistent with the evidence of his knowledge of the whereabouts of the body. As I would apply a <em>Strickland </em>prejudice standard and find, because Bergman has abandoned the argument, no prejudice, I concur in the result for that reason as well as the reasons stated in the memorandum disposition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
