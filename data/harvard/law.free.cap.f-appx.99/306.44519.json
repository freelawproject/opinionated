Harris, James Keller and Everton Mack (collectively \u201cthe plaintiffs\u201d), as either First or Second level Project Officers (\u201cPO-I\u201d or \u201cPO-II\u201d). As PO-II\u2019s, the plaintiffs reported to a Senior Project Officer (\u201cSPO\u201d) on the day-to-day activities of public school renovations and repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-17\">In 1998, the plaintiffs, all African-American males, filed a civil rights action in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cTitle VII\u201d), the N.Y. Human Rights Law, Exec. Law \u00a7 290, <em>et seq., </em>and N.Y.C. Admin. Code 8-101, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">The plaintiffs claim that, for race-related reasons: (1) the SCA failed to promote them from either PO-I\u2019s to PO-II\u2019s or from PO-II\u2019s to SPO\u2019s; (2) there were salary disparities between black and non-black PO-II\u2019s; <em>and </em>(3) the SCA retaliated against them for filing administrative complaints with the SCA\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity (\u201cEEO\u201d) counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-19\">The plaintiffs\u2019 issues were divided into treatment and impact claims and tried concurrently before a jury and the district court. The claims for disparate treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>in promotions, disparate treatment in pay, and retaliation, were submitted to a jury and the disparate impact claims were tried by Judge Wolle in a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">After a twelve-day trial and almost two days of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict for the SCA on all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Subsequently, Judge Wolle delivered a verdict for the SCA dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claims. Plaintiffs appeal solely from the jury verdict, claiming erroneous evidentiary rulings and jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">A. <em>Evidentiary Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Before trial, the SCA moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude alleged evidence of discrimination pre-dating the statute of limitations on plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The SCA asked the court to exclude: (1) a \u201cpreliminary sketch\u201d (or \u201creport\u201d) prepared by Noel Poyser, the SCA\u2019s EEO officer on alleged statistical disparities in promotion; (2) Poyser\u2019s lay testimony about the report; <em>and </em>(3) employment applications from three white employees to show that the SCA\u2019s salary enhancement guidelines were applied in a discriminatory fashion. The plaintiffs opposed SCA\u2019s motion and asked the court to admit Poyser\u2019s report, his related testimony, and the salary documents as \u201csubstantive evidence of discrimination\u201d or as \u201cbackground evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The court reserved decision on the motion to exclude Poyser\u2019s report, and revisited the issue several more times before ruling that the report could \u201cbe referred to, but not presented [and] anything in it that preceded [the statute of limitations] will not be talked about to the jury.\u201d The court ultimately determined that the report was more prejudicial than probative. Thus, the jury was permitted to consider Poyser\u2019s testimony about the report only \u201cfor the limited purpose of proving the timing and background of when the plaintiffs made complaints about racial discrimination and what SCA said and did in response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">For the reasons stated below, the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">Federal Rule of Evidence 403 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArT\">Rule 403 rulings \u201care entitled to considerable deference and will not be overturned absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Costantino v. Herzog, </em>203 F.3d 164, 173 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">An erroneous evidentiary ruling is reversible only if it affects \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d as \u201cwhen ... a district court excludes a party\u2019s primary evidence in support of a material fact, and failure to prove that fact defeats the party\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., </em>189 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">Poyser\u2019s report \u2014 which contained incomplete data on the race of applicants for promotions and lacked adequate comparisons of applicants to promotees based on nondiscriminatory criteria \u2014 had limited probative value for plaintiffs\u2019 intentional discrimination claims. (The court admitted, but ultimately rejected, the report at the bench trial on plaintiffs\u2019 disparate impact claims.) Furthermore, four of the fifteen positions and three of the years analyzed in the report concerned a time outside the statute of limitations, and the report\u2019s conclusions were based on an analysis of all fifteen positions, not just the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>eleven within the limitations period. The report\u2019s information outside the limitations period was also cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Given the low probative value and high potential for confusion and prejudice, the court\u2019s exclusion of the report was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">While evidence of discrimination predating the statute of limitations may sometimes be admissible as background evidence, <em>Fitzgerald v. Henderson, </em>251 F.3d 345, 365 (2d Cir.2001), the district court retains discretion to determine when this is admissible, <em>Malarkey v. Texaco, Inc. </em>983 F.2d 1204, 1211 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Regarding the forty-four SPO and PO-II positions challenged by plaintiffs, there was ample background information. The court was well within its discretion to exclude the report given the prejudicial impact and its tendency to confuse the jury, compared to the report\u2019s low probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We do not disagree that evidence of conditions and events prior to the enactment, application, or limitations period of Title VTI may be admissible to show that current salary disparities have been perpetuated. <em>See generally, Bazemore v. Friday, </em>478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986); <em>Sobel v. Yeshiva Univ., </em>839 F.2d 18 (2d Cir.1988). However, the court\u2019s exclusion of the salary documents in this case was proper for two reasons. First, the plaintiffs\u2019 questions about the documents were directed to a witness who lacked personal knowledge of the criteria for salary enhancements at the relevant time. (The court also noted that one of the documents was partially illegible.) Second, and more importantly, there is no evidence in the record that the same salary guidelines within the limitations were in effect between 1989 and 1991, when the employment applications were generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">B. <em>Jury Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The plaintiffs contend that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on several issues, including the standard of proof, the use of statistical evidence, and plaintiffs\u2019 salary and promotion claims. For the reasons stated below, we find no reversible errors in any of the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">This Court reviews jury instructions <em>de novo. See, e.g., LNC Invest., Inc. v. First Fidelity Bank, N.A., </em>173 F.3d 454, 460 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cA jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, a trial court has considerable discretion in the formulation and style of jury instructions. <em>See Parker v. Sony Pictures Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>260 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">An erroneous jury instruction is harmless if it is clear that it did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>LNC Invs., </em>173 F.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">1. <em>Standard of Proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The district court\u2019s instruction that \u201cpreponderance of the evidence is evidence that is more convincing than opposing evidence\u201d was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">In truth, this Court has advised on more than one occasion that \u201c \u2018[i]n an ordinary civil suit ... words like \u2018convince\u2019 ... should be shunned in a jury charge.\u2019\u201d <em>Ostrowski v. Atl. Mut. Ins. Cos., </em>968 F.2d 171, 187 (2d Cir.1992) (endorsing scale-tipping language of model federal jury instructions) (citation omitted). We reaffirm this Court\u2019s <em>caveat, </em>but note that other than the solitary word \u201cconvincing,\u201d the charge here bears little resemblance to that criticized in <em>Ostrowski.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In <em>Ostrowski, </em>this Court was specifically concerned about use of the word \u201cconvincing\u201d in conjunction with \u201cconfidently\u201d because \u201cto tell the jury that it must be able to say \u2018confidently\u2019 that the evidence is in the plaintiffs favor seems quite likely to require more than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court\u2019s lucid instruction contained no \u201cconfidence\u201d language, and the phrase \u201cmore than the opposing evidence\u201d conveyed the substance of the scale-tipping instruction requested by the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Therefore, despite the <em>potential </em>implications of \u201cconvincing\u201d in jury instructions, there was no error on these facts, nor any conceivable prejudice to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">2. <em>The Use of Statistics</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Nor was the court\u2019s instruction on the probative value of comparative salary charts prepared by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s paralegal reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The court instructed the jury that for plaintiffs\u2019 statistical evidence \u201cto be probative of intentional discriminatory intent\u201d on the promotion claims, it \u201cmust compare the relevant persons filling the position with the qualified population of persons seeking to be hired or promoted ... including the relevant labor market.\u201d As for the salary disparity claim, the court instructed that \u201cthe statistical evidence must compare the salary history and related-back provisions of the persons whose salaries are being challenged with the salary and related background history of a plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">The district court\u2019s instruction is not materially different from a similar charge affirmed by this Court. <em>See Luciano v. Olsten Corp., </em>110 F.3d 210, 218 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming instruction that \u201cstatistics and numbers offered must be compared with a number of factors, including among other factors, the relevant labor market, including the qualified applicant pool, the relative numbers of men and women who were both qualified for and interested in management jobs with the [defendant] company\u201d); <em>cf. Smith v. Xerox Corp., </em>196 F.3d 358, 370 (2d Cir.1999) (because \u201ca disparate treatment claim looks at how an individual was treated compared to her similarly situated coworkers .... statistical analyses that compare coworkers who competed directly against each other ... are appropriate\u201d). Therefore, the charge was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Even if we accept plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the district court should have instructed the jury that their statistical evidence had probative value absent the aforementioned analysis and comparison, any defect would have been rectified by the court\u2019s further instruction that \u201c[i]n determining the usefulness of the statistical evidence, you must consider all the surrounding facts and circumstances,\u201d including logic, common sense, accuracy, accompanying expert testimony, and whether the statistics reflect nondiseriminatory reasons for different treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">3. <em>Discrimination Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADg\">a. <em>Salary Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s salary claim instruction that each plaintiff must show that \u201c[h]e was performing his job at a level which satisfied the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">Plaintiffs claim that under <em>Belfi v. Prendergast, </em>191 F.3d 129 (2d Cir.1999), satisfying an employer\u2019s reasonable expectations is an unauthorized element of a salary disparity case. This is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">We note, as a preliminary matter, that <em>Belfi </em>is not dispositive because there is no \u201crigid\u201d or \u201cmechanized\u201d formula to articulate the elements of a discrimination claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>See Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). Further, in <em>Belfi </em>itself, one of the Court\u2019s articulations of the salary disparity claim included the element that the plaintiff \u201cwas qualified for the job in question,\u201d 191 F.3d at 140, which is functionally equivalent to \u201csatisfying the employer\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Nor are we limited to <em>Belfi </em>in determining whether the district court\u2019s articulation was an abuse of discretion. In non-salary cases, this Court has included in a plaintiffs initial burden the element of \u201csatisfactory job performance,\u201d <em>Farias v. Instructional Sys., Inc., </em>259 F.3d 91, 98 (2d Cir.2001), and \u201cwhether an employee\u2019s performance meets his employer\u2019s legitimate expectations,\u201d <em>Meiri v. Dacon, </em>759 F.2d 989, 995 (2d Cir.1985) (citation and quotations omitted). These articulations are even closer to the district court\u2019s articulation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Accordingly, the court\u2019s use of the same charge for the salary and promotion claims to avoid jury confusion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">b. <em>The Promotion Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In contrast to the above evidentiary exclusions and jury instructions, the district court\u2019s instruction on the plaintiffs\u2019 promotion claim was erroneous, but the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The court instructed that a plaintiff must \u201cshow that after [he] was rejected for promotion, the position remained open and defendant continued to interview persons with the same qualifications as plaintiff until defendant filled the job with a white person.\u201d The plaintiffs requested that the court substitute \u201cnonAfrican-American\u201d for \u201cwhite person\u201d on the theory that the SCA may have favored Hispanics. The court overruled their objection reasoning that the \u201centire thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 case has been to distinguish between black and white.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">As a general proposition, the instruction was contrary to federal discrimination law. <em>See, e.g., de la Cruz v. N.Y.C. Human Res. Admin., </em>82 F.3d 16, 20 (2d Cir.1996) (Puerto Rican established <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination where job was awarded to African-American female).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">However, we are convinced that the error had no influence on the jury verdict for the following reasons. <em>First, </em>the district court\u2019s attachment to the verdict sheet of the names and occupants of all the relevant positions, including those held by the five Hispanic employees, mitigated the defective instruction. <em>Second, </em>only two of the forty-four contested positions at issue were awarded to Hispanics. <em>Third, </em>the verdict sheet records the jury\u2019s specific finding that none of the SCA\u2019s employment decisions were racially motivated. Thus, the effect of error, if any, would have been <em>de minimis. Finally, </em>we also decline to remand for a limited retrial based on the plaintiffs\u2019 technical, but unemphasized, challenges at trial to the five positions held by Hispanics. There is no evidence in the record for a rational juror to find that the SCA intentionally discriminated against the four African-American plaintiffs who applied for the two challenged positions held by Hispanics.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-13\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
