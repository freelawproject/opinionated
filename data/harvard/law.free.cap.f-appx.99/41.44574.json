We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Safety provided excess insurance coverage to A-Best, a former manufacturer of heat-protective clothing containing asbestos fibers. In 1997, Safety entered into an agreement with A-Best\u2019s other excess insurers-American Special Risk Insurance Company, Cincinnati Insurance Company, and Stonewall Insurance Company-to settle the case <em>American Special Risk Insurance Co. v. A-Best Products, Inc., </em>975 F.Supp. 1019 (N.D.Ohio 1997) (declaratory judgment action interpreting one excess insurance contract). The settlement agreement apportioned potential liability among the excess insurers, and also provided that the parties would submit any disputes concerning the agreement to binding arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">In 2001, a lawsuit filed in Ohio state court, <em>Schmidt v. A-Best Products, </em>asserted wrongful death and survivorship claims against A-Best and also alleged that A-Best, along with QPC, Safepro, National Safety Apparel, and Charles L. Grossman, participated in fraudulent transfers to keep assets hidden from asbestos claimants. Safety contends that its insurance coverage extends only to A-Best\u2019s asbestos-related liability and does not include the alleged fraudulent conveyances. To establish non-coverage for the fraudulent transfer claims, Safety brought this suit seeking to compel arbitration among A-Best\u2019s excess insurers, as well as the defendants in the <em>Schmidt </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">The defendants in this case moved to dismiss Safety\u2019s complaint on the ground that no ripe, justiciable controversy exists because the <em>Schmidt </em>court stayed the fraudulent conveyance claims pending a determination whether sufficient insurance funds existed to cover any wrongful death or survivorship judgment against A-Best. Moreover, the defendants argued-and Safety did not dispute-that any judgment against A-Best was unlikely to exceed the limits of the insurance policies. Furthermore, A-Best was not then (nor is it now) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>facing fraudulent conveyance claims from any plaintiffs other than those in <em>Schmidt. </em>The district court agreed that Safety\u2019s action was not ripe for review and granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">This court reviews de novo a decision to dismiss for lack of ripeness. <em>See, e.g., Kruse v. Vill. of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, </em>74 F.3d 694, 697 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Safety argues that the district court (1) misinterpreted Safety\u2019s suit as seeking a declaratory judgment rather than an order to compel arbitration; (2) should have ordered the parties to arbitrate; and (3) should not have considered the merits of <em>Schmidt </em>in deciding the motion to dismiss. The three errors Safety alleges share a common flaw: a failure to recognize that under the Federal Arbitration Act, a district court may consider a petition to compel arbitration only if the court otherwise has jurisdiction over the action. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (stating that a district court may compel arbitration if that court \u201cwould have jurisdiction ... of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties\u201d). Safety seems to believe that its desire to arbitrate the issue of its liability for fraudulent conveyance claims against A-Best suffices to confer jurisdiction on the district court to decide Safety\u2019s motion to compel arbitration. Federal court jurisdiction, however, requires a \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy\u201d that is definite and concrete, not hypothetical or abstract. U.S. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 2; <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, </em>300 U.S. 227, 240-41, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937). Moreover, a federal court should refrain from reviewing issues that are not ripe. <em>See Young v. Klutznick, </em>652 F.2d 617, 625-26 (6th Cir. 1981); 13A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Edward H. Cooper, Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. \u00a7 3532.1 (1995) (\u201cThe central perception is that courts should not render decisions absent a genuine need to resolve a real dispute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Here, the issue whether Safety has a duty to defend or indemnify A-Best in fraudulent conveyance suits is not ripe for adjudication, given that (1) the <em>Schmidt </em>court stayed the fraudulent conveyance claims; (2) any judgment against the <em>Schmidt </em>defendants would likely not exceed the insurance limits, so there exists no need to decide any fraudulent conveyance claims; and (3) no other plaintiffs have filed fraudulent conveyance claims against A-Best. Thus, any assessment of Safety\u2019s obligations would likely be advisory-or, applying the standard the Supreme Court set forth in <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941), the controversy between the parties is not of \u201csufficient immediacy and reality.\u201d Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Safety\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order of dismissal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. Although defendants moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the district court should have dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1). We do not find, however, that this error changes the appropriateness of the decision to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
