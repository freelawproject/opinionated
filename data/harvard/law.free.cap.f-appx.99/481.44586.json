Thompson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue, but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. Thompson did not file a pro se supplemental brief, despite being informed of his right to do so. The Government declined to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel questions whether the district court properly complied with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 when accepting Thompson\u2019s guilty plea. Because Thompson failed to object or move to withdraw his guilty plea, this court reviews his plea hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 524-27 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 899, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). After a close review of the plea proceedings, we conclude that the district court thoroughly complied with the requirements of Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We, therefore, affirm Thompson\u2019s conviction and sentence, and we deny Thompson\u2019s motion to reheve counsel and appoint substitute counsel. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
