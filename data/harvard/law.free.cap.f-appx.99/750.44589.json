Washington filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed lawyer now moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Washington was notified that he could respond to the <em>Anders </em>brief, but he did not do so. Because counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, we review only the potential issues it identifies. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>States v. Johnson, </em>248 F.3d 655, 667-68 (7th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Police in Beloit, Wisconsin, stopped a car driven by Washington early in the morning on March 10, 2003, after a car matching its description was reported leaving the scene of a shooting at 541 Euclid Avenue. Believing that Washington might be armed, the police ordered him and his passenger from the car, handcuffed them, and searched the car, finding a loaded semiautomatic handgun in the front console. Washington then informed the officers that he had been shot in the foot, so they took him to the hospital, where he eventually admitted to detectives his involvement in the Euclid Avenue shooting (at which he himself appears to have been the only one injured). He was later charged by federal authorities under \u00a7 922(g)(1), having been previously convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to deliver. Washington moved to suppress both the gun found in the car and his statements at the hospital, arguing that he was arrested without probable cause and that his confession was involuntary. After an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge recommended denying the motion. Washington filed no objections to the recommendation, which the district court adopted. Washington then offered a conditional guilty plea. He moved at sentencing to withdraw his plea and dismiss his attorney, but that motion too was denied. The court calculated his guideline range at 151 to 188 months, which was above the ten-year statutory maximum. The court thus sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Counsel first asks whether Washington could challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Counsel suggests that it would be frivolous to argue that the police\u2019s search of Washington\u2019s car was improper: not only did the police have reasonable suspicion that the occupants of the car had been involved in a shooting and possessed a weapon, <em>see United States v. Wimbush, </em>337 F.3d 947, 950 (7th Cir.2003), but they also had observed the car speeding and running a red light, <em>see United States v. Hernandez-Rivas, </em>348 F.3d 595, 599 (7th Cir.2003). As for Washington\u2019s statements at the hospital, counsel finds no evidence in the record that they were the result of any form of police coercion, <em>see United States v. Huerta, </em>239 F.3d 865, 871 (7th Cir.2001), or that Washington\u2019s will or understanding were impaired by the pain of his wound or the effect of painkillers, <em>see United States v. Walker, </em>272 F.3d 407, 412\u201413 (7th Cir. 2001). In any event, counsel notes, Washington did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that the motion be denied, and thus waived the right to appeal the issues it addressed. <em>See Hernandez-Rivas, </em>348 F.3d at 598. We agree that any challenge to the denial of Washington\u2019s motion to suppress would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Counsel next asks whether it would be frivolous to argue that Washington\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Counsel observes that the district court complied with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 at Washington\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, except that it did not advise Washington that he could be subject to restitution or forfeiture. But because neither restitution nor forfeiture was in fact imposed \u2014 indeed, neither could be on these facts \u2014 counsel concludes that this, if error, was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. Gochis, </em>256 F.3d 739, 746 (7th Cir.2001). We agree with counsel that this argument would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>Counsel next considers whether Washington could argue that the court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea. His request was based on newly discovered statements from witnesses at the Euclid Avenue residence concerning how Washington came into possession of the gun. Counsel points out, however, that Washington\u2019s felon-in-possession charge was not based on how or why he obtained the weapon, but rather on the admitted fact that he possessed the gun as he fled from the scene, so the witness statements would have had no bearing on Washington\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Orozco, </em>188 F.3d 422, 425 (7th Cir.1999) (request to withdraw guilty plea because of legal innocence must be based on evidence sufficient to show innocence). Counsel concludes, and we agree, that this argument would therefore be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Counsel also asks whether Washington could argue that the district court should have allowed him to dismiss his appointed attorney. This request was based primarily on the attorney\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation concerning the motion to suppress. For the reasons discussed above, counsel suggests that any such objections would themselves have been frivolous. In any event, counsel notes that this court will find that a court abused its discretion by denying a motion for new counsel only after considering whether the motion was timely, whether it was adequately addressed by the court, and whether it established a \u201ctotal lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Bjorkman, </em>270 F.3d 482, 500 (7th Cir.2001) (per curiam). Counsel concludes that Washington\u2019s motion would be unable to pass this test. Washington presented the motion at the sentencing hearing, more than two months after pleading guilty and even longer after his attorney had failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The court considered the motion and concluded that it did not establish a complete failure of communication between Washington and his attorney, but only a difference of opinion about litigation strategy. We agree with counsel that this argument too would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Finally, counsel considers whether Washington could challenge the sentence he received. The court calculated a total offense level of 30, based in part on a four-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing the firearm in connection with the felony offense of recklessly endangering safety, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 941.30. Washington objected to this finding, insisting that it wasn\u2019t he who fired the gun, but the court concluded that the evidence \u2014 including accounts from several eyewitnesses \u2014 contradicted this denial. Counsel suggests that it would be frivolous to argue that the court\u2019s factual conclusions were clear error. <em>See United States v. Carroll, </em>346 F.3d 744, 747 (7th Cir.2003). Having reviewed the evidence in question, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal. We DENY Washington\u2019s request for the appointment of new counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
