Holiwell (\u201cHoliwell\u201d) appeals the grant of summary judgment to Greyhound Lines, Inc. (\u201cGreyhound\u201d) on Holiwell\u2019s Title VII claim of racial discrimination. A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Padfield v. AIG Life Ins. Co., </em>290 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2002). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-27\">Greyhound terminated Holiwell\u2019s employment following a highway collision for which he was responsible. Holiwell sued Greyhound for violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended. Greyhound sought summary judgment, claiming that Holiwell failed to make a prima facie case of discrimination under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Greyhound argued in the alternative that even if Holiwell did make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>prima facie case, he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Greyhound\u2019s proffered reason for its employment decision was pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 804. The district court found that Holiwell failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and granted summary judgment to Greyhound. It did not address Greyhound\u2019s alternative argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">This Court may review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Or-say v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>289 F.3d 1125, 1132 (9th Cir.2002). In this case, it is unnecessary to determine whether Holiwell made a prima facie case of discrimination, because even if he did, Holiwell has not offered any evidence that would raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Greyhound\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for terminating his employment, the traffic accident, was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b186-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
