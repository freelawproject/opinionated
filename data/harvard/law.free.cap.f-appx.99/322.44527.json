L. No. 104-208, 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009, 2009-546, 3009-625. The IIRIRA preserves jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. 1105(a) (repealed 1996), where, as here, deportation proceedings were initiated before April 1, 1997, and the BIA issued its final order of deportation after October 30, 1996. <em>See Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306, n. 1 (2d Cir.2003) (citing Diallo v. INS, 232 F.3d 279, 282 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000)). Petitioner seeks review of the August 20, 2002, decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA summarily affirmed the March 16, 1999 decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), that found petitioner\u2019s testimony not credible, denied the application for asylum under Section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, denied petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of deportation under Section 243(h), ordered the petitioner to voluntarily depart the United States by April 15, 1999, and ordered the petitioner deported should he fail to comply with the voluntary departure order.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The statutes governing asylum and refugee status \u201cgive the Attorney General discretion to grant asylum to an applicant who demonstrates persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion, while they <em>require </em>him to withhold deportation where an applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened for that reason.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d at 306 <em>(citing INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002)). To succeed under the withholding of deportation prong, petitioner has the burden of showing a \u201cclear probability of threat to life or freedom; demonstrating past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of such threat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The burden of proof is on the applicant for asylum to establish that he is a refugee. <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">In this case, the IJ noted \u201cseveral inconsistencies between [petitioner\u2019s] written application and [his oral] testimony.\u201d For example, in his written application Zou claimed that his wife was ordered to undergo sterilization after the birth of their first child but in his oral testimony Zou stated that \u201cthere were no problems after the first child was born.\u201d Other inconsistencies included testimony regarding the birthplace of his third child, and whether he fought with government authorities over the country\u2019s family planning policies. In addition, the IJ found that the petitioner was extremely unresponsive regarding certain matters going to the heart of his asylum claim, including the details concerning the alleged sterilization of his wife. For these reasons the IJ concluded that Zou\u2019s testimony was not \u201ccredible or reliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">We treat an IJ\u2019s determination of credibility as a factual finding subject to the substantial evidence standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). In addition, \u201cwe give particular deference to credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381 (2d Cir. 1997). A decision of the IJ will be reversed only where \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>vant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u201d <em>Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(quoting Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 312-13 (2d Cir.1999)). In this case there is ample relevant evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the BIA properly dismissed Zou\u2019s appeal, and the petition for review is hereby DENIED. The judgment of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-7\">. Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ's decision and, in doing so, adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we directly review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
