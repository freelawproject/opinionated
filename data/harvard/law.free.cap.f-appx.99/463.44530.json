Compton pursuant to 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945 (2000). This case is before the Court for a second time. <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203 (4th Cir.2000). In our earlier decision, we concluded that the ALJ erred in considering the evidence related to the existence of pneumoconiosis in discrete parts according to the categories of evidence described in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(l)-(4) (2003), without also considering all the evidence together to determine whether Compton suffered from the disease. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11. We also held that the ALJ erred in crediting the medical opinion of Dr. Gaziano and in discrediting the opinion of Dr. Fino, but correctly weighed the other medical opinions of record. <em>Id. </em>at 211-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">On remand, the ALJ followed the Court\u2019s instruction to consider the x-ray and medical opinion evidence regarding the existence of pneumoconiosis together, and again concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that Compton suffers from the disease. The ALJ considered the opinions of Doctors Carrillo and Fino regarding the existence of the disease and whether pneumoconiosis was a substantial cause of Compton\u2019s total disability and found Dr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion worthy of greater weight. The ALJ accordingly awarded benefits. On the employer\u2019s appeal, the BRB concluded that the ALJ again erred in discrediting Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion, vacated the ALJ\u2019s decision awarding benefits, and remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">After the BRB\u2019s remand, the ALJ reconsidered the medical opinions of Doctors Fino and Carrillo, and again concluded that the opinion of Dr. Carrillo, supported by the opinion of Dr. Cabauatan, was more persuasive as to the existence of pneumoconiosis and that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of Compton\u2019s total respiratory disability. The BRB affirmed the award of benefits with one judge dissenting, and the employer filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">We review decisions of the BRB to determine whether the BRB properly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was in accordance with law. <em>See Doss v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>53 F.3d 654, 658 (4th Cir.1995). In making this determination, we undertake an independent review of the record in deciding whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. v. Held, </em>314 F.3d 184, 186 (4th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence is more than a scintil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>la, but only such evidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>See Lane v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir. 1997). Subject to the substantial evidence requirement, the ALJ has the sole authority to make credibility determinations and resolve inconsistencies or conflicts in the evidence. <em>See Grizzle v. Pickands Mather &amp; Co., </em>994 F.2d 1093, 1096 (4th Cir.1993). An ALJ, however, may rely only on a medical opinion that constitutes a reasoned medical judgment. <em>See Freeman United, Coal Mining Co. v. Cooper, </em>965 F.2d 443, 448 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">To establish that he is entitled to black lung benefits in a case under Part 718, a miner must prove: \u201c(1) he has pneumoconiosis; (2) the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment; (3) he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition; and (4) pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.\u201d Mi<em>lburn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">A claimant may establish the existence of pneumoconiosis by means of (1) chest x-rays; (2) biopsy or autopsy evidence; (3) invocation of the presumptions at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.304-718.306; or (4) medical opinion evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a) (2003). In this case, there is no biopsy or autopsy evidence and the presumptions at \u00a7\u00a7 718.304-718.306 do not apply because Compton has not been diagnosed with complicated pneumoconiosis, the claim in question was filed after January 1, 1982, and this is a living miner claim. The ALJ concluded that the x-ray evidence was insufficient to establish the existence of pneumoconiosis, and considered the opinions of Doctors Carrillo and Fino.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">The ALJ concluded that Dr. Fino did not adequately consider whether Compton suffered from legal pneumoconiosis, a respiratory disease or condition that was aggravated by his exposure to coal dust, and accordingly gave Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion lesser weight. Because Dr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion was supported by the opinion of Dr. Cabauatan after his 1979 examination of Compton, and this Court\u2019s holding that \u201cDr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion was reasoned and sufficiently documented,\u201d <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 212, the ALJ gave Dr. Carrillo\u2019s opinion greater weight and concluded that the existence of pneumoconiosis was established by medical opinion evidence. On appeal, Island Creek argues that the ALJ improperly credited the opinion of Dr. Carrillo and discredited that of Dr. Fino. We conclude that Island Creek\u2019s argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The ALJ\u2019s primary criticism of Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion related to Dr. Fino\u2019s comment that the objective evidence indicated that Compton suffered from an obstructive impairment that was consistent with smoking induced emphysema but inconsistent with the contraction of lung tissue caused by fibrosis associated with simple pneumoconiosis. The ALJ interpreted this remark as indicating that Dr. Fino did not consider whether Compton suffered from legal pneumoconiosis, but rather only whether Compton had the clinical or medical form of the disease. The ALJ stated that Dr. Fino failed to adequately address whether Compton suffered from a respiratory condition that was substantially related to or aggravated by exposure to coal dust. Our review of the record convinces us that this conclusion is without factual support.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Dr. Fino\u2019s lengthy report in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>eludes a very detailed explanation of why he concluded that Compton did not suffer from any occupationally acquired respiratory disease. The objective findings and x-rays that pointed to an absence of fibrosis in Compton\u2019s lungs were only one part of Dr. Fino\u2019s analysis and reasoning that supported his conclusion. Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion in fact does address the concept of legal pneumoconiosis, as he concluded that Compton\u2019s exposure to coal dust did not cause or aggravate any impairment of his lung function. Further, the ALJ\u2019s requirement that Dr. Fino \u201crule out\u201d pneumoconiosis essentially shifted the burden of proof to the employer, contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the black lung benefits act. <em>Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs v. Greenwich Collieries, </em>512 U.S. 267, 281, 114 S.Ct. 2251, 129 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">We also note that the objective evidence appears supportive of Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion. A pulmonary function test conducted on June 8, 1995, in conjunction with Dr. Carrillo\u2019s examination of Compton demonstrated rather severe impairment. Another test conducted ten months later, on April 3, 1996, by Dr. Zaldivar, however, demonstrated significantly greater pulmonary function, which weighs against a diagnosis of the irreversible and progressive disease of pneumoconiosis. Moreover, the ALJ failed to follow this Court\u2019s encouragement \u201cto consider more explicitly the impact of the doctors\u2019 respective credentials.\u201d <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 213 n. 13. Dr. Carrillo\u2019s qualifications are not contained in the record. Dr. Fino is board certified in internal medicine and the sub-specialty of pulmonary disease, and is a certified \u201cB\u201d reader. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s discrediting of Dr. Fino\u2019s opinion is not supported by substantial evidence, and requires that the case be remanded yet again.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We have also considered Island Creek\u2019s arguments that the ALJ failed to determine whether the evidence established that a material change in condition occurred since the denial of Compton\u2019s prior benefits claim, and that Compton\u2019s claim was untimely. We find these arguments meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Because the ALJ\u2019s evaluation and discrediting of the opinion of Dr. Fino was erroneous, we vacate the award of benefits. We are convinced that the errors committed by the ALJ require a fresh perspective, and therefore direct that the BRB remand Compton\u2019s claim to a different ALJ for further consideration. <em>Mil-burn Colliery Co. v. Hicks, </em>138 F.3d 524, 537 (4th Cir.1998). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\"> The ALJ\u2019s reliance on <em>Barber v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>43 F.3d 899 (4th Cir. 1995), is misplaced. The claimant in that case benefitted from the presumption in \u00a7 718.305 that pneumoconiosis caused her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>husband's respiratory impairment, which does not apply to Compton\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
