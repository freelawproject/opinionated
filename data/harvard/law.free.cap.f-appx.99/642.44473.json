Their suit followed INS\u2019s notice that if they did not voluntarily depart, it would deport them. We affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the claims because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g) divests federal courts of jurisdiction to review these deportation decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Pak v. Reno, </em>196 F.3d 666, 669 (6th Cir.1999). Congress enacted \u00a7 1252(g) to limit the jurisdiction of federal courts which \u201care not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress....\u201d <em>Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., </em>475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986) (citing <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 173-180, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Section 1252(g) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-14\">(g) Exclusive jurisdiction</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-15\">Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">This provision applies \u201cto three discrete actions that the Attorney General may take: [the] \u2018decision or action\u2019 to <em>\u2018commence </em>proceedings, <em>adjudicate </em>cases, or <em>execute </em>removal orders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 482, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (emphasis in original) <em>(AADCj. </em>The initiation and prosecution of various stages in the deportation process are within the Attorney General\u2019s discretion and not subject to judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">INS notified appellants that they must leave voluntarily or it would deport them. Appellants sued prior to the passing of the voluntary departure deadline. The district court held that \u00a7 1252(g) deprived it of jurisdiction to review INS\u2019s decision \u2014 evidenced by the option to voluntarily depart or face deportation \u2014 to commence proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Botezatu v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 311, 314 (7th Cir.1999) (INS decision <em>not </em>to allow voluntary departure is within the scope of \u00a7 1252(g)). The goal of \u00a7 1252(g) is to protect the \u201cExecutive\u2019s discretion from the courts.\u201d <em>AADC, </em>525 U.S. at 486. INS exercised its discretion by ordering appellants to depart the United States or be deported and the district court concluded correctly that \u00a7 1252(g) deprived it of jurisdiction to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
