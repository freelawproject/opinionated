(UPS), cross-appeal the district court\u2019s decision approving a ratified arbitration award that upholds Edwards\u2019s termination. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">Having detailed the underlying facts and early procedural history of this case in our previous opinions, <em>Edwards v. UPS, </em>181 F.3d 100 (6th Cir.1999) (decision without published opinion), and 16 FedAppx. 333 (6th Cir.2001) (unpublished), we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">Following our most recent remand, the district court determined that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>mandating a board decision by majority vote did not permit the parties to presume the votes of the partisan board members, leaving the neutral to, in effect, break the tie. The provision instead required that an actual vote take place. Accordingly, the court concluded that the neutral arbitrator\u2019s award violated the majority vote provision of the CBA. The court went on to find, however, that the flawed decision was \u201ccorrected\u201d by the partisan UPS board members\u2019 votes to ratify the arbitrator\u2019s award. In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied on (1) affidavits of the partisan UPS board members submitted on remand, and (2) the lack of specificity in the CBA as to the time and manner of the board\u2019s majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">With this appeal, the parties challenge three aspects of the district court\u2019s judgment: (1) its subject matter jurisdiction to determine compliance with provisions of the CBA; (2) its assessment that the preratification award violated the CBA\u2019s terms; and (3) its conclusion that the preratification award could be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Although this court previously decided this jurisdiction question in <em>Edwards v. UPS, </em>16 Fed.Appx. 333 (6th Cir.2001), the law-of-the-case doctrine does not foreclose reconsideration of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Amen v. City of Dearborn, </em>718 F.2d 789, 793-94 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Reviewing the issue of subject matter jurisdiction de novo, <em>Friends of the Crystal River v. EPA, 35 </em>F.3d 1073, 1077 (6th Cir.1994), we again find that the district court had jurisdiction to review the arbitration award as part of its authority to determine whether the board failed to confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction \u2014 that is, whether the board complied with the CBA\u2019s terms. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., </em>728 F.2d 257, 265 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">B. The Original Arbitration Award</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">UPS contends that the district court incorrectly concluded that the original award violated the CBA\u2019s majority vote provision. In UPS\u2019s view, the consistent past practice of the parties validated the approach of presuming the votes of the partisan board members (as a two-to-two tie) and requiring only the neutral arbitrator (as the tie breaker) to enter the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">As we previously held, the board is bound by the CBA\u2019s express majority vote provision because \u201c \u2018the jurisdiction of the arbitration boards is limited to that which is conferred upon them by the arbitration agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards, </em>16 FedAppx. at 337 (citing <em>Jones, </em>728 F.2d at 265). Past practice or custom cannot trump clear and unambiguous terms of a CBA. <em>See, e.g., Beacon Journal Publ\u2019g Co. v. Akron Newspaper Guild, Local Number 7, </em>114 F.3d 596, 601 (6th Cir.1997). Accordingly, given the terms of this particular CBA, the district court properly found that the original award violated the CBA\u2019s majority vote provision because the award resulted solely from the neutral arbitrator\u2019s unilateral decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">C. The Ratified Arbitration Award</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">Edwards contests the district court\u2019s ruling that ratification by partisan UPS board members could properly correct the award. He first contends that according to <em>Jones v. St. Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, </em>the board lacked authority to ratify the award more than six years after holding hearings on Edwards\u2019s grievance because the arbitrators\u2019 authority had expired. 728 F.2d at 265 (6th Cir. 1984) (finding that a fourteen-month delay in rendering an arbitration award was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>reasonable and that the arbitration board \u201chad long since lost jurisdiction to resolve [the] dispute\u201d after such an \u201cinordinate period of time\u201d). <em>Jones, </em>however, concerned a delay between the arbitration hearing and the board\u2019s rendering of a written award, not (as here) a delay between the issuance of the board\u2019s award and judicial determination of that award\u2019s validity. As the district court noted, the delays of litigation should not preclude the board from ratifying the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Edwards next urges that the board violated the CBA\u2019s terms because the substitutions of partisan board members, specifically the substitution of the UPS board member at the third hearing, meant that the same five board members did not hear the evidence in its entirety, thereby violating the CBA\u2019s requirement that the board \u201chear the dispute including the presentation of such witnesses and evidence\u201d before rendering a decision. Edwards raised no objection to the substitutions during the course of the hearings; in fact, the Independent Pilots Association, which represented his interests in the arbitration, substituted one of its partisan board members at the second hearing day. More importantly, the board members who signed (or ratified) the award were the same members present at the third hearing day, which concerned Edwards\u2019s second urine sample, and therefore heard the merits of all the issues decided by the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Finally, Edwards complains that because the board did not confer prior to rendering its award (either when the neutral arbitrator issued the award or when the partisan UPS members ratified the award), the board failed to comply with the requirements of the CBA. As with Edwards\u2019s other challenges, we look to the CBA and find there no requirement that board members deliberate before rendering a decision. The agreement requires only that the board\u2019s decision result from a \u201cmajority vote,\u201d and is silent about the manner of achieving that vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment upholding the ratified arbitration award as compliant with the CBA\u2019s express terms.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
