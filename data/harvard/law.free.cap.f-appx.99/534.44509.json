Barnes had been accused of and had admitted to stalking at least two female law students.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>On May 25, 2000, Barnes came to campus and attempted to register for the upcoming summer session of classes. Barnes was arrested for criminal trespass by a St. Mary\u2019s University campus police officer, Defendant \u2014 Appellee, Officer Paul Chapa. The officer turned Barnes over to the San Antonio police, who later transferred Barnes to the Bexar County Sheriffs Department, where Barnes was charged with criminal trespass. The charges were later dropped by the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On March 13, 2002, Barnes filed this suit against St. Mary\u2019s University and the named defendants. Upon the motion of Defendants \u2014 Appellees, the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed the action. Barnes timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. <em>Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America, </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); <em>Melton, </em>114 F.3d at 559; <em>Galindo v. Precison Am. Corp., </em>754 F.2d 1212, 1216 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Barnes has failed to show that the district court erred in granting summary judgment. <em>See Melton, </em>114 F.3d at 559. Barnes\u2019 conclusory allegations of malice are insufficient to create an issue of fact. <em>Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">After reviewing the record, we hold that there was probable cause for Barnes\u2019 arrest and prosecution. <em>See Piazza v. Mayne, </em>217 F.3d 239, 246 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Bodzin v. City of Dallas, </em>768 F.2d 722, 724-26 (5th Cir.1985). Therefore, Barnes\u2019 claims lack merit under both federal and state law. <em>See Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Barnes also failed to show that the district court erred in holding that Defendant \u2014 Appellee, Officer Paul Chapa, was entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Jacob-sen v. Osborne, </em>133 F.3d 315, 320-22 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the district court\u2019s decision. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
