As relief, Mr. Fenner indicated he wanted a jury trial and a different attorney in his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that dismissal was proper. Mr. Fenner\u2019s allegations and the relief he requested indicate that he was in effect challenging the validity of his guilty plea and conviction. The sole federal remedy for a state prisoner bringing such a challenge is a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 499-500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), and there is no indication in the record that Mr. Fenner has exhausted his state court remedies, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A); <em>Carmichael v. White, </em>163 F.3d 1044, 1045 (8th Cir.1998) (\u00a7 2254 petitioner has burden to show all available state remedies have been exhausted or exceptional circumstances exist). Accordingly, we affirm, but we modify the dismissal to be without prejudice. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We also deny Mr. Fenner\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-24\">.
