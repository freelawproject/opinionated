We grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">Sosa argues that the IJ erred by failing to afford him a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution based on past persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(ii). The IJ credited Sosa\u2019s testimony in its entirety, but did not analyze the question of past persecution. Instead, the IJ relied on counsel\u2019s apparent willingness to agree, at the hearing, with the IJ\u2019s own problematic description of the law regarding past persecution. We hold that the IJ should have assessed Sosa\u2019s claim by comparing the purported acts of persecution committed against him with those committed in other cases in which this Court has and has not found past persecution. <em>See Ruano v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1155, 1159-60 (9th Cir.2002) (setting forth the methodology for determining past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">In <em>Ruano, </em>we recognized that threats in combination with the intrusion into the asylum applicant\u2019s home, the close confrontation of his family members, the interrogation of his relatives regarding the applicant\u2019s whereabouts, and the applicant\u2019s change in \u201cvehicles, residences, offices, phone numbers\u201d as a result of these threats, was the type of treatment that could constitute \u201cpast persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>1161. Here, Sosa asserts that, in addition to the -written death threats he received, his home was twice broken into by armed officials; the officials closely confronted his family, interrogated them about his whereabouts, and threatened them with death; his three compatriots were \u201cdisappeared\u201d concurrently; and, as a result, he felt compelled to leave his home, curtail contact with his family, and eventually leave the country and assume a new identity. Accordingly, we remand so that the agency may consider in the first instance whether Sosa is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of well-founded fear on the basis of past persecution. <em>See Ventura v. INS, </em>817 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In determining whether the presumption of well-founded fear that arises from past persecution has been rebutted, \u201cinformation about general changes in the country is insufficient;\u201d rather, the IJ must engage in an \u201cindividualized analysis of how changed conditions will affect the specific petitioner\u2019s situation.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>No. 02-73357, 366 F.3d 799, 804-806, 2004 WL 937262, at **5-6 (9th Cir. May 3, 2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Sosa argues that, had the IJ conducted the requisite \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d of the record, the judge would have found substantial evidence to support his claim that indigenous leaders remained victims of substantial human rights abuses at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">We conclude that the IJ\u2019s assessment was not sufficiently individualized with respect to Sosa\u2019s leadership of a national indigenous movement. The evidence submitted here - the 1996 and 1997 State Department Country Reports on which the IJ relied, as well as the newspaper articles submitted by Sosa - \u201cpresents a mixed picture of the human rights conditions in Guatemala after the conclusion of the 1996 peace accords.\u201d <em>See Lopez, </em>366 F.3d at 804-805, 2004 WL 937262, at *5 (describing the 1998 Report). Moreover, Sosa\u2019s asylum claim \u2014 based primarily on race and social group, rather than political opinion \u2014 is different in nature from that of petitioners in <em>Ventura </em>and <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir.2003). The violent controversy over the human rights movement with which Sosa was involved as a leader - a movement reflecting deeply entrenched racial and ethnic divisions rather than the political exigencies of a civil war - continued even after the peace accords. In light of the foregoing, we remand to the agency so that it may conduct the appropriate country conditions analysis in the first instance. <em>See Lopez, </em>366 F.3d at 807, 2004 WL 937262, at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">PETITION GRANTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
