On appeal to this court, they argue that the BIA violated their due process rights by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without issuing an opinion. They also argue that the BIA erred when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision because he violated their due process rights to enter evidence into the record and he incorrectly determined that they were not eligible for cancellation of removal. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Because we write only for the parties, it is not necessary to recite the facts of this case in detail. It is sufficient to note that Quirino and Rivera-Lopez entered the U.S. from Mexico without inspection in 1981 and 1989 respectively. In October 1999, the INS issued the petitioners Notices to Appear alleging that they entered the U.S. without being admitted or paroled, in violation of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(l). The petitioners conceded that they were subject to removal from the U.S., but applied for cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">To support their application for cancellation, the petitioners presented a child psychologist\u2019s evaluation of the effect that their removal would have on one of their U.S. citizen children, nine-year-old Stephanie, during the removal hearing. The petitioners claim that Stephanie was present at their removal hearing at the close of petitioners\u2019 testimony and was prepared to testify, but the IJ did not permit her to testify. There is no record in the hearing transcript that Stephanie\u2019s testimony was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied the petitioners\u2019 application for cancellation of removal because they did not establish that their U.S. citizen children would suffer \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d under INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(D). The petitioners appealed the decision to the BIA. A single BIA member affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion on October 4, 2002, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.1(e)(4) (Sept. 25, 2002). The petitioners timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">INA \u00a7 106(a) gives Courts of Appeals the authority to review all final orders of deportation against aliens, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>states that venue is proper in the judicial circuit in which the petitioner resides. Quirino and Rivera-Lopez had been residing in New Jersey at the time the briefs in this case were filed, making venue proper in this circuit. The government challenges our subject-matter jurisdiction over this claim, stating that INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(I) deprives this court of jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding removal of cancellation under INA \u00a7 240A(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(I) states: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section 212(h), 212(1), <em>24-OA, </em>240B, or 245.\u201d (emphasis added). The meaning of \u201cjudgment\u201d in \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(I) is unclear; it could mean \u201cany decision\u201d of the BIA, or it could mean \u201ca decision involving the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 178 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>MonteroMartinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002)). We have concluded \u201cthat, for nondiscretionary factors, the Court maintains jurisdiction, but as to discretionary decisions we lack jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We therefore must determine which of the questions presented here are nondiscretionary. The petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding violation of -their due process rights are, of course, nondiscretionary factors. However, the petitioners\u2019 third argument, that the IJ erred when she determined that they were ineligible for cancellation of removal because they did not meet the hardship requirement in INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(D), involves a discretionary decision. We held in <em>MendezMoranchel </em>that the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding whether an alien meets this hardship requirement is discretionary. 338 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">We review the petitioners\u2019 remaining two due process claims seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Quirino and Rivera-Lopez argue that the BIA violated their due process rights by affirming the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4) (Sept. 25, 2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc), this court recently denied such a due process challenge to the affirmance without opinion (\u201cAWO\u201d) mechanism in 8 C.F.R \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2002). The AWO process is essentially the same here. Accordingly, <em>Dia </em>controls our review. Applying Dia\u2019s rationale to the case at hand, we find that the petitioner\u2019s due process right to an individualized determination was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">The petitioners also argue that their Fifth Amendment due process rights were denied when the IJ failed to allow their daughter Stephanie to testify at their removal hearing. They state that this violation of their rights prejudiced their case, and that it was improper to issue an AWO because the 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e)(4) mechanism allows AWOs only if \u201cany errors in the decision under review were harmless or nonmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">As the petitioners concede, there is no record of any discussion or decision regarding Stephanie\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">At the hearing, after both petitioners testified regarding the hardship their deportation would have on their oldest daughter, the IJ asked the government if it had an objection to voluntary departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>and rendered her decision in the case. The petitioners\u2019 counsel made no request or objection on the record, and the court did not <em>go off </em>the record during this part of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Even if we agreed with petitioners\u2019 legal argument that the preclusion of their daughter\u2019s testimony would violate their due process rights, there is no factual basis for the assertion that her testimony was precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">For all of the above reasons, we will affirm the decision of the Board of Immigrations Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\">.
