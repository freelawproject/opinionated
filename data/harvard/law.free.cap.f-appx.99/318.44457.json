Weinstein, Judge) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Among its determinations, the District Court denied petitioner\u2019s claim that his constitutional rights were violated because of the alleged partiality of one of the jurors but granted a certificate of appealability as to this issue. <em>Waters v. McGuiness, </em>2003 WL 21508318, *4 (E.D.N.Y., June 16, 2003). Familiarity is assumed as to the facts of this case, its procedural context, and the issue that has been raised for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">By deliberately choosing not to challenge this particular juror before the trial court, Waters has waived the opportunity to challenge the juror\u2019s impartiality on habeas review. <em>See United States v. Rag-land, </em>375 F.2d 471, 475 (2d Cir.1967) (\u201cFailure to object to the composition of the jury has long been held to result in a waiver of the right of the accused to be heard by an impartial jury.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gersh, </em>328 F.2d 460, 463-64 (2d Cir.1964) (denying relief due to defendant\u2019s failure to challenge juror\u2019s partiality in a timely fashion, stating also that it is impermissible for defense counsel to have known of the bias \u201cbefore the ease was submitted to the jury or while it was deliberating, but [to] nevertheless st[an]d mute, gambling on an acquittal while holding this issue in reserve.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-20\">Defendant\u2019s claim that, during his trial, he was unaware of the alleged bias is unavailing. As the District Court noted, \u201c[t]he trial transcript reveals that it was petitioner himself who insisted, against his lawyer\u2019s advice, to leave this juror on the panel even after they learned his job title.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>2003 WL 21508318, at *4. At the venire, the juror stated that he is \u201cAssis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>tant Deputy Warden for Department of Correction.\u201d The juror also stated that he had been called at some point in the past \u201cto testify in a trial regarding a [jail] riot.\u201d Through counsel, Waters easily could have inquired further about any of these statements. Given these facts and the fact that Waters\u2019 attorney advised Waters to seek to exclude this juror, we find that Waters has waived the right to make this objection now.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">While we sometimes apply plain error analysis to forfeited claims, having not followed his attorney\u2019s advice to object to the seating of the juror after the issue was raised in open court, Waters has waived rather than merely forfeited the opportunity to object to the juror\u2019s alleged partiality. <em>Cf. United States v. Brown, </em>352 F.3d 654, 663 (2d Cir.2003). In any event, the defendant does not ask us to apply a plain error review, and even if such an analysis were appropriate, we would not exercise our discretion to do so here. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\u201cIf the forfeited error is \u2018plain\u2019 and \u2018affect[s] substantial rights,\u2019 the court of appeals has authority to order correction, but is not required to do so.\u201d) On the record, there is no evidence of partiality. The juror in question stated that he could fairly and impartially fulfill his duties based solely on the evidence presented in court. Lastly, there is no indication to this day that the juror had any prior contact with Waters nor that the juror knew that Waters was allegedly involved in a jailhouse fracas two weeks prior to his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
