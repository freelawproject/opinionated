His appointed attorney filed a notice of appeal but now seeks to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), because he is unable to find a non-frivolous issue for appeal. Bigelow was notified of counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), and has filed a response. We limit our review of the record to those potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief, <em>see United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997), and in Bigelow\u2019s response. Because we conclude that all of those potential issues are frivolous, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss Bigelow\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">Bigelow was indicted for distributing methamphetamine after he twice sold the drug to a woman who was cooperating with the police. Bigelow was released subject to pre-trial supervision pending his trial on the drug charge, but failed to appear on the first day of his trial. He was arrested 10 days later in El Paso, Texas, as he attempted to re-enter the United States. He was then indicted for failing to appear for a judicial proceeding while on pre-trial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Bigelow subsequently pleaded guilty to both indictments without a plea agreement. The probation officer calculated in the presentence report (PSR) a combined base offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of III. After adding two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, the probation officer recommended a sentencing range of 97 to 121 months. The district court adopted the PSR and sentenced Bigelow to 99 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">Counsel first considers whether Bigelow could argue that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the district court failed to fully comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. But Bigelow has not indicated that he wants to withdraw his guilty plea, so counsel need not explore this potential argument. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Counsel next considers whether Bigelow could challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was responsible for 60 grams of methamphetamine. But Bigelow withdrew his objection to the PSR\u2019s drug quantity calculation after assuring the judge at sentencing that he had read the report and discussed it with counsel. Where a defendant knows the content of a presentence report and is aware he can object to a calculation in the report but affirmatively elects not to, he waives the right to challenge the calculation on appeal. <em>United States v. Staples, </em>202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir.2000). Waiver, unlike forfeiture, prohibits plain error review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number><em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Thus, we agree with counsel that a challenge to the amount of methamphetamine attributed to Bigelow would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Counsel then generally considers whether Bigelow could argue that the district court should not have applied a two-level increase for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The district court assessed this increase because Bigelow failed to appear for a judicial proceeding\u2014 his trial. The application notes to \u00a7 3C1.1 specifically list \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding\u201d as conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(e); <em>United States v. Bolden, </em>279 F.3d 498, 502 (7th Cir.2002). Thus we agree with counsel that any challenge to the district court\u2019s imposition of the enhancement for obstruction of justice would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Both counsel and Bigelow examine whether Bigelow could argue that the court improperly declined to grant him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The court did not grant the reduction because Bigelow violated the terms of his pre-trial supervision by fleeing the country and using illegal drugs. Bigelow asserts that he accepted responsibility when he \u201creadily returned <em>from </em>Mexico on his own accord,\u201d with the intention of turning himself over to authorities. In considering acceptance of responsibility, however, a sentencing court may, however, consider a defendant\u2019s drug use and failure to comply with the terms of his pre-trial release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n.3; <em>United States v. McDonald, </em>22 F.3d 139, 144 (7th Cir. 1994). Because Bigelow admitted to the probation officer that he violated the terms of his pre-trial release by using illegal drugs, we agree with counsel that any challenge to the district court\u2019s decision not to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Both counsel and Bigelow next consider whether Bigelow could challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from the guidelines based on an overrepresentation of his criminal history, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b), because the prior offenses were \u201crelatively minor infractions.\u201d But we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward unless the district court was mistaken about its authority to depart. <em>See United States v. Aron, </em>328 F.3d 938, 940 (7th Cir.2003). In Bigelow\u2019s case, nothing in the record indicates that the district court did not understand its authority to depart from the guidelines. At sentencing, the district judge acknowledged the argument put forward by Bigelow, but explained that he found \u201cno basis demonstrated whatsoever for a reduction in the criminal history as suggested by the defendant.\u201d Counsel is correct that it would be frivolous to raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Finally, Bigelow proposes challenging the district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure because of his substantial assistance in providing information to the government before sentencing. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The government, however, did not move the court to make such a departure, and our case law is clear that unless the government makes a motion for departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, a court may not depart under that section, <em>see United States v. Bosque, </em>312 F.3d 313, 318 (7th Cir.2002), so any effort to press this issue on appeal would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
