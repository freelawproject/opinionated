Between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>1981 and 1988, Keene engaged in a corporate restructuring in which it first created appellee-defendant Bairnco Corporation (\u201cBairnco\u201d), and, through a \u201cdrop down\u201d merger, became a subsidiary of Bairnco. Over the next several years, Keene sold a number of its constituent businesses to other subsidiaries of Bairnco. Defendants-appellees Kaydon Corporation, The Genlyte Group Incorporated, Kasco Corporation, Shielding Systems Corporation, and Arlon Inc. each were created in order to, and in fact did, purchase assets from Keene. Defendant-appellee Glenn W. Bailey (\u201cBailey\u201d) was one of the founders of Keene, and was an officer and director of Keene, Bairnco, and the other corporate defendants. Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and into the early 1990s, Keene was named in an increasing number of asbestos-related lawsuits. In 1993, upon becoming unable to purchase appeal bonds, Keene filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Plaintiffs-appellants are the trustees of Keene Creditors Trust, a trust instituted to represent persons exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured by Keene and the insulation business it purchased in 1967. Pursuant to \u00a7 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, such a \u201ctrustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(b)(1). According to a stipulation approved by the bankruptcy court, the \u201capplicable law\u201d here is New York law. In 1996, plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that Keene sold its constituent businesses and paid dividends to Bairnco as part of a scheme to divest itself of assets that otherwise would have been available to Keene\u2019s asbestos-victim creditors. Plaintiffs contended that all of the corporate defendants were liable to these creditors under theories of actual fraudulent conveyance, <em>see </em>N.Y. Debt. &amp; Cred. Law \u00a7 276 (McKinney 2003), constructive fraudulent conveyance, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 273-75, and successor liability. Further, plaintiffs sought to pierce the corporate veil in order to impose Keene\u2019s asbestos liabilities on Bairnco. Finally, plaintiffs alleged that, as a director of Keene, Bailey caused Keene to pay unlawful dividends to Bairnco, <em>see </em>N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7\u00a7 510, 719 (McKinney 2003), and, by virtue of his involvement with the asset sales and dividend payments, breached his fiduciary duties as a corporate officer and engaged in corporate misconduct. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 720(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendants initially moved for partial summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that plaintiffs were time-barred from bringing constructive-fraud claims based on transactions that occurred prior to 1988. In October 1998, the district court (Chin, J.) denied defendants\u2019 motion in part and granted it in part, holding that plaintiffs could bring pre-1988 claims on behalf of one category of creditors, the so-called \u201cinactive docket\u201d claimants. <em>See Lippe v. Bairnco Corp., </em>225 B.R. 846, 855-56 (S.D.N.Y.1998) <em>(\u201cLippe I\u201d). </em>However, the court later reconsidered that ruling and held that plaintiffs could not satisfy the time-bar for any pre-1988 claims brought under New York Debtor &amp; Creditor Law (\u201cDCL\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 273, 274, or 275, including those brought on behalf of the \u201cinactive docket\u201d claimants. <em>See Lippe v. Bairnco Corp., </em>229 B.R. 598, 601-02 (S.D.N.Y.1999) <em>(\u201cLippe II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Following years of discovery and numerous applications to the district court with regard to discovery, defendants moved in January 2003 to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying as to the value of assets sold by Keene to the corporate defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>That motion was granted. <em>See Lippe v. Bairnco Corp., </em>288 B.R. 678 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) <em>(\u201cLippe III\u201d). </em>In March of 2003, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute a new valuation expert and granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims of actual and constructive fraud, as well as plaintiffs\u2019 claims under theories of unlawful dividend payments, successor liability, piercing the corporate veil, breach of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. <em>See Lippe v. Bairnco Corp., </em>249 F.Supp.2d 357 (S.D.N.Y.2003) <em>(\u201cLippe IV\u201d). </em>Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s rulings regarding plaintiffs\u2019 proffered experts; its grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims; and its grant of summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims, including the court\u2019s final statute-of-limitations determination. For the reasons that follow, we fully agree with the district court\u2019s thoughtful and thorough decisions and affirm them in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">I. <em>Plaintiffs </em>\u2019 <em>Proffered Experts</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aza\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion, and we have explained that \u2018[a] decision to admit or exclude expert ... testimony is not an abuse of discretion unless it is manifestly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zaremba v. General Motors Corp., </em>360 F.3d 355, 357-58 (2d Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Amorgianos v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., </em>303 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir.2002)) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Under <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the Federal Rules of Evidence \u201cassign to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. In carrying out this task, a trial judge is \u201cto make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). Accordingly, the Federal Rules of Evidence permit the admission of expert testimony only \u201cif (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In granting defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 valuation experts, Thomas E. Dewey, Jr. and Professor Jocelyn D. Evans, the district court stated it was \u201csimply not persuaded that their proposed testimony rests on a \u2018reliable foundation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lippe III, </em>288 B.R. at 689. The court provided no less than <em>eighteen </em>reasons why plaintiffs\u2019 valuation experts were so unreliable as to be inadmissible under Rule 702. <em>See id. </em>at 689-701. Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in criticizing Dewey\u2019s failure to perform a \u201cdiscounted cash flow\u201d (\u201cDCF\u201d) analysis in addition to the \u201ccomparable companies\u201d analysis that he did perform. In our view, much of the problem in this regard is that Dewey failed to adequately explain <em>why </em>he chose not to use DCF as a check against the comparables he employed in the valuations. The remainder of plaintiffs\u2019 argument focuses on the district court\u2019s criticism of both Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 addition of \u201ccontrol premiums\u201d to their valuations. Plaintiffs contend that the addition of control premiums is a standard valuation technique. However, the district court was clear that its primary concern over control premiums was not <em>that </em>they were applied, but rather <em>how </em>they were applied, including Dewey\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Evans\u2019 failure to explain the reasons for the percentages used. <em>See id. </em>at 691-93. The experts simply failed to \u201coffer a meaningful explanation\u201d as to why they added control premiums to their valuations. <em>Id. </em>at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Most significantly, plaintiffs\u2019 argument goes little further. Plaintiffs suggest that <em>all </em>of the district court\u2019s other observations merely go to the weight of the evidence \u2014 and not its admissibility. While it is true that \u201c[a] minor flaw in an expert\u2019s reasoning or a slight modification of an otherwise reliable method will not render an expert\u2019s opinion <em>per se </em>inadmissible,\u201d <em>Amorgianos, </em>303 F.3d at 267, Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 testimony exhibited considerably more than \u201cminor flaws.\u201d Among the indicia of unreliability were Dewey\u2019s inability to explain a number of variables and assumptions used in his analysis, such as price/earnings multipliers, income projections, and which companies were comparable to those being valued; his failure to adjust his calculations to account for variances between the businesses sold by Keene and the companies against which he compared them; and his commission of numerous outright \u2014 and largely admitted \u2014 errors in analysis. Similarly, Evans asserted wildly implausible valuations of Keene and the Shielding Systems businesses; relied on plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to provide her with information on \u201ccomparable companies\u201d \u2014 without verifying whether those companies were indeed comparable and without adjusting her analyses to account for variances; and failed to explain why her \u201ccomparable companies\u201d and DCF analyses did not yield similar results \u2014 after admitting that they should. These examples are a mere sample of the flaws in Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 proffered testimony. The record, as a whole, clearly demonstrates that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting defendants\u2019 motion to exclude that testimony as inadmissible under Rule 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to hold a hearing on the admissibility of Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 testimony. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Kumho Tire </em>that \u201c[t]he trial court must have the same kind of latitude in deciding <em>how </em>to test an expert\u2019s reliability, and to decide whether or when special briefing or other proceedings are needed to investigate reliability, as it enjoys when it decides <em>whether ... </em>that expert\u2019s relevant testimony is reliable.\u201d 526 U.S. at 152 (emphasis in original). As the district court aptly noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgV\">[T]he testimony would add nothing. The parties have provided a voluminous record, which includes the experts\u2019 reports, complete transcripts of the experts\u2019 depositions, documents reviewed by the experts, transcripts of depositions of other witnesses, and treatises on valuation. The experts have had a full and fair opportunity to explain their opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\"><em>Lippe III, </em>288 B.R. at 701 n. 7. We agree. Given the amount of information upon which the district court made its decision, it did not abuse its discretion by denying a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Finally, the district court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute Laureen M. Ryan as a new valuation expert, and also denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to include Ryan\u2019s report in the summary judgment record. <em>See Lippe IV, </em>249 F.Supp.2d at 385-87. In its 2003 ruling, the court noted that this case had been pending since 1996; that plaintiffs had retained Dewey and Evans in 1998 and 2000, respectively; that Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 expert reports were filed in 2001; that defendants prepared their challenges to those reports for the next one and one-half years; and that Dewey and Evans were finally deposed by defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>dants in 2002. <em>Id. </em>at 385. The parties then submitted over 900 pages of briefing on defendants\u2019 motions to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 expert evidence and for summary-judgment, the latter based in large part on the former. <em>Id. </em>Seven days after the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 experts, and just \u201c[t]wo days before the argument of the summary judgment motions, plaintiffs raised the possibility of designating a new valuation expert. At the outset of the argument of the summary judgment motions, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel handed up [Ryan\u2019s] new valuation report....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The district court explained its decision to deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute Ryan as a valuation expert, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">Plaintiffs had more than a full and fair opportunity to find proper valuation experts. In fact, they had years to do so. After they chose Dewey and Evans, plaintiffs were placed on notice, months ago, that their reports, opinions, and testimony were flawed in many respects. Yet, plaintiffs made no effort to add or substitute other experts \u2014 until all the motions, including the summary judgment motions, had been filed and briefed and the <em>Daubert </em>motions had been decided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 386. The court further observed that defendants would be prejudiced by having to meet this new report, that a \u201cnew round of <em>Daubert </em>motions and a new round of summary judgment motions ... would surely take another year, if not longer,\u201d and that it would be unfair to the defendants to permit the plaintiffs an opportunity to cure their case after having made \u201csome ill-advised tactical choices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court precluded plaintiffs from offering Ryan\u2019s testimony or supplementing the summary judgment record with Ryan\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Although plaintiffs were long on notice of defendants\u2019 criticisms of Dewey\u2019s and Evans\u2019 reports, plaintiffs decided not to respond to those criticisms until the district court finally excluded the evidence as unreliable. Indeed, \u201calthough [plaintiffs were] on notice every step of the way that [defendants were] challenging [their] experts, [they] made no attempt to add or substitute other evidence.\u201d <em>Weisgram v. Marley Co., </em>528 U.S. 440, 456, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000). In addition to the delay that would likely ensue from permitting plaintiffs to introduce a new expert at this late juncture, <em>cf. Kirstein v. Parks Corp., </em>159 F.3d 1065, 1069 (7th Cir. 1998), it is simply the case that \u201cfairness does not require that a plaintiff ... be afforded a second chance to marshal other expert opinions and shore up his case.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., </em>243 F.3d 244, 250 (6th Cir.2001). As the district court well documented, plaintiffs had a full and fair opportunity to develop and defend their choice of experts. That they failed in that endeavor does not entitle them to begin anew. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to substitute Ryan as a valuation expert, or in denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion to include Ryan\u2019s report in the summary judgment record.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">II. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Fraudulent-Conveyance Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">The focus of plaintiffs\u2019 argument below was that Keene sold its assets to the corporate defendants for less than fair value, and thus that those transfers were fraudulent as to Keene\u2019s asbestos-victim creditors. As explained above, plaintiffs have no admissible evidence that those transfers were for less than fair value. Indeed, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in part because plaintiffs\u2019 failure to present any admissible evidence that Keene received less than fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>value for its assets meant that plaintiffs had presented no evidence from which a jury could conclude that Keene\u2019s creditors had been harmed. <em>See Lippe IV, </em>249 F.Supp.2d at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">In New York, fraudulent-conveyance liability may not attach absent some prejudice to a creditor of the transferor. In <em>HBE Leasing Corp. v. Frank, </em>48 F.3d 623 (2d Cir.1995), this Court recognized that under the DCL, \u201ca transfer may not be challenged as fraudulent unless it prejudices the complaining creditor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 n. 10; <em>see also Travelers Ins. Co. v. 633 Third Assocs., </em>973 F.2d 82, 86 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>Willcox v. Goess, </em>22 F.Supp. 841, 843-44 (S.D.N.Y.1938); <em>Bryce v. Nat\u2019l City Bank of New Rochelle, </em>17 F.Supp. 792, 796 (S.D.N.Y.1936); <em>Buckley Petroleum Prods., Inc. v. Goldman, </em>28 A.D.2d 640, 641, 280 N.Y.S.2d 876 (4th Dep\u2019t 1967); <em>Newfield v. Ettlinger, </em>22 Misc.2d 769, 774-75, 194 N.Y.S.2d 670 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1969); <em>Suffolk &amp; Nassau Amusement Co. v. Ambrose, </em>145 N.Y.S.2d 424, 426 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1955); <em>Prudential Sav. Bank v. Grant, </em>99 N.Y.S.2d 602, 603 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Plaintiffs suggest that Keene\u2019s creditors were in some way \u201cprejudiced\u201d by Keene\u2019s asset transfers. But plaintiffs can advance no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Keene\u2019s asbestos creditors were prejudiced by the sale of Keene\u2019s assets. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory below, that Keene received less than fair value for its assets, relied on the valuations performed by Dewey and Evans. Plaintiffs have not offered other evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the transfers hindered their ability to move against Keene\u2019s <em>unchanged </em>net worth. Rather than converting its assets into a form unreachable by its creditors, Keene transformed them into a medium arguably more accessible: cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Plaintiffs suggest that by exchanging its assets for cash, Keene exchanged dynamic, growing businesses for static, idle cash\u2014 cash that it then frittered away by, among other things, paying unlawful dividends to Bairnco. However, Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. issued \u201cfair value\u201d opinions for each of the asset transfers. Such opinions took into account the future income potential of the businesses valued, discounted to present value. It is thus a crude simplification to suggest that the exchange of a business for cash is somehow inherently unfair; Keene received an amount that accounted for future potential growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Moreover, Keene\u2019s subsequent use of its cash belies any suggestion that it intended to frustrate creditors by converting its assets into cash and letting that cash languish or dissipate. In the years following the first sale in question, Keene engaged in numerous <em>acquisitions </em>of businesses and attempted, albeit somewhat unsuccessfully, to develop those businesses. Given these facts, plaintiffs\u2019 theory devolves into the suggestion that, in 1981, Keene hatched a scheme to divest itself of assets in order to shield them from asbestos liability; Keene began selling assets, and, with the money it earned in those sales, bought more assets' \u2014 only to fraudulently sell them in order to shield them from asbestos liability. Further, plaintiffs have not presented evidence that Keene\u2019s payment of dividends to Bairnco was improper. Keene paid Bairnco quarterly dividends at a rate of 45 percent of Keene\u2019s net income for the previous quarter, a rate agreed upon in 1981 after Smith Barney advised Keene of comparable, prevailing dividend rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">In sum, for plaintiffs to survive summary judgment on their claims for actual and constructive fraud, they must at the very least be able to prove that Keene\u2019s creditors were prejudiced by the asset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>sales. As plaintiffs\u2019 only plausible theory of harm is that Keene received less than fair value in those sales, and plaintiffs have no evidence supporting that theory, plaintiffs cannot survive summary judgment. Thus, the district court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Further, plaintiffs\u2019 constructive-fraud claims under DCL \u00a7 273 fail for an absence of proof that Keene was insolvent at the time of, or was rendered insolvent by, the asset transfers in question.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>N.Y. Debt. &amp; Cred. Law \u00a7 273. The DCL explains that \u201c[a] person is insolvent when the present fair salable value of his assets is less than the amount that will be required to pay his probable liability on his existing debts as they become absolute and matured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 271(1). A \u201c \u2018[cjreditor\u2019 is a person having any claim, whether matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Plaintiffs claim that Keene underestimated its asbestos-related liabilities, and that on a proper estimate Keene was insolvent at the time of the asset transfers in question. Plaintiffs contend that future claims of persons exposed to asbestos \u2014 but not yet symptomatic \u2014 must be included in a debtor\u2019s \u201cprobable liability.\u201d N.Y. Debt. &amp; Cred. Law \u00a7 271(1). Plaintiffs maintain that such persons are \u201ccreditors\u201d insofar as their claims fit within the rubric of \u201cmatured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, absolute, fixed or contingent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 270. With these definitions of \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201ccreditors,\u201d plaintiffs argue that the estimates of their asbestos-liability expert, Dr. Peterson, demonstrate that Keene should have estimated future case filings far in excess of the number it actually estimated.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Using Peterson\u2019s numbers, Keene\u2019s total asbestos-liabilities range from approximately $1 billion to approximately $2 billion. In calculating these figures, Peterson included tort claims based on injuries expected to manifest as late as 2027. However, DCL \u00a7 271(1) refers to \u201cexisting debts\u201d as the relevant starting point of a solvency analysis. Under New York law, \u201cin tort cases the relationship of debtor and creditor arises the moment the cause of action accrues.\u201d <em>Shelly v. Doe, </em>249 A.D.2d 756, 757, 671 N.Y.S.2d 803 (3d Dep\u2019t 1998); <em>accord Marcus v. Kane, </em>18 F.2d 722, 723 (2d Cir.1927). Thus, the hypothetical existence of an unaccrued tort claim does not give rise to a debtor-creditor relationship. There is no \u201cexisting debt.\u201d The question arises, then, whether the future claims included in Dr. Peterson\u2019s estimates had yet accrued \u2014 that is, whether they were \u201cexisting debts\u201d for purposes of a solvency analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Under current New York law, a cause of action accrues in a toxic-tort case not on the date of exposure, but rather on \u201cthe date of discovery of the injury by the plaintiff or ... the date when through the exercise of reasonable diligence such injury should have been discovered by the plaintiff, whichever is earlier.\u201d N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 214-c; <em>see also Blanco v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>90 N.Y.2d 757, 766, 666 N.Y.S.2d 536, 689 N.E.2d 506 (1997) (Wesley, J.) (explaining that \u00a7 214-c \u201cwas en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>acted to abrogate the exposure rule which [the New York Court of Appeals] had [previously] formulated and adhered to\u201d in toxic tort cases); <em>Matter of New York County DES Litigation, </em>89 N.Y.2d 506, 513, 655 N.Y.S.2d 862, 678 N.E.2d 474 (1997) (holding that \u00a7 214-c\u2019s \u201creference to \u2018discovery of the injury\u2019 ... mean[s] discovery of the <em>condition </em>on which the claim [is] based and nothing more\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It is true that under New York\u2019s pre1986 statute of limitations, a toxic-tort cause of action accrued upon exposure to a toxic substance; under this rule, toxic-tort plaintiffs, subject as they were to the latent effects of exposure, often found their claims untimely. <em>See, e.g., Snyder v. Town Insulation, </em>81 N.Y.2d 429, 599 N.Y.S.2d 515, 615 N.E.2d 999 (1993); <em>Schmidt v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Co., </em>270 N.Y. 287, 200 N.E. 824 (1936). But it is clear that, for purposes of determining whether a toxic-tort cause of action has accrued, C.P.L.R. \u00a7 214-c has displaced cases such as <em>Snyder </em>and <em>Schmidt. </em>Indeed, the remedial effect of \u00a7 214-c highlights why, even if the pre-1986 statute applied to the analysis of Keene\u2019s solvency, plaintiffs have not produced evidence that Keene\u2019s \u201cprobable liability\u201d exceeded its assets. Section 214-c ameliorated the harshness of the exposure rule by extending the time in which toxic-tort plaintiffs could bring suit. If the exposure rule \u2014 and its corollary three-year statute of limitations \u2014 applied to Keene\u2019s asbestos-victim \u201ccreditors,\u201d then the only such creditors to whom Keene had \u201cprobable liability\u201d would be those who had been exposed within three years prior to the solvency analysis in question. Surely this is a small percentage of those included in Dr. Peterson\u2019s estimates. But in any event, plaintiffs\u2019 have provided no evidence in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Thus, plaintiffs are caught in the horns of a dilemma. If the present discovery rule applies, then to the extent that Dr. Peterson\u2019s estimates depend on the inclusion of unsymptomatic, future claimants, those estimates depend on the inclusion of unaccrued claims. And because the estimates depend on unaccrued claims, they depend on amounts that are not \u201cdebts\u201d under the DCL. But if the pre-1986 exposure rule applies, then Keene\u2019s liability for any given solvency analysis is severely limited to a three year window of pre-analysis exposure. In either case, Dr. Peterson\u2019s estimates overstate Keene\u2019s liabilities. As plaintiffs have provided no other evidence of Keene\u2019s assets-to-liabilities ratios, plaintiffs have offered no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Keene was insolvent at the time of, or was rendered insolvent by, any of the transactions in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">III. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019Remaining Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments and consider them to be either rendered moot by the determinations above \u2014 or simply without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">A. Payment of Unlawful Dividends</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">Under New York Business Corporations Law, \u201c[a] corporation may declare and pay dividends ... except when currently the corporation is insolvent or would thereby be made insolvent....\u201d N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 510(a). Plaintiffs have not presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Keene was insolvent at the time it paid its quarterly dividends to Bairnco.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">B. Successor Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Under New York law, \u201c[a] corporation may be held liable for the torts of its predecessor if (1) it expressly or impliedly assumed the predecessor\u2019s tort liability, (2) there was a consolidation or merger of seller and purchaser, (3) the purchasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Corporation was a mere continuation of the selling corporation, or (4) the transaction is entered into fraudulently to escape such obligations.\u201d <em>Schumacher v. Richards Shear Co., </em>59 N.Y.2d 239, 245, 464 N.Y.S.2d 437, 451 N.E.2d 195 (1983). Plaintiffs do not challenge the district court\u2019s early ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 only possible ground of establishing successor liability is under the fourth factor above. <em>See Lippe I, </em>225 B.R. at 858. Thus, insofar as plaintiffs have failed to establish that defendants acted fraudulently, plaintiffs have failed to establish the \u201cfraudulent purpose\u201d exception to the traditional rule that a successor corporation is ordinarily not liable for the torts of its predecessor. <em>See Schumacher, </em>59 N.Y.2d at 244, 464 N.Y.S.2d 437, 451 N.E.2d 195. Further, although plaintiffs suggest that an \u201cequity and fairness\u201d exception to the no-liability rule should apply, plaintiffs offer no authority for such an exception. Finally, the theory of successor liability is appropriate where a defendant succeeds to substantially all of its predecessor\u2019s assets, <em>see, e.g., Nettis v. Levitt, </em>241 F.3d 186, 193 (2d Cir.2001); no one defendant here did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">C. Piercing the Corporate Veil</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">In New York, \u201cpiercing the corporate veil requires a showing that: (1) the owners exercised complete domination of the corporation in respect to the transaction attacked; <em>and </em>(2) that such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong against the plaintiff which resulted in plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>Morris v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Taxation and Finance, </em>82 N.Y.2d 135, 141, 603 N.Y.S.2d 807, 623 N.E.2d 1157 (1993) (emphasis added). Although plaintiffs suggest that \u201cdomination\u201d is a ground for veil-piercing liability that is distinct from fraud, New York law is clear that domination <em>and </em>fraud are required. <em>See id. </em>Plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence that Bairnco dominated Keene in the furtherance of the alleged fraud. Further, as plaintiffs cannot prove injury to Keene\u2019s creditors, plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that defendants\u2019 conduct \u201cresulted in ... injury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">D. <em>Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Corporate Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">According to New York Business Corporations Law (\u201cBCL\u201d), \u201c[a]n action may be brought against one or more directors or officers of a corporation to procure a judgment for the following relief .... to compel the defendant to account for his official conduct in ... [t]he neglect of, or failure to perform, or other violation of his duties in the management and disposition of corporate assets committed to his charge.\u201d N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 720(a)(1)(A). Because plaintiffs have presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that any one of the defendants acted fraudulently, that Keene was rendered insolvent by any of the actions of the defendants, or that Keene\u2019s creditors were harmed, plaintiffs have no grounds for claiming that Bailey breached his fiduciary duties or committed corporate misconduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">E. Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">The district court held that plaintiffs could not satisfy the statute of limitations for any pre-1988 claims brought under DCL \u00a7\u00a7 273, 274, or 275. <em>See Lippe II, </em>229 B.R. at 601-02. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that New York\u2019s statute of limitations may be avoided for two categories of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>claims: those brought on behalf of the U.S. Pension Benefits Guarantee Corp. and those brought on behalf of \u201cinactive docket\u201d claimants. Plaintiffs also argue that the district court abused its discretion in declining to use principles of \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d to toll the statute of limitations. Given that the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims in toto, we need not reach the issue of whether the plaintiffs can satisfy the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">. Although not necessary to the determination of plaintiffs\u2019 fraudulent-conveyance claims\u2014 given that plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate injury for those claims \u2014 the issue of solvency is both an alternative ground on which we affirm the district court's ruling with regard to plaintiffs\u2019 DCL \u00a7 273 claims and an independent ground on which we affirm the court\u2019s ruling with regard to plaintiffs\u2019 unlawful-dividends claim. <em>See infra </em>Section III.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. Further, even if plaintiffs could produce evidence in support of their claim under BCL \u00a7 720, they could only do so to the extent that they represent \"judgment creditors.\u201d N.Y. Bus. Corp. Law \u00a7 720(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
