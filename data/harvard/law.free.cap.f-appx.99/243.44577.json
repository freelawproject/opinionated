Madigan (Madigan), a truck upfitter located in Ayer, Massachusetts, to be a full distributor of its products. Tuck\u2019s Trucks, Inc. (TTI), another Fisher distributor located in Hudson, Massachusetts, claims that Fisher\u2019s promotion of Madigan violated its agreement with Fisher that Fisher would only appoint additional distributors after providing notice to existing distributors and for valid business reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">TTI sued Fisher in Massachusetts state court, alleging breach of contract, intentional interference with contract, intentional interference with advantageous relations, fraud, violation of the Massachusetts Trade Practices Act, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A, and violation of the Massachusetts Anti-Trust Act, Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93 \u00a7 6. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, Fisher removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. After discovery, Fisher moved for summary judgment on all counts. The district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge who recommended granting it. The district court agreed and entered final judgment in Fisher\u2019s favor. TTI appealed, pursuing only the contract, intentional interference with advantageous relations, fraud, and ch. 93A claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, <em>see Rathbun v. Autozone, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 62, 66 (1st Cir. 2004), convinces us that the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough opinion correctly analyzes the challenged counts, and we affirm essentially for the reasons stated therein. <em>See Boyle v. Douglas Dynamics, LLC, </em>292 F.Supp.2d 198 (D.Mass.2003). We write mostly to amplify the magistrate judge\u2019s rulings, mindful that \u201c[wjhere ... a trial judge astutely takes the measure of a case and hands down a convincing, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words resonate.\u201d <em>Corrada Batances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., </em>248 F.3d 40, 43 (1st Cir.2001) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">We sketch only the factual highlights, construing the record in favor of TTI. <em>See Carmona v. Toledo, </em>215 F.3d 124, 131 (1st Cir.2000). In the fall of 1996, James Boyle began negotiations with Thomas Walsh for Boyle\u2019s company, TTI, to purchase Walsh\u2019s company, TTSales. TTSales, a General Motors truck dealer, had also sold Fisher plow equipment since the early 1970\u2019s. TTSales\u2019s distributorship agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Fisher, contained in a combination of oral promises and documents, did not limit Fisher\u2019s prerogative to appoint other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In or around 1996, Fisher began discussions with Madigan about becoming a full distributor. When TTSales heard about these discussions, it told Fisher that it vehemently opposed Madigan\u2019s appointment. To placate TTSales, Fisher decided to appoint Madigan only as a \u201cpool distributor.\u201d This designation did not give Madigan full authority to sell Fisher products and forced Madigan to purchase some of its Fisher equipment from TTSales or another distributor, Chapdelaine Truck Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Before TTI agreed to purchase TTSales in April of 1997, it did not discuss the pending deal with Fisher. TTI understood, however, that it would need to negotiate directly with Fisher to obtain a distributorship because TTSales could not assign its distributorship. Around this time, TTI began discussions with Fisher about becoming a distributor. Fisher stated that it would not begin formal distributorship talks until General Motors had approved TTI as a distributor of its trucks. In the interim, TTI and Fisher had several conversations about the distributorship process. During these conversations, Fisher representatives stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s a trust situation. You do the right thing and you continue to do what [TTSales] does, you will have no problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">\u2022 \u201c[TTSales] has done an outstanding job. You continue to do that stuff and you will have no problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\u2022 \u201cDo what [TTSales] did, and we\u2019ll get along just fine because [it] obviously did it right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">\u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t let us down and we won\u2019t let you down and it makes good sense for everyone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">\u2022 The transition \u201cwould be seamless ... Once the credit was approved, it was seamless. There were no issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4U\">General Motors approved TTI as a distributor in September 1997. TTI then began the Fisher application process. About that time, TTI learned that TTSales did not have a written agreement with Fisher that restricted Fisher\u2019s ability to appoint other distributors. Apparently concerned about Fisher\u2019s power to appoint other distributors, TTI demanded that TTSales sign an \u201coffset agreement\u201d to compensate it if Fisher appointed another distributor in certain designated towns. Despite TTI\u2019s concern, it never discussed the distributor network or Madigan\u2019s status with Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">In October 1997, Fisher and TTI met. At this meeting, Fisher\u2019s representative stated that it \u201chas had a long and strong relationship with [TTSales] and had no plans to change anything.\u201d According to TTI, it already was a distributor by the time of this meeting, Madigan\u2019s status was not discussed at this meeting, and it only learned of Madigan\u2019s appointment in the summer of 1998. At this meeting, TTI signed Fisher\u2019s \u201cAuthorized Distributor Code of Ethics and Responsibilities.\u201d The Code of Ethics and Responsibilities did not restrict Fisher\u2019s ability to appoint other distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">TTI\u2019s first claim is for breach of contract. TTI asserts that Fisher\u2019s \u201cstatements to the effect that things [would] remain the same was the factual basis for [the] agreement that Fisher would not change its distributor system without notice and then only for business reasons.\u201d The magistrate judge rejected this claim because Fisher\u2019s oral statements did not establish an agreement limiting its ability to appoint additional distributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">The parties agree that, absent a contrary agreement, a manufacturer may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>choose distributors at will. <em>See Jobbers Warehouse Serv., Inc. v. Maremont Corp., </em>453 F.Supp. 840, 842 (D.Mass.1978). Nothing in the discussions highlighted by TTI is sufficiently definite to displace this principle. <em>See Held v. Zamparelli, </em>13 Mass.App.Ct. 957, 431 N.E.2d 961, 962 (1982) (stating that oral contract cannot be based on indefinite statements). The discussions between Fisher and TTI concerned only Fisher\u2019s inclination to appoint TTI as a distributor. Neither party mentioned the distributor network or Madigan\u2019s status. In light of this context, no reasonable fact finder could conclude that Fisher intended its reassuring comments to TTI to limit its ability to appoint other distributors. Moreover, TTI\u2019s subsequent demand from TTSales for an \u201coffset agreement\u201d to protect it from losses if Fisher appointed other distributors indicates that TTI understood that Fisher retained the unfettered right to appoint additional distributors. TTI\u2019s breach of contract claim is thus supported only by placing certain of Fisher\u2019s statements out of context and then applying a meaning to them that the parties did not intend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">TTI also asserts that Fisher\u2019s appointment of Madigan violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This covenant is an implied contractual term that prevents the parties from taking any action to injure the rights of another party to reap the benefits of its contract. <em>See Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. v. HBC Assocs., </em>411 Mass. 451, 583 N.E.2d 806, 820 (1991). The \u201ccovenant may not, however, be invoked to create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship, as the purpose of the covenant is to guarantee that the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in their performance.\u201d <em>See UNO Restaurants v. Boston Kenmore Realty Corp., </em>441 Mass. 376, 805 N.E.2d 957, 964 (2004). TTI claims that Fisher violated the covenant by failing to provide adequate notice before appointing Madigan as a distributor. But, as discussed above, Fisher made no express promise to this effect. <em>See supra </em>at 245-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Citing <em>Cherick Distribs., Inc. v. Polar Corp., </em>41 Mass.App.Ct. 125, 669 N.E.2d 218 (1996), TTI argues that Fisher\u2019s obligation to supply reasonable notice was an implied term of the distributorship agreement. In <em>Cherick, </em>the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that a jury could find that a manufacturer breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating a distributorship agreement on only four-days notice. <em>Id. </em>at 220. The court ruled that the termination of an at-will distributorship agreement requires reasonable notice and that four-days notice could be deemed unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>The instant case does not implicate Fisher\u2019s obligations vis-\u00e1-vis <em>TTI\u2019s </em>distributorship. <em>Cherick </em>does not hold that a manufacturer must provide notice to its current distributors before appointing a new distributor. Seemingly, in the absence of a statutory command, importing such a notice requirement into distributorship agreements is unwarranted because the harm to an existing distributor caused by the appointment of an additional distributor, if any, typically is not of the same magnitude as the harm caused by the termination of the agreement. In any event, TTI has not provided a reason or cited authority for such a rule. <em>See Piantes v. Pepperidge </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Farm, Inc., </em>875 F.Supp. 929, 938 (D.Mass. 1995) (citing cases in which similar implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims have been rejected).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">TTI\u2019s tort claims fare no better. TTI asserts that Fisher wrongfully interfered with its advantageous relationship with Madigan. To prevail on this claim, TTI must show that Fisher acted with an improper motive or by improper means. <em>See United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23-24 (1990). TTI argues that Fisher acted with an improper motive by waiting to appoint Madigan until TTSales was no longer a distributor, so as not to upset Fisher\u2019s longstanding relationship with TTSales. TTI has not set forth any facts showing that Fisher\u2019s purpose in promoting Madigan was to harm TTI. Taken in the light most favorable to TTI, the facts show that Fisher had an interest in promoting Madigan when it believed that it could do so without harming its established relationship with TTSales. This was a legitimate business purpose for Fisher. <em>See Smith &amp; Croyle, LLC v. Ridgewood Power Corp., </em>111 F.Supp.2d 77, 85 n. 18 (D.Mass.2000) (stating that improper motive cannot be established where defendant acts in pursuit of \u201clegitimate corporate purpose\u201d). That Fisher\u2019s action may have also interfered with TTI\u2019s future plans for selling products to Madigan does not establish a claim. <em>See Hunneman Real Estate Corp. v. Norwood Realty, Inc., </em>54 Mass.App.Ct. 416, 765 N.E.2d 800, 808 (2002) (stating that \u201csomething more\u201d than mere interference with relationship is required to prove tort).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">TTI also claims that Fisher committed fraud by making assurances that \u201cthings would remain the same.\u201d We agree with the magistrate judge that TTI cannot rest a fraud claim on Fisher\u2019s statements because \u201cthey are too general to justify reliance.\u201d <em>Hinchey v. NYNEX Corp., </em>979 F.Supp. 40, 44 (D.Mass.1997). As discussed above, the conversations during which Fisher made the representations did not concern Madigan or even the distribution network generally. <em>See supra </em>at 245-46. While TTI may, in hindsight, wish that it had discussed Fisher\u2019s plans to appoint additional distributors, it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">TTI\u2019s final claim asserts a violation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A. The magistrate judge rejected this claim because there was no evidence that Fisher engaged in deceit or other unfair practices in its dealings with TTI. TTI has not put forward a developed argument challenging this ruling. We therefore affirm the ruling for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s opinion. <em>See Boyle, </em>292 F.Supp.2d at 218-220.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Having considered all of TTI\u2019s arguments and finding them to be without merit, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">. TTI also argues that the \u201ccourse of dealing\u201d between it and Fisher established an agreement limiting Fisher\u2019s ability to appoint distributors. As the magistrate judge correctly concluded, this argument fails because \u201cTTI had no prior relationship with Fisher at all.\u201d <em>Boyle, 292 </em>F.Supp.2d at 209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
