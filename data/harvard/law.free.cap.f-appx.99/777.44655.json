Phil Stern cross-appeals the district court\u2019s decision to award summary judgment in Sinatra\u2019s favor. The district court found that Stern did not possess a valid copyright in the photograph \u201cF.S. in Corridor Walking Away\u201d at the time he initiated this copyright infringement action, but it declined to award attorneys\u2019 fees in Sinatra\u2019s favor. We have jurisdiction, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\">It is undisputed that Stern took the photograph in 1954 or 1955, and that the photograph appeared in <em>Look </em>magazine in 1957 with a credit to \u201cPhil Stern, Globe.\u201d There is no evidence permitting a reasonable inference that the publication in <em>Look </em>was unauthorized. As Stern testified under oath, \u201cthis is authorized by Globe Photos, which is automatically authorized by me since I made them my agent and they would sell my \u2014 what I would call my file photos.\u201d Stern\u2019s twenty-eight year statutory copyright term under the 1909 Copyright Act began to run from the time of the 1957 publication in <em>Look </em>and persisted until 1985, when Stern failed to renew it. At that time the photograph fell into the public domain. <em>See Urantia Found. v. Maaherra, </em>114 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir. 1997). Stern\u2019s inclusion of the photograph in a 1996 copyright registration for \u201cFrank Sinatra Images\u201d did not alter this photograph\u2019s public domain status. <em>See Cooling Sys. &amp; Flexibles, Inc. v. Stuart Radiator, Inc., </em>777 F.2d 485, 490 (9th Cir.1985), <em>overruling on other grounds recognized by Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., </em>35 F.3d 1435, 1448 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Without a valid copyright in the photograph, Stern\u2019s additional claims against Sinatra for unjust enrichment and violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1203, failed as a matter of law. <em>See Del Madera Props, v. Rhodes &amp; Gardner, Inc., </em>820 F.2d 973, 977 (9th Cir.1987), <em>overruling on other grounds recognized by Kodadek v. MTV Networks, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 1209, 1213 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Accordingly, as the district court concluded, summary judgment for Sinatra was appropriate. Nor can we say that the district court abused its discretion in denying Sinatra\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Fantasy Inc. v. Fogerty, </em>94 F.3d 553, 556 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
