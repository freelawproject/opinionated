(\u201cDelta\u201d), a Texas Corporation, brought suit against SSAB Tunnplat AB (\u201cSSAB\u201d), a Swedish Corporation, Danieli Corporation (\u201cDanieli Corp\u201d), a Delaware Corporation, and Danieli &amp; C Officine Meccaniche SpA (\u201cDanieli &amp; C\u201d), an Italian Corporation. The three defendants sought dismissal on various grounds. After finding that Delta had failed to establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over SSAB or Danieli Corp., the district court granted their motions to dismiss. The district court granted Danieli &amp; C\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens, upon determining that the relevant private and public interests favored Italy, rather than Texas, as the appropriate forum. Delta appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of its claims against SSAB, Danieli &amp; C, and Danieli Corp. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b40-14\">Delta, a Texas corporation that designs and manufactures steel-processing equipment, contacted SSAB, a sheet-steel manufacturer based in Sweden, in an effort to market its product to SSAB. Fortuitously, at that time, SSAB was soliciting bids for two cut-to-length lines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SSAB invited Delta to submit a bid, and Delta complied by sending a bid and layout drawings to SSAB. Five companies besides Delta responded to SSAB\u2019s bid request, including Danieli &amp; C, an Italian company.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">At SSAB\u2019s invitation, Delta flew to Sweden to discuss its bid. During its meeting with Delta in Sweden, SSAB expressed an interest in viewing Delta\u2019s equipment in operation. Once Delta\u2019s representatives returned to the United States, SSAB again requested to view Delta\u2019s equipment. The parties agreed that SSAB would visit the United States. SSAB thus flew to the United States, inspected Delta\u2019s equipment in Tennessee and Indiana, and met with Delta representatives at Delta\u2019s headquarters in Irving, Texas. Throughout the trip, SSAB praised Delta\u2019s technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-16\">Danieli Corp.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the North American rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>resentative of Danieli &amp; C,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> telephoned Delta to inquire about the possibility of having Delta work as a subcontractor for Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C on the SSAB project. Employees at Danieli Corp. and Delta exchanged several phone calls and emails on this subject, but Danieli &amp; C and Delta ultimately decided to pursue separate bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">SSAB subsequently invited Delta, Danieli &amp; C, and one other company back to Sweden for final bidding and negotiations. After completion of these meetings, SSAB informed Delta that it had not been chosen for the project. Delta telephoned SSAB to inquire who had been chosen; SSAB replied that Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C was to provide its cut-to-length lines. During this call, SSAB told Delta that it had asked Danieli &amp; C to provide a rotary shear like Delta\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">At SSAB\u2019s suggestion, Delta contacted Danieli &amp; C, through Danieli Corp., about possibly subcontracting on SSAB\u2019s project. According to Delta, Danieli Corp. opened a dialogue between Delta and Danieli &amp; C. Danieli Corp. also forwarded technical information from Delta to Danieli &amp; C. These discussions culminated in Delta submitting an offer to Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C. When Danieli &amp; C did not immediately respond to the offer, Delta contacted Danieli &amp; C to check the status of its bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C telephoned Delta in Texas and asked Delta to send a delegation to Buttrio, Italy to finalize the agreement. Delta\u2019s representatives thus traveled to Italy. In Italy, Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C executed a confidentiality agreement with Delta and was provided with confidential documents regarding Delta\u2019s rotary shear and its electromagnetic stacker. Danieli &amp; C, however, declined to finalized the subcontracting agreement while Delta was in Italy; Danieli &amp; C told Delta that the agreement would be finalized upon Delta\u2019s return to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Delta\u2019s representatives returned to Texas, but Delta was not contacted by Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C as planned. Delta telephoned Danieli &amp; C repeatedly to check on the status of its bid. Danieli <em>&amp; G </em>eventually emailed Delta that its price was too high. When Delta telephoned Danieli &amp; C, Danieli &amp; C warned that if Delta would not provide its rotary shear and its electromagnetic stacker at a lower price, then Danieli <em>&amp; G </em>would have them manufactured by someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Delta brought suit against Danieli &amp; C and Danieli Corp. in federal district court in Texas, alleging that the companies had both breached their confidentiality agreement with Delta and misappropriated Delta\u2019s trade secrets. Delta later amended its complaint to add causes of action for fraud, conspiracy, and negligent misrepresentation, and to include SSAB as a defendant. Upon various motions by the defendants, the district court dismissed Delta\u2019s suit against Danieli &amp; C under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, dismissed Delta\u2019s suit against SSAB for lack of personal jurisdiction, and ordered Delta to amend its complaint to state its allegations against Danieli Corp. more specifically. Delta\u2019s Second Amended Complaint alleges that Danieli Corp. conspired with Danieli &amp; C to misappropriate Delta\u2019s trade secrets by misrepresenting Danieli &amp; C\u2019s intent to use Delta as a subcontractor and then breaching its confidentiality agreement with Delta. After Delta submitted its Second Amended Complaint, Danieli Corp. moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted Danieli Corp.\u2019s motion and entered a final judgment against Delta. Delta timely appeals the dismissal of its claims against SSAB, Danieli &amp; C, and Danieli Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>II. PERSONAL JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction de novo. <em>Stripling v. Jordan Prod. Co., </em>234 F.3d 863, 869 (5th Cir.2000). Where, as here, the district court did not conduct an evidentiary hearing, the party seeking to assert personal jurisdiction is required only to present sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case. <em>Id. </em>The court will accept as true any uncontroverted allegations contained the party\u2019s complaint and will resolve all factual conflicts arising out of the parties\u2019 affidavits in favor of the party seeking jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>The court need not, however, accept \u201cmerely conclusory\u201d allegations as true. <em>Cent. Freight Lines Inc. v. APA Transp. Corp., </em>322 F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">A federal court sitting in diversity may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if (1) the state long-arm statute permits an exercise of jurisdiction and (2) an exercise of jurisdiction would comport with the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Liebreich, </em>339 F.3d 369, 373 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1), 4(h)(1), 4(k)(l). Because the requirements of Texas\u2019s long-arm statute are coextensive with the requirements of the Due Process Clause, the sole inquiry in this case is whether the district court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over the defendants would be consistent with due process. <em>Religious Tech Ctr., </em>339 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is proper, under the Due Process Clause, when two requirements have been met: (1) the defendant has established \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum state and (2) exercising jurisdiction does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945); <em>Alpine View Co. v. Atlas Copco AB, </em>205 F.3d 208, 214-15 (5th Cir.2000). A defendant has minimum contacts with a forum if it has \u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 253, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958). The minimum-contacts requirement ensures that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 U.S. 286, 297, 100 S.Ct. 559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Personal jurisdiction may be specific or general. A court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the suit arises out of or is related to the defendant\u2019s purposeful contacts with the forum. <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 414 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984); <em>Alpine View Co., </em>205 F.3d at 215. By contrast, if a suit is unrelated to the defendant\u2019s activities in the forum, a court may exercise general personal jurisdiction over the defendant if the defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state are substantial and \u201ccontinuous and systematic.\u201d <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 414-15; <em>Alpine View Co., </em>205 F.3d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">With these general principles in mind, we now consider whether the district court properly found that it did not have personal jurisdiction over either SSAB or Danieli Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">1. SSAB</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">SSAB is organized under the laws of Sweden. SSAB\u2019s principal place of business is Borlange, Sweden; it has no subsidiaries or branch offices in the United States. SSAB does not have employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>servants, or agents in Texas, nor does it own or lease any property in Texas. Nonetheless, Delta contends that SSAB\u2019s contacts with Texas are sufficient to support general personal jurisdiction because (1) SSAB Swedish Steel (\u201cSwedish Steel\u201d), which is wholly owned by SSAB\u2019s parent corporation, SSAB Svenskt Stal AB, maintains a Pittsburgh office and sells products in Texas; (2) one of Swedish Steel\u2019s employees resides in Texas; (3) 0.04% of SSAB\u2019s steel products were shipped by third parties into Texas; and (4) SSAB\u2019s representatives visited Delta\u2019s Texas facility on one occasion. We agree with the district court that these contacts are insufficient to give rise to general personal jurisdiction over SSAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As noted by the district court, Swedish Steel\u2019s contacts with Texas may not be imputed to SSAB because the evidence demonstrates that SSAB and Swedish Steel, though owned by the same parent corporation, are separate and distinct entities. <em>See Alpine View Co., </em>205 F.3d at 218-19; <em>Bearry v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>818 F.2d 370, 372-73 (5th Cir.1987). Furthermore, that a small portion of SSAB\u2019s products were shipped by third parties into Texas does not establish that SSAB availed itself of the benefits and protections of Texas law. <em>See Bearry, </em>818 F.2d at 373, 375-76 (holding that \u201c[t]he laws of Texas neither protected nor benefitted\u201d the defendant even though nearly $250 million of the defendant\u2019s manufactured products flowed to independent dealers in Texas over a five-year period). Finally, SSAB\u2019s lone trip to Texas for the purpose of visiting Delta\u2019s headquarters is not a substantial contact and certainly does not constitute \u201ccontinuous and systematic\u201d contacts with Texas. In sum, the flow of SSAB\u2019s goods into Texas through third parties, combined with one visit by SSAB to Delta\u2019s Texas facility, are insufficient contacts with Texas to give rise to general personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Delta also contends, however, that SSAB has contacts with Texas that support specific personal jurisdiction because (1) SSAB made misrepresentations to Delta, some of these misrepresentations were made in Texas, and it was foreseeable that the effects of SSAB\u2019s misrepresentations \u2022would be felt by Delta in Texas and (2) SSAB was part of a conspiracy to acquire and to misappropriate Delta\u2019s confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Delta correctly notes that this court has held that tortious actions performed outside of Texas may be sufficient, for purposes of minimum-contacts analysis, if the actions \u201chad foreseeable effects in the forum and were directed at the forum.\u201d <em>Wien Air Alaska, Inc. v. Brandt, </em>195 F.3d 208, 212 (5th Cir.1999). But Delta has not shown that SSAB directed its actions at Texas. Rather, the evidence shows that Delta sought out SSAB\u2019s business, first by telephoning SSAB in Sweden, and then by traveling to Sweden to meet with SSAB representatives. In fact, SSAB ultimately declined to create an ongoing business relationship with Delta, opting instead to do business with Danieli &amp; C, an Italian Corporation. Contact initiated by Delta is insufficient to show that SSAB purposefully directed its actions at Texas. <em>Hanson, </em>357 U.S. at 253 (\u201cThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Furthermore, Delta has not alleged that SSAB made misrepresentations to Delta while SSAB was in Texas; nor has Delta alleged that SSAB made misrepresentations in telephone calls, faxes, or emails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Delta personnel in Texas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Wien Air Alaska, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 212 (holding that the defendants had purposefully directed their actions at Texas by making fraudulent misrepresentations to the plaintiff in telephone calls to the plaintiff in Texas and in letters and faxes sent to the plaintiff in Texas). Thus, Delta has not shown that SSAB purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business within Texas or invoked the benefits and protections of Texas\u2019s laws. Consequently, we conclude that Delta has failed to establish a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction based on SSAB\u2019s alleged misrepresentations. <em>See Panda Brandywine Corp. v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>253 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Delta also contends that specific personal jurisdiction can be based on SSAB\u2019s alleged participation in a conspiracy to obtain Delta\u2019s confidential information. To establish its prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction, Delta was required to demonstrate that SSAB individually, and not as part of the conspiracy, had minimum contacts with Texas. <em>Guidry v. United States Tobacco Co., </em>188 F.3d 619, 625 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, Delta was required to show that either the alleged conspiracy or SSAB\u2019s alleged misrepresentations were related to or arose out of SSAB\u2019s contacts with Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Delta\u2019s First Amended Complaint states that \u201cDefendants SSAB and Danieli have conspired together ... to acquire and misappropriate [Deltaj\u2019s confidential and proprietary information\u201d by making material misrepresentations to Delta. In this section of its complaint, however, Delta makes no reference to the state of Texas. Delta has provided no other evidence that the conspiracy was related to SSAB\u2019s contacts with Texas. Furthermore, as explained above, there is no evidence that SSAB\u2019s alleged misrepresentations were directed at Texas. Therefore, Delta has not established a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction over SSAB based on its alleged participation in a conspiracy against Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">As Delta has presented neither a prima facie case of general personal jurisdiction nor a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction, the district court correctly dismissed Delta\u2019s suit against SSAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">2. Danieli Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Delta contends that Danieli Corp. has minimum contacts with Texas based on Danieli Corp.\u2019s breach of Delta\u2019s confidentiality agreement, its fraudulent misrepresentations to Delta, and its conspiracy with Danieli &amp; C to acquire Delta\u2019s confidential information. We agree with the district court, however, that Delta has not presented a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction related to any of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">In its appellate brief, Delta argues that specific personal jurisdiction is proper based on the confidentiality agreement, because, by entering into the agreement, Danieli Corp. \u201ccreated continuing obligations between it and [Delta], a Texas resident^] and has availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Texas.\u201d Delta\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. As Delta admitted in its Second Amended Complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201cDanieli [Corp.] and Danieli &amp; C are separate and distinct legal entities.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence shows that Danieli Corp. never agreed to be bound by the confidentiality agreement between Delta and Danieli &amp; C. Notwithstanding that Danieli &amp; C promised on behalf of itself and \u201cany other party affiliated with it [to] maintain ... the strict confidentiality of [Delta\u2019s] Confidential Information,\u201d only Danieli &amp; C signed the agreement. Danieli Corp. did not know about the confidentiality agreement,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> let alone agree to be bound by it. It is far-fetched indeed to assert that Danieli Corp. should have anticipated being haled into Texas court in connection with a contract it did not know about, that was executed in Italy by its affiliate, and that was allegedly breached by its affiliate in Italy. Consequently, we hold that Delta has failed to establish a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction related to its contract claim against Danieli Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Delta also contends that specific personal jurisdiction exists based on Danieli Corp\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentations. In its brief on appeal, Delta argues that Danieli Corp., like SSAB, made misrepresentations to Delta that it knew or should have known would cause harm to Delta in Texas. Delta, however, never alleged in its Second Amended Complaint that Danieli Corp. actually misrepresented any material facts. Delta merely alleged that misrepresentations were made, but the complaint is ambiguous about who allegedly made them: Danieli &amp; C, Danieli Corp., or both.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since Danieli Corp. and Danieli &amp; C are different corporations, only misrepresentations made by Danieli Corp. itself can be used to measure Danieli Corp.\u2019s contacts with Texas; Danieli &amp; C\u2019s contacts cannot be imputed to Danieli Corp. <em>See Alpine View Co., </em>205 F.3d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Furthermore, even if we interpreted Delta\u2019s complaint as alleging that Danieli Corp. made material representations to Delta and that it was foreseeable to Danieli Corp. that the effects of the misrepresentations would felt by Delta in Texas, we would still find that Delta has not established a prima facie case of jurisdiction over Danieli Corp. As with SSAB, Delta has failed to show that Danieli Corp.\u2019s misrepresentations had any connection to Texas, other than that the effects of the misrepresentations would be felt by Delta there. Critically, Delta has not shown that Danieli Corp. purposefully directed its actions at Texas. <em>See Panda Brandywine Corp., </em>253 F.3d at 869-70 (holding that the foreseeability of causing injury in Texas is insufficient for specific personal jurisdiction, and that the plaintiff must also show that the defendant purposefully directed its efforts towards the forum state). Delta has not, for example, alleged that Danieli Corp.\u2019s misrepresentations arose out of contacts initiated by Danieli Corp., rather than contacts initiated by Delta.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Delta alleged that Danieli Corp.\u2019s misrepresentations occurred in telephone calls, emails, or faxes, to Delta in Texas. <em>Cf. Wien Air Alaska, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 212. Because there has been no showing that Danieli Corp. purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business within Texas, we find that Delta\u2019s allegations do not support a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction over Danieli Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Finally, Delta argues that it properly established a prima facie case of specific personal jurisdiction based on Danieli Corp.\u2019s alleged participation in a conspiracy with Danieli &amp; C. In its Second Amended Complaint, Delta alleges that Danieli Corp. conspired with Danieli &amp; C to misappropriate Delta\u2019s confidential information and that the \u201cmeans employed [to accomplish this goal] was the misrepresentation to [Delta] with respect to Danieli &amp; C\u2019s intent to utilize [Delta] as a subcontractor [and] the breach of the Confidentiality Agreement.\u201d According to Delta, its allegations of conspiracy were sufficient, under Ma<em>ndelkorn v. Patrick, </em>359 F.Supp. 692 (D.D.C.1973), to establish a prima facie case because Danieli Corp. never denied that it participated in a conspiracy with SSAB and Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C. We note, first, that <em>Mendelkom, </em>a district court case from the District of Columbia, is not binding authority. Even if we agreed with the analysis contained in <em>Mandelkom, </em>however, Delta\u2019s argument fails because, in his affidavit, Mark Brandon, the President of Danieli Corp., explicitly \u201cdenie[d] that [Danieli Corp.] conspired in any way with SSAB ... and/or Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C to acquire any information from Delta.\u201d In any event, as explained above, Delta has failed to show how the alleged conspiracy between the defendants had any connection to the state of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Because Delta has not established a prima facie ease of specific personal jurisdiction over Danieli Corp., the district court correctly dismissed Delta\u2019s claims against Danieli Corp. for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">III. FORUM NON CONVENIENS We review for clear abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a suit under the doctrine of forum non conveniens. <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 255, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981); <em>Baumgart v. Fairchild Aircraft Corp., </em>981 F.2d 824, 835 (5th Cir. 1993). \u201cWhere the district court \u2018has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Baumgart, </em>981 F.2d at 835 (quoting <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>454 U.S. at 257).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">There is a \u201cstrong presumption in favor of the plaintiffs choice of forum.\u201d <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>454 U.S. at 254-5. Nonetheless, this presumption may be overcome when an alternate, adequate forum is available and private and public interests \u201cclearly point towards trial in the alternate forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255 &amp; n. 22. The relevant private interest factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">the \u201crelative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 242 n. 6 (quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947)). The district court should also consider the following public interest factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-10\">the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion; the \u201clocal interest in having localized controversies de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>cided at home\u201d; the interest in having the trial of a diversity case in a forum that is at home with the law that must govern the action; the avoidance of unnecessary problems in conflict of laws, or in the application of foreign law; and the unfairness of burdening citizens in an unrelated forum with jury duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp., </em>330 U.S. at 509). Although citizen plaintiffs are given \u201csomewhat more deference\u201d in their choice of forum than foreign plaintiffs, dismissal is still appropriate \u201cif the balance of conveniences suggest that trial in the chosen forum would be unnecessarily burdensome for the defendant or the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255 n. 23. The defendant bears the burden of showing that dismissal on this basis is warranted. <em>Robinson v. TCI/US West Communications Inc., </em>117 F.3d 900, 907 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Delta has not challenged the district court\u2019s determination that Italy is an available and adequate alternative forum for its suit against Danieli &amp; C. Instead, Delta claims that the district court erred in its evaluation of the public and private interests at stake. Regarding the private interests, Delta argues that it is no easier to access sources of proof in Italy than in Texas and that the cost of obtaining the attendance of willing witnesses would be no higher if the suit were tried in Texas than it would be if the suit were tried in Italy. Furthermore, Delta argues that as important documents are in English, its personnel speaks only English, and the key meetings were conducted in English, a trial in Italy would require extensive translation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">In considering the private interest factors, the district court addressed all of these arguments. Although recognizing that most of <em>Delta\u2019s </em>documents and witnesses are located in Texas, the district court concluded that Italy would provide better overall access to sources of proof because most of the information and witnesses necessary for trial are located in Italy and Europe. Furthermore, because it found that almost all of the relevant testimony would be provided by European witnesses, the district court concluded that the cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses would be lower if the case were tried in Italy. Finally, the district court determined that language barriers would be more problematic in Texas than in Italy, as more witnesses and documents are located in Italy than in Texas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We find that the district court\u2019s analysis of these factors was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Delta also contends that the district court erred in finding that the existing public interests weighed against trial in Texas. First, Delta claims that this is a localized controversy and, thus, that Texas has an interest in having the case heard in its courts. Second, Delta argues that Texas law applies to the dispute and, therefore, that courts in Texas will be most familiar with the law to be applied. Third, because the law of Texas applies, according to Delta, there would be no problems of conflict of laws or the application of foreign law if the case were tried in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The district court disagreed with Delta\u2019s analysis of the public interests present in this suit. The district court found that this is fundamentally an Italian dispute, rather than a Texas dispute, because the presentation and negotiations of the confidentiality agreement were conducted during Delta\u2019s trip to Italy, the confidentiality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>agreement was executed there, and Danieli <em>&amp; </em>C\u2019s alleged breach of the agreement occurred there. According to the district court, even though Texas has an interest in hearing a case brought by one of its citizens, Italy has a stronger interest in having the case heard in Italy because of its interest in regulating corporations that operate within its boundaries. Furthermore, the court concluded that, under a \u201cmost significant contacts\u201d analysis, Italian law would apply; thus, Italian courts would be most at home with the law and trying the case in Italy would avoid unnecessary problems in the application of foreign law. Finally, the district court concluded that it would be unfair to burden Texas citizens with jury duty, since this is basically an Italian dispute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">We find no clear abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s analysis of the public interest factors. Specifically, we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that Italian law, rather than Texas law, applies to the dispute. Since this diversity case comes to us from a district court in Texas, we apply Texas choice-of-law rules. <em>Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941). Texas follows the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test for contract cases. <em>Jackson v. W. Telemktg. Corp. Outbound, </em>245 F.3d 518, 523 (5th Cir.2001). Under this test, the court looks at the quality, rather than the quantity, of the parties\u2019 contacts with a particular jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Because Danieli &amp; C is domiciled in Italy and the confidentiality agreement between Delta and Danieli &amp; C was negotiated, executed, and allegedly breached in Italy, we find that the district court was correct in holding that Italian law applies. <em>See Maxus Exploration Co. v. Moran Bros., Inc., </em>817 S.W.2d 50, 53-54 (Tex.1991) (outlining the factors that a court should consider in determining which jurisdiction has the most significant relationship to the parties and the transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Because the district court carefully considered the relevant private and public factors, and its analysis was reasonable, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the suit against Danieli &amp; C under the doctrine of forum non conveniens.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

SSAB did allegedly comment, during a phone call with a Delta employee in Texas, that \"the rotary shear and temper mill in [Delta\u2019s] material were very novel and interesting,\u201d but, presumably, Delta does not consider this to be a false statement. In any case, this statement cannot form the basis for a fraudulent-misrepresentation claim, because, under Texas law, statements of opinion or judgment do not ordinarily support claims of fraud. <em>Fina Supply, Inc. v.

Because neither Danieli &amp; C nor Delta addressed the administrative difficulties flowing from court congestion, the district court did not include this factor in its analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
