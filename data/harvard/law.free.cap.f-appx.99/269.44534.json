For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-14\">First, we find that the evidence that Cushing had engaged in securities fraud while he was employed at Monitor Investment Group, Inc., Meyers Pollock Robbins, Inc., and Hoffman Schneider, was properly admitted at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) for the three reasons urged by the government, to wit: to prove the charge in the indictment that Cushing withheld material information concerning his background and qualifications from WAMEX investors; to establish that Cushing did so intentionally; and to explain to the jury, Cushing\u2019s relationship with Anthony Hidalgo. <em>See United States v. Germosen, </em>139 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 1998) (\u201c[OJther acts evidence ... can be admitted for any purpose except to show criminal propensity ....\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Cushing\u2019s argument that he was not under an affirmative duty to disclose all information concerning his prior work experience in his press releases and other public announcements goes to the validity of the material omission charge, not to the admissibility of the evidence necessary to prove it. We also reject Cushing\u2019s alternative argument that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Second, we hold that the district court did not commit plain error by failing to poll the entire jury to determine whether or not any of its members had been prejudiced by exposure to the <em>New Yorker </em>cartoon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given the non-specific subject of the cartoon, Juror # ll\u2019s assurances that she had not attempted to influence other members of the jury, as well as the \u201cwide discretion\u201d afforded district courts \u201cin deciding how to pursue an inquiry into the effects of extra-record information,\u201d <em>United States v. Hillard, </em>701 F.2d 1052, 1064 (2d Cir.1983), it was within the discretion of the district court to conclude, after questioning Juror # 11, that no further inquiries were necessary. Although in <em>United States v. Hunnewell, </em>891 F.2d 955 (1st Cir.1989), relied on by Cushing, the district court questioned each juror individually to determine whether the jury had been prejudiced by exposure to a cartoon, <em>id. </em>at 960, <em>Hunnewell </em>did not prescribe a procedure to be followed mechanistically in all cases involving alleged jury contamination. On the contrary, <em>Hunnewell </em>makes clear that district courts \u201cpossess[ ] considerable leeway in determining when and how to interrogate the venire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Third, Cushing argues that the district court improperly adopted the $24 million loss amount set forth in the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Because, at sentencing, Cushing did not challenge the PSR\u2019s calculation but argued instead that the entire loss amount was not attributable to him, we review Cushing\u2019s instant contention for plain error. Cushing conceded at the sentencing hearing that the sale of WAMEX shares resulted in a $20 million loss. The government, more precisely, explained in a letter brief that \u201c19.5 million shares of WAMEX stock ... were sold in the marketplace ... for a total of $20.4 million.\u201d Because the loss of $20.4 million \u2014 like a loss of $24 million \u2014 required the enhancement of Cushing\u2019s offense level by 16 steps pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(Q),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> any error by the district court in adopting the PSR\u2019s $24 million loss calculation did not affect Cushing\u2019s substantial rights. In addition, we find that the district court did not err in attributing the entire loss amount to Cushing as a foreseeable consequence of his jointly undertaken criminal activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Finally, we hold that the district court committed no error in enhancing Cushing\u2019s sentence for use of \u201csophisticated means\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(6)(C). Cushing argues that the district court should not have applied the enhancement because his involvement in the stock manipulation was limited to making public statements. But, as noted above, the Guidelines provide that, in cases of jointly undertaken criminal activity, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>defendant is responsible for \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a)(l)(B); <em>see United States v. Lewis, </em>93 F.3d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir.1996) (holding that \u201csophisticated means\u201d is an offense characteristic, not a characteristic of an individual defendant; \u201c[a] defendant cannot escape punishment simply by contracting out to his accountants the dirty work of tax evasion\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Miles, </em>360 F.3d 472, 482 (5th Cir.2004) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the sophisticated means enhancement could not be applied to her where she allegedly did not personally use sophisticated means, because her co-conspirator\u2019s use of sophisticated means was reasonably foreseeable to her). We also reject Cushing\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s imposition of enhancements under both U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C) and \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2) resulted in impermissible double counting. Indeed, the district court enhanced Cushing\u2019s sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2), not, as Cushing contends, for \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d but rather for a scheme to defraud more than one victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction and sentence of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">. The government argues that Cushing waived his right to request individual polling by failing to request this procedure before the district court. We, however, do not need to address whether a criminal defendant can waive his or her right to an impartial jury, an issue identified but not resolved in <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>277 F.3d 164, 205 (2d Cir. 2002), because even if the right to an impartial jury cannot be waived, the lack of the procedural step of polling to determine whether any other juror had seen the cartoon does not mean that the defendant was denied the right to an impartial jury. In <em>Nelson, </em>we were careful to point out that \"we do not assert that the presence of a possibly biased juror, whose bias has never been challenged by defendants at <em>voir dire, </em>necessarily taints the jury panel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\">.
