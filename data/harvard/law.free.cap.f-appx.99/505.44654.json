After exhausting his state remedies, Morrow filed a \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court in which he alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and refused to grant a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on any of Morrow\u2019s claims. Morrow now seeks a COA <em>from </em>this court for his claims that his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to make multiple objections during the prosecutor\u2019s cross examination of him. For the following reasons, we DENY Morrow\u2019s request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">On the evening of April 3, 1996, Lisa Allison took her father\u2019s car to a local carwash but never returned home. At Morrow\u2019s trial for capital murder, Bryan McNeil testified that he saw Allison at the carwash that night as he was cleaning his truck. McNeil noticed a man crossing the street toward the carwash; although McNeil never positively identified Morrow, Morrow matched the physical description that McNeil provided. Subsequently, while McNeil was filling his truck with gasoline, he heard a short, startling scream and observed that the man who had crossed the street was laying on top of Allison in the front seat of her car. Although McNeil could not see the man\u2019s hands at any time during this incident, he hypothesized that the two individuals were boyfriend and girlfriend because Allison did not appear to be struggling. A few moments later, the man shifted his position, Allison slid over to the driver\u2019s seat, and the man moved into the passenger seat of the car. Allison then drove the car, with the man inside, in the direction of the Trinity River.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">Testimony and evidence presented at Morrow\u2019s trial indicated that the authorities discovered Allison\u2019s body in the Trinity River the next morning. An autopsy revealed that she had been beaten before death and had sustained numerous injuries. The autopsy also suggested that her death was caused by a combination of several skull fractures and a large cutting wound to her neck that severed her jugular vein. Later that day, the authorities found Allison\u2019s father\u2019s car abandoned within a few miles of Morrow\u2019s house. A number of hair and blood samples from inside the car matched the victim, Allison, while other blood stains matched Morrow\u2019s DNA profile. In particular, the DNA extracted from a blood stain on the rear seat was consistent with a mixture of Allison\u2019s and Morrow\u2019s DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">In addition, Cecil Smith, one of Morrow\u2019s acquaintances, testified that Morrow told him \u2014 prior to Allison\u2019s death \u2014 that it would be relatively easy to abduct a woman from this particular carwash at knife point, rob her, and sell her possessions for drug money. Morrow\u2019s friend, Dane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ScMsler, also testified that he had dropped Morrow off at the store across the street from the gas station and carwash on April 3, 1996, at approximately the same time that McNeil observed the man who fit Morrow\u2019s description approach the car-wash. Moreover, Brad Keaton, another of Morrow\u2019s acquaintances, testified that he saw Morrow walking down the road toward his house at around midnight on April 3, 1996. According to Keaton, Morrow had scratches on his arm and a good deal of blood on his arms and legs. Keaton\u2019s description of the clothes worn by Morrow was consistent with McNeil\u2019s description of the clothing worn by the man who approached Allison at the carwash earlier that night. Keaton stated that Morrow claimed he had received his injuries in a car wreck.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Morrow exercised his right to testify in his own defense, and, during his direct examination, Morrow claimed that he did not commit the crime. Nevertheless, the jury found Morrow guilty of capital murder and sentenced him to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for certiorari. Morrow then filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the state trial court in which he claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that his trial attorneys had been constitutionally ineffective when they failed to object to numerous questions and comments made by the prosecutor during Morrow\u2019s cross examination. The state court rejected the application. In an unpublished opinion, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the state habeas court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied Morrow\u2019s request for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Morrow then filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) in federal district court, reasserting his contention that his trial counsel\u2019s conduct during his cross examination was constitutionally deficient. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Morrow\u2019s request for a COA. Thereafter, Morrow filed an application for a COA with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Morrow must obtain a COA before appealing the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To obtain a COA, Morrow must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Supreme Court has stated that, to make a \u201csubstantial showing,\u201d a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (quotation marks omitted). Additionally, \u201c[bjecause the present case involves the death penalty, any doubts as to whether a COA should issue must be resolved in [the petitioner\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Johnson, </em>213 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Although we need not decide whether Morrow\u2019s appeal ultimately will succeed at this stage in the proceedings, the COA determination does require \u201can overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029; <em>accord Henderson v. Cockrell, </em>333 F.3d 592, 604 (5th Cir.2003). In making this assessment, we are mindful of the deferential standard of review that AEDPA required the district court to apply to Morrow\u2019s claims. <em>See Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>F.3d 331, 336 (5th Cir.2003). Because the state habeas court adjudicated Morrow\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim on the merits, the district court was required to defer to that court\u2019s decision \u2014 that Morrow\u2019s counsel was not constitutionally defective \u2014 unless it was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Moreover, the state court\u2019s factual findings enjoy a presumption of correctness, which Morrow bore the burden of rebutting \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">III. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Morrow was required to show both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this deficient performance prejudiced his defense. Habeas relief is unavailable if Morrow fails to establish either prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. <em>Riley v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 308, 315 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[Tjhere is no reason for a court ... to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d). To prove that his counsel was constitutionally deficient, Morrow must show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Supreme Court has cautioned courts not to second-guess counsel\u2019s decisions through the distorting lens of hindsight, however: thus, we must employ \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance ... [and], under the circumstances, ... might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689,104 S.Ct. 2052 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In addition to proving his attorneys\u2019 deficiencies, Morrow must also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by their unprofessional performance. That is, Morrow \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">In the district court, Morrow claimed that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during his cross-examination by the prosecuting attorney. Morrow enumerated a plethora of objections he believes should have been made \u2014 to both the prosecutor\u2019s questions and his comments responding to Morrow\u2019s answers. According to Morrow, had his attorneys objected, the trial court would have sustained their objections and the jury might then have acquitted him of capital murder. We group these objections into relevant categories and examine each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">1. Prosecutor\u2019s Mode of Interrogation</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Morrow first contends that his attorney was deficient for failing to object to the format of the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Morrow claims that the prosecutor \u201ccontracted\u201d with him \u201cconcerning the scope of [the] cross-examination\u201d by pi'omising only to ask questions calling for a \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answer. The state habeas court disagreed, noting that the prosecutor merely stated that he was \u201cgonna try to\u201d follow this format. The state court found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys did not object to the open-ended questions subsequently posed by the prosecutor because they felt any objection would be overruled and that numerous interruptions might cause Morrow, who they believed to be temperamental, to \u201cloos[e] his cool\u201d in front of the jury. Because Morrow prof<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>fered no evidence to rebut these factual findings, the district court held that counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the mode of interrogation was objectively reasonable. In light of these findings, we do not believe that reasonable jurists would debate or find wrong the district court\u2019s conclusion that counsel\u2019s inaction was based on sound trial strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">2. Prosecutor\u2019s Comments on Morrow\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AM5\">Morrow also contends that his trial counsel failed to object to eleven different comments made by the prosecutor during the course of his testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Morrow further complains that although his attorney did successfully object to a twelfth comment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they did not ask that the jury be instructed to disregard it. According to Morrow, these twelve comments were argumentative and prejudicial; had his attorneys both objected to and asked for limiting instructions regarding the comments, the jury might have believed his exculpatory testimony. The state habeas court disagreed. It found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys chose not to make these objections because they believed \u2014 after considering Morrow\u2019s \u201cgeneral mood, mannerisms, tone of voice, and overall body language\u201d \u2014 that Morrow was responding well to the cross examination and, therefore, was gaining \u201csome points\u201d with the jury. Additionally, the state court found that Morrow\u2019s counsel believed the objections might have either flustered Morrow or interrupted his train of thought. Again, because Morrow provided no evidence to rebut these factual findings, the district court presumed that they were correct and held that defense counsel\u2019s strategic choice not to object to these comments was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">We do not believe that reasonable jurists would find this conclusion debatable. \u201c[Cjounsel\u2019s failure to object to improper remarks by a prosecutor is not ineffective assistance unless the remarks are so prejudicial as to render the trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Jones v. Estelle, </em>632 F.2d 490, 492-93 (5th Cir.1980); <em>see also Neill v. Gibson, </em>278 F.3d 1044, 1058 (10th Cir. 2001) (holding that, if an ineffective-assistance claim based on not objecting to a prosecutorial comment \u201cdoes not implicate any specific constitutional right, [the petitioner] will be entitled to habeas relief only if the prosecutor\u2019s improper remark resulted in a fundamentally unfair proceeding\u201d). As we explain below, however, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>tensive evidence of Morrow\u2019s guilt was presented at trial, belying Morrow\u2019s conclusory argument that his counsel\u2019s inaction somehow prejudiced his defense. Thus, because Morrow has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that these comments either rendered his trial fundamentally unfair or affected the outcome of the proceeding, we decline to grant a COA on this issue. <em>See Hubbard v. Haley, </em>317 F.3d 1245, 1261 (11th Cir.2003) (denying federal habeas relief because defense counsel\u2019s decision \u201cnot to \u2018jump up and down\u2019 with objections ... thereby \u2018annoying\u2019 the jury\u201d was an objectively reasonable strategy).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">3. Cumulative Questioning</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Morrow\u2019s next set of contentions involves his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s repetitive questioning of Morrow regarding six subjects during his cross examination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further complains that his counsel did not object, during the cross examination, to the prosecutor\u2019s repeated playing of portions of a tape-recorded conversation between Morrow and local law enforcement. The state habeas court found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys did not lodge these objections because they did not want to interrupt Morrow\u2019s positive mood during the cross examination, did not want the jury to believe that they were hiding damaging testimony, and did not believe that the objections would be sustained. Thus, the state court held that Morrow\u2019s counsel made a strategic choice to avoid making a string of overruled objections, which the attorneys believed would be more harmful than beneficial to Morrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Morrow proffered no evidence to rebut these findings. The district court therefore concluded that defense counsel\u2019s choice not to make these objections was objectively reasonable. Considering that Morrow provides neither a legal basis for concluding that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were improper in the first instance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor an explanation of how the repetition of admissible testimony could have affected the outcome of the proceeding, we find the district court\u2019s resolution of these claims unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">4. Impeachment</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">Next, Morrow contends that his counsel should have objected to some of the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment evidence; specifically (1) Morrow\u2019s three misdemean- or convictions and (2) the tape-recorded conversation between Morrow and law enforcement. First, under Rule 609(a) of the Texas Rules of Evidence, Morrow explains, a defendant who testifies as a witness may only be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction if the conviction was for a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See Theus v. State, </em>845 S.W.2d 874, 877 n. 1 (Tex.Crim.App.1992) (en banc); <em>id. </em>at 879 (requiring also that the probative value of the conviction outweigh its prejudicial ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>feet). But, in addition to impeaching Morrow with his prior felony convictions during the cross examination, Morrow notes that the prosecutor also inquired about his marijuana possession, D.W.I., and failure to identify a fugitive from justice convictions \u2014 all three of which, he claims, were misdemeanors. Morrow complains that his counsel lodged an objection only after the third crime was mentioned. Notably, the trial court overruled this objection, finding that Morrow had opened the door to admission of his prior misdemeanor and felony convictions by his direct examination testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The state habeas court held that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the use of Morrow\u2019s marijuana and D.W.I. offenses as impeachment evidence was objectively reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state court found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys thought the objections would have been overruled and would also have been futile because the jury had already heard about Morrow\u2019s numerous felony convictions in three different states. Further, the state court found that defense counsel felt that Morrow\u2019s own testimony that he was high on crack cocaine on the night of the murder would overshadow his past misdemeanors in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The district court deferred to the state court\u2019s findings and held that Morrow\u2019s counsel\u2019s decisions were objectively reasonable. Morrow points to no evidence that might rebut these findings; instead, he merely makes a conclusory allegation that his counsel was obviously deficient for not objecting to these \u201cinadmissible misdemeanor convictions.\u201d In light of the substantial impeachment evidence that had already been admitted and the fact that the trial court eventually ruled that Morrow had opened the door to the use of his misdemeanor convictions, jurists of reason would not find it debatable that Morrow has not met his burden of showing that there is a reasonable probability that he was prejudiced by the admission of his D.W.I. and marijuana possession convictions. Cf<em>. Jones v. Estelle, </em>622 F.2d 124, 126 (5th Cir.1980) (holding that, because \u201cfour [of the] convictions thoroughly impeached [the petitioner\u2019s] credibility,\u201d \u201cany error in admitting the other convictions was rendered harmless\u201d); <em>Gibson v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 556, 559 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201d[I]n light of the overwhelming evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt and the fact that at least two of the convictions used to impeach [his] testimony were valid, ... the introduction of the [invalid] convictions constituted harmless error.).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Morrow\u2019s other complaint regarding the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment evidence involves the admission of a tape-recorded conversation between Morrow and Ranger Cook, which the prosecutor used to demonstrate inconsistencies between Morrow\u2019s trial testimony and his prior statements to law enforcement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Morrow claims, without citing the record, that he testified that he was not entirely truthful in his conversation with Ranger Cook before the tape was introduced. Based on this admission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Morrow argues that his attorney should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s use of the tape-recorded statement during cross examination. But Morrow provides no legal support for his contention that the tape-recorded statement was inadmissible.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Morrow instead faults his counsel for \u201clodg[ing] no objection\u201d to the use of the recorded statement, without identifying the grounds upon which an objection might have been granted. Therefore, Morrow has not made a substantial showing that he was denied a federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">5. <em>Prejudicial Questioning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In the course of questioning Morrow about his prior felony convictions in Louisiana, the prosecutor asked Morrow whether he remembered that the New Orleans police discovered a ski mask in Morrow\u2019s car when they arrested him for one of his prior crimes. Morrow contends that his attorneys should have objected to the prosecutor\u2019s questions about the ski mask, because he believes that the fact that he previously owned a ski mask was irrelevant, prejudicial, and introduced in an attempt to present improper \u201c \u2018propensity\u2019 or \u2018conformity\u2019 evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After reviewing the record and an affidavit from Morrow\u2019s trial counsel, the state habeas court found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys did not object to the ski mask questions because, at that point in the cross examination, Morrow\u2019s body language was good and they were pleased by the content of his answers to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiries. The district court presumed that these findings were correct and also noted that there was nothing in the record indicating that Morrow was either upset or surprised by the prosecutor\u2019s questions. Instead, Morrow calmly explained that he probably had the ski mask in the car because he frequently used them when he worked \u201con drilling rigs where it\u2019s real cold upstairs.\u201d The district court then held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to these questions was not objectively unreasonable. In light of these findings, which Morrow makes no attempt to rebut, we conclude that he has not made a substantial showing that his counsel was deficient in not challenging the questions and allowing Morrow to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">6. Prosecutor\u2019s Personal Beliefs and Opinions</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Morrow further asserts that his attorneys were deficient in not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s interjection of his personal beliefs and opinions while cross examining Morrow. Morrow highlights three comments, claiming that they were improperly argumentative and, in making them, that the prosecutor was improperly acting as a witness. With respect to the first remark, the state habeas court found that Morrow\u2019s counsel believed that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>was no grounds for objection because the comment \u2014 \u201cI am sure you have reasons for all of your lies, haven\u2019t you?\u201d \u2014 immediately followed Morrow\u2019s testimony that he \u201chad a reason to lie\u201d to law enforcement before trial. Thus, the state court found no suggestion that the remark was based on evidence outside of the record. Agreeing, the district court held that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to object was objectively reasonable. Because Morrow still asserts only that the prosecutor was improperly \u201cacting as a witness\u201d in making this statement, without explaining how the state habeas court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, we believe that reasonable jurists would agree that Morrow\u2019s counsel was not deficient in not challenging the prosecutor\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The other complained-of cross-examination comments include the prosecutor\u2019s assertions, \u201cyou took [Allison] down here\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and \u201cI have shown where you have lied and lied and lied and lied about this incident, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d The state habeas court found that Morrow\u2019s attorneys chose not to object to these statements because Morrow remained calm in the face of the prosecutor\u2019s questions, Morrow\u2019s responses were both logical and believable, and constantly objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments would have alienated the members of the jury, risking the possibility that the jury would not credit Morrow\u2019s testimony. Because Morrow did not demonstrate that these factual findings were clearly erroneous, the district court assumed they were true and concluded that defense counsel\u2019s performance was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In the district court and in his COA application, Morrow has cited <em>Hall v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 582, 583-84 (5th Cir.1969), for the proposition that a prosecutor may not discuss his personal opinions during a trial because \u201c[t]he power and force of the government tend to impart an implicit stamp of believability to what the prosecutor says.\u201d Although Morrow points us to no Texas authority, we note that a similar rule applies in Texas state courts. <em>See Wolfe v. State, </em>917 S.W.2d 270, 281 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (en banc) (explaining that a prosecutor may not state his personal opinions, which are not based on evidence in the record, at trial). Be that as it may, Morrow proffers no evidence demonstrating that reasonable jurists would disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion, under the circumstances, that it was objectively reasonable for Morrow\u2019s counsel to make the strategic choice not to object to these comments for fear of interrupting Morrow\u2019s calm demeanor or alienating the jury. Moreover, even if we assume that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, we must deny Morrow\u2019s application for a COA because, considering the context of the comments<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the substantial evidence of his guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>adduced at trial, he has not shown that he was prejudiced by these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">7. Prosecutor\u2019s Comment on Morrow\u2019s Right to Remain Silent</p>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">In his final individual claim of error, Morrow asserts that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor commented on Morrow\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent after being arrested for Allison\u2019s murder. At trial, Morrow testified that John Hampton murdered Allison and told Morrow about the crime on three different occasions. Because Morrow admitted that Hampton\u2019s three alleged confessions took place before Morrow voluntarily spoke with Ranger Cook, the prosecutor asked Morrow whether he had informed Ranger Cook of Hampton\u2019s guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">Q: When you talked to Jeff Cook on August 12, 1996, you were already in jail, weren\u2019t you, you were already under arrest for capital murder, weren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">A: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">Q: And you still didn\u2019t tell anybody, at least you didn\u2019t tell Jeff Cook that John Hampton had done this, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">A: No, sir. I was advised not to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axh\">According to Morrow, these questions were objectionable because they violated the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). In <em>Doyle, </em>the Court ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state prosecutor from impeaching a defendant\u2019s exculpatory trial testimony by reference to his post-arrest, post-Mmmdawarnings silence. <em>Id. </em>at 618-19, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Importantly, the Court reasoned that because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings inform a defendant of his right to remain silent, they implicitly assure him that his silence will not later be used against him at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Yet four years later, in <em>Anderson v. Charles, </em>447 U.S. 404, 100 S.Ct. 2180, 65 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980), the Court clarified that a prosecutor may inquire about the inconsistencies between a defendant\u2019s testimony at trial and his post-arrest statements to the police without violating due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\"><em>Doyle </em>does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent. As <em>to the subject matter of his statements, </em>the defendant has not remained silent at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 408, 100 S.Ct. 2180 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court held that a prosecutor may cross-examine a defendant regarding omissions in his post-arrest statements when \u201c[t]he questions [are] not designed to draw meaning from silence, but to elicit an explanation for a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409,100 S.Ct. 2180.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Citing <em>Charles, </em>the state habeas court held that the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not violate Morrow\u2019s due process rights. Importantly, the state court found that, although Morrow received <em>Miranda </em>warnings after requesting an interview with Ranger Cook, he waived those warnings and chose not to exercise his right to silence when he spoke to Cook about his activities on the night of the murder. The district court agreed that the prosecutor\u2019s questions fell within the exception to <em>Doyle </em>carved out by <em>Charles, </em>after noting that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were aimed at highlighting the discrepancy between Morrow\u2019s trial testimony \u2014 that Hampton told Morrow he had committed the murder \u2014 and Morrow\u2019s arguably inconsistent statements to Ranger Cook on the same subject \u2014 that Morrow did not believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Hampton was capable of committing the murder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the district court concluded that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Under the standard of review laid out in AEDPA, we do not believe that Morrow has made a substantial showing that his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated when his attorneys did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2). As we stated above, a federal court may not grant habeas relief to a petitioner without first determining that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1). But, as the district court aptly explained, the state court\u2019s resolution of this issue was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Charles </em>because Morrow\u2019s prior statements to Ranger Cook involved the same subject matter as, and were arguably inconsistent with, his exculpatory statements at trial that he had known for months that Hampton was guilty of the murder. <em>See Pitts v. Anderson, </em>122 F.3d 275, 280 (5th Cir.1997) (concluding that, under <em>Charles, </em>\u201cwhere a prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments are aimed at eliciting an explanation for an arguably prior inconsistent statement, no <em>Doyle </em>violation occurs\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, we hold that there is no basis for granting Morrow\u2019s application for a COA on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">8. Strickland Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Even if we assume that reasonable jurists might debate whether Morrow\u2019s attorneys were deficient in not making one or more of the objections enumerated in his petition for habeas relief, Morrow\u2019s claim that his attorneys were constitutionally ineffective ultimately fails because he does not (nor can he) \u201cshow that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We agree with the district court\u2019s astute conclusion that, in light of the substantial evidence of Morrow\u2019s guilt adduced at trial, \u201cdefense counsel\u2019s conduct during cross-examination[ ] had no bearing on the outcome of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">As both the state habeas court and the district court observed, trial testimony placed a man matching Morrow\u2019s physical and clothing description at the carwash when Allison was abducted. Additionally, the forensic evidence revealed that Morrow\u2019s blood was in the victim\u2019s car and, at least in one stain, was mixed with the victim\u2019s blood. Cecil Smith further revealed that Morrow had previously bragged that it would be easy to commit a crime strikingly similar to Allison\u2019s abduction at the same carwash.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Moreover, Morrow\u2019s direct examination testimony regarding his activities on the night of the murder was impeached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>evidence both of Morrow\u2019s prior felony convictions and his prior inconsistent statements. Morrow\u2019s story was also contradicted by several witnesses at trial. For example, Dale Schisler did not agree that he dropped Morrow off at the car-wash <em>after </em>Allison left the carwash; instead, he placed Morrow at the carwash at the same time that McNeil witnessed Allison\u2019s abduction. In addition, testimony from Charlotte Miller, John Hampton, and Gary Ellison directly conflicted with Morrow\u2019s version of his activities on the night of the murder \u2014 that he spent part of the evening at Miller\u2019s house and later rode around looking for crack cocaine with Miller, Hampton, and a third man, in what turned out to be Allison\u2019s car, before returning home in the early hours of the morning. Lastly, Hampton, whom Morrow claimed had confessed to killing Allison, denied making those statements and testified instead that he was at home with his wife on the night of the murder. In sum, this evidence sufficiently demonstrates that there is no reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different had his counsel made the objections outlined above during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Morrow.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Morrow\u2019s application for a COA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\">. The prosecutor's comments included the following references to alleged discrepancies between Morrow\u2019s testimony on direct examination and his earlier statements to the police: (1) \"[W]e have already run into one\u201d discrepancy; (2) \"and now you have added somebody else [to the list of people you saw at the crack house that night]\u201d; (3) \"Now, did you lie to the Texas Ranger or are you lying to this jury?\"; and (4) \"This jury needs to hear the truth.\u201d Other comments are alleged to be either sarcastic or argumentative, including: (5) \"You remember some of the details pretty well\u201d (after Morrow claimed to have forgotten a detail of his alibi); (6) \"So Chief Tidwell just got up there and he told a bald faced lie, is that what you are saying?\"; (7) \"But [Chief Tidwell] is lying again is that right? ... So he is lying again, right?\u201d; (8) \"Do you really expect [the jury] to believe that?\u201d; (9) \"I guess you had a sudden flash of memory\u201d; (10) \"Two weeks and a month\u201d \u2014 Morrow\u2019s two guesses as to how long he had been collecting unemployment benefits \u2014 \"is quite a bit of difference\u201d; and (11) regarding the murder weapon, \"thank God [Allison's father] didn\u2019t know why I was asking it, but you heard him say that when he had [the ratchet] it wasn\u2019t bent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-10\">. In response to Morrow\u2019s remark that he did not believe he had made a statement that the prosecutor claimed he had made, the prosecutor replied: \"Well, we are making a tape for the jury so they can figure out if they didn\u2019t hear it.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\">. These questions focused on the following: (1) whether Morrow was stabbed in the leg on the night of April 3, as he told the police, or whether he was shot in the leg, as he testified at trial; (2) whether Morrow remembered the price that he paid for a twelve-pack of beer on April 3; (3) why Morrow did not seek medical treatment if he was shot in the leg; (4) whether Chief Tidwell had given false testimony regarding his interrogation of Morrow; (5) whether Morrow asked Dane Schisler to lie to the police about the events of April 3; and (6) whether Morrow asked Brad Keaton to tell the police that he saw Morrow walking home between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., not between 12:00 and 1:00 a.m., on April 3 (the night of the murder).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-14\">. Morrow does explicitly claim that his tape-recorded statement was inadmissible; however, as we explain in the next section, he does not proffer a legal basis for this contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\">. Of course, because his counsel objected under Rule 609(a), albeit unsuccessfully, to the prosecutor\u2019s discussion of Morrow\u2019s failure-to-identify conviction, Morrow cannot now contend that his counsel was ineffective regarding the admission of this conviction without identifying an alternate ground on which the objection would have been sustained. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 527 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-10\">. The district court did not address the question whether Morrow's counsel should have objected to the admissibility of the tape-recorded statement in the first instance, probably because Morrow\u2019s argument against its admissibility is far from clear and completely lacks legal authority. Nevertheless, out of an abundance of caution, we will address this issue in the context of Morrow\u2019s COA application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. In fact, under Rule 613(a) of the Texas Rules of Evidence, a witness may be impeached by a prior inconsistent statement provided that he has not already \"unequivocally admitted\u201d the inconsistencies between the prior statement and his trial testimony. <em>Aranda v. State, </em>736 S.W.2d 702, 708 (Tex. Crim.App.1987); <em>see also McGary v. State, </em>750 S.W.2d 782, 786 &amp; n. 3 (Tex.Crim.App. 1988). Morrow has identified no part of the record in which he made such an <em>unequivocal </em>admission, however. Thus, there is no basis for concluding that an objection to playing portions of the prior statement, which contra-dieted Morrow\u2019s testimony at trial, would have been granted by the trial court. Thus, Morrow has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that his counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted constitutionally ineffective assistance. <em>See Johnson v. Cockrell, </em>306 F.3d 249, 255 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-13\">. Morrow's brief is silent as to what conduct the prosecutor meant to imply he had a propensity for when he mentioned Morrow\u2019s ownership of a ski mask.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\">. The prosecutor was referring to the scene of the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">. First, the prosecutor's statement that Morrow \u201ctook [Allison] down\u201d to the murder scene arose as part of a series of questions regarding whether Morrow had committed various aspects of the crime. In response, Morrow strongly denied the allegation, just as he had denied each of the prosecutor's other allegations, which were more properly phrased as questions. The second comment \u2014 that Morrow had \"lied and lied and lied and lied\u201d about the events of April 3\u2014 could not plausibly be interpreted as anything other than a reference to Morrow\u2019s repeated admissions, during the cross examination, that there were numerous discrepancies between his testimony on direct and the stories that he told the police, his friends, and a newspaper reporter prior to trial. Despite these circumstances, Morrow provides no concrete argument explaining how the comments might possibly have affected the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">. During the cross-examination, the prosecutor played a tape-recorded portion of Morrow's post-arrest conversation with Ranger Cook. After listening to his prior statements, Morrow admitted that he had told Ranger Cook, in reference to Allison\u2019s murder, that \"I don\u2019t even think John Hampton is capable of doing that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. We note that the prosecutor posed his questions regarding Morrow's failure to inform Ranger Cook of Hampton's confessions <em>before </em>he confronted Morrow with the discrepancies in his prior inconsistent statement. Because a review of the entire colloquy demonstrates that this set of questions was posed in an attempt \"to elicit an explanation\u201d for the discrepancies, and was not simply \"designed to draw meaning from silence,\u201d the questions\u2019 sequence is immaterial to our analysis. <em>Charles, </em>447 U.S. at 409, 100 S.Ct. 2180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">. At the end of his COA application, Morrow argues that his counsel\u2019s constitutional ineffectiveness is clear \"when one considers the totality of defense counsel's performance during the cross-examination.\u201d Although inchoate, it is plausible to infer from this statement that Morrow is attempting to present a claim of cumulative error. Nevertheless, because we have concluded that each of Morrow\u2019s individual claims of ineffective assistance lacks constitutional merit, there is nothing to cumulate and we deny Morrow\u2019s application for a COA on this ground. See <em>Miller v. Johnson, </em>200 F.3d 274, 286 n. 6 (5th Cir. 2000); <em>see also Westley v. Johnson, </em>83 F.3d 714, 726 (5th Cir.1996) (\"Meritless claims or claims that are not prejudicial cannot be cumulated, regardless of the total number raised.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
