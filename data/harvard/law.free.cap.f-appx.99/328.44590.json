St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), he was wrongfully denied the opportunity to petition for discretionary relief pursuant to (now repealed) section 212(c) of the 1952 Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u00a7 212(c)) (formerly codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)). Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, procedural posture, and the specification of appellate issues. We affirm substantially for the reasons articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-15\">In a prosecution for illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326, a defendant may challenge the propriety of his initial deportation under \u00a7 1326(d) if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-16\">(1) [he] exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the [deportation] order;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-17\">(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-18\">(3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-19\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) (emphasis added). Failure to meet any one of the \u00a7 1326(d) requirements precludes dismissal of an indictment for illegal reentry in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). <em>United States v. Femandez-Antonia, </em>278 F.3d 150, 157 (2d Cir.2002). The district court held that Tucker failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies to his 1997 deportation order, and failed to show that the initial deportation was fundamentally unfair. Reviewing the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, id. </em>at 156, we consider only the issue of fundamental unfairness, and conclude that there can be none because Tucker was statutorily barred from seeking \u00a7 212(e) relief as of the time the 1997 deportation order was entered. <em>St. Cyr </em>thus has no bearing on the propriety of Tucker\u2019s initial deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">Section 212(c) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), section 304(b) (effective April 1, 1997). The Supreme Court held that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) does not apply retroactively to pre-enactment convictions, and \u201cremains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 326. Under the version of \u00a7 212(c) that applied with respect to Tucker\u2019s 1992 guilty plea on the date he was ordered deported, the Attorney General had no discretion to intervene if the otherwise deportable alien had \u201cbeen convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and ha[d] served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) note at 480 (1990 Amendments), 488 (Effective and Termination Dates) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">As of that date, Tucker had been incarcerated pursuant to his rape conviction for more than five years. Moreover, IIRIRA expanded the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include rape, and made the expanded definition applicable \u201cregardless of whether [a] conviction was entered before, on, or after\u201d September 30,1996. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (as amended by IIRIRA \u00a7\u00a7 321(a)(1), (b), 110 Stat. at 3009-627-28). Similarly, the effective date provision for the expanded definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d directs that \u201c[t]he amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this Act [Sept. 30, 1996], regardless of when the conviction occurred ...\u201d <em>See St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. at 319-20 <em>&amp; </em>n. 43; <em>Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 111 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Thus, \u00a7 212(c) was unavailable to Tucker as of the date he was initially ordered deported, because as of October 30, 1997, he had been convicted of an aggravated felony for which he had served a prison term of at least five years. <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Ashcroft, </em>360 F.3d 346, 353-54 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Tucker suggests that the five-year incarceration preclusion in \u00a7 212(c) should not apply to his case, because he committed the rape prior to the addition of that restriction to \u00a7 212(c) in 1990. The argument is meritless. <em>See Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 291, 293-95 (1993) (holding that any alien who (i) is <em>convicted </em>of an aggravated felony even prior to the date the five-year preclusion took effect; and (ii) who served a sentence of five or more years is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief); <em>see also Reid v. Holmes, </em>323 F.3d 187, 188 (2003) (holding <em>Buitrago-Cuesta </em>unaffected by <em>St. Cyr).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
