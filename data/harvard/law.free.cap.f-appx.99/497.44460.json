Patri now appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his summary-judgment motion insofar as it asserted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>defense of qualified immunity against the federal claims. We REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u201cGovernment officials acting -within their discretionary authority are immune from civil damages if their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Evett v. DETNTFF, </em>330 F.3d 681, 687 (5th Cir. 2003). This court\u2019s \u201cexamination of a claim of qualified immunity is a two-step process.\u201d <em>Harper v. Harris County, Texas, </em>21 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must allege the violation of a clearly established right.... Second, the actions of the officer must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances, such that a reasonably competent officer would not have known his actions violated then-existing clearly established law.\u201d <em>Evett, </em>330 F.3d at 687 (citation omitted). The question whether an official\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable is a question of law, to be decided by this court. <em>Harper, </em>21 F.3d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Patri clearly falls within the category of persons for whom qualified immunity was promulgated. First, he was a government employee. Second, he was performing a discretionary governmental act, as a sheriffs employee jailing a suspect. <em>Davis v. Klevenhagen, </em>971 S.W.2d 111, 116 (Tex. App.1998). Investigations of matters within the official\u2019s purview are also discretionary acts. <em>See Fowler v. Szostek, </em>905 S.W.2d 336, 342 (Tex.App.1995). Thus, the remaining question is whether Patri should prevail under the two-step analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Patri is entitled to immunity because Smith has not pleaded or shown a violation of a clearly established constitutional right. The bases of Smith\u2019s complaint against Patri are that he filed a \u201cfalse\u201d report about Smith\u2019s possession of crack cocaine and that he was improperly searched after Patri discovered the crack cocaine about his person. R. 1, 2-3. First, there is no right to a completely accurate police report. Furthermore, Patri admitted before the jury that his memory of the incident had faded over the intervening months and that he could not testify with certainty that Smith dropped the crack cocaine from his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Also without merit is Smith\u2019s claim that Patri violated his rights by searching him after Patri saw him drop what he believed to be crack cocaine. A lawfully arrested prisoner has no right to be free from searches of his person. Indeed, the notion that a prisoner when processed into a jail should be free from search is ridiculous. Such a search is valid as a search incident to a lawful arrest. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shugart, </em>117 F.3d 838, 846 (5th Cir.1997). For Patri\u2019s search to have violated Smith\u2019s rights in this context, this court would have to disavow law enforcement\u2019s authority to protect itself, the general public, and other prisoners by searching arrested persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The second step of the immunity analysis asks whether \u201cthe actions of the officer [were] objectively reasonable under the circumstances, such that a reasonably competent officer would not have known his actions violated then-existing clearly established law. The question of whether an official\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable is a question of law, to be decided by this Court.\u201d <em>Evett, </em>330 F.3d at 687 (citations omitted). Patri\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable, since he was merely doing his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">It was Patri\u2019s responsibility as an intake jailer to search prisoners brought to the Tarrant County Jail. It was especially important for him to search Smith thoroughly because the arresting officer felt that he was concealing something and told Patri <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that. Undoubtedly there was evidence that Smith was concealing 15 grams of crack cocaine. Thus Patri\u2019s search of Smith was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Second, Patri\u2019s truthful testimony at Smith\u2019s trial was objectively reasonable, as shown by the record. Smith does not contest this, but asks whether \u201ca witness\u2019s honest testimony [is] a lawful excuse for a fabricated report.\u201d He argues that Patri is not entitled to qualified immunity because he falsified the report, which may have induced the jury to convict him.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This lacks merit because Smith was convicted in spite of the alleged error in Patri\u2019s report. The jury convicted Smith <em>after </em>it heard Patri testify that he did not then recall that the drugs fell from Smith\u2019s hand but instead may have fallen from his belt or pocket area. <em>See </em>R. 1, 206-09. Thus, the jury convicted Smith notwithstanding Patri\u2019s uncertainty concerning whence the drugs fell. Moreover, there was never any question that Patri recovered the drugs from underneath Smith\u2019s foot after he placed his foot over them when they hit the floor. Thus, Patri is entitled to summary judgment on his defense of qualified immunity. <em>See Evett, </em>330 F.3d at 686-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is further ORDERED that Smith\u2019s motion for damages under Fed. R.App. P. 38 is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b535-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
