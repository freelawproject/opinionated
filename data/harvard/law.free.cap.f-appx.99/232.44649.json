R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b270-23\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and affirming a hearing officer\u2019s determination that Mackenzie Kruvant is not a \u201cchild with a disability\u201d under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400, <em>et seq. </em>(2000) (\u201cIDEA\u201d), be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-24\">A \u201cchild with a disability\u201d is a child (1) with one of various listed disorders or \u201cspecific learning disabilities,\u201d (2) who \u201cby reason thereof, needs special education and related services.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(3)(A). \u201cSpecific learning disability\u201d means \u201ca disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>spoken or written, which disorder may manifest itself in imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do mathematical calculations.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(26)(A). \u201cA team may determine that a child has a specific learning disability\u201d if the child (1) \u201cdoes not achieve commensurate with his or her age and ability levels in one or more of the areas listed,\u201d and (2) \u201chas a severe discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability\u201d in one of the listed areas. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.541. Under the IDEA, a child with a disability is entitled to receive a special education from her school system.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">We conclude that the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) has proven that Mackenzie Kruvant does not have a \u201cspecific learning disability,\u201d and, accordingly, that the Kruvants are not entitled to reimbursement for the tuition they incurred by reason of their decision to send Mackenzie to a private school. Mackenzie\u2019s achievement levels range from low average to superior for a child of her age and intelligence. <em>See </em>J.A. 29 (hearing officer review of all evaluations in the record), 148-50 (DCPS psychoeducational evaluation). The hearing officer, relying on testimony from the DCPS psychologist who evaluated Mackenzie, determined that the discrepancy between her achievement scores and intelligence scores was not \u201csevere\u201d because the difference between the scores was less than two standard deviations. When Mackenzie was evaluated, the IDEA, federal regulations, and D.C. regulations did not define \u201csevere discrepancy.\u201d It was reasonable for the hearing officer, on the DCPS psychologist\u2019s recommendation, to use two standard deviations as the definition. That definition has since been expressly incorporated into the D.C. regulations. <em>See </em>50 D.C.Reg. 1854 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The Kruvants also contend that, even if Mackenzie does not have a \u201cspecific learning disability,\u201d she is a \u201cchild with a disability\u201d because she suffers from a \u201chealth impairment,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(3)(A). The Kruvants did not raise this claim in the administrative proceedings, and the district court was correct in refusing to consider it for the first time on a motion for summary judgment. Finally, although DCPS admits that it failed to satisfy its responsibility to assess Mackenzie for IDEA eligibility within 120 days of her parents\u2019 request, the Kruvants have not shown that any harm resulted from that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
