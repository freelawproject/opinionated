See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<author id=\"b524-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">William H. Wyatt, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 19, 2003. The notice of appeal was filed on January 21, 2004. Because Wyatt failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny Wyatt\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
