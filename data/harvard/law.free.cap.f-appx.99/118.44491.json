Because we conclude that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) applied the correct legal standards and because his decision to deny Bailey benefits is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the judgment. As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we cite them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Bailey asserts that the ALJ erred when he: 1) rejected the medical opinion of examining physician Dr. Truhn, 2) rejected the testimony of treating therapist Kristin Bezdek, 3) found Bailey\u2019s testimony to be not credible, and 4) posed a defective hypothetical to the vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Dr. Truhn examined Bailey on a single occasion in May 2000. Almost a year later in April 2001, though he did not examine Bailey again, Dr. Truhn completed a Medical Source Statement concluding that Bailey was \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d in her ability to carry out simple one or two step tasks, and in her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods. Although the ALJ agreed that Bailey suffered from \u201csevere\u201d mental impairments, he declined to adopt these portions of Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis because it contradicted the reports of Bailey\u2019s treating source providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">It is well-established that an ALJ may reject an examining physician\u2019s opinion in favor of a treating physician\u2019s whenever inconsistencies and contradictions are present. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). In contrast to Dr. Truhn\u2019s single examination of Bailey, Dr. Dean <em>treated </em>Bailey for nearly a year and examined her on at least four separate occasions. Throughout his treatment of Bailey, Dr. Dean never reported the severe limitations in concentration and basic functioning that Dr. Truhn diagnosed. Not only does Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis contradict that of Dr. Dean\u2019s but it also contradicts the reports of Dr. Ballew and Dr. Hennings, who reviewed Bailey\u2019s complete record in March and June of 2000, and determined that she was <em>not </em>markedly limited in her ability to focus, or in her ability to carry out short simple tasks.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">The record thus reveals that Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis is inconsistent with the reports of three other physicians \u2014 including that of a treating physician. Moreover, Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis is neither entitled to the most weight under our case law, nor is it the most recent of the medical reports. Under these circumstances, we hold that the ALJ was entitled to reject Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis in favor of the reports provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>by other physicians. <em>See Matney v. Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that in evaluating the evidence, we must review the \u201crecord as a whole\u201d and \u201cif the evidence can support either outcome, the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ\u201d); <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989) (citations omitted) (\u201cWhere medical reports are inconclusive ... resolution of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely of the [Commissioner].\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The ALJ also rejected Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis because it was contradicted by Bailey\u2019s daily activities which included providing housekeeping and childcare services in exchange for room and board. The dissent points out that Bailey\u2019s duties cannot be described as \u201cfull-fledged child-care responsibilities.\u201d This court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595 (9th Cir. 1999), however, upheld a denial of benefits based on a claimant\u2019s comparable level of activity. In <em>Morgan, </em>we stated that an \u201cability to fix meals, do laundry, work in the yard, and <em>occasionally care for his friend\u2019s child </em>served as evidence of [claimant\u2019s] ability to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Regardless of how we view the quality of the childcare Bailey rendered, the ALJ was entitled to find that her ability to feed and care for children contradicted Dr. Truhn\u2019s assessment that she was \u201cmarkedly limited\u201d in her ability to perform even one step tasks. For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">An ALJ can reject the opinion of a lay witness, such as therapist Kristin Bezdek, for reasons \u201cgermane\u201d to the witness. <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511 (9th Cir.2001). In so far as Bezdek opined that Bailey was incapable of working due to her anxiety and bipolar disorders, Bezdek\u2019s opinion was inconsistent with that of other medical professionals. Dr. Dean, Dr. Ballew, and Dr. Hennings never reported that Bailey was so impaired by her anxiety that she would be unable to work; in fact, Dr. Dean noted, without reservation, that Bailey was attempting to find employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the ALJ also did not err in rejecting Bezdek\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Our case law allows an ALJ to reject a claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of her symptoms if the claimant has made prior inconsistent statements to medical sources concerning her symptoms. <em>See Smolen v. Chafer, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ correctly noted that Bailey had previously given Dr. Truhn \u201cinaccurate and misleading\u201d information. For instance, when describing the severity of her manic episodes, Bailey told Dr. Truhn that her behavior was once so disrupted that she went 27 days without sleep or food. Moreover, the ALJ properly rejected Bailey\u2019s testimony because her claim that she could not perform even simple tasks was contradicted by the fact that, at the time of her testimony, Bailey was taking care of her daughter\u2019s children and of the house in exchange for room and board. <em>See id.; Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595, 600 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Because the ALJ was not obligated to accept either Dr. Truhn\u2019s opinion, or Bailey\u2019s testimony, his hypothetical to the vocational expert did set out all the relevant limitations and was thus, not in error. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 756 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The district court properly affirmed the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">. The dissent states that this report does not provide evidence that Bailey would have been able to sustain employment because she lasted less than a month at her \"most recent job\u201d due to a manic episode. Citing Bailey\u2019s experience at Albertson's Deli is unconvincing, however. First, the only evidence that Bailey actually suffered a manic episode is her own testimony, and for reasons discussed below, the ALJ was entitled to discredit Bailey\u2019s testimony. Second, this \"recent job\u201d occurred in either 1994 or 1995, five years prior to Dr. Dean's report and thus, is about as relevant to our current inquiry as Bailey's four-year tenure as a gas station employee in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-7\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">REINHARDT, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Among the numerous physicians and other mental health professionals who have come into contact with Jesse Bailey, there is no disagreement that she has a severe bipolar disorder as well as other mental health illnesses. Even the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) admits that Bailey will probably never work in the formal economy. Nonetheless, he found that Bailey was not disabled under the Social Security Act. For the following reasons, I disagree and would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">In contrast to the majority, I believe that the ALJ failed to provide legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence for rejecting the opinion of Dr. David Truhn, the clinical psychologist who examined Bailey in May 2000. The ALJ\u2019s primary reason for discrediting Dr. Truhn was that his findings contradicted those of Dr. Adrian Dean, the physician who had treated Bailey earlier. However, both doctors scored Bailey similarly on the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, which indicates that they agreed that her psychological and occupational impairments were serious. Although Dr. Truhn\u2019s diagnosis reflected greater impairments than Dr. Dean identified, his evaluation was substantially more thorough than Dr. Dean\u2019s. In my view, it is not legitimate for an ALJ to reject the opinion of an examining doctor who administers a more comprehensive battery of psychological tests than did the treating doctor simply because the treating doctor who saw the patient only four times and failed to perform the extensive tests performed by the examining doctor did not learn as much about the patient\u2019s disability as did his more thorough and careful colleague.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">Nor did the ALJ\u2019s speculation that Dr. Truhn had been misled by Bailey\u2019s account of her personal history constitute a proper ground for rejecting his evaluation. Even though Dr. Truhn did not have access to Bailey\u2019s complete medical records, he did not accept her account at face value. Instead, he administered thorough, sophisticated tests, and on that basis, concluded, like Bailey\u2019s other doctors, that her skewed account revealed the extent to which her sense of reality was impaired by her mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The record also belies the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. Truhn underestimated Bailey\u2019s functional capabilities. The ALJ\u2019s finding that Bailey engaged in an \u201cextensive, demanding range of activities\u201d is not supported by substantial evidence. Unlike the claimant in <em>Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595, 600-03 (9th Cir.1999), Bailey never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>assumed full-fledged child-eare responsibilities. Not only was another adult always in the house to resolve any problems that might arise, but Bailey did little more than turn on the TV, ensure that her grandchildren were fed, and alert the other adult to any such problems. Also, Bailey performed a much narrower range of functions than Morgan whose duties extended as far as yard-work.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Dr. Truhn\u2019s assessment is further supported by the testimony of Kristin Bezdek, the therapist who began treating Bailey in June 2000. Although a therapist\u2019s opinion is not accorded as much weight as a physician\u2019s, <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 511 (9th Cir.2001), in this case the ALJ\u2019s discrediting of Bezdek\u2019s testimony followed logically, albeit erroneously, from his rejection of Dr. Truhn\u2019s evaluation. Contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding, Bezdek\u2019s testimony was not inconsistent with her clinical entries in Bailey\u2019s records. Bezdek\u2019s notes, as well as the reports from Zola Yates, a nurse practitioner who also treated Bailey in 2000-2001, indicated that the claimant\u2019s condition waxed and waned\u2014 even when she was taking medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The ALJ\u2019s other primary reason for rejecting Bezdek\u2019s testimony was that her explanation for why Bailey failed to complete the Confidence Clinic at the Douglas County, Oregon Mental Health Center was contradicted by Charity McSpirit, the program\u2019s coordinator. Here, the ALJ clearly misinterpreted MeSpirit\u2019s testimony. Bezdek and McSpirit agreed that Bailey\u2019s anxiety prevented her from completing the Confidence Clinic\u2019s skill-building curriculum in a classroom setting. That Bailey was suffering from \u201cstressors\u201d at the time adds nothing, as an individual with anxiety problems like Bailey\u2019s will almost inevitably suffer from stressors of one kind or another.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The ALJ\u2019s misinterpretation of MeSpirit\u2019s testimony is also significant because the Confidence Clinic was designed as a precursor to vocational training and rehabilitation. Whatever limited tasks Bailey performed at home, her difficulties in the Confidence Clinic indicate that she was not able to transfer these capabilities to a formal work setting. <em>Cf. Morgan, </em>169 F.3d at 600. Moreover, Bailey\u2019s failure in the Confidence Clinic occurred during a period when it is undisputed that she was taking medicine, contrary to the ALJ\u2019s finding that she was able to control her illnesses through proper medication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Having concluded that the ALJ failed to provide legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence for rejecting Dr. Truhn\u2019s evaluation or germane reasons for according little weight to Bezdek\u2019s testimony, I would credit their opinions as true. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995). Because the vocational expert opined on cross-examination that a claimant with the diagnosis that Dr. Truhn reported would be unable to perform any substantial gainful work in the national economy, I would conclude that Bailey is disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for an award of benefits. <em>See Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Schneider v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>223 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-11\">. Unlike the majority, I do not think that the reports of the two physicians who, at the government\u2019s request, reviewed Bailey\u2019s record support the ALJ's decision to discredit Dr. Truhn. Dr. Ballew\u2019s review occurred before Dr. Truhn\u2019s evaluation. Therefore, he was not able to analyze the battery of tests that Dr. Truhn conducted. Dr. Hennings\u2019s review did occur after Dr. Truhn\u2019s evaluation, but he gave no reason for any disagreement with Dr. Truhn and, in fact, did not even mention Dr. Truhn's evaluation in his report. Moreover, his opinion was conclusoiy, unsupported by clinical findings, and thus, deserves little weight. <em>See Matney v. Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">. I also disagree with the majority that Dr. Dean's report \"without reservation\u201d that Bailey was looking for work provides any evidence that she would have been able to sustain employment. To the contrary, Bailey lasted less than a month in her most recent job, at an Albertson's deli, before she experienced a manic episode and was hospitalized.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
