McAvoy, <em>Judge) </em>which, <em>inter alia, </em>dismissed his claim for state law negligence against certain officers of the New York State police department. We assume familiarity with the facts of this case and its procedural context.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">Green raises only one issue on appeal. Namely, he argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his state law negligence claim as barred by the statute of limitations. On the record before us, however, there is no indication at all that his negligence claim was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds. In fact, the court\u2019s May 8, 2002 judgment states that \u201c[a]t trial, the Court determined as a matter of law that plaintiff had not pled a state common law negligence claim.... \u201d There is no indication that the District Court\u2019s decision was based on the statute of limitations, and Green cites no evidence in the record to support this view. Green also fails to make any legal argument to support his claim and fails even to state the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>facts of his case that could possibly entitle him to relief. While this Court reads a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s papers liberally and \u201cinterpret[s] them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest,\u201d <em>Burgos v. Hopkins, 14 </em>F.3d 787, 790 (2d. Cir.1994), \u201cwe need not manufacture claims of error for an appellant proceeding <em>pro se. </em>\u201d <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 93 (2d Cir.1995). Indeed, Green\u2019s brief has offered us too little information from which a claim could possibly be discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED and the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal is hereby DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
