Reagan, a Tennessee prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing his post-judgment petition to amend his civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">On March 31, 2003, Reagan filed a complaint against Kelly Hull, former sheriff of Overton County, Tennessee; Donnie Mathenie, former administrator of the Overton County Jail (OCJ); and Julie Whorley, a nurse employed at the OCJ. Reagan alleged that on January 16, 2000, he was seriously injured in an automobile accident and hospitalized for treatment and rehabilitation. Reagan alleged that on March 30, 2000, during his hospitalization, he was arrested and transported to the OCJ. Relying upon the Eighth Amendntent, Reagan alleged that he was denied adequate medical care and treatment during his incarceration in the OCJ and that the defendants \u201cwere negligent and reckless in the care of the Plaintiff and thus causing the Plaintiff extreme pain and suffering.\u201d Reagan sought monetary relief only.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">The district court granted Reagan\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and summarily dismissed his complaint on April 2, 2003, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Reagan did not file a notice of appeal. Instead, on May 19, 2003, Reagan filed an \u201cAmended Petition,\u201d to add Michael Cox, M.D., and Overton County, Tennessee, as defendants. The district court dismissed Reagan\u2019s amended petition on June 16, 2003. Reagan filed a notice of appeal on July 14, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">This court dismissed Reagan\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s April 2, 2003 order dismissing his complaint because it was untimely. However, Reagan\u2019s timely appeal from the district court\u2019s June 16, 2003, order was allowed to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">We review the district court\u2019s disposition of an amended complaint for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Duggins v. Steak \u2018N Shake, Inc., </em>195 F.3d 828, 833-34 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Crawford v. Roane, </em>53 F.3d 750, 753 (6th Cir.1995). An abuse of discretion has been defined as \u201ca definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Logan v. Dayton Hudson Corp., </em>865 F.2d 789, 790 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Reagan\u2019s amended petition. Section 1915(e) re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>quires district courts to screen cases at the moment of filing and to sua sponte dismiss those that fail to state a claim for relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B); <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 612 (6th Cir. 1997). If a complaint satisfies the criteria set forth in \u00a7 1915(e) when filed, the district court is required to dismiss the complaint without affording the plaintiff an opportunity to amend it. <em>McGore, </em>114 F.3d at 612; <em>accord </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). The district court reviewed Reagan\u2019s complaint and determined that it failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Since Reagan\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for relief at the moment of filing, the dismissal of the complaint prior to amendment was appropriate. <em>See McGore, </em>114 F.3d at 612; <em>accord </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Even if Reagan\u2019s amended petition had been treated as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment, as he contends that it should have been, it was properly dismissed by the district court. Reagan\u2019s amended petition did not allege the existence of any of the grounds for relief specified in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(l)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
