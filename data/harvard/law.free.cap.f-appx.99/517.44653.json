Ghidoni (\u201cGhidoni\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that the Agreed Order between the parties released Hill County S.A., Ltd. (\u201cHCSA\u201d), Bexar Metropolitan Water District (\u201cBexar\u201d), and Trustee Johnny W. Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) from all liability, including prospective liability, arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings, in exchange for $10,000.00. We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b556-19\">During the course of a bankruptcy proceeding, Ghidoni, the debtor, entered into an Agreed Order with Thomas, the trustee, and the sole creditor Bexar. Bexar was the assignee of HCSA\u2019s claim. The October 24, 2002 Agreed Order first provided that HCSA and Bexar \u201chave agreed to accept, in full and final satisfaction of both the Secured Claim and the Administrative Expense Claim, the total sum of $493,500.00.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Apparently in return for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>this satisfaction, \u201cDonald E. Ghidoni has agreed <em>to release all parties </em>hereto from such claims as he may have <em>arising out of </em>the actions or conduct of those parties and/or their counsel <em>arising in this proceeding. </em>\u201d (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Pursuant to this Agreed Order the bankruptcy court entered an \u201cOrder Granting Trustee\u2019s Motion to Approve Final Settlement with Internal Revenue Service and Payment of Other Expenses of the Estate\u201d that stipulated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">Donald E. Ghidoni, for the consideration of $10,000.00, to be distributed by the Trustee, is deemed, upon payment by the Trustee of $10,000.00, to have fully and finally released Johnny W. Thomas, individually<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in his capacity as Trustee for the Estate of Donald E. Ghidoni, Morgan &amp; Luttrell, L.L.P., Hill County S.A., Ltd. and Bexar Metropolitan Water District of and from <em>any and all claims, or causes of action of whatever kind or nature </em>which Mr. Ghidoni may have, <em>whether known or unknown, which have arisen or which may arise hereafter from or as a result of the pendency of the instant bankruptcy proceeding.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">(emphases added). This April 2, 2008 order ostensibly enforced the October 24, 2002 Agreed Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u2018We review the decision of the district court by applying the same standards of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.\u201d <em>In re Crowell, </em>138 F.3d 1031, 1033 (5th Cir.1998). Findings of fact by the bankruptcy court are reviewed for clear error, while conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. In re Howe, </em>913 F.2d 1138, 1142 n. 1 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">Ghidoni argues that he could not have released Thomas, HCSA and Bexar from future liability. In point of fact, however, \u201c[p]arties may contract to release future liability unless the agreement is unconstitutional, violates statutory law, or is against public policy.\u201d <em>Allright, Inc. v. Elledge, </em>515 S.W.2d 266, 267 (Tex.1974). The release in question is not violative of the Constitution, statutory law, or public policy. The issue is therefore whether the parties intended the release to apply prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">Nothing in the language of the release \u2014 an agreement \u201cto release all parties ... from such claims ... arising in this proceeding\u201d \u2014 indicates an intent to limit the release\u2019s application to events which occurred prior to the signing of the release. We therefore hold that the Agreed Order does release Thomas, HCSA and Bexar from future liability arising out of the bankruptcy proceeding, and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">Ghidoni next asserts that he did not release the other parties from liability in exchange for $10,000.00. The Agreed Order mentions no such sum, he argues, and the bankruptcy court erred in modifying the release in its April 2, 2003 order. Thomas, HCSA and Bexar, on the other hand, maintain that the parties only signed the Agreed Order based upon representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tions at the hearing that all claims against them would be released in exchange for payment of $10,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Thomas, HCSA, and Bexar are literally correct, in that the transcript of the hearing held prior to entry of the Agreed Order does report discussions between the parties with respect to the release and the payment of $10,000.00. However, nothing in the Agreed Order incorporates this hearing, by reference or otherwise. Under the basic rules of contract<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interpretation, the four corners of the contract control, <em>J.M. Krupar Construction Co. v. Rosenberg, </em>95 S.W.3d 322, 334 (TexApp. 2002), unless the contract is deemed ambiguous, <em>Clear Lake City Water Authority v. Kirby Lake Development, Ltd., </em>123 S.W.3d 735, 744 (Tex.App.2003). \u201cOnly when a contract is first determined to be ambiguous may the courts consider the parties\u2019 interpretation and admit extraneous evidence to determine the true meaning of the instrument.\u201d <em>Clear Lake City Water Authority, </em>123 S.W.3d at 744. Because the Agreed Order unambiguously states that Ghidoni releases the parties from claims arising out of the bankruptcy proceeding in exchange for no specified amount,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> this is the interpretation that must control. The bankruptcy court erred in entering its April 2, 2003 order to the extent that it held the release was contingent upon the payment of $10,000.00. We reverse the ruling of the district court on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Ghidoni requests, as relief, that this Court reform the Agreed Order by striking the April 2, 2003 order\u2019s release language in its entirety and replacing the language referring to \u201cthe sum of $10,000.00\u201d with \u201call remaining cash and assets of the Estate.\u201d Because we have determined that the April 2, 2003 Order released Thomas, HCSA, and Bexar from any claims arising out of the bankruptcy action as was contemplated by the Agreed Order, we decline to strike that language. And although we agree with Ghidoni that the Agreed Order did not contemplate the payment of $10,000.00 in exchange for this release, we decline to reform the April 2, 2003 order in the manner he requests. Just as nothing in the four corners of the Agreed Order stipulates the payment of $10,000.00, nothing in the four corners of the Agreed Order refers to \u201call remaining cash and assets of the Estate.\u201d The Agreed Order does not address what happens to any remaining assets of the Estate after satisfaction of the claims of the creditors. We therefore rem and this case for a determination of the status of any remaining assets of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Ghidoni did release Thomas, HCSA, and Bexar from claims arising out of the bankruptcy proceeding. To the extent that the April 2, 2003 order embodies this release, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The release was not, however, in exchange for $10,000.00. To the extent that the April 2, 2003 order contemplates this exchange, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">The Agreed Order did not address the disposition of any assets of the Estate that remained after the creditors were satisfied. This case is REMANDED with instructions to REMAND to the bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>court for resolution of this issue and further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\">. In a footnote to this provision of the Agreed Order the parties further agreed that [t]o the extent that the capital gains tax liability of the Estate is reduced by the Internal Revenue Service to an amount that results in funds available for distribution by the Estate, the funds shall be used first to pay the Secured Claim of Hill Country S.A., Ltd. Up to the amount of $513,000.00. Any funds thereafter available shall be used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>pay any allowed but unpaid expenses of administration and thereafter shall be payable to the Debtor, Donald E. Ghidoni.</p>\n<p id=\"AVAv\">Although this footnote was in contention at the district court, the parties have not appealed the court\u2019s ruling on this matter. The footnote is not relevant to this portion of the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-17\">. The district court struck the release with respect to Thomas in his individual capacity, and neither party has appealed that ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. Because both parties concur that the Agreed Order is a contract, we assume without deciding that it should be treated as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\">. There was, however, consideration for the release. Ghidoni retained the right to sue a third party for malpractice, a right relinquished by Thomas, HCSA, and Bexar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
