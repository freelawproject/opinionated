Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">In October 1998, a jury convicted Martinez of the capital murder of Kiersa Paul while attempting to commit or committing robbery or aggravated sexual assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the punishment phase of the trial, the defense and prosecution presented witnesses regarding Martinez\u2019s character, past experiences, and future dangerousness. The prosecution also offered the testimony of an expert, Dr. Ferrara, who used the Hare Psychopathy Checklist to argue that Martinez posed a future danger to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">The jury expressly found (1) that a probability existed that Martinez would commit future criminal acts of violence and would represent a continuing threat to society; and (2) that no sufficient mitigating circumstances existed to justify a life sentence rather than the death penalty. Consequently, the court sentenced Martinez to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">Martinez unsuccessfully challenged his conviction and sentence through a direct appeal and through a state habeas petition. He filed a federal habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied relief on all seven issues Martinez raised but issued a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-18\">(1) whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to prepare for and adequately argue the results of the Hare Psychopathy Tests should be excluded, or adequately impeach the State\u2019s ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>pert on this issue; (2) whether the petitioner\u2019s due process rights were violated with the admission of the Hare Psychopathy Tests; (3) whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to investigate and present evidence of the substantial abuse suffered by the petitioner at the hands of his mother, father, and his father\u2019s sado-masochistic homosexual lover; and (4) whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorneys failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence as well as employ and prepare defense experts and cross-examine the State\u2019s experts in such a manner as to provide the jury a true and correct picture of the petitioner\u2019s future dangerousness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The four grounds do not concern the validity of the verdict but only address questions surrounding the punishment phase of the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court did not err in denying Martinez\u2019s habeas petition on these four matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u201cIn a habeas corpus appeal, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards to the state court\u2019s decision as did the district court.\u201d <em>Busby v. Dretke, </em>359 F.3d 708, 713 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Martinez v. Johnson, </em>255 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir.2001)). \u201c[W]e must defer to the state habeas court unless its decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019.... \u201d <em>Haynes v. Cain, </em>298 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.) (en banc) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1072, 123 S.Ct. 676, 154 L.Ed.2d 567 (2002). Additionally, \u201c[fjactual determinations by state courts are presumed correct absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 339, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Three of the questions on which the district court granted a COA center on the effectiveness of Martinez\u2019s appointed trial counsel. More specifically, they question counsel\u2019s constitutional effectiveness in investigating three separate matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a defendant \u201cmust show that his counsel\u2019s assistance was deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced him.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Cockrell, </em>325 F.3d 579, 586 (5th Cir.) (citing <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 430, 157 L.Ed.2d 314 (2003). \u201cTo establish deficient performance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation Tell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 2535, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052). If counsel performed deficiently, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Haynes, </em>298 F.3d at 380 (quoting <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). With respect to investigations, we do not focus on the purported matters the counsel should have found or on the final decision to pursue a particular course but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>rather \u201cwhether the investigation supporting [a particular] decision ... <em>was itself reasonable.\u201d Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at-, 123 S.Ct. at 2536 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Martinez\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> did not act in an objectively deficient manner or below an objective standard of reasonableness. Rather, counsel thoroughly investigated and interviewed a variety of witnesses as part of their effort to spare their client from the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">First, Martinez maintains that his counsel did not adequately prepare themselves and did not sufficiently argue to exclude the Hare Psychopathy Test, which measures behavior based on twenty characteristics to determine whether the subject meets that test\u2019s definition of a psychopath. Upon learning that Ferrara intended to use the Hare Test in his testimony, defense counsel objected and obtained a delay in the punishment phase so as to investigate and challenge<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the validity of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">During the three days in which the court stayed its proceedings, counsel contacted their experts and located ample reference materials with which to cross-examine Ferrara. The challenge to the test and the cross-examination of Ferrara lasted half a day. Although the challenge did not succeed, counsel prepared so well that the trial judge complimented them on their efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-15\">The attorneys\u2019 efforts did not fall below any standard of reasonableness. Instead, when faced with an adverse clinical test, the attorneys responded as well as could any reasonably competent attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Once the court allowed the jury to consider the Hare Test, the attorneys introduced evidence to argue that Martinez\u2019s propensity for violence would decrease over time and that a life sentence would ensure that he would no longer endanger society. Such an approach allowed Martinez to challenge the test, to respond to the graphic evidence, and to offer a plausible reason not to order the death penalty. Martinez\u2019s counsel did not act in an objectively unreasonable manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-16\">Secondly, Martinez challenges his attorneys\u2019 investigation and presentation of alleged abuse that occurred at the hands of Martinez\u2019s parents and his father\u2019s sado-masochistic lover. Martinez offers that a more thorough investigation would have uncovered witnesses who would have more affirmatively testified as to the abuse that Martinez suffered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>As the district court discussed and as the state habeas court noted, defense trial counsel introduced evidence to indicate that Martinez suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his mother.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The counsel, for strategic reasons, chose not to attack the mother directly while on the stand.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of the fact that \u201c[w]e will not find inadequate representation merely because, with the benefit of hindsight, we disagree with counsel\u2019s strategic choices,\u201d Martinez\u2019s trial counsel did not perform below any objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Green v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 1115, 1122 (5th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">With respect to alleged abuse from the father and his sado-masochistic lover, various witnesses gave differing accounts of what took place in Martinez\u2019s home.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defense witnesses suggested that something changed after Martinez\u2019s father became involved with a new partner who had an interest in sado-masochism. John Reynolds, Martinez\u2019s father\u2019s prior partner, indicated that Martinez and the father dressed and acted \u201cweirder\u201d after the change in partners. Petitioner asserts that Jessica Scott, Mary Ellen Felps, and William Zachary would have testified that Martinez suffered abuse at the hands of his father and his father\u2019s partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">The evidence available for trial, however, did not establish exactly what took place in Martinez\u2019s father\u2019s home. Martinez\u2019s counsel could not reach Martinez\u2019s father and failed in serving an out-of-state subpoena on him. Additionally, Martinez gave contradictory statements to various people regarding possible abuse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because Martinez\u2019s trial counsel could not compel Martinez\u2019s father to testify, and because scant direct evidence existed to support the claim of sexual abuse, the attorneys had to make a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Given the mixture of available evidence, Martinez\u2019s attorneys adopted an approach that emphasized the difficult circumstances that Martinez faced but did not highlight possible sexual abuse. Trial counsel described their strategy in an affidavit they provided to the state habeas court: \u201cDavid Martinez had good relationships with his mother, his friends, his teachers[,] was mistreated by his mother, and ... he had difficulty because his father was in an openly homosexual relationship and in the business of making homosexual sex toys.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The attorneys attempted to use Felps\u2019s testimony to suggest that the parents abused Martinez, but they could not \u201csubstantiate any sexual activity between David and David\u2019s father or David\u2019s father\u2019s lover, Evan.\u201d Again, an unsuccessful strategy does not necessarily indicate constitutionally deficient counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Thirdly, Martinez asserts that his trial counsel failed to investigate and prepare witnesses to present sufficient mitigating evidence so as to give a more favorable image of Martinez\u2019s future dangerousness. Martinez offers a number of witnesses, including those listed previously, who allegedly would have offered more mitigating information. Felps indicates that greater preparation on the part of the defense attorneys would have enabled her to testify in a more composed manner and to connect with the jury. Felps also wishes that she could have testified more directly as to possible abuse from Martinez\u2019s father. William Zachary allegedly would have undermined some of the testimony of Sarah Yoder, a prosecution witness.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Counsel\u2019s failure to offer these individuals\u2019 and any other parties\u2019 testimony did not render their performance deficient. Trial counsel presented numerous witnesses who testified to Martinez\u2019s positive character traits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although Felps wished that she could have given a more persuasive form of testimony, the district court correctly noted that she had the opportunity to present the testimony that she now wishes she had given.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Though Zachary\u2019s testimony might have undermined Yoder\u2019s statements to some degree, it would not have contradicted the knife incident or any specific incident in which Martinez might have engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Thus, Martinez\u2019s trial attorneys did not perform in a manner that fell below any objective standard of reasonableness. They conducted investigations and located numerous witnesses to help their client avoid the death penalty. In the course of the punishment phase, they had to make strategic decisions based on the available evidence and on the predicted effect a certain approach might have on the jury. Martinez has not satisfied the first prong of <em>Washington. </em>Thus, his claims with respect to the first, third, and fourth issues on which he requested a COA are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Martinez asserts that the introduction of the Hare Psychopathy Test violated his due process rights. As we have indicated, the test considers twenty factors in determining whether a person meets the definition of a psychopath. Ferrara testified on behalf of the prosecution and concluded that Martinez was a psychopath. Although Martinez\u2019s counsel challenged the validity of the test in front of the jury, the court allowed the jury to consider it in its punishment determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Martinez argues that the test has significant weaknesses and inadequacies and that Ferrara did not follow the test\u2019s actual procedures. We agree with the district court that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the test did not violate \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). The test itself does not involve any constitutionally suspect factors such as race or ethnicity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The jury had the opportunity to listen to defense counsel\u2019s articulation of the test\u2019s weaknesses and to the cross-examination of Ferrara. Because the jury considered a number of pieces of evidence regarding Martinez\u2019s future dangerousness, and because Martinez\u2019s counsel challenged the merits of the Hare Test\u2019s procedures, the court did not violate Martinez\u2019s due process rights by allowing the test and Ferrara\u2019s testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The judgment denying habeas relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\">. A jogger found Paul\u2019s body along a trail. Paul told her sister the previous night that she intended to meet an individual named Wolf at that location. Her body was covered only by a pair of unbuttoned boxer shorts, and her legs were spread open. Further investigation revealed injuries consistent with strangulation, blunt force injury to the head and nose, gouge marks on the neck, bruising of both nipples, cuts on her neck, breast, and stomach, and forceful sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">Martinez, whose nickname was \"Wolf,\u201d told friends that he intended to meet a girl that evening along the trail. He returned to his friends\u2019 house with a bicycle he did not own. After executing a search warrant, the police determined that Martinez possessed Paul's bicycle and bicycle bag. They also seized a Swiss army pocketknife owned by Martinez. Forensic tests determined that hairs found on Paul were consistent with Martinez\u2019s hair and that Martinez\u2019s pocketknife contained blood that matched Paul\u2019s DNA. Semen collected from Paul\u2019s underwear matched Martinez's DNA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-20\">. Section 2253(c)(1) states that a party may not appeal \"the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court\u201d unless a circuit justice or judge issues a COA. Section 2253(c)(2) notes that a COA can issue \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. Martinez has not appealed the denial of any other grounds for a COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\">. Different appointed counsel represented Martinez in his trial and in his habeas proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\">. The challenge followed the approach of <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-12\">. Our review of the record causes us to agree with the assessment of the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-13\">There is no evidence that Martinez\u2019s attorneys performed objectively unreasonably under the <em>[Washington] </em>standard. To the contrary, Martinez\u2019s counsel timely objected to Dr. Ferrara\u2019s testimony and articulated several reasons for their objections. Their repeated and fervent objections persuaded the trial judge to continue the trial from a Thursday to a Monday morning, even though the judge stated he wanted to move the trial along. During this continuance, the attorneys consulted with their experts and collected materials regarding the Hare test and prepared a respectable cross-examination of Dr. Ferrara during the <em>Daubert </em>hearing and in the presence of the jury. They also submitted expert testimony that Martinez was not at risk for future dangerousness because his propensity for violence will decrease over time. Over all, Martinez\u2019s attorneys responded to the Hare testimony in a professional reasonable manner.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b579-18\">. Martinez proffers that Jessica Scott, a high school friend, would have testified that Martinez was being pushed to engage in sexual acts with his father and the sado-masochistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>lover. Scott also would have testified, at the punishment phase, that she learned that Martinez's father sexually abused Martinez.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b580-6\">. Mary Felps, a social worker who visited Martinez's childhood home, testified that the home smelled, was covered with bird feces, and was one of the worst homes she had seen. She indicated that she believed the mother abused and neglected Martinez. Laura Walker, Martinez's probation officer for an earlier offense, testified that Martinez moved into his father\u2019s home because his mother had physically and emotionally abused him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">. In quoting an affidavit from Martinez\u2019s trial counsel, the district court noted that \"[w]hile the defense called Martinez\u2019s mother to the stand 'to give the jurors an idea of what kind of person she was,\u2019 'for strategic reasons, [they] did not try to annihilate her.' \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b580-14\">. <em>See also Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 701, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\"Counsel\u2019s strategy choice was well within the range of professionally reasonable judgments, and the decision not to seek more character or psychological evidence than was already in hand was likewise reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b580-15\">. During the time Martinez lived with his father, the father changed partners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\">. Although Martinez told his probation officer that his mother had abused him, he denied any abuse at the hands of his father. When Martinez met with another psychiatrist while awaiting the capital trial, he denied that any abuse from either parent had occurred. Additionally, Martinez told Felps that he loved his father and that nothing was wrong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. Yoder testified that Martinez often forced her into uncomfortable and unwanted sexual situations and that Martinez once held a hunting knife to her throat.

As the district court stated, \"Thus, while in the perfect trial, Felps might have been more prepared, she did have the opportunity at trial to give the testimony she now states she wishes she would have given, and in fact did give some of that testimony.
