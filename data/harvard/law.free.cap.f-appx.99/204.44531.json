ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">Following the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, Ray C. Payne entered a conditional plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). As permitted by the terms of his plea agreement, Mr. Payne now appeals the district court\u2019s order denying suppression of the gun he dropped while being pursued by police. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b243-19\">At approximately 10 p.m. on September 24, 2002, Officers Beard and Harty of the Wichita Police Department\u2019s gang unit observed Payne as he was stopped at a stop sign in a blue Oldsmobile. The officers testified that they became suspicious because of the way Payne stared at them as they passed his car. They therefore turned their car around intending to check the Oldsmobile\u2019s license plate. Meanwhile, Payne had continued driving and, according to the officers\u2019 testimony, turned right without signaling. The officers then intended to stop Payne\u2019s vehicle, but they were still some distance behind him. As they continued following the Oldsmobile, they saw it turn into the driveway of a house and stop. The house was later determined to belong to Payne\u2019s cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-20\">The officers also pulled into the driveway and parked directly behind the Oldsmobile. They saw Payne had exited the vehicle and was then approximately five feet away from it, approaching the house. Both officers, who were wearing gang unit attire consisting of black clothing with the word \u201cPOLICE\u201d in large white letters on the front and back, got out of their car and yelled at Payne to stop. Payne continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>walking toward the house. Following, Officer Beard again yelled stop. Payne turned and looked directly at the officer, then began running towards the house\u2019s backyard. While Officer Harty remained on the street, Officer Beard, holding his weapon in the \u201clow ready\u201d position, pursued Payne into the backyard. During the next six seconds, according to Officer Beard\u2019s testimony, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aco\">[Payne]\u2019s running, he\u2019s reaching into his waistband as he\u2019s going along. Right now I\u2019m still at the low ready position. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 ready to come up, keep giving him verbal commands to stop, police. As he\u2019s turning, from what I can see is he turns (witness indicating) he\u2019s now pulled out a stainless steel colored handgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">.... It was definitely in his right hand and he had pulled it out as he is kind of caught in the wires [of a clothesline], pulls it out and he starts to come this way towards me. But I had shown the flashlight towards his eyes and I think he just threw it on the ground at that point. Never actually came all the way up or pointed it directly at me; but it was in this kind of a motion (witness indicating) and he just kind of throws it down and takes off again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Hr\u2019g Tr. at 38-39, R. Vol. II. On cross-examination, Officer Beard repeated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">Like I said, it\u2019s all one motion. As he\u2019s running this way, he starts to fall into the clothesline. The clothesline is \u2014 like he is trying to duck underneath. I saw he is getting caught, then he is trying to get down underneath here and going like this. The gun comes out like this and then he throws it down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 55. According to Officer Beard, Payne never came to a complete stop while discarding the gun. Payne testified, to the contrary, that when he heard Officer Beard order him to stop in the backyard, \u201cI stopped, looked over my shoulder ... and I turned around and faced him and then threw the firearm down.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Payne then jumped over the backyard fence and fled. Several hours later, Payne was found hiding in the vicinity and was arrested. Meanwhile, the police recovered a Sterling Arms Mark #2, .380 caliber semiautomatic handgun from the spot where Officer Beard saw Payne drop the gun. After Payne\u2019s prior felony conviction was discovered, he was charged by indictment with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Payne sought to suppress the gun as evidence, claiming its recovery resulted from a Fourth Amendment violation. Specifically, Payne contested the police officers\u2019 claim that he had failed to use his turn signal and argued that even assuming he had committed a traffic infraction, the police were not justified in pursuing him onto private property or in detaining him in the backyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">In denying Payne\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court concluded that Payne \u201cnever submitted to the officers\u2019 authority\u201d during the initial backyard pursuit, and held that Payne therefore \u201cwas not seized, let alone subjected to a custodial arrest, until he was discovered hiding several hours later.\u201d Mem. and Order at 5, R. Yol. I, tab 21. The district court further held that the officers had sufficient justification to initiate a traffic stop, based on their observed turn signal violation, and that their subsequent actions were reasonable under the circumstances as they developed. The court concluded that Payne dropped the gun in the backyard \u201cdeliberately ... in an admitted effort to keep it from being discovered on his person,\u201d and thus \u201cretained no reasonable expectation of privacy in the [gun].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The court held that the gun was thus voluntari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ly abandoned and properly subject to seizure at the time it was recovered by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">After entering a conditional guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement, Payne was sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. He then brought this appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Flynn, </em>309 F.3d 736, 738 (10th Cir.2002). Where a search or seizure has occurred, we review de novo the ultimate question of whether it was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Here, as indicated above, the district court held that the police\u2019s seizure of the gun was reasonable because Payne voluntarily abandoned the gun in his cousin\u2019s backyard. We consider property to be abandoned, and thus subject to warrant-less seizure, when the person discarding the property retains no reasonable expectation of privacy in it. <em>Id. </em>In order for the seizure of the property to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, however, the abandonment must have been voluntary. <em>Id. </em>We hold an abandonment involuntary as a matter of law if it occurs \u201cas a consequence of illegal police conduct.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Garzon, </em>119 F.3d 1446, 1451 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cA defendant cannot be deemed ... to have abandoned his or her property merely by refusing to comply with [a police officer\u2019s] unlawful order.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>7 F.3d 944, 947 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A]n abandonment is not voluntary when it results from a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Payne argues that his abandonment of the gun was involuntary on the basis that it resulted from a prior Fourth Amendment violation \u2014 an unreasonable seizure of his person by Officer Beard. As noted above, however, the district court held, and the government continues to argue, that Payne was not seized at the time he dropped the gun. We must therefore resolve the initial question of whether Payne was seized at all before considering whether such a seizure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Whether a seizure has occurred is an issue of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. McKneely, </em>6 F.3d 1447, 1451 (10th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Wood, </em>981 F.2d 536, 538 (D.C.Cir. 1992). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991), we have held that \u201c[u]ltimately, a seizure requires either the use of physical force by the police officer or submission by the individual to the police officer\u2019s assertion of authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>313 F.3d 1228, 1234 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Here, Payne\u2019s claim that he did submit to Officer Beard\u2019s show of authority rests on his factual assertion that he came to a halt in response to Officer Beard\u2019s order and stood facing the officer at the moment he discarded the gun. However, Officer Beard\u2019s testimony contradicted this assertion, indicating that Payne discarded the gun while simultaneously disengaging himself from a backyard clothesline and continuing his flight. The district court clearly credited the officer\u2019s testimony, finding that Payne discarded his weapon \u201cin the middle of a police chase,\u201d Mem. and Order at 8, R. Vol. I, tab 21, having \u201cr[u]n from the officers almost immediately after being confronted\u201d by them, and \u201cnever submitted to the officers\u2019 authority\u201d until his later arrest, <em>id. </em>at 5. We cannot consider the court\u2019s findings clearly erroneous. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>we hold that Payne was not seized when he abandoned the gun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Payne also argues that the police violated the Fourth Amendment by entering his cousin\u2019s backyard to pursue him without a search warrant. Payne refers to <em>Welsh v. Wisconsin, </em>466 U.S. 740, 104 S.Ct. 2091, 80 L.Ed.2d 732 (1984), for the proposition that only exigent circumstances could justify such a warrantless entry. In <em>Welsh, </em>the Supreme Court held that police could not enter a suspect\u2019s own home without a warrant based solely on his suspected violation of a noncriminal, civil forfeiture offense. <em>Id. </em>at 754, 104 S.Ct. 2091.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">However, <em>Welsh </em>is inapplicable here where the relevant police entry was not into Payne\u2019s home but into Payne\u2019s cousin\u2019s backyard. Although Payne repeatedly states that \u201che had [his cousin\u2019s] consent\u201d to be on her property, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12, the Supreme Court has explained that \u201can overnight guest in a home may claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment, but one who is merely present with the consent of the householder may not.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Carter, </em>525 U.S. 83, 90, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Gordon, </em>168 F.3d 1222, 1225-26 (10th Cir.1999). The relevant inquiry is whether the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises searched. <em>Id. </em>While the district court did not rule on this issue, the record is clear that while Payne was a frequent visitor at his cousin\u2019s house, he was not an overnight guest. Moreover, as the government points out, Payne has failed to demonstrate any other basis on which he might have had any reasonable expectation of privacy in his cousin\u2019s backyard that would allow him to challenge the police\u2019s entry on Fourth Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Thus, we conclude that no prior Fourth Amendment violation rendered Payne\u2019s abandonment of the gun involuntary. Nor is there any indication that the police officers\u2019 conduct was otherwise unlawful. We therefore hold that Payne voluntarily abandoned the gun, and the district court properly denied his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\">. As indicated above, the district court, having concluded that no seizure occurred, proceeded with a <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), traffic stop analysis, considering whether the \"initial stop was proper\u201d and \"whether the officers\u2019 subsequent actions exceeded the scope of the initial stop.\u201d Mem. and Order at 6-7, R. Vol. I, tab 21. Such an analysis is unnecessary here, as without a \"seizure,\u201d there was no traffic stop, and thus no possibility of a traffic stop-related Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 627, 111 S.Ct. 1547 (\"Since policemen do not command \"Stop!\u201d expecting to be ignored, or give chase hoping to be outrun, it fully suffices [as a deterrent] to apply the [exclusionary rule] to their genuine, successful seizures.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
