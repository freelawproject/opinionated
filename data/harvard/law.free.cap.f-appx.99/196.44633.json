R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Appellant Emmett R. Duncan, a federal prisoner represented by counsel, pled guilty to using, carrying or possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and two counts of forcible assault and interference of an officer engaged in official duties, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111(a)(1) and (b). The district court sentenced Mr. Duncan to sixty-months imprisonment on the firearm count, to run consecutively with forty-six months imprisonment for the assault counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">While Mr. Duncan has filed a timely notice of appeal, his counsel has filed an appeal brief, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that, in her opinion, no meritorious appellate issues exist and requesting an order permitting her to withdraw as Mr. Duncan\u2019s counsel. Consistent with the dictates of <em>Anders, </em>counsel has nevertheless pointed out two sentencing issues to support an appeal, namely, asserting the district court erred when it 1) applied United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2A2.2 for aggravated assault to determine his offense level, and 2) declined to reduce his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 for reduced mental capacity. Although the holding in <em>Anders </em>entitles a defendant to raise additional points in response to an <em>Anders </em>brief and such opportunity was given in this case, Mr. Duncan made no such filing. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744. We affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">The relevant facts for the purpose of addressing the two sentencing issues presented on appeal follow. Mr. Duncan participated in an armed break-in of a home located on the Ute Reservation and remained at large for approximately three months until a Utah Highway Patrol trooper stopped the vehicle in which he was riding. The trooper called for backup from officers from the Roosevelt Police Department who, in turn, called for officers from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to assist. At one point, after the passengers exited the vehicle, they were given the option of getting back into the vehicle to stay warm; at this time, Mr. Duncan returned to the vehicle and sat in the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">After Bureau of Indian Affairs Officer Myore arrived and identified Mr. Duncan, for whom an outstanding arrest warrant was pending, Officer Myore placed him under arrest and ordered him to exit the vehicle, which he refused to do. Officer Myore and Roosevelt Police Officer Denver then leaned into the vehicle to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>him. While Officer Myore was holding Mr. Duncan\u2019s left arm, Mr. Duncan grabbed Officer Denver\u2019s wrist and then sped off, injuring one officer, and dragging and injuring the other. During an ensuing high-speed police pursuit reaching speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, Mr. Duncan deliberately swerved his vehicle into a patrol car, and then lost control and rolled the vehicle he was driving. A passenger in the car driven by Mr. Duncan received serious injuries as a result of the rollover. Officers then arrested Mr. Duncan, who later pled guilty to carrying a firearm during the home break-in, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), and forcible assault and interference of two officers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Following the sentencing hearing, the district court found the vehicle used by Mr. Duncan constituted a dangerous weapon and that Mr. Duncan intended to use it to harm the officers involved in his arrest. Based on these findings, the district court concluded the offense category under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 for aggravated assault applied. In addition, the district court denied Mr. Duncan\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 for reduced mental capacity, determining him ineligible to receive such a departure because his conduct resulted in \u201cactual violence.\u201d Applying these and other Sentencing Guidelines, the district court imposed a sixty-month sentence for the firearm count and forty-six months imprisonment on the two assault counts, to run consecutively. In so doing, the district court noted the sixty-month sentence for the firearm count is the \u201cmandatory minimum term for armed home invasion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Application of United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2A2.2</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">When reviewing an application of the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201c[t]his court reviews the district court\u2019s legal conclusions under the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error, affording great deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Eaton, </em>260 F.3d 1232, 1237 (10th Cir.2001). This court \u201cwill not disturb a factual finding of the district court unless the court\u2019s finding was without factual support in the record, or if after reviewing all the evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>United States v. Easterling, </em>921 F.2d 1073, 1077 (10th Cir.1990) (quotation marks and citation omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>500 U.S. 937, 111 S.Ct. 2066, 114 L.Ed.2d 470 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Section 2A2.2, entitled \u201cAggravated Assault,\u201d sets the offense level for \u201cfelonious assault[s] that involved (A) a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily harm <em>(ie., </em>not merely to frighten) with that weapon; (B) serious bodily injury; or (C) an intent to commit another felony.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, cmt. n. 1. This section is disjunctive because \u201c[t]he plain language of this definition requires \u00a7 2A2.2 be applied if any of the three described situations exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Rue, </em>988 F.2d 94, 96 (10th Cir.1993). For the purposes of \u00a7 2A2.2, a car may be considered a \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d if it was involved in the offense with the intent to commit bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, cmt. n. 1. A car is clearly \u201can instrument capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>See United States v. Sherwin, </em>271 F.3d 1231, 1233-35 (10th Cir.2001) (determining patrol car door kicked by defendant into officer\u2019s knee-caps, upper legs and waist, constituted a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 2A2.2). In this case, the district court determined the car constituted a \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d and was both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>intended to and did cause bodily harm, for the purposes of both parts (A) and (B) of the commentary to \u00a7 2A2.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">On appeal, counsel for Mr. Duncan acknowledges \u00a7 2A2.2 is properly applied in calculating a sentence when bodily harm occurs. However, she points out that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4, entitled \u201cObstructing or Impeding Officers,\u201d is designed to encompass less severe conduct than \u00a7 2A2.2, and thereby, counsel seems to intimate it should be applied in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Unlike U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4 is only applicable \u201c[i]f the conduct involved physical contact, or if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed and its use was threatened.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4(b)(l). Thus, unlike \u00a7 2A2.2, \u00a7 2A2.4 does not mention injury or intent to cause bodily injury. <em>Compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4. Only \u00a7 2A2.2 is more clearly applicable when a serious bodily injury is sustained or an intent to do bodily harm is evidenced. Moreover, for more severe conduct, \u00a7 2A2.4 expressly provides a cross reference to \u00a7 2A2.2, in instances where \u201cthe conduct constituted aggravated assault.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In this case, the two police officers clearly sustained serious bodily injuries and the district court determined, after receiving healing evidence, that Mr. Duncan intended to harm the officers either by grabbing Officer Denver\u2019s wrist while he drove off dragging him, or when he aggressively drove into the police vehicle during the high-speed chase. Under the circumstances presented, and applying the applicable standard of review, we conclude the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2A2.2 in determining Mr. Duncan\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">B. Failure to Apply United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5K2.13</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Section 5K2.13 allows \u201c[a] sentence below the applicable guideline range\u201d if \u201c(1) the defendant committed the offense while suffering from a significantly reduced mental capacity; and (2) the significantly reduced mental capacity contributed substantially to the commission of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. However, this section does not apply in certain circumstances, including when the \u201cthe facts and circumstances of the defendant\u2019s offense indicate a need to protect the public because the offense involved <em>actual violence </em>or a serious threat of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We lack jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to apply \u00a7 5K2.13 and depart downward from the guidelines, absent a clear misunderstanding by the court of its discretion to depart. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>316 F.3d 1151, 1154 (10th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Busekros, </em>264 F.3d 1158, 1159 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">In this case, the district court found Mr. Duncan ineligible for a departure under \u00a7 5K2.13, because his offense conduct involved \u201cactual violence,\u201d including 1) speeding away which caused injuries to two officers, including one taken away in an ambulance, 2) operating a vehicle at speeds over 100 miles per hour during police pursuit to avoid arrest, and 3) crashing a car into a patrol car, which resulted in a rollover and injury to the passenger. In so holding, it is clear the district court was aware of its discretion to depart, but declined to do so given its determination Mr. Duncan was ineligible under \u00a7 5K2.13 because his conduct resulted in \u201cactual violence.\u201d Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s decision not to depart downward. Moreover, we note Mr. Duncan\u2019s counsel\u2019s acknowledgment that current law prohibits a \u00a7 5K2.13 departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>under the circumstances of Mr. Duncan\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">After careful review of the record on appeal, we conclude no grounds for appeal exist. We thereby grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
