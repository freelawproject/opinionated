See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<author id=\"b517-26\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b517-27\">Frank M. Neff seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>complaint, in which Neff alleged that the Maryland Division of Corrections miscalculated his release date. Neff raised this claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000). The district court denied relief based on Neffs failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">To the extent Neff appeals the denial of relief under \u00a7 2241, he may not do so unless a circuit judge or justice issues a certificate of appealability, and a certificate of appealability will not issue absent a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A habeas petitioner meets this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Neff has not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">To the extent that Neff appeals the denial of relief on his \u00a7 1983 claim, we find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
