We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence both the denial of asylum, <em>Malhi v. </em>INS, 336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003), and the denial of relief under the Convention, <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Asatryan testified that he was persecuted in Armenia because of his membership in the Seventh Day Adventist church. However, Asatryan submitted a document indicating that he was a member of the Armenian Evangelical Baptist Church, and then testified inconsistently about whether he was a member of that church. This inconsistency is substantial and goes to the heart of Asatryan\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that inconsistencies are not minor when they relate to the basis for petitioner\u2019s allege fear of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In addition, Asatryan testified that he returned to Armenia for a visit in December of 1998, and lived with his family until June of 1999, during which time he attended prayer meetings without incident. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that applicant\u2019s claim of persecution is undercut when applicant has returned to the home country without incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Asatryan did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">We do not address Asatryan\u2019s Convention claim because he failed to raise it in his opening brief to this court. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-17\"> The disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
