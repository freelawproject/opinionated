The Honorable Sidney H.

(\u201cTD Waterhouse\u201d), and its denial of his cross-motion for summary judgment. Chimarev originally filed this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>action in state court, alleging employment discrimination based on national origin as well as other claims related to his employment history with TD Waterhouse, which ended with his termination in 2001. We assume familiarity with the pleadings and the history of proceedings after removal of the case to federal court, including the detailed report of Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein recommending an award of summary judgment in favor of TD Waterhouse, and the opinion of District Judge Victor Marrero directing entry of the challenged award. See <em>Chimarev v. TD Waterhouse Investor Servs., Inc., </em>280 F.Supp.2d 208 (S.D.N.Y.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">1. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>See SCS Communications, Inc. v. Herrick Co., </em>360 F.3d 329, 338 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate only where \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). This is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">a. <em>Title VII Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Title VII prohibits an employer from \u201cdischarg[ing] any individual, or otherwise ... discriminat[ing] against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s ... national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l); see also <em>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., </em>534 U.S. 506, 509, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002). \u201cAs a precondition to filing a Title VII claim in federal court, a plaintiff must first pursue available administrative remedies and file a timely complaint with the EEOC.\u201d <em>Deravin v. Kerik, </em>335 F.3d 195, 200 (2d Cir.2003). This administrative exhaustion requirement also applies to retaliation claims, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), except where there is a related discrimination charge filed, <em>see Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 150-51 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Legnani v. Alitalia Linee Aeree Italiane, S.P.A, </em>274 F.3d 683, 686-87 (2d Cir.2001). Because Chimarev filed no complaint with any administrative agency, the district court correctly ruled that Chimarev was barred as a matter of law from suing under Title VII for discrimination, harassment, and retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">b. <em>Wage and Severance Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Chimarev does not dispute that on February 7, 2001, a TD Waterhouse vice president told him that he was \u201cterminated immediately.\u201d Chimarev, who had served as an at-will employee, has adduced no evidence to support his claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219, that he was entitled to wages for any time after the February 7 termination date. Nor has he proffered any evidence of a TD Waterhouse severance policy entitling him to any payments after termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">To the extent Chimarev cites state labor law to support his wage and severance claims, the cited statutory sections simply require the maintenance of documentary records pertaining to payrolls, termination notices, and minimum wages, <em>see </em>N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 195, 662; they do not create any employee right to additional payments after termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">c. <em>Privacy Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Chimarev cannot sue for invasion of privacy pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, which deals with information retained by government agencies, not private employers. Nor can he state a claim under New York law, where the right to privacy is governed exclusively by N.Y. Civ. Rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Law \u00a7\u00a7 50, 51, which prohibit the unauthorized commercial use of a private person\u2019s \u201cname, portrait, or picture,\u201d circumstances not here at issue. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 50; <em>see Howell v. New York Post Co., </em>81 N.Y.2d 115, 123, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 354, 612 N.E.2d 699 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">d. <em>Other State Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Chimarev\u2019s remaining state law claims merit little discussion. As an at-will employee, Chimarev cannot sue TD Waterhouse for breach of contract based on his termination. <em>See Murphy v. American Home Prods. Corp., </em>58 N.Y.2d 293, 297, 461 N.Y.S.2d 232, 233, 448 N.E.2d 86 (1983). To the extent New York recognizes an exception to this rule when an employee relies to his detriment on an employer\u2019s express written policy limiting its right of discharge, <em>see Lobosco v. New York Tel./NYNEX, </em>96 N.Y.2d 312, 316, 727 N.Y.S.2d 383, 385-86, 751 N.E.2d 462 (2001), Chimarev has faded to adduce any evidence of such a limiting policy at TD Waterhouse, much less his own reliance thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Neither does New York permit a terminated at-will employee to pursue a tort claim based on public policy or on implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. <em>See Horn v. New York Times, </em>100 N.Y.2d 85, 96-97, 760 N.Y.S.2d 378, 384, 790 N.E.2d 753 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The at-will nature of Chimarev\u2019s employment further precludes him from suing TD Waterhouse for fraudulently hiring him to appropriate his professional expertise before then firing him. <em>See Arias v. Women in Need, Inc., </em>274 A.D.2d 353, 354, 712 N.Y.S.2d 103, 103-04 (1st Dep\u2019t 2000); <em>Tannehill v. Paul Stuart, Inc., </em>226 A.D.2d 117, 118, 640 N.Y.S.2d 505, 506 (1st Dep\u2019t 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Finally, such evidence as Chimarev has adduced to demonstrate rude and discriminatory treatment at TD Waterhouse is insufficient, as a matter of law, to meet the \u201crigorous ... and difficult to satisfy\u201d standard necessary to state a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>Conboy v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>241 F.3d 242, 258 (2d Cir.2001). This tort pertains only to conduct that is \u201cso outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency ... in a civilized society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Stuto v. Fleishman, </em>164 F.3d 820, 828-29 (2d Cir.1999) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In sum, summary judgment was appropriately entered in favor of T.D. Water-house on all of Chimarev\u2019s federal and state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">2. <em>Denial of Chimarev\u2019s Motion to Amend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Chimarev asserts that the district court should not have entered judgment against him without permitting amendment of the complaint. We review this decision for abuse of discretion, <em>see Ellis v. Chao, </em>336 F.3d 114, 127 (2d Cir.2003), and conclude that the futility of Chimarev\u2019s proposed amendments precludes any finding of abuse, <em>see Jones v. New York State Div. of Military and Naval Affairs, </em>166 F.3d 45, 50 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Chimarev could not amend his complaint to add an age discrimination claim because, as with his Title VII claims, Chimarev had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Tewksbury v. Ottaway Newspapers, </em>192 F.3d 322, 328-29 (2d Cir.1999) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d)(2)). Similarly futile was Chimarev\u2019s proposed defamation claim based on critical comments made by TD Waterhouse in this litigation about his work performance; such statements are shielded by absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>privilege under New York law. <em>See Mosesson v. Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Firm,, </em>257 A.D.2d 381, 382-83, 683 N.Y.S.2d 88, 89 (1st Dep\u2019t 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Nor could Chimarev state a defamation claim by asserting that he was earlier defamed within TD Waterhouse to prevent his transfer to another department. Preliminarily, we observe that this allegation was first presented to the district court in a letter dated December 24, 2002, some weeks after the court had denied leave to amend. In any event, the claim is plainly futile, both because its allegation of malice is unsupported by evidentiary fact, <em>see Shamley v. ITT Corp., </em>869 F.2d 167, 173 (2d Cir.1989), and because, under New York law, \u201can employer has the right, without judicial interference, to assess an employee\u2019s performance on the job,\u201d so that negative internal assessments cannot support a claim for defamation, <em>Williams v. Varig Brazilian Airlines, </em>169 A.D.2d 434, 438, 564 N.Y.S.2d 328, 331 (1st Dep\u2019t 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">3. <em>Discovery Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We reject Chimarev\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in managing discovery. <em>See Hechinger Inv. Co. of Del. v. Friedman (In re Subpoena Issued to Dennis Friedman), </em>350 F.3d 65, 68-69 (2d Cir.2003). Specifically, there was no abuse in the court\u2019s decision not to reopen discovery to allow Chimarev to pursue evidence in support of his age discrimination claim; as already noted, this claim was procedurally barred by the failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Nor was abuse evidenced by the district court\u2019s refusal, after the close of discovery, to allow Chimarev to depose a TD Water-house employee. Chimarev had indicated at an earlier status conference that he did not intend to take any depositions because he thought it \u201ceasier\u201d to have \u201cwritten requests and responses\u201d in view of his discomfort with oral communication in English. Tr. of Disc. Conference, <em>Chimarev v. TD Waterhouse Investor Servs., Inc., </em>No. 01-7120(VM) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 12, 2002), at 37. Mindful of this fact, the district court had permitted him to file additional interrogatories after the close of discovery and, despite Chimarev\u2019s failure to comply with the court\u2019s direction that he ask only \u201csimple, nonargumentative questions,\u201d the court liberally construed even objectionable interrogatories, in some cases interpreting them as requests for document production and directing defendant to comply. <em>Chimarev v. TD Waterhouse Investor Servs., Inc., </em>No. 01-7120(VM) (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2002) (order of Gorenstein, M.J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Although Chimarev presents a litany of complaints about TD Waterhouse\u2019s alleged misconduct during discovery, he fails to identify any evidence that he thinks has been destroyed. In any event, because he failed to seek sanctions in the district court, this aspect of his discovery challenge is not properly before us. <em>See Zerilli-Edelglass v. New York City Transit Auth., </em>333 F.3d 74, 80 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">4. <em>Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Because Chimarev did not challenge the removal of his case in the district court, he cannot raise the point on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Accordingly, because we find Chimarev\u2019s points on appeal uniformly without merit, the district court\u2019s August 4, 2003 judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
