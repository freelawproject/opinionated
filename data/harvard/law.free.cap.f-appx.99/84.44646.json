The district court found that Green\u2019s federal complaint was a forbidden de facto appeal from a state court judgment of the Nevada Justice Court, and that the district court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Noel v. Hall, </em>341 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-28\">We take judicial notice of the fact that the Nevada District Court, Nevada\u2019s appellate court in this instance, has reversed the decision of the Nevada Justice Court, the state court judgment from which the district court had held that Green had brought a forbidden de-facto appeal. Because therefore there is no longer an underlying state court judgment in Green\u2019s case, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not bar subject matter jurisdiction in the district court. <em>See Noel, </em>341 F.3d at 1164. Our disposition does not address the merits of a possible dismissal of Green\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>plaint under the principles of abstention articulated in <em>Younger v.
