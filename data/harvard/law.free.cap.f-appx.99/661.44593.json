NORRIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b700-23\">Plaintiff Bethany K. Thacker appeals from the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s denial of Thacker\u2019s claim for supplemental security income benefits. Thacker contends that the district court erred by failing to follow our decision in <em>Howard v. Comm\u2019r of Social Security, </em>276 F.3d 235 (6th Cir.2002). Thacker also contends that the district court erred in failing to determine that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to follow two agency rulings. Because <em>Howard </em>does not require a reversal, and because the ALJ did follow the rulings Thacker identifies, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-25\">Thacker filed a claim for supplemental security income benefits with the Social Security Administration on August 10, 1999. Her claim was denied initially and upon reconsideration. Thacker then moved for a hearing on her claim before an Administrative Law Judge. ALJ Charlie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Paul Andrus denied the claim in a decision dated September 25, 2000. Having determined that Thacker could not perform the work she had done in the past, the ALJ determined that the Commissioner had met his burden of demonstrating that a significant number of jobs existed in the regional and national economies for Thacker to perform, thus preventing her from being eligible for supplemental security income benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In denying Thacker\u2019s claim, the ALJ relied upon the testimony of a vocational expert, Melissa Glannon. Glannon testified that jobs existed for Thacker in the regional and national economies given her age, education, past work experience and residual functional capacity. In eliciting testimony from Glannon, the ALJ asked the following hypothetical questions and received the following answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-6\">Q. All right. So let\u2019s assume we have an individual who is physically limited to no more than medium work. Let\u2019s assume that the individual has some moderate limitations. And by moderate, I use the definition of somewhere between no significant limitation at all and no useful ability to perform the function, but moderately limited in ability to perform activities within the schedule, maintain regular attendance and be punctual and to deal with the general public, limiting the individual to simple routine work without significant public contact. Assume that the individual is only occasionally able to climb ladders, stoop, crouch or crawl. To these limitations I want you to add vocational factors. Assuming that our hypothetical individual is of the claimant\u2019s age, education and work history, in your opinion, would there be jobs that such an individual could perform?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-7\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">Q. Well, what percentage of the medium, light and sedentary unskilled jobs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-9\">recognized after the (INAUDIBLE) could such an individual do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-10\">A. Approximately 60% of the medium, 50% of the light and 50% of the sedentary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-11\">Q. Could you give me some examples and their frequency in the regional and national economies, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-12\">A. Yeah. At the medium level of exertion, food preparation jobs, (INAUDIBLE) approximately 235,000 nationally, 14,700 in the tristate area of West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. Also at the medium level of exertion stock handler jobs exist, approximately 153,000 nationally, 12,000 in the region. At the light level of exertion housekeeping/cleaning jobs exist, approximately 248,000 nationally, 13,800 in the region. Also at the light level hand packing jobs exist, approximately 210,000 nationally, 13,300 in the region. At the sedentary level of exertion assembler jobs exist, approximately 75,000 nationally, 7,100 in the region. And bench work labor jobs exist, approximately 65,000 nationally, 5,400 in the region.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-13\">Q. Let\u2019s assume that I find that the individual has severe limitations in the ability to maintain attention, concentration and task persistence. Would there be further limitations imposed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">A. Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-15\">Q. And what jobs would be eliminated? A. All jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-16\">Q. Are there any other factors you observed in your review of the file that would cause vocational impact that I have not covered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-17\">A. No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">Thacker appealed the ALJ\u2019s denial of her claim to the Appeals Council, which affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision on February 22, 2002, making the ALJ\u2019s decision the Commissioner\u2019s final determination of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Thacker filed a complaint against the Commissioner in federal district court, arguing, among other things, that our court\u2019s decision in <em>Howard v. Comm\u2019r of Social Security, </em>276 F.3d 235 (6th Cir.2002), required a reversal because the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions to the vocational expert were incomplete for failure to list Thacker\u2019s medical diagnoses. On August 8, 2002, the district court, ruling from the bench, denied Thacker\u2019s claim for benefits. The court stated that it did \u201cnot believe the holding of <em>Howard, </em>276 F.3d 235, is necessarily as expansive as plaintiffs counsel would have the Court conclude; otherwise, practically every case in which an ALJ relies upon a hypothetical question of a vocational expert would have to be remanded unless the hypothetical question included all the restrictions, limitations and diagnoses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Thacker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\n<em>1. The Proper Interpretation of Howard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Having reviewed the relevant facts in this case, we conclude that our decision in <em>Howard </em>does not require a reversal for the reasons enunciated in <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r of Social Security, </em>368 F.3d 629 (6th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">\n<em>2. The ALJ\u2019s Compliance with Social Security Ruling 96-6p</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Thacker asserts that the ALJ erred in failing to comply with SSR 96-6p. That ruling requires the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">Administrative law judges and the Appeals Council are not bound by findings made by State agency or other program physicians and psychologists, but they may not ignore these opinions and must explain the weight given to the opinions in their decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">SSR 96-6p. Thacker argues that the ALJ failed to explain the weight he accorded the opinions of government doctors in accordance with the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">We disagree with Thacker because the ALJ did discuss the weight he was according the government doctors\u2019 opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW31\">Findings of fact made by State Agency medical and psychological consultants and other program physicians and psychologists regarding the nature and severity of an individual\u2019s impairments are treated as expert opinion evidence of non-examining sources. Although I am not bound by a consultant\u2019s findings, they cannot and have not been ignored. Rather, I have give [sic] such findings the weight I deem proper. I note that the Commissioner is the ultimate determiner of both residual functional capacity and of disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-14\">I find that the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity is limited to medium ex-ertional work. This finding is based on the State Agency experts having found the claimant to have the ability to perform medium exertional work, and there being no new evidence since such finding; the claimant allegedly not even sure of her limitations; and the objective medical evidence being consistent with the finding of medium exertional work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">It is apparent from this passage that the ALJ was aware of his obligation to consider the government doctors\u2019 findings. The ALJ states that he accorded them substantial weight because they were consistent with the objective medical evidence. Although the ALJ\u2019s discussion is brief and unspecific, we find that it meets the requirements of SSR 96-6p.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">\n<em>8. The ALJ\u2019s Compliance with Social Security Ruling 96-7p</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">Thacker argues that the ALJ erred in not discussing other Social Security Administration employees\u2019 observa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>tions of her. She cites an agency ruling, SSR 96-7p, in support of her argument. The relevant part of that ruling reads: \u201cThe adjudicator must also consider any observations about the individual recorded by Social Security Administration (SSA) employees during interviews, whether in person or by telephone.\u201d SSR 96-7p.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The language of that ruling, however, does not support Thacker\u2019s argument. SSR 96-7p only requires that the ALJ consider other employees\u2019 observations of her. The ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss those observations does not indicate that they were not considered. An ALJ need not discuss every piece of evidence in the record for his decision to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court and the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
