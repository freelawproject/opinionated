Sanchez-Villar was sentenced principally to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Sanchez-Villar, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>argues that his conviction should be reversed because he received ineffective assistance from trial counsel. Specifically, he claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the warrantless seizure of the firearm and the police officers\u2019 subsequent warrantless arrest of him. Sanchez-Villar asserts that the seizure and arrest were improper because, he claims, the officers had no basis to believe his possession of the firearm was illicit. Rather, the only grounds for probable cause arose, Sanchez-Villar contends, after his arrest \u2014 when he admitted that he was an illegal alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Despite the general preference for review of ineffective-assistance claims in habeas proceedings rather than on direct appeals, <em>see Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003), we find the record here sufficiently complete for immediate review, <em>see United States v. Morris, </em>350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir.2003) (stating that claim may be decided on record before court). To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Sanchez-Villar must show that: (1) \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and (2) \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">We find the instant ineffective-assistance claim unavailing because the argument that Sanchez-Villar contends his trial counsel should have raised is frivolous. Sanchez-Villar\u2019s argument appears to rest on the mistaken assumption that the probable cause justifying the seizure and arrest must have been coterminous with the charges for which he was ultimately charged and convicted. The discovery of the firearm, however, provided the officers with sufficient probable cause that a crime under New York law was being committed, therefore creating probable cause for both the seizure of the weapon and the arrest of Sanchez-Villar. Under New York law, it is a crime to possess a firearm. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.01(1); <em>People v. Washington, </em>209 A.D.2d 162, 163, 618 N.Y.S.2d 32 (1994) (holding that under New York law possession of a gun is a crime). While state law excepts from prosecution individuals in possession of a firearm with the appropriate license, <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 265.20(3), this exception is an affirmative defense that \u201cgenerally is a matter for the defendant to raise in defense, either under the general issue or by affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>209 A.D.2d at 163, 618 N.Y.S.2d 32. Thus, because it is beyond dispute that the officers were lawfully located in a place from which they plainly could see the gun, the officers were justified in seizing it because of its \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d incriminating character. <em>See Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 136-37, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990). Further, Sanchez-Villar\u2019s subsequent arrest was proper because probable cause existed that Sanchez-Villar\u2019s possession of the firearm violated New York law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cruz, </em>834 F.2d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir.1987) (holding that warrantless arrests are justified when based on probable cause, which is present when the facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge warrant a \u201cbelief that an offense has been or is being committed\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\">. We reject Sanchez-Villar\u2019s argument that New York\u2019s statutory scheme offends the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const, amend. II; <em>United States v. Toner, </em>728 F.2d 115, 128 (2d Cir.1984) (stating that the right to possess a gun is clearly not a fundamental right\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
