He has also filed redundant motions to proceed IFP, for appointment of counsel, and to reinstate appeal no. 04-20033. Bansal is a citizen of India who was suspended from school in 1997 and deported in May 2001 following two misdemeanor convictions for harassment in Texas. He has a lengthy history of challenging his convictions, suspension, and deportation in three different district courts and in numerous appeals via petitions for habeas corpus and civil rights suits.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The instant appeals are the latest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>in Bansal\u2019s voluminous, repetitive litigation. Bansal\u2019s motion to reinstate appeal no. 04-20033 is GRANTED. Bansal has moved to consolidate appeal nos. 03-20625, 03-20638, and 04-20033. Because those appeals share a common record, the motion is GRANTED. We also consolidate appeal no. 03-20788. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Bansal concedes that the instant complaints he filed in the Southern District of Texas, captioned <em>Bansal v. INS </em>and <em>Bansal v. Consulate General of India, </em>are duplicative of two complaints he filed in nearly identical litigation in the Eastern District of Texas. We conclude that the instant appeals therefore lack arguable merit and should be dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>see also Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 995 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Wilson v. Lynaugh, </em>878 F.2d 846, 850 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Although he now seeks to have his Southern District of Texas complaints dismissed without prejudice to his pursuit of his claims in one of the Eastern District of Texas cases, the case to which he refers was administratively closed and is no longer pending. <em>See Bansal v. Lamar Univ., </em>No. 1:02-CV-710 (E.D.Tex. July 22, 2003). Moreover, Bansal has had an adverse judgment on similar claims affirmed by this court in yet another civil rights case in the Eastern District of Texas, although we remanded for the district court to consider a single due process claim that the district court erroneously failed to consider. <em>See Bansal v. Lamar Univ., </em>93 Fed.Appx. 590 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Bansal has exhibited a pattern of filing repetitive suits that abuses the judicial system. <em>See Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 359-60 (5th Cir. 1986). Bansal has not clearly explained why he filed nearly identical suits in three different district courts, <em>i.e. </em>the Southern and Eastern Districts of Texas and the Eastern District of Louisiana. He has been barred on at least two occasions from filing further pleadings in the district court. <em>See, e.g., Bansal v. Warden, </em>No. 1:00-CV-307 (E.D.Tex. July 17, 2003); <em>Bansal v. Consulate General of India, </em>No. H-03-CV-2502 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 20 2003). He has also continued to file redundant pleadings in this and other cases despite warnings and orders from the district court and this court. <em>See, e.g., Bansal v. Orange City Mayor, </em>No. 03-41219 (5th Cir. Dec. 3, 2003)(unpublished); <em>Bansal v. Warden, </em>No. 03-41110 (5th Cir. Mar. 16, 2004)(unpublished). He candidly acknowledges that the instant appeals concern repetitive complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Bansal is ordered to show cause within 30 days why sanctions should not be imposed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38; <em>Freeze v. Griffith, </em>849 F.2d 172, 176 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Green v. Carlson, </em>649 F.2d 285, 287 (5th Cir.1981). Bansal is instructed that his response to this order must be limited to 15 pages and that no portion of the response in excess of the limitation will be considered. No extensions of time to respond will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">MOTION TO REINSTATE GRANTED; MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE GRANTED; APPEALS DISMISSED; ALL OTHER OUTSTANDING MOTIONS DENIED; SHOW CAUSE ORDER ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b574-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
