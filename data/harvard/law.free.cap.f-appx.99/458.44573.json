He also claimed a bonus under a stock plan. While Computer Sciences tendered a severance payment to McCormack, McCormack disputed the amount, as well as Computer Sciences\u2019 refusal to tender any benefit under the stock plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Because the parties were unable to resolve their differences through internal procedures, McCormack commenced this action for (1) the larger severance payment to which he claimed entitlement and (2) a stock bonus under the stock plan. Following a bench trial, the district corut awarded McCormack $359,550 in additional severance pay, plus interest and attorneys fees. It also determined that McCormack was entitled to the stock bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">On this appeal, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it awards severance benefits to McCormack, but we reverse its award of bonus stock to McCormack. Our reasons follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">McCormack began his employment with PMSC in 1997 as a Senior Vice President and Controller of the company, and he became a participant in the company\u2019s \u201cChange in Control Severance Pay Plan\u201d (\u201cSeverance Plan\u201d). The purpose of the Severance Plan was to provide qualifying employees with severance benefits in the event that the employees suffered a constructive termination by PMSC as a result of a change in control of the company. Among other benefits, the Severance Plan provided three components for calculating an eligible employee\u2019s severance. First, paragraph 7(i) provided that an employee would receive three times his annual base salary at the time of termination. Second, paragraph 7(ii) provided that the employee would receive three times the greater of his target bonus for the year of termination or the actual bonus he had received during the previous year. Finally, paragraph 8(c)(ii) provided that the employee was entitled to the greater of the accrued annual bonus for the year of termination or a pro-rata amount of the target bonus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>for the period of such year through the date of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">McCormack also became a participant in PMSC\u2019s Restricted Stock Ownership Plan (\u201cRSOP\u201d). The RSOP required that participating executives own an amount of company stock consistent with an individualized annual guideline target. If an executive did not reach his target, one-half of his annual bonus was paid in the form of restricted company stock. In addition, under the RSOP, an executive would receive a stock \u201cuplift,\u201d which amounted to additional stock equal to 25% of his bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">PMSC did not pay any bonuses in 1999. But in 2000, it targeted McCormack\u2019s bonus at $76,125, amounting to 35% of his $217,500 salary. The record contains no evidence that an actual bonus for McCormack for 2000 was ever calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">During the summer of 2000, PMSC entered into an agreement to merge with Computer Sciences, and the merger was consummated on December 27, 2000, when Computer Sciences purchased all of PMSC\u2019s outstanding stock. The closing of the merger constituted a \u201cchange in control,\u201d as defined in the Severance Plan, and amounted to a constructive termination event upon which participants in the Severance Plan could act to terminate their employment and receive benefits. The consummation of the merger, however, ended the RSOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">On December 29, 2000, two days after the merger, McCormack wrote Pete Boy-kin, the President of Computer Sciences, and notified him that the acquisition of PMSC worked a \u201cchange in control,\u201d which, under the Severance Plan, constituted a \u201cconstructive termination event.\u201d McCormack further informed Boykin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-8\">[T]his letter is provided solely to establish and preserve my rights under the Plan, by notifying you that I consider the above described \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d to have terminated my employment effective December 27, 2000. Without waiving any of my rights under the Plan I am pleased to provide services during the thirty day cure period set forth in the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">McCormack made himself available, as promised, and continued to assist Computer Sciences in the transition. On January 11, 2001, Computer Sciences advised McCormack that his services would no longer be needed beyond January 19, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">On February 1, 2001, Computer Sciences tendered McCormack a check in the sum of $879,550, which it claimed fully satisfied its obligation to McCormack under the Severance Plan. McCormack disputed the amount of the severance payment, stating that it was miscalculated under the terms of the Severance Plan. McCormack noted that because he was constructively terminated on December 27, 2000, his severance payment should have been computed on the following basis: three times his annual salary, per paragraph 7; plus three times his targeted 2000 bonus, per paragraph 7(ii); plus a pro-rata portion of his 2000 targeted bonus, per paragraph 8(c)(ii). Instead, Computer Sciences had taken the position that McCormack was terminated on January 19, 2001 and therefore that his severance payment should be calculated with respect to the 19 days that McCormack had worked in 2001, not the 360-odd days that McCormack had worked in 2000. McCormack also disputed the fact that Computer Sciences provided no benefit under the RSOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Because the parties were unable to resolve their differences, McCormack commenced this action against Computer Sciences under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) for benefits to which he claimed he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>entitled. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(1)(B) (affording participants in a qualified plan a private right of action to enforce their rights under the plan). In the course of the proceedings, the parties stipulated that Computer Sciences\u2019 acquisition of PMSC worked a \u201cchange in control\u201d on December 27, 2000, and that, because McCormack suffered a material reduction in his responsibilities and authority, he had experienced a \u201cconstructive termination event.\u201d The parties continued to dispute, however, whether McCormack\u2019s termination occurred on December 27, 2000, as he claimed in his December 29 letter to Computer Sciences, or on January 19, 2001, as claimed by Computer Sciences when it indicated it would no longer need his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The district court determined that McCormack was entitled to date his constructive termination as of December 27, 2000. It also ruled that, because the RSOP\u2019s lapse occurred simultaneously with the \u201cconstructive termination event,\u201d McCormack was entitled to the \u201cuplift\u201d bonus of stock under the RSOP. The court included in its judgment a monetary award in favor of McCormack in the amount of $359,557.60 in unpaid severance benefits, $127,482.24 in interest, and $123,096.27 for attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of an ERISA plan <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See Johannssen v. Dist. No. 1</em>\u2014Pac. <em>Coast Dist., MEBA Pension Plan, </em>292 F.3d 159, 168 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The issue on the claim for Severance Plan benefits reduces to the question of whether McCormack\u2019s employment with Computer Sciences terminated in December 2000, when he sent his notice of termination to Computer Sciences, or on January 19, 2001, when Computer Sciences no longer needed McCormack\u2019s services, as it had stated on January 11, 2001. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that McCormack\u2019s letter of December 29 effectively terminated his employment and that that termination date provided the <em>date </em>for computing McCormack\u2019s severance benefits.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The Severance Plan provides unequivocally that severance benefits are payable, based on the <em>date </em>of a \u201ccovered termination\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">The severance payment to be made shall be paid to the Eligible Employee in a single lump sum cash payment, net of any required tax withholding, within fifteen (15) calendar days after <em>the date </em>of the Eligible Employee\u2019s Covered Termination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Severance Plan, 117 (emphasis added). McCormack asserts that the termination effected by his December 29 letter was a \u201ccovered termination\u201d and that severance benefits therefore are payable within 15 days after that date. Computer Sciences, however, contends that McCormack continued working after December 29 and that he was not terminated until January 19, 2001, when the company told him his services would no longer be needed. In addition, Computer Sciences argues that even if the December 29 date were used, the effective date of a covered termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>must be pushed back 30 days after the notice-of-termination date in order to permit Computer Sciences to \u201ccure\u201d the facts giving rise to the covered termination \u2014 in this case, a change of control. In essence, Computer Sciences argues that the 30-day cure period postpones the date from which severance payments are computed because only after the 30-day period can it be concluded that a termination was a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">While Computer Sciences\u2019 position is not frivolous, we believe that the better reading holds that the cure period established in the Severance Plan is a condition subsequent that determines whether a \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d qualifies to make the employee\u2019s termination a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d In providing a cure period, however, the Severance Plan does not purport to change the actual <em>date </em>of termination. Paragraph 7 says that benefits are payable 15 days after the <em>date </em>of a covered termination. A \u201ccovered termination\u201d is a defined term, to which paragraph 6 of the Severance Plan is devoted. Consequently, whatever is written in paragraph 6 determines whether the employee\u2019s termination was a \u201ccovered termination,\u201d but it does not, for purposes of the severance payment provided by paragraph 7, change the \u201cdate\u201d from which severance payments are payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Under paragraph 6 of the Severance Plan, a termination is a \u201ccovered termination\u201d if it follows a \u201cconstructive termination event,\u201d and a \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d is defined as, among other things, a \u201cmaterial reduction in an Eligible Employee\u2019s title, position, reporting relationship, responsibilities or authority.\u201d In order for a \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d to be <em>treated </em>as one under paragraph 6, the employer must have a 30-day period within which to cure the events giving rise to a \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d \u2014 in this case, the change in McCormack\u2019s authority. Only after the cure period has been allowed may the \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d be <em>\u201ctreated\u201d </em>as a \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d for purposes of qualifying a termination as a \u201ccovered termination,\u201d and, consequently, not until 30 days have elapsed can one know whether a termination qualifies as a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d But waiting this 30-day period does not postpone the <em>date </em>of the termination that an employee has posited as a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d It is only a condition subsequent that must be fulfilled before the original \u201cconstructive termination event\u201d can be <em>\u201ctreated\u201d </em>as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In the facts of this case, the merger between PMSC and Computer Sciences on December 27, 2000 was a \u201cconstructive termination event,\u201d and the parties have so stipulated. McCormack\u2019s letter of December 29, 2000 was a termination of his employment which he posited as a \u201ccovered termination\u201d because it followed a \u201cconstructive termination event.\u201d Accordingly, under paragraph 7 of the Severance Plan, he would be entitled to severance pay as of that notice letter if it turned out that he was correct that his termination was a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d Because a constructive termination event could not be \u201ctreated\u201d as one until the 30-day cure period elapsed, McCormack could not know on December 29 whether his termination was a covered termination. But by the end of January 2001, when the 30-day cure period elapsed, he was able to know that his termination on December 29 was a \u201ccovered termination.\u201d Nothing in paragraph 6 of the Severance Plan, describing how a termination qualifies as a covered termination, purports to state that McCormack is denied the benefit of the termination <em>date </em>that was established by his letter of termination. Because his letter of December 29 terminated his employment, which by the passage of time could be treated as a covered termination, McCormack became entitled to severance bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>fits from December 29, not from some date in January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it awards McCormack severance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Computer Sciences argues that even if it owes severance benefits as of December 29, 2000, it has no liability under the RSOP because that plan ended when all of the PMSC stock was acquired by Computer Sciences on December 27, 2000. We agree. With the termination of the RSOP in the merger documents and the transfer of all of PMSC\u2019s stock to Computer Sciences, the plan no longer existed and could no longer function.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it awards benefits under the RSOP.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> The district court found that McCormack's termination was on December 27, the date on which McCormack said his termination was effective. Because McCormack did not give notice of termination until December 29 and because the constructive termination event of December 27 was not self-actuating, however, we conclude that McCormack\u2019s employment terminated on December 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
