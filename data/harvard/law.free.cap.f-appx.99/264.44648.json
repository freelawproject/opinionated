In August 2001 and again in April 2002, members of the New York City Police Department found Evans in possession of a firearm. Evans was charged in a two-count indictment in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with the crime of being a previously convicted felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). In January 2003, after the district court denied Evans\u2019 motion to suppress the weapons in question, Evans pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-19\">The district court (Gershon, J.) Sentenced Evans to 66 months\u2019 incarceration, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $200 special assessment. In arriving at Evans\u2019 sentence, the court set his base offense level at 20, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A); applied a two-level enhancement for \u201crecklessly creating] a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.2; applied another two-level enhancement for \u201cobstructing] ... the administration of justice\u201d by providing materially false information in connection with his suppression hearing, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1; and declined to apply a three-level \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d decrease to Evans\u2019 resultant offense level of 24, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. Evans appeals the district court\u2019s application of the \u201creckless endangerment\u201d and \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d enhancements, as well as the court\u2019s decision not to apply the \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d decrease. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s rulings in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-20\">\u2018We review ... the district court\u2019s legal interpretation and application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo,\u201d United States v. Rivers, </em>329 F.3d 119, 120 (2d Cir.2003), while \u201cfactual findings supporting the court\u2019s offense calculation are reviewed for clear error,\u201d <em>United States v. McSherry, </em>226 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir.2000). First, Evans contends that although he fled from the police in their April 2002 encounter, the \u201cshort one block chase\u201d that ensued did not amount to reckless behavior within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. The facts as found by the district court indicate otherwise. After officers approached Evans\u2019 vehicle and observed him holding a firearm, Evans pulled away \u201cwith the tires screeching.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Evans struck another vehicle and, while carrying the firearm, fled on foot. After Evans threw the weapon over a fence, and unsuccessfully attempted to \u201cear jack\u201d another vehicle, an officer apprehended him - only to have Evans again attempt to flee. We cannot hold that the district court clearly erred in crediting the officers\u2019 testimony as to these facts, and we see no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Evans acted \u201crecklessly\u201d in his attempt to flee. Indeed, Evans plainly \u2018\u201cwas aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>254 F.3d 44, 46 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.4, app. note 1, defining \u201creckless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Second, Evans contends that, although he provided false information in connection with the suppression hearing, that information was not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the issue. But again, the facts indicate otherwise. Although Evans admitted at the hearing to having possessed a firearm during the April 2002 incident, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that \u201cin his moving affidavit, defendant affirmatively asserted that he did not possess the firearm at issue.\u201d The district court also found that, at the hearing, Evans lied in \u201cclaiming] that he did not see the officers\u2019 shields and ... that they did not announce that they were police officers\u201d prior to his leading them in chase. Finally, the court found that Evans lied in claiming that, at the April 2002 incident, the firearm remained in his pocket until after he began to flee on foot - an apparent attempt to undermine the presence of reasonable suspicion during the traffic stop in question. Thus, we see no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Evans committed perjury warranting an \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d enhancement. Indeed, Evans provided false information that, \u2018\u201cif believed, ... would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lincecum, </em>220 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, app. note 6, defining \u201cmaterial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Third, Evans contends that he should have received an \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d decrease in his offense level because he \u201cadmitted his guilt to the instant offense and apologized to both the Court and his family.\u201d Under \u00a7 3E1.1, \u201c \u2018[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment ... as a matter of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. note 3). Moreover, only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d will a defendant be eligible for an \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d decrease when that defendant has also received an \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. note 4; <em>see also United States v. Champion, </em>234 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir.2000). We recognize that Evans ultimately admitted his guilt. However, he has suggested no reason why this Court should view his case as \u201cextraordinary\u201d such that leniency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>for his belated contrition would be consistent with his enhancement for \u201cobstruction of justice.\u201d Indeed, Evans\u2019 documented attempts to mislead the district court on matters relevant and material to his guilt are flatly inconsistent with his claim to have \u201cclearly demonstrated] acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a); <em>see also Cox, </em>299 F.3d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
