R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b150-16\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-17\">Gulam Mostofa, a native and citizen of Bangladesh, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmance of an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of Mostofa\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation. We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a), <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and review the IJ\u2019s decision because his conclusions were adopted by the BIA. <em>See Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 680 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he IJ\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-18\">Aside from doubting Mostofa\u2019s credibility, the IJ also concluded that Mostofa did not suffer past persecution. Substantial evidence supports this conclusion, as the record evidence of Mostofa\u2019s injuries does not compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cAlthough a reasonable factfinder could have found this incident sufficient to establish past persecution, we do not believe that a factfinder would be compelled to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-19\">Moreover, \u201ca petition must be denied unless the evidence [is] so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>See Rostomian v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 1088, 1089 (9th Cir.2000) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mostofa did not \u201cpoint[ ] to credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record ... that would support [an objectively] reasonable fear of persecution\u201d for a returning Jatiya party member. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Mostofa asks that we take judicial notice of the BNP\u2019s return to power in 2001. We decline to do so, as our determination that Mostofa did not demonstrate past persecution means that \u201cwe must consider the facts in the administrative record as if they speak to the current situation.\u201d <em>Avetova-Elisseva v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1192, 1198 n. 9 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The Clerk is directed to stay the mandate pending the resolution of <em>Deloso v.
