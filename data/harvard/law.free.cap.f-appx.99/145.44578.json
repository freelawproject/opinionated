Indus. Pension, Welfare &amp; Training Trust Funds v. Karr, </em>994 F.2d 1426, 1429 (9th Cir.1998); <em>People v. Barragan, </em>32 Cal.4th 236, 253, 9 Cal. Rptr.3d 76, 83 P.3d 480 (2004). This is true even though the earthquake and aftershock arose in different policy years and are separate seismic events. Cal.Civ.Proc. Code \u00a7 340.9 has no effect here because \u00a7 340.9(d)(1) exempts from revival \u201c[a]ny claim that has been litigated to finality in any court of competent jurisdiction prior to the effective date of this section.\u201d The dismissal with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(l)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is a final judgment on the merits. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that the present action is barred by res judicata. Finally, denying leave to amend was well within the court\u2019s discretion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b184-7\">. <em>Mikhael Khoury &amp; Pierrette Khoury v.
