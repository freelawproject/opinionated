We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-21\">The district court did not err by imposing a two-level enhancement under section 2Dl.l(b)(l) of the Sentencing Guidelines for Jasper\u2019s possessing firearms in connection with a drug-related crime. The government proved Jasper\u2019s constructive possession of the firearms by a preponderance of the evidence, and Jasper offered no evidence showing the clear improbability that the weapons were connected to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">Furthermore, because the evidence demonstrates that Jasper managed another person (his mother) in his criminal activity, we agree with the district court\u2019s application of a two-level enhancement under section 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
