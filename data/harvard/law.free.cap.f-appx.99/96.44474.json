Because the BIA summarily affirmed the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 887-88 (9th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The government conceded in its motion to remand that \u201c[njeither the immigration judge\u2019s decision, nor the Board\u2019s summary affirmance, provides specific cogent reasons as to why Petitioner was not a credible witness.\u201d Because the IJ is required to \u201c \u2018offer a specific, cogent reason for any stated disbelief,\u2019 \u201d <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 386, 342 (9th Cir.1994)), we hold that his adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Having reached this conclusion, we deem Castellanos\u2019s testimony to be credible. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir.2004). Therefore, it is unnecessary to remand for another credibility determination. <em>He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 604 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-14\">As to the merits of the asylum claim, the IJ stated, after discussing the statutory requirements for proving past persecution and their application to the facts in this case: \u201cThe foundation of the claim, I am satisfied, would be sufficient were it a plausible, credible claim upon which a grant of asylum could be made.\u201d We interpret this statement as a finding that Castellanos\u2019s experiences qualified as past persecution, assuming that his testimony was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Castellanos suffered past persecution is supported by substantial evidence. The persecution was \u201con account\u201d of Castellanos\u2019s imputed political opinion. <em>See Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1509 (9th Cir.1995). Castellanos\u2019s supervisor in the <em>Estado Mayor Presidencial </em>(\u201cEMP\u201d) told him that his two-week detention in solitary confinement was due to his cooperation with <em>Misi\u00f3n de las Naciones Unidas en Guatemala </em>(United Nations Inspection Mission to Guatemala) (\u201cMINUGUA\u201d). Immediately after Castellanos\u2019s release, the EMP directed him to a residence where he was severely beaten and again accused of aiding MINUGUA. These incidents, as well as the death threats to Castellanos and his family, clearly rise to the level of persecution. Finally, because the EMP is a unit of the Guatemalan military, the persecution was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>committed by the government. <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 655-56 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Castellanos\u2019s past persecution creates a presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution were he to return to Guatemala. <em>Id. </em>at 657. Because the IJ did not consider the evidence in the record as to changes in Guatemala since the Castellanos family fled, we remand for a determination as to whether the government can meet its rebuttal burden. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). On remand, in order to overcome the presumption, the government would be required to make a particularized showing by a preponderance of the evidence that conditions in Guatemala have fundamentally changed so as to render the basis for Castellanos\u2019s particular fears, given his individual circumstances, no longer warranted. <em>See Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 738 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT the petition and REVERSE the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. With respect to petitioners\u2019 asylum claims, we AFFIRM the IJ\u2019s determination that Castellanos suffered past persecution and REMAND solely for an individualized analysis as to whether the government is able to rebut the presumption that the family has a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because the' IJ made no findings as to withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture, we REMAND these claims in their entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-16\">.

We note that the presumption cannot be overcome by showing general improvements with respect to the treatment of opponents or suspected opponents of the Guatemala government. <em>See Rios v.
