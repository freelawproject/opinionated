R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied for the reasons stated in the memorandum accompanying this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\n<em>MEMORANDUM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), the Secretary of Agriculture may suspend or revoke the required license of any commission merchant, dealer, or broker who employs \u201cany person who is or has been <em>responsibly connected\u201d </em>with a licensee found to have committed \u201cany flagrant and repeated violation of section 499b.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499h(b)(2) (emphasis added). That section makes it unlawful for covered entities to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cfail ... [to] make full payment promptly\u201d for perishable agricultural commodities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 499b(4). The statute creates a presumption that a person who holds more than 10 percent of the outstanding stock of a PACA violator is \u201cresponsibly connected,\u201d but also allows a person to rebut that presumption: \u201cA person shall not be deemed to be responsibly connected if the person demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was <em>not actively involved in the activities resulting in a violation ... </em>and that the person either was only nominally a partner, officer, director, or shareholder of a violating licensee.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 499a(b)(9) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">In response to our decision in <em>Norinsberg v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>162 F.3d 1194, 1200 (D.C.Cir.1998), the Secretary has articulated the standard for \u201cnot actively involved,\u201d requiring a petitioner to \u201cdemonstrate! ] by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her participation [in activities resulting in a PACA violation] was limited to the performance of ministerial functions only.\u201d <em>In re Norinsberg, 58 </em>Agric. Dec. 604, 610-11 (1999). \u201cMinisterial\u201d has been further defined as \u201cnot exercising] judgment, discretion, or control with respect to the activities that resulted in a violation of the PACA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">From June 1999 through January 2000, Jacobson Produce failed to make full payment promptly for perishable agricultural commodities, resulting in a violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4). During that period, Mrs. Jacobson was manager of the Jacobson Produce frozen food department. Agriculture determined that she was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d because she owned 11.95 percent of Jacobson Produce\u2019s outstanding stock. Mrs. Jacobson seeks to carry her burden of rebutting the presumption triggered by that ownership by arguing that she was not actively involved in activities resulting in a violation \u2014 her actions involved only placing orders to <em>buy </em>produce, while it is <em>not paying </em>for the produce that gives rise to a PACA violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Substantial evidence, however, supports the Judicial Officer\u2019s determination that Mrs. Jacobson knew or should have known, when she placed orders for produce, that Jacobson Produce was not meeting its obligations to produce sellers. <em>In re Janet S. Orloff </em>et al., Decision and Order as to Mema K. Jacobson, Docket No. 01-0002, at 21 (Jan. 7, 2003); <em>see Veg-Mix, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>832 F.2d 601, 612 (D.C.Cir.1987). The question thus becomes whether it is reasonable for the agency to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>an individual who places orders for produce, with the knowledge that the buyer is having or will have difficulties paying for the produce, has not carried the burden of showing she was not actively involved in activities resulting in the subsequent failure to make full payment promptly. Under <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we cannot say that such a reading of the statute is unreasonable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
