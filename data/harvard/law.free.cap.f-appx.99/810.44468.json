On appeal, Lin claims that substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Because Lin\u2019s evidence would not compel any reasonable adjudicator to conclude that he was eligible for asylum or withholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B), we uphold the IJ\u2019s factual determinations and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-21\">We afford great deference to an immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding: \u201cadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)-(B); <em>see Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>(9th Cir.2003). Thus, when a petitioner contends that the IJ\u2019s credibility findings are erroneous, the petitioner \u201cmust establish that the evidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">In making the adverse credibility determination, the IJ primarily relied on two inconsistencies in Lin\u2019s testimony. First, the IJ explained that, given Lin\u2019s statement that he had not seen his partner Xhu Yu San since January 1998, it was \u201cinconsistent\u201d for Lin to believe that he had any relation with Xhu Yu San that necessitated Lin\u2019s phone call to warn Xhu Yu San when the police came to Lin\u2019s house. Second, the IJ explained that the following statements were \u201cinternally inconsistent,\u201d \u201cinconsistent with ... prior testimony,\u201d and \u201ccannot be reconciled\u201d: (1) Lin had only had one homosexual partner, (2) his last homosexual activity was in November 1998, (3) he had last seen his partner Xhu Yu San in May of 1998 in the park, and (4) he had last seen his partner Xhu Yu San in January 1998 at Xhu Yu San\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">While an IJ cannot substitute her own subjective interpretation of what happened, <em>see Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1996) (concluding that \u201cconjecture is not a substitute for substantial evidence\u201d), it is also not the role of this Court \u201cto substitute an analysis of which side in the factual dispute we find more persuasive.\u201d <em>Cruz-Navarro v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1024, 1028 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting Marat <em>v. INS, </em>147 F.3d 1078, 1082 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The activities resulting from Lin\u2019s relationship with Xhu Yu San formed the entire basis of Lin\u2019s asylum claim. It was this relationship that allegedly caused the community to discover that Lin was gay; it was this relationship that allegedly caused the police to arrest, detain, and beat Lin; it was this relationship that allegedly precluded Lin from attending school; and it was this relationship that allegedly caused Lin\u2019s parents to urge Lin to leave China. Yet, the IJ determined that Lin was unable to present a consistent chronology of key events in his relationship. Lin made several statements that are inconsistent on their face. These facts constituted substantial evidence to support the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001) (where the adverse credibility determination \u201cgoes to the heart of\u2019 petitioner\u2019s asylum claim, no further inquiry into petitioner\u2019s remaining claims is necessary). Plaintiff has offered no evidence to compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">Accordingly, we uphold the finding, and therefore the denial of Lin\u2019s asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT claims, because the IJ established a legitimate, articulable basis to question Lin\u2019s credibility and offered specific, cogent reasons for this disbelief. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156. The discrepancies in Lin\u2019s testimony were directly relevant to Lin\u2019s credibility, which in turn was necessary to his asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109,1111 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b849-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
