See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<author id=\"b526-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">Raymond McGee appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new trial based on alleged juror bias. McGee was convicted of unarmed bank robbery and conspiracy to commit bank robbery and armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2113(a), (d) (2000). Fourteen months after being sentenced and five months after we affirmed his convictions, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>43 Fed.Appx. 529 (4th Cir.2002)(per curiam), McGee filed a motion for a new trial. McGee\u2019s motion alleged that one juror was biased against him at trial because of a previous disagreement between the two of them. The juror did not disclose this disagreement during jury selection. After conducting an evidentiary hearing at which McGee and two witnesses testified on his behalf, the district court denied McGee\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for new trial based on a juror\u2019s failure to fully disclose information during voir dike for an abuse of discretion, or a clear error of law in the exercise of that discretion. <em>See City of Richmond v. Madison Mgmt. Group, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 438, 459 (4th Cir.1990). In order to obtain a new trial \u201c \u2018a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Greene, </em>150 F.3d 357, 362 (4th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984)). In the absence of dishonesty, a criminal defendant may nevertheless establish a Sixth Amendment violation warranting a new trial by showing that a juror was actually biased against the defense. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>150 F.3d at 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding McGee\u2019s and his witnesses\u2019 testimony implausible and in denying McGee\u2019s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
