We assume familiarity with the underlying facts that may be found in the tax court\u2019s opinion at <em>Comtek Expositions, Inc., v. Commissioner, 85 </em>T.C.M. (CCH) 1280, 2003 WL 21078102 (May 13, 2003), 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 135, and recite only the relevant details here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">From 1990-1996, Comtek, a corporation organized under the laws of Connecticut, organized trade shows throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc. Comtek leased exhibit halls, solicited exhibitors from Europe, the United States and the former Soviet bloc, and secured commitments from the exhibitors to display and sell electronic and household wares at the trade shows. Crocus International (\u201cCrocus\u201d), a Russian corporation, provided exhibitors with certain services at many Comtek trade shows including, <em>inter alia, </em>security, exhibit construction, maintenance, and catering. Crocus also solicited a limited number of Russian exhibitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In 1995, Comtek and Crocus entered into a Reciprocal Royalty Agreement (the \u201croyalty agreement\u201d), a revenue sharing agreement with E.C.I. Management Services, Ltd. (\u201cECI\u201d), a non-resident Irish corporation, under which Comtek purportedly received 25% of the gross revenues from the trade shows and ECI purportedly received the remainder. On its returns for the 1995 and 1996 tax years, Comtek included in its income only the 25% portion of its gross revenues from the trade shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Commissioner determinated that Comtek had failed to include the gross receipts and sales from foreign trade shows as income in its 1995 and 1996 tax returns and, on February 8, 2000, mailed a notice of deficiency to Comtek that advised \u201cfor the fiscal years [which] ended 7/31/95 and 7/31/96 [Comtek] realized gross income in the amounts of $19,906,081.00 ... and $21,610,895.00 [respectively] ... in lieu of the amounts reported on the income tax returns for each of those years.\u201d The notice further explained that \u201cthe amounts excluded from your return were for amounts paid or accrued to ECI in connection with [the] Reciprocal Royalty Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">After discovery, Comtek and the Commissioner (the \u201cparties\u201d) submitted a record of stipulated facts and exhibits pursuant to the Rules of Practice and Procedure of the United States Tax Court. <em>See </em>Tax Ct. R. 122. The parties agreed that the \u201csole issue in dispute is how Comtek and Crocus should report income generated by the foreign trade shows;\u201d in sum, if the tax court determined that Crocus and [Comtek] were joint venturers, then Comtek would not owe additional taxes. They further stipulated that \u201cboth ECI and the royalty agreement should be disregarded for federal income tax purposes\u201d and that \u201cno adverse inference should be drawn against either [party] based on the ECI [royalty] agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">As the Tax Court aptly observed, the stipulated facts created an \u201cartificial situation\u201d accompanied by \u201cobscurity, lack of transparency, and incompleteness of the stipulated record regarding the business and financial relationships of [Comtek] and Crocus.\u201d <em>See Comtek, </em>2003 Tax Ct. Memo LEXIS 135 at *33, 2003 WL 21078102. Having reviewed the same opaque record, and according the Tax Court\u2019s factual findings and inferences substantial deference, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">On appeal, Comtek first argues that because the \u201csole issue\u201d before the Tax Court was not set forth in the Commissioner\u2019s original notice of deficiency, it is a \u201cnew matter\u201d and the court should have shifted the burden of proof to the Commissioner to show that Comtek and Crocus were not joint venturers. BB20 See Tx. Ct. Rule 142.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> We disagree and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>conclude that the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts did not entail a \u201cnew matter\u201d and thus the Tax Court did not err by declining to shift the burden of proof under Tax Court Rule 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Comtek further contends that the tax court erred in its factual finding that it and Crocus were not joint venturers. We disagree. Because the Tax Court applied the proper legal standard to determine whether a joint venture existed between Comtek and Crocus as set forth in <em>Luna v. Comm\u2019r, </em>42 T.C. 1067, 1077-78, 1964 WL 1259 (1964), both its findings on each individual factor and its overall assessment of their varying weights must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. See <em>Estate of Kahn v. Comm\u2019r, </em>499 F.2d 1186, 1190 n. 4 (2d Cir.1974) (citing <em>Burde v. Comm\u2019r, </em>352 F.2d 995, 1002 (2d Cir.1965)); see <em>also Smith v. Comm\u2019r, </em>300 F.3d 1023, 1028 (9th Cir.2002) (factual inferences drawn from stipulated record are reviewed for clear error); <em>Malachinski v. Comm\u2019r, </em>268 F.3d 497, 505 (7th Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">To determine the existence of a joint venture <footnotemark>***</footnotemark> for federal income tax purposes we ask whether the parties \u201creally and truly intended to join together for the purpose of carrying on business and sharing in the profits or losses or both.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. Tower, </em>327 U.S. 280, 287, 66 S.Ct. 532, 90 L.Ed. 670 (1946). We consider all the facts: \u201cthe agreement, the conduct of the parties in the execution of its provisions, their statements, ... the relationship of the parties, their respective abilities and capital contributions, the actual control of income and the purpose for which it was used and any other facts throwing light on their true intent.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r v. Culbertson, </em>337 U.S. 733, 742, 69 S.Ct. 1210, 93 L.Ed. 1659 (1949); <em>see also Luna </em>42 T.C. 1077-78, (enumerating eight factors to determine existence of \u201cpartnership\u201d for federal income tax purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The Tax Court\u2019s finding that Comtek and Crocus were not joint venturers for federal income tax purposes is not clearly erroneous. It correctly found that there was no evidence in the record of any agreement, written or oral, between Comtek and Crocus for the sharing of profits and losses. Although Crocus and Comtek essentially split the direct expenses of the trade shows in the former Soviet bloc, only Comtek bore the risk that the trade shows would be unprofitable and there is no evidence that Crocus was entitled to any profit beyond reimbursement of its direct expenses. Comtek alone solicited exhibitors throughout the U.S. and Europe, generating ninety percent of the gross revenue from the trade shows, which was exclusively received by Comtek. Finally, the vast majority of exhibitors (all exhibitors except the relatively few located in the former Soviet bloc) dealt primarily, if not solely with Comtek by entering into a contract for exhibit space with Comtek, signed by a Comtek employee. Only in limited cases would such an exhibitor have any contact with Crocus.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">We have considered all of Comtek\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the Tax Court\u2019s judgment is hereby AEFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> Rule 142(a)(1) reads, in relevant part: \"The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except as otherwise provided by statute or determined by the Court; and except that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>respect of any new matter, increases in deficiency, and affirmative defenses, pleaded in the answer, it shall be upon the respondent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AhJ\"> For purposes of federal tax law, the term \u201cpartnership,\u201d is used interchangeably with the term \"joint venture.\u201d <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)(2); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7701-3(a); <em>Madison Gas &amp; Elec.
