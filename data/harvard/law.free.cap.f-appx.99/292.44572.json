Torres sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The district court concluded that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment to them on Torres\u2019s claims for monetary damages. With the consent of the parties, the district court then conducted a bench trial, based on the documentary evidence, regarding Torres\u2019s claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and dismissed Torres\u2019s remaining claims. The sole issue on appeal is the adequacy of the defendants\u2019 review of Torres\u2019s administrative segregation at Clinton Correctional Facility in and after July 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Tenenbaum v. Williams, </em>193 F.3d 581, 593 (2d Cir.1999). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivJ?. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">We \u201cprovid[e] government officials performing discretionary functions with a qualified immunity, shielding them from civil damages liability as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 638, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). We must ask if, \u201c[tjaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, ... the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right[.]\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">In <em>Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), the Supreme Court held that prison officials must \u201cengage in some sort of periodic review of the confinement\u201d of inmates in administrative segregation to ensure that the administrative segregation is not a pretext for indefinite confinement, <em>id. </em>at 477 n. 9. The <em>Hewitt </em>Court noted that this periodic review \u201cwill not necessarily require that prison officials permit the submission of any additional evidence or statements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">The district court found that Torres received regular reviews of his confinement, every seven days for the first two months, and every month thereafter. This is more than the \u201cperiodic review\u201d required by the Supreme Court. Beyond the regular reviews, provided by a committee of three, the district court found that the decision to keep Torres in administrative segregation was based on a variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>factors, including the original circumstances that necessitated administrative segregation, events that occurred in the interim, and the committee\u2019s personal observations of Torres, and that Torres was given the opportunity to present information to the committee. This, too, more than satisfies the requirements articulated in <em>Hewitt. </em>Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s findings of fact after a bench trial are not to be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d Ceraso <em>v. Motiva Enterprises, LLC, </em>326 F.3d 303, 316 (2d Cir.2003). Legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Coppola, </em>85 F.3d 1015, 1019 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">As the above discussion of <em>Hewitt </em>makes clear, the due process clause requires only minimal review of administrative segregation placements. The district court found that Torres received satisfactory review of his administrative segregation. These findings are not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Torres\u2019s remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
