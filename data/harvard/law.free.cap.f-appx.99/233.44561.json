R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the NLRB\u2019s Decision and Order deferring to an arbitration award be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-20\">This court has upheld the NLRB\u2019s practice of deferring to an arbitrator\u2019s award if: (1) the arbitrator faced and considered the unfair labor practice issue; (2) the arbitration proceedings were fair and regular; (3) the parties agreed by contract to be bound by the arbitrator\u2019s award; and (4) the arbitrator\u2019s award is not \u201cclearly repugnant to the purposes and policies of the [National Labor Relations] Act.\u201d <em>Utility Workers Union of America, Local 246, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, </em>39 F.3d 1210, 1213 (D.C.Cir.1994). An award is \u201cclearly repugnant\u201d to the Act only if it is \u201cpalpably wrong\u201d or \u201cnot susceptible to an interpretation consistent with the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1213 (quoting <em>Olin Corp., </em>268 N.L.R.B. 573, 574 (1984)). We review the NLRB\u2019s decision to defer to an arbitrator solely for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">On May 14, 1998, an impartial arbitrator found that Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania did not violate either its collective bargaining agreement with Communications Workers of America, Local 13000 or the National Labor Relations Act when it promulgated a rule prohibiting employees who had visible contact with customers from wearing \u201cRoad Kill\u201d shirts, and disciplined workers who wore the shirts. The \u201cRoad Kill\u201d shirt depicted a squashed, rodent-like carcass labeled \u201cBell Atlantic employees\u201d ly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>ing in a pool of blood on the \u201cInformation Superhighway\u201d as trucks labeled \u201cBell Atlantic\u201d and \u201cAT&amp;T\u201d passed by. On August 21, 2008, the NLRB deferred to the arbitration award in favor of Bell Atlantic, and the union now petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Although the union concedes that the first three conditions for deference are satisfied, it contends that the fourth is not. We cannot conclude, however, that the Board abused its discretion in ruling that, \u201calthough the Road Kill shirt was protected under Section 7, it was not repugnant or \u2018palpably wrong\u2019 for the arbitrator to find that employees\u2019 Section 7 interests may give way to the Respondent\u2019s legitimate interests in protecting its public image under the circumstances of this case.\u201d 339 N.L.R.B. No. 139, at 4, 2003 WL 22012216 (2003) (J.A. 4); <em>see NLRB v. Mead Corp., </em>73 F.3d 74, 79 (6th Cir.1996) (noting that an employer may restrict its workers\u2019 right to wear union apparel in \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d which may arise when employees have significant contact with customers, when the apparel denigrates the company\u2019s business, and when the \u201cslogans are patently offensive or vulgar\u201d). In concluding that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was not repugnant or palpably wrong, the NLRB did not \u2014 and did not have to \u2014 decide whether it would have reached the same result on its own. <em>See Utility Workers, </em>39 F.3d at 1214. Neither, of course, do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
