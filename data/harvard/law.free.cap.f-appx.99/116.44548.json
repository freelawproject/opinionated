Reviewing the district court\u2019s confirmation of the arbitration award \u201clike any other district court decision ... accepting findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous but deciding questions of law de novo,\u201d <em>Coutee v. Barington Capital Group, L.P., </em>336 F.3d 1128, 1132 (9th Cir.2003), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-16\">An arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the issues submitted is entitled to deference, as is the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of the issues he deems submitted. <em>Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n Local Union No. 359 v. Madison Indus., Inc. of Arizona, </em>84 F.3d 1186, 1190 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Pack Concrete, Inc. v. Cunningham, </em>866 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir.1989). Thus, \u201ccourts are not at liberty to substitute their own interpretation of the parties\u2019 submission for that of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Ass\u2019n of W. Pulp &amp; Paper Workers, Local 78 v. Rexam Graphic, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1085, 1089 (9th Cir.2000). Further, although the common law doctrine of <em>functus officio </em>prohibits an arbitrator from redetermining an arbitration award, see <em>McClatchy Newspapers v. Cent. Valley Typographical Union No. 46, </em>686 F.2d 731, 734 (9th Cir. 1982), \u201can arbitrator <em>can </em>correct a mistake which is apparent on the face of his award, complete an arbitration if the award is not complete, and clarify an ambiguity in the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734 n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-17\">For the reasons expressed by the district court, we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in concluding that the issues submitted to him included the issue of starting time for dragline crews. We also agree with the district court that the arbitrator was not <em>functus officio </em>when he addressed this issue in his May 2001 letter because that letter merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>clarified the arbitrator\u2019s ambiguous April 2000 ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
