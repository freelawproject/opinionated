James Martin appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit against the State of Nevada Employment Security Division, Nevada Equal Rights Commission and Carlos Romo (collectively the \u201cDivision\u201d). The district court granted the Division summary judgment, finding that Martin had failed to exhaust administrative remedies in a timely fashion. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-18\">To establish federal subject matter jurisdiction over his Title VII claim, Martin was required to exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a timely charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(b); <em>see B.K.B. v. Maui Police Dept, </em>276 F.3d 1091, 1099 (9th Cir.2002). The EEOC charge must be filed within 180 days \u201cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(l). If the plaintiff institutes proceedings with a state or local agency \u201cwith authority to grant or seek relief from such practice,\u201d the period of limitations for filing a charge with the EEOC is extended to 300 days. <em>Id. </em>The parties disagree as to whether Martin qualified for the longer limitations period. Because Martin\u2019s charge was untimely even if he were entitled to 300 days, we need <em>not </em>resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>\u201cA claim accrues when a plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d <em>Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 926 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999)) (brackets omitted). In determining when an act occurs for statute of limitations purposes, \u201cthe question is when the operative decision was made, not when the decision is carried out.\u201d <em>RK Ventures, Inc. v. City of Seattle, </em>307 F.3d 1045, 1059 (2002). The statute of limitations began to run at the latest on May 25, 2001, when Martin received a certified letter informing him that he was terminated effective June 1, 2001, because that letter was \u201cadequately final and represented the [Division\u2019s] \u2018official position.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1060 (quoting <em>Delaware State Coll. v. Ricks, </em>449 U.S. 250, 261, 101 S.Ct. 498, 66 L.Ed.2d 431 (1980)). Martin therefore filed his EEOC charge four days too late (March 25, 2002), even if he were entitled to the longer 300-day period, which would have expired March 21, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Martin for the first time in a supplemental memorandum asserted that he was entitled to equitable tolling. This claim is waived because Martin did not pursue it before the district court. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Martin\u2019s lawsuit for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. Our determination is without prejudice to any state claims that Martin may bring in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The Division\u2019s motion to strike is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b871-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
