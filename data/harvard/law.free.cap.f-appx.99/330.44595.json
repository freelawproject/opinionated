The action alleged various state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On April 26, 1996, Chrysler moved to dismiss Appellee\u2019s Amended Complaint, which the district court (Deborah A. Batts, <em>Judge) </em>granted in a Memorandum and Order dated March 27, 1997 (\u201cDismissal Order\u201d). <em>See Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>172 F.R.D. 96 (S.D.N.Y.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">On December 4, 1997, Chrysler moved for sanctions against Appellee\u2019s counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, on grounds that Appellee filed a frivolous class action. Appellee\u2019s counsel opposed the motion, and cross-moved for sanctions pursuant to Section 1927 on grounds that Chrysler\u2019s motion was frivolous and vexatious.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In a Memorandum and Order dated August 14, 1998 (\u201cSanctions Order\u201d), the district court denied Chrysler\u2019s motion, granted Appellee\u2019s cross-motion, and imposed sanctions on Chrysler and its counsel, Bryan Cave LLP. <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 96 Civ. 2245(DAB), 1998 WL 477725, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 14, 1998). Chrysler and Bryan Cave LLP (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">On July 26, 2001, while maintaining jurisdiction over the appeal, this Court entered judgment vacating the district court\u2019s Sanctions Order and remanding the case to the district court for \u201cadditional findings and reasoning as appropriate, ...\u201d <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 98-9233, 2001 WL 868672 (2d Cir. July 26, 2001) (\u201cInformal Remand Order\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994)) (discussing this Court\u2019s use of informal remand orders). Specifically, this Court held that \u201cthe district court did not reach the question of whether Chrysler\u2019s motion was \u2018entirely merit-less\u2019 ... [n]or did it discuss in sufficient detail its reasons for concluding that Chrysler\u2019s motion was made \u2018for improper purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">On remand, the district court issued an Order (\u201cSupplemental Findings Order\u201d), dated November 6, 2001, setting forth additional factual findings supporting its imposition of sanctions. Appellants moved, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s Supplemental Findings Order in light of new documentary evidence, specifically, an affidavit from Chrysler\u2019s counsel with exhibits purportedly demonstrating that its motion for sanctions was not improperly motivated. The district court reviewed and considered Chrysler\u2019s documents, but nonetheless denied the motion for reconsideration by Order dated May 20, 2002 (\u201cReconsideration Order\u201d). <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 96-2245 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">By letter dated July 2, 2002, Appellants requested this Court to reactivate its appeal and to permit supplementation of the record with documents relating to Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">As an initial matter, we informally remanded this case to the district court while retaining appellate jurisdiction over it. Finding all conditions satisfied for restoring appellate jurisdiction, we now reactivate this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Addressing Appellants\u2019 request to supplement the record on appeal, we acknowledge that Fed. R.App. P. 10(e) permits supplementation when it will \u201cclarif[y] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>our understanding of the process by which the District Judge reached the decision challenged on appeal.\u201d <em>Salinger v. Random, House, Inc., </em>818 F.2d 252, 253 (2d Cir.1987) (per curiam). The documents offered by Appellants address the limited issue of whether the <em>timing </em>of its motion for sanctions evinces an improper or vexatious motivation. The district court considered the documents and made clear that, although the timing of the motion was a factor it considered, it was but part and parcel to a \u201cconfluence of circumstances\u201d which led it to conclude that sanctions were warranted. <em>Weaver v. Chrysler Corp., </em>No. 96-2245 at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 6, 2001). Because we find that the record amply supports the district court\u2019s conclusion and supplementation of the record would not serve to clarify our understanding at this stage, Appellants\u2019 request to supplement is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, in light of the district court\u2019s additional findings and articulated reasoning, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed sanctions on Appellants pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. <em>See Revson v. Cinque &amp; Cinque, P.C., </em>221 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 143, 154 (2d Cir.1997)). Any shortcomings apparent in the district court\u2019s Sanctions Order were adequately addressed in its Supplemental Findings Order. Accordingly, we rescind our Informal Remand Order and affirm the district court\u2019s Sanctions Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the August 14, 1998 Sanctions Order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
