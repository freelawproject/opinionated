We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petitions for review because the Mishustins\u2019 due process, statutory, and regulatory arguments fail and because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The Mishustins contend that BIA\u2019s \u201cstreamlining\u201d procedures, under which a single member of the BIA can affirm without opinion an IJ\u2019s decision, violated their statutory, regulatory, and due process rights. We disagree. \u201c[Sjtreamlining does not violate an alien\u2019s due process rights.\u201d <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848 (9th Cir.2003). The Mishustins have not demonstrated that the streamlining procedures violate any regulatory or statutory provisions. <em>See id. </em>at 850 (streamlining procedure provides aliens with \u201call of the administrative appeals to which they were entitled by statute\u201d; \u201c \u2018[n]or does the scheme violate any statute\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Albathani v. I.N.S., </em>318 F.3d 365, 377 (1st Cir.2003))).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The Mishustins claim that the Acting BIA Chairperson \u201cengaged in unlawful rulemaking without publication and comment, in violation of \u00a7 533 of the Administrative Procedures Act,\u201d when she issued memoranda designating certain categories of cases as suitable for streamlined review. This issue is moot. Those memoranda were issued before the August 26, 2002 revision to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1, which became effective two months before the BIA\u2019s decision in the Mishustins\u2019 case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(e) (2003) (assigning virtually all cases to single Board member, rather than a three member panel, for disposition); <em>Capital Area Immigrant\u2019s Rights Coalition v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>264 F.Supp.2d 14, 31 n. 14 (D.D.C.2003) (APA challenge to memoranda moot because \u201c[t]he final streamlining regulation, which became effective September 2[5], 2002, amends and thus supercedes the 1999 streamlining regulation ... pursuant to which the acting chairman issued the three memoranda\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The Mishustins also argue that the BIA improperly applied the streamlining procedures to this case. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche. See </em>350 F.3d at 855 (\u201c[W]here we can reach the merits of the decision by the IJ or the BIA, an additional review of the streamlining decision itself would be superfluous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final agency decision that we review. <em>See id. </em>at 849; <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). We review the administrative record to determine whether substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that the Mishustins were not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>See Thomas v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1169, 1174 (9th Cir.2004) (asylum and withholding of removal); <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 442 (9th Cir.2003) (CAT). We will only reverse if the evidence the Mishustins presented was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d in their favor. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 484, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The evidence must do more than support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>finding in the Mishustins\u2019 favor, it must compel it. <em>Id. </em>at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. at 815 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the Mishustins are not eligible for asylum because the mistreatment Oleg Mishustin suffered did not constitute past persecution, Oleg Mishustin\u2019s fears of future persecution were not objectively well-founded, there was no nexus between the mistreatment and any protected ground, and Oleg Mishustin was not a member of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d simply because he was a practitioner of non-traditional medicine who contracted with his government and then sought to terminate that relationship. <em>See Prasad v. I.N.S., 47 </em>F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995) (not compelled to find past persecution when applicant was stopped at a roadblock, hit and kicked without receiving serious injury, taken to jail cell and questioned, and released after a few hours); <em>see also Kozulin v. I.N.S., </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1117-18 (9th Cir.2000) (insufficient proof of future persecution based on applicant leaving Russia and seeking asylum). The evidence presented does not compel us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Because there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that the Mishustins are ineligible for asylum, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s finding that the Mishustins are ineligible for withholding of deportation. <em>See Ghaly v. I.N.S., </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201c[Fjailure to satisfy the lesser standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily results in a failure to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of deportation as well.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that it is not \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Oleg Mishustin would be tortured if he returned to Russia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2003); <em>see also Malhi v. I.N.S., </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir. 2003). The evidence does not compel us to find to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
