We affirm Klopfs convictions for unlawful use of identification documents and clarify the intent element necessary for proving a violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3) as well as the effect on interstate or foreign commerce required for conviction under both statutes. Because Klopfs sentence for conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(3) exceeds the statutory maximum, we vacate his sentence in its entirety and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-9\">Klopf was indicted for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(3), possessing with intent to use unlawfully five or more fraudulent identification documents, (\u201cCount I\u201d), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2), using unauthorized access devices with the intent to defraud, (\u201cCount II\u201d). The fraudulent identification documents consisted of approximately sixteen Florida driver\u2019s licenses bearing Klopfs picture alongside identifying information for several other individuals, while the access devices were credit cards in the names of individuals identified as A.G., M.E.H., R.J.A., and G.S.Z. These individuals were later identified as Allen Gould, Martin Hanaka, Robert J. Adamson, and Gary Zack, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-13\">At trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Barry Golden, of the United States Marshal\u2019s Service, testified that, at the time when Klopf was arrested, he searched Klopfs vehicle and recovered (1) a credit card purportedly issued to Martin Hanaka of United Equity Leasing Service, (2) a printout from a public records database with identifying information for Hanaka, including address, Social Security number, birth date, and driver\u2019s license number, (3) a Visa credit card issued by Bank One to Gary Zack of Integrated Data Concepts, (4) a printout of identifying information for Zack, (5) a MasterCard credit card issued by Advanta Bank to Robert J. Adamson of United Equity Leasing Service, and (6) a printout of identifying information for Adamson. Golden further testified that, at the time of his arrest, Klopf was living in an apartment that he had rented under the name of Garrett Bender. During a search of Klopfs apartment, Golden observed a number of plastic storage containers. In these containers were folders, which held identifying information and various documents pertaining to several individuals, including Bender, Gould, Hanaka, Zack, Joseph Rebak, Scott Woolley, Steven Sponder, Michael Becker, Michael Wer-theimer, and Michael Hoover. Golden also testified that he recovered a package, addressed to Robert J. Adamson, that was delivered to a Storage USA facility, where Klopf had rented storage and office space under the name of \u201cGarrett.\u201d Additionally, the government introduced into evidence Klopfs Storage USA application, which showed that he had rented the facility under the name of Bender, using Bender\u2019s driver\u2019s license number.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>Zack, president of Engineer Glass Systems, testified that he did not know Klopf and never had allowed Klopf to use his identity. R5 at 194. Zack testified that he was not affiliated with a company named Integrated Data Concepts and did not apply for the Bank One credit card that was found in Klopfs possession. When shown a $4,500 check that was purportedly written by him, he testified that the signature on the check was not his. <em>Id. </em>at 198. Hanaka, chairman of the board of Sports Authority, likewise testified that he never had allowed Klopf to use his identity to apply for credit cards. <em>Id. </em>at 201. He testified that he was not associated with United Equity and Leasing Service and never had applied for the Capital One credit card that was discovered in Klopfs possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\">Leo Johnson testified that he had made several fraudulent Florida driver\u2019s licenses at Klopfs request. <em>Id. </em>at 214. Johnson testified that, although the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses were not perfect replicas of actual Florida licenses, they were passable to an untrained person. Johnson stated that these fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses exhibited Klopfs picture and identifying information for other individuals, which was obtained from a public records database. Johnson testified that the licenses contained the actual Florida driver\u2019s license numbers for the identified individuals. Johnson also provided Klopf with fraudulent supporting documents, including Social Security cards, voter registration cards, utility bills, and American Express credit cards. The purpose of the supporting documentation was to \u201cadd[ ] value and weight\u201d to the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses. <em>Id. </em>at 230. Johnson testified that Klopf purchased approximately thirty sets of documentation and requested the supporting documents in order to obtain a \u201cfull wallet\u201d of identifying documents for the same individual. <em>Id. </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">Kelly Carrick, of the Florida Highway Patrol Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Driver\u2019s License Fraud Task Force, testified as an expert in the detection of fraudulent Florida driver\u2019s licenses. Trooper Carrick testified that the driver\u2019s licenses found in Klopfs apartment contained identifying information for Woolley, Bender, Rebak, Hoover, Becker, David Ruttenberg, Steven Sponder, and Brad McBride. <em>Id. </em>at 254-63. When she checked the information from the licenses against the information contained in the Florida Highway Patrol\u2019s database, she discovered that the pictures and certain information did not match, and, therefore, concluded that the licenses were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">On cross-examination, Trooper Carrick testified that (1) none of the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses contained the holograms that appear on valid Florida driver\u2019s licenses; (2) the magnetic stripes were not encoded with the appropriate identifying information; and (3) each contained several other defects that indicated that they were not valid licenses. Trooper Carrick further testified that the licenses were poor replicas and that she had \u201cseen a lot better.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274. She testified, however, that an untrained officer might not recognize the driver\u2019s licenses as fraudulent, especially considering the fact that the hologram on a valid Florida license potentially can erode. On redirect, Trooper Carrick testified that the average lay person would believe that the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses were valid Florida driver\u2019s licenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-8\">Clayton Warmer, of Advanta Bank Corporation, testified that (1) the credit card bearing Adamson\u2019s name was a valid card issued by Advanta; (2) the Adamson account had a credit limit of $12,500, and $10,733.74, less finance charges, had been charged to the account; and (3) the Adam-son account was closed and written off as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>a fraud loss. <em>Id. </em>at 286-94. Warmer additionally testified that a credit card bearing Gould\u2019s name was a valid card issued by Advanta. He stated that Advanta incurred a total loss of $14,431.25 as a result of charges made on the Gould account. <em>Id. </em>at 300. He testified that Advanta\u2019s account statements are processed in, and mailed from, Nebraska. On cross-examination, Warmer testified that the Adam-son and Gould accounts were not closed until Advanta was contacted by United States Marshals, who informed them that the accounts had been implicated in a fraud investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 306-08. Wari-ner testified that the Adamson account was delinquent at that time, but that the Gould account was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Leslie Godden, of Bank One, testified that approximately $9,161.76 in charges were made using the credit card issued in Zack\u2019s name. <em>Id. </em>at 325. On cross-examination, Godden testified that the Zack account was closed in March 2003 because it was deemed to be fraudulent following notification by United States Marshals. Gould testified that he never had given Klopf permission to use his identifying information in order to obtain a credit card. <em>Id. </em>at 335. Elaine Kolar, a teller at the Wachovia bank located near Klopfs apartment, testified that three ATM withdrawals were made at her bank using the Gould credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">William Schulz, of the United States Secret Service, testified that several of the credit cards found in Klopfs possession were used on numerous occasions at Mark\u2019s Chop House in Jupiter, Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 361-62. Schulz testified that he visited Mark\u2019s Chop House and spoke with its owner, Mark Bendeck. Subsequently, Bendeck testified that Schulz showed him a series of photographs and asked if he recognized any of the individuals. Bedeck stated that he recognized one of the individuals pictured as a person, whom he knew as Allen, then later as Gary, who had visited the restaurant eight to twelve times. R6 at 387. Bendeck testified that Mark\u2019s Chop House is located two to three miles from Klopfs apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-7\">At the close of the government\u2019s case-in-chief, Klopf moved for a judgment of acquittal and argued that, (1) with regard to Count I, the government failed to prove that he intended to use the fraudulent identification documents for an unlawful purpose; and, (2) with regard to Count II, the government failed to prove that he used unauthorized access devices with the intent to defraud. The district judge denied his motion. The only evidence presented by Klopf in his defense was a stipulation that the Hanaka credit card account was open as of February 14, 2003, the date of Klopfs arrest, with a payment due on March 11, 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 421. Klopf then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-8\">Klopf requested a jury instruction informing the jurors that, to find him guilty on Count I, they must identify and name a specific offense that he intended to commit with the fraudulent identification documents in his possession. Klopf contended that the government could not prove that he intended to use the fraudulent identification documents unlawfully without identifying a specific law that his intended use would have violated. The district judge denied the request and found that our circuit\u2019s pattern jury instruction for a violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3) was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-9\">In his closing argument, Klopf maintained that possessing a counterfeit driver\u2019s license is not illegal unless there is a corresponding intent to use it unlawfully. Klopf argued that the government had failed to prove that he intended to use the fraudulent identification documents at all, much less for an unlawful purpose. The jury returned a guilty verdict for Klopf on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer grouped Klopfs offenses together and set the base offense level at 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a) (2003). The probation officer added the following enhancements to the base offense level: (1) a ten-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F), because the amount of the loss was between $120,000 and $200,000; (2) a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(8)(C), because the offense involved the use of sophisticated means; (3) a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C)(ii), because the offense involved \u201cthe possession of five or more means of identification that unlawfully were produced from, or obtained by the use of, another means of identification\u201d; (4) a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), because Klopf was the leader or organizer of a criminal enterprise involving five or more participants; and (5) a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, for obstruction of justice. With a total offense level of 26, and a criminal history category of VI, Klopfs Sentencing Guidelines range was 120 to 150 months of imprisonment. The PSI states that the maximum statutory sentence authorized was fifteen years for Count I and ten years for Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">The PSI also shows that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(a) and (b)(2), the sentencing court was permitted to impose a term of supervised release of up to three years. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(a), however, the judge was required to order supervised release for not more than three years if he imposed a term of imprisonment of more than one year. The PSI additionally states that Klopf is required to pay restitution to the victims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l) and that the total restitution owed is $104,865.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-10\">Klopf objected to all of the sentencing enhancements and argued that they were unlawful under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because they increased his sentence based on facts stated in the PSI, which were neither admitted by him nor proved to the jury. At the sentencing hearing, the district judge overruled this objection. The government moved for an upward departure, which the judge reluctantly denied because he concluded that nothing in Klopfs case rendered it outside of the heartland for identity-theft cases. The judge further stated that he would have granted an upward departure, if he had been permitted to do so because he believed that Klopf deserved the harshest sentence available. The district judge sentenced Klopf to concurrent sentences of 150 months of imprisonment on Count I, and 120 months of imprisonment on Count II. Additionally, the judge imposed a three-year term of supervised release and ordered Klopf to pay $104,865.14 in restitution. On appeal, Klopf challenges his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-12\">A. <em>Conviction for Possession of Fraudulent Identification Documents</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ae9\">Klopf argues that the government failed to prove (1) that he intended to use the sixteen fraudulent Florida driver\u2019s licenses found in his possession for an unlawful purpose, or (2) that his possession of those licenses had any affect on interstate or foreign commerce. Klopf contends that a conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(3) \u25a0 requires proof that (1) his intended use of the fraudulent identification documents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cvio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>lated a particular federal, state, or local law,\u201d and (2) his \u201cactual use\u201d of the fraudulent identification documents affected interstate or foreign commerce. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. He argues that the government failed to prove either of these elements. Specifically, Klopf contends that, because the government failed to prove that he ever used fraudulent identification documents in any manner, it could not possibly have proven that his actual use of the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses affected interstate or foreign commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">We review a defendant\u2019s challenge to sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo. United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). \u201cThe evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if, \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cIn determining whether sufficient evidence supports a defendant\u2019s conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Chirinos, </em>112 F.3d 1089, 1095 (11th Cir.1997). Where the government relies on circumstantial evidence, \u201creasonable inferences, and not mere speculation, must support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1557 (11th <em>Cir.</em>1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-10\">To convict a defendant for possession with intent to use unlawfully five or more false identification documents, in violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3), the government must prove three elements: \u201c(1) the defendant knowingly possessed five or more false identification documents, (2) the defendant had the willful intent to transfer the false identification documents unlawfully, and (3) the defendant\u2019s possession of the false identification documents was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Alejandro, </em>118 F.3d 1518, 1521 (11th Cir.1997); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(a)(3), (c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-11\">Klopf concedes that the government proved the first element of the offense, but he challenges the other two elements. With regard to the second element, the evidence presented at trial demonstrated that (1) Klopf possessed valid credit cards in the names of several individuals, who had not given him permission to use their information, and had charged over $30,000 to those accounts; (2) he pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>sessed sixteen fraudulent Florida driver\u2019s licenses, with supporting documentation that bore his picture and the identifying information of other individuals; (3) although the names on the driver\u2019s licenses did not match the names on the credit cards, identifying information and documents pertaining to the individuals named on the credit cards were found in plastic containers in Klopf s apartment, along with information relating to the individuals named on the driver\u2019s licenses; and (4) he had requested and obtained fraudulent supporting documentation for the individuals named on the driver\u2019s licenses, in order to create a \u201cfull wallet\u201d of identifying documents purporting to belong to the same individual. Based on this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could infer that Klopf intended to obtain valid credit cards bearing the same names as those on the driver\u2019s licenses, and, if he was ever questioned about his identity while attempting to use one of the credit cards, he could then use his fraudulent driver\u2019s license to verify that he was the individual named on the credit card. Such use would be unlawful, because it would violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) concerning fraud related to access devices. Accordingly, sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding that Klopf intended to use the fraudulent identification documents for an unlawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-5\">Concerning the third element, the effect on interstate or foreign commerce, the following facts were proved at trial: (1) Klopf rented a storage facility under the name Bender; (2) Klopf possessed two fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses bearing Bender\u2019s name and identifying information; (3) the number on the driver\u2019s license matched the number entered on the application for the storage facility; and (4) Klopf used the storage facility to receive mail, including unauthorized credit cards and account statements. Given these facts, a reasonable factfinder could infer that Klopf used one of the fraudulent identification documents to verify his identity when applying for the storage facility, and, in turn, used that facility to receive mail in connection with a credit-card scheme that had a significant effect on interstate commerce. Because it would be reasonable for a factfinder to make this inference, sufficient evidence supports Klopf s conviction for Count I as to the second element of proof. <em>See Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A), \u201c[t]he circumstance referred to in subsection (a) of this section is that ... the production, transfer, possession, or use prohibited by this section is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the legislative history for this statute, the Fourth Circuit noted \u201cthat Congress intended \u2018to provide broad Federal jurisdiction over violations of this section\u2019 by requiring that only a \u2018minimal nexus with interstate or foreign commerce be shown.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Pearce, </em>65 F.3d 22, 25 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 802, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1982), <em>reprinted in, </em>1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3519, 3532-33). By requiring the government to prove a minimal connection to interstate commerce in a \u00a7 1028(a) case, this statute, in contrast to those in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), which did not contain jurisdictional requirements, contains a sufficient jurisdictional requirement to overcome a Commerce Clause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> challenge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>In the context of a Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, prosecution, our court has held that, because of the interstate commerce jurisdictional element, \u201cthe Government only needs to establish a minimal effect on interstate commerce to support a violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Castleberry, </em>116 F.3d 1384, 1387 (11th Cir.1997) (collecting cases from other circuits adopting the minimal-effect standard for interstate commerce under the Hobbs Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Relying on the legislative history of \u00a7 1028, the Fourth Circuit held that, to prove a violation under \u00a7 1028(a), the government need demonstrate only a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d between the fraudulent identification and interstate or foreign commerce. <em>Pearce, </em>65 F.3d at 24-25. In <em>Pearce, </em>the Fourth Circuit cited with approval the Sixth Circuit\u2019s upholding a jury instruction requiring only \u201c \u2018an intent to do acts which, if complete, would have affected interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pearce, </em>65 F.3d at 25 (quoting <em>United States v. Gros, </em>824 F.2d 1487, 1494-95 (6th Cir.1987)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1230-8\">The Eighth Circuit also has given \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A) an expansive interpretation by noting that \u201cthe statute presents two options: possession may be \u2018in\u2019 interstate commerce or it may \u2018affect\u2019 interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>155 F.3d 942, 947 (8th Cir.1998). The <em>Jackson </em>court concluded that the government demonstrates that possession of unlawful identity documents, such as stolen driver\u2019s licenses, affected interstate commerce by proof that possession \u201cwas integral to [defendant\u2019s] scheme to defraud businesses and banks operating in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, fraudulently inducing a bank to issue a credit card through fraudulent identification documentation would be sufficient evidence of a \u00a7 1028(a) violation to satisfy \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">The Fifth Circuit has addressed whether a defendant\u2019s criminal act involving a fraudulent identification document must actually affect interstate or foreign commerce to satisfy the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A) or whether criminal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>tent is sufficient. Upholding the defendant\u2019s conviction for violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(2), transfer of a fraudulent identification document, and specifically addressing the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A) of affecting interstate or foreign commerce, the Fifth Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1231-5\">When we decide whether a transfer of an identification document or false identification ... for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028, is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce, we must assume the accused completed his intended goals .... [W]e do not focus on whether the identification document actually traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or whether the transfer actually affected interstate or foreign commerce. Rather, <em>we focus on whether the identification document would have traveled in interstate or foreign commerce or whether the transfer ivould have affected interstate or foreign commerce if [the defendant] had successfully accomplished his intended goals.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\"><em>United States v. Villarreal, </em>253 F.3d 831, 834, 835 (5th Cir.2001) (emphasis added); <em>see Pearce, </em>65 F.3d at 25 (concluding that the jurisdictional element of affecting interstate commerce is satisfied if the intended criminal act would affect interstate commerce adversely).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">Based on the reasoning of the cited cases from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Circuits, we now hold that the government must prove only a minimal nexus with interstate commerce in a \u00a7 1028(a) prosecution to satisfy the \u201cin or affects interstate or foreign commerce\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A). The defendant need have had only the intent to accomplish acts, which, if successful, would have affected interstate or foreign commerce. The government, however, is not required to prove that the defendant had knowledge of the interstate commerce nexus when he committed an act in violation of \u00a7 1028(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-12\">In this case, Klopf s possession of fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses was an integral part of his identity-theft scheme, and sufficient evidence supports a finding that, even if he had not done so already, he intended to use those driver\u2019s licenses in a manner that would have affected interstate commerce significantly, satisfying \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A). Therefore, we affirm Klopf s conviction on Count I for violating \u00a7 1028(a) because sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that he possessed five or more fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses and intended to use them for an unlawful purpose, which would affect interstate or foreign commerce under \u00a7 1028(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-13\">B. <em>Conviction for Use of Unauthorized Access Devices</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1231-14\">Klopf argues that his conviction on Count II for use of unauthorized access devices under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2) was improper because the government failed to prove that he acted with the requisite intent to defraud.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Klopf maintains that he did nothing more than \u201cborrow[ ] the creditworthiness of unsuspecting individuals to open corporate accounts in order to utilize credit cards because he was unable to apply for credit cards under his own name because of his fugitive status.\u201d Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>lant\u2019s Br. at 21. Klopf further contends that, since he had made regular payments on the credit card accounts, and all accounts were active at the time of his arrest, he did not possess the requisite intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">To convict a defendant for use of unauthorized access devices, in violation of \u00a7 1029(a)(2), the government must prove that the defendant: (1) \u201cknowingly\u201d used \u201cone or more unauthorized access devices,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) \u201cwith intent to defraud,\u201d (3) to obtain anything having an aggregate value of \u201c$1,000 or more\u201d during a one-year period, and (4) such use \u201caffect[ed] interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2). \u201cIntent to defraud has often been defined as \u2018the specific intent to deceive or cheat, for the purpose of either causing some financial loss to another, or bringing about some financial gain to one\u2019s self.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peden, </em>556 F.2d 278, 280 (5th Cir.1977) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">In this case, the evidence presented at trial and Klopfs own admissions show that he acted with the requisite intent to defraud. He (1) obtained credit cards from various banks, (2) by purporting to be and using the identifying information of other individuals with better credit ratings, (3) without the knowledge or permission of those individuals or the issuing banks, and (4) subsequently used those credit cards to make numerous purchases and cash withdrawals totaling more than $30,000 during a one-year period. Klopf clearly intended to deceive the banks into believing that he was the individual named on the various credit cards issued to him. The credit cards involved in this case were unauthorized access devices within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(3) because they were \u201cobtained with intent to defraud.\u201d Id. It is irrelevant that he subsequently made payments on the cards because, in each application for a credit card, he intended to defraud the banks by representing to them that they were dealing with persons other than himself. <em>See Peden, </em>556 F.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-10\">Concerning the requirement that the access-device fraud affect interstate or foreign commerce, credit cards generally are issued to applicants by out-of-state financial institutions, and credit-card account numbers travel across state lines, both electronically and by mail. By making purchases and withdrawals with the fraudulently obtained credit cards, Kloph engaged in interstate financial transactions. We conclude that a reasonable fact-finder could have found that Klopf used the fraudulently obtained credit cards with the intent to defraud the issuing banks both by acquiring the credit cards and using them for purchases and cash withdrawals amounting to more than $30,000 within a year. Consequently, the jury additionally would have found that these transactions affected interstate commerce. Therefore, sufficient evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>Klopfs conviction for use of unauthorized access devices as charged in Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\">C. <em>Requested Jury Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Klopf argues that the district judge abused his discretion by denying Klopfs requested jury instruction, which would have informed the jury that it could not find him guilty of unauthorized use of fraudulent identification documents unless it identified a specific unlawful offense that he had intended to commit. Klopf contends that, to convict him of a violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3), the government was required to prove (1) the particular intended use for which he possessed the fraudulent identification documents, and (2) that the intended use would have violated a particular federal, state, or local law. Klopf argues that the jury should not have been permitted to rely on \u201ccommon sense\u201d in order to determine whether his intended use was unlawful, but, rather, should have been informed as to precisely which law his intended conduct would have violated. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>308 F.3d 1147, 1153 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). \u201cA trial judge\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction will warrant a new trial only if (1) the requested instruction was substantively correct, (2) the court\u2019s charge to the jury did not cover the gist of the instruction, and (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In deciding whether a defendant\u2019s requested instruction was substantially covered by the actual charge delivered to the jury, we \u201cneed only ascertain whether the charge, when viewed as a whole, fairly and correctly states the issues and the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>975 F.2d 1514, 1517 (11th Cir.1992) (determining that the trial judge abused his discretion by not giving defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction resulting in the jury\u2019s considering the evidence without the instruction, which caused the defendant to be \u201cseriously impaired from presenting an effective defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-9\">Our circuit has not addressed whether a violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3) must include a reference to the specific law that a defendant\u2019s intended conduct would have violated. The Fourth Circuit reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(3) because the district court had failed to instruct the jury that her intended conduct must have violated a particular law. <em>United States v. Rohn, </em>964 F.2d 310, 313-14 (4th Cir.1992). The Fourth Circuit reasoned that, to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(3), \u201cit is necessary that the jury be instructed by the district court that particular conduct would have violated a specific law,\u201d and further stated that that requirement \u201ccould have been satisfied by, for example, an instruction that presenting a false driver\u2019s license to a police officer violates a law of a state in which appellant could be expected to drive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-10\">The District of Columbia Circuit, however, determined that the jury instructions were sufficient where the defendant was charged with violating both \u00a7 1028(a)(3) and \u00a7 1029(a)(2). <em>United States v. Kayode, </em>254 F.3d 204, 213 (D.C.Cir.2001). The D.C. Circuit distinguished <em>Rohn </em>because, unlike the defendant in <em>Rohn, </em>who was charged only with a violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3), the defendant in <em>Kayode </em>also was charged with violating \u00a7 1029(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the D.C. Circuit concluded that the instructions included a specific law that the defendant\u2019s intended conduct would have violated, and, therefore, the instructions were sufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>Although the circumstances of this case appear nearly identical to those in <em>Kayode, </em>Klopf attempts to distinguish that case based on the fact that none of the names on the driver\u2019s licenses found in Klopf s apartment matched the names on any of the credit cards, whereas, in <em>Kay-ode, </em>the defendant had both a credit card and a driver\u2019s license in the name of the same person. While this distinction may have made the evidence in <em>Kayode </em>more compelling, it does not follow that the district judge\u2019s instruction was insufficient in this case. As we have explained, the evidence presented at trial permitted a reasonable jury to infer that Klopf intended to use the driver\u2019s licenses as supporting documentation in order to facilitate the use of fraudulently obtained credit cards. The only difference between this case and <em>Kay-ode </em>is that Klopf was apprehended before he had the opportunity to obtain credit cards bearing the names of individuals for whom he had fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses. In both cases, however, \u201cthe jury was adequately informed both of \u2018the uses to which [the] appellant intended to put the identifications\u2019 and that the \u2018intended uses would violate one or more federal ... laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rohn, </em>964 F.2d at 313).</p>\n<p id=\"b1234-4\">Klopfs requested instruction that the district judge declined to <em>give </em>states: \u201cIn order to convict the Defendant of Count I Fraudulent Identification Documents the Government must [p]rove beyond a [r]ea-sonable doubt that the Defendant intended an unlawful use of the driver[\u2019]s licenses!,] the unlawful use being Rl-51 (citing <em>Rohn). </em>The jury instructions given by the judge as to Counts I and II were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-6\">Now, <em>Title 18, United States Code, Section 1028(a)(8) makes it a federal crime or offense for anyone to knowingly possess with the intent to unlawfully use five or more false identification documents, such possession being in or affecting interstate commerce.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-8\">\n<em>The defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-9\">First: That the defendant possessed five or more false identification documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1234-10\">Second: That the defendant did so knowingly and willfully with the intent to unlawfully use the false identification documents;

By using blank lines for the description of the unlawful use of the fraudulently obtained driver\u2019s licenses, he implicitly intended for the district judge to complete those lines or to use his own description for the jury in explaining Klopfs intended unlawful use. Consequently, he cannot now complain concerning the judge\u2019s instructions regarding Klopfs intended unlawful use of the fraudulently obtained driver\u2019s licenses. Consistent with our analysis of unlawful intent as to violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3), Klopfs <em>intended </em>fraudulent use of the false driver\u2019s licenses was sufficient to violate \u00a7 1028(a)(3), even though this intended unlawful use had not been completed. His obtaining five or more fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses to use for an unlawful identification purpose in conjunction with fraudulently obtained credit cards under \u00a7 1029(a)(2), which was apparent from the evidence at trial, was sufficient to support his conviction under \u00a7 1028(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-16\">Second, the district judge\u2019s explanation to the jury regarding the acts necessary for violation of both \u00a7 1028(a)(3) and \u00a7 1029(a)(2) are correct statements of those statutes, and the examples he gives clearly explain acts that would constitute violation of the respective statutes. The judge also makes clear that these are federal statutes and that the elements of each of the charged crimes must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Third, we agree with the D.C. Circuit that, by being charged with both fraud relating to possession of identification documents and use of unauthorized access devices, in contrast to <em>Rohn, </em>the jury was aware of the entire unlawful scheme. \u201cThus, the jury was adequately informed both of \u2018the uses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>which appellant intended to put the identifications\u2019 and that the \u2018intended uses would violate one or more federal ... laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kayode, </em>254 F.3d at 213 (quoting <em>Rohn, </em>964 F.2d at 313).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-4\">Therefore, Klopfs incomplete, requested instruction was covered in more detail by the charge delivered to the jurors, which (1) instructed them that they must find that Klopfs possession and intended use of the fraudulent driver\u2019s licenses was unlawful, and (2) informed them what conduct would have violated \u00a7 1028(a)(3). Klopfs incomplete requested instruction was more fully covered by the charge that the judge delivered to the jury, specifically with the instructions relating to violations of both \u00a7 1028(a)(3) and \u00a7 1029(a)(2), which worked in conjunction in this case. Klopf was not impaired whatsoever in his ability to present an effective defense to \u00a7 1028(a)(3). We conclude that instructions like those delivered in this case, in which the trial judge explained the elements of violating \u00a7 1028(a)(3) and \u00a7 1029(a)(2), and further described for the jury unlawful acts that violate both statutes, are sufficient instructions. Consequently, the district judge did not abuse his discretion by denying Klopfs incomplete, requested jury instruction concerning \u00a7 1028(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">D. <em>Sentencing Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">Klopf raises sentencing issues on appeal that challenge his sentencing enhancements,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> restitution, and supervised release. As an preliminary matter, however, we must address Klopfs sentence under Count I for violating \u00a7 1028(a)(3), because the district judge sentenced Klopf to a term of imprisonment that exceeded the statutory maximum sentence. At the time of sentencing, the maximum statutory sentences authorized for Klopfs offenses were three years for Count I for violating \u00a7 1028(a)(3), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(b)(2)(B), and ten years for Count II for violating \u00a7 1029(a)(2), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(c)(l)(A)(i). Under the <em>pre-Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>mandatory Sentencing Guidelines scheme, the district judge was required to group Klopfs offenses together into a single count and determine the offense level accordingly. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. After calculating Klopfs offense level and criminal history score, the judge determined that the Sentencing Guidelines range was 120 to 150 months and imposed a total sentence of 150 months of imprisonment. This 150-month sentence was Klopfs \u201ctotal punishment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, comment. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">The government concedes that Klopfs sentence on Count I was unlawful because it exceeded the maximum statutory term. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 46-47. The PSI erroneously states that the maximum authorized imprisonment sentence for Count I is fifteen years, instead of the actual maximum of three years. Neither Klopf nor the government noticed this error in the PSI and brought it to the attention of the sentencing judge. Apparently, in reliance on the erroneous PSI, the judge incorrectly sentenced Klopf to an imprisonment term of 150 months on Count I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>which exceeded the statutory maximum. Because the judge thought that he could achieve the total punishment by sentencing Klopf to 150 months of imprisonment on Count I, he imposed concurrent sentences. Therefore, remand is necessary so that the district judge can resentence Klopf within the appropriate statutory maximum of three years for Count I for violation of \u00a7 1028(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Klopf, however, was convicted and sentenced on a two-count indictment, and his crimes of conviction are interdependent: fraud connected with possession of identification documents and use of access devices. \u201c \u2018 \u201cMultiple count convictions present the trial judge with the need for a sentencing scheme which takes into consideration the total offense characteristics of a defendant\u2019s behavior. When that scheme is disrupted because it has incorporated an illegal sentence, it is appropriate that the entire case be remanded for resentencing.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1441 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted); <em>see United States v. Mixon, </em>115 F.3d 900, 903 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c \u2018If a multicount sentence is a package \u2014 and we think it is \u2014 then severing part of the total sentence usually will unbundle it.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). Klopfs sentence additionally involved application of the Sentencing Guidelines, which interrelate the facts and characteristics of the defendant\u2019s unlawful participation to the crimes of conviction. Calculating a sentence that encompasses both a statutory sentence and the Sentencing Guidelines involves an interconnected decision by the district judge to determine an appropriate sentence that fulfills his or her considered resolution of statutorily established sentences with appropriate Sentencing Guidelines enhancements. <em>See United States v. Watkins, </em>147 F.3d 1294, 1297 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he district court viewed [the convicted defendant\u2019s] sentence as a \u2018package\u2019 and took into account \u2018the nature of the crime, certain characteristics of the criminal, and the interdependence of the individual counts.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). That composite sentencing decision is undone or unbundled by vacating one of the necessary components, the sentence on a count of conviction, as in this case. The district judge on remand for resentencing will \u201crecalculate and reconsider\u201d Klopfs \u201centire sentencing, package\u201d to impose a sentence that he determines is appropriate for the crimes of conviction under the <em>Booker </em>advisory sentencing scheme as to application of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">Additionally, the sentencing judge made clear that he felt constrained to give Klopf a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines that was insufficient to punish him for the identity crimes that he had committed, complete with the ramifications of his criminal acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-8\">THE COURT: The Court finds that this identity theft is the worst type of personal invasion of privacy. It\u2019s in many ways worse than somebody burglarizing your home, I mean to literally steal your identity. The Court totally abhors this type of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-9\">But with respect to consideration of a motion for upward departure, that is to go outside of the Guidelines that have been proscribed, the Court must find that this case is outside of the heartland, that there is something about this case that\u2019s different from other cases involving identity theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-10\">The Court has already found that this was sophisticated. And the Court under the Guidelines granted a two level enhancement based on sophistication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1237-11\">The Court has found that the defendant was an organizer or a leader, and that the criminal activity was extensive. The Court\u2019s already added four levels because of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number>The Court\u2019s found that the defendant obstructed justice. The Court added two levels for that. The Court added ten levels as a result of the loss or intended loss exceeding one hundred and twenty thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-4\">And believe me, I don\u2019t fault the government for asking for it. <em>And if there was a way that I could legally grant the upward departure, believe me, I would. I think Mr. Klopf deserves the harshest sentence that the law permits. But the bottom line is, the Court finds that the law does not permit an upward departure.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-5\">And accordingly, the harshest sentence that the Court can impose under these circumstances is a hundred and fifty months, which exceeds ten years. And that\u2019s certainly a lot of time. So based on that, the Court will respectfully deny the motion for upward departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">R8-101 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">Since Klopfs sentencing, the Supreme Court has decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory in application and not mandatory. \u201cAs a result of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2005). Based upon the district judge\u2019s commentary at sentencing, <em>Booker </em>error is obvious. This is further reason that Klopf must be resentenced in addition to \u201cour established precedent\u201d that vacating the sentence for one count disrupts the sentencing package and requires resentencing for all counts of conviction. <em>Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1440. Because of the many sentencing considerations now involved <em>post-Booker </em>and the potential of Klopfs receiving a greater sentence at resentenc-ing,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as well as his <em>pro se </em>representation in this case to date, we strongly recommend that the district judge appoint counsel for Klopfs resentencing on remand. Since we are vacating Klopfs sentence in its entirety to give the district judge the ability to reconsider the sentence as a complete sentencing package post <em>-Booker, </em>we need not address Klopfs sentencing issues relating to his sentencing enhancements, restitution, and supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-13\">On appeal, Klopf has challenged his convictions under \u00a7\u00a7 1028(a)(3) and 1029(a)(2) for sufficiency of evidence and the denial of his requested jury instruction as well as his sentence concerning the enhancements, restitution, and supervised release.
