The record shows that, for nearly 21 years, the contract between the plaintiff and the District authorities had been executed and had been acquiesced in by the Board of Public Works, the Legislative Assembly, Congress, and the Commissioners and attorneys of the District. Its legality was first questioned October 16, 1891. The contract was based upon the then- received interpretation of the organic act of 1871. The contemporaneous construction of the law must govern. <em>Packard </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>17 Mass. 143; <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 418; <em>McKeen </em>v. <em>De Lancy, </em>5 Cr. 22; <em>Havermeyer </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>70 U. S. 294; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>113 U. S. 568; <em>Topliff v. Topliff, </em>122 U. S. 121; 11 Am. and Eng. Ency. of L. 519.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">2. The Governor of the District had the legal right to make the arrangement of November 8, 1871.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-9\">3. The Board of Public Works had the legal right to make the arrangement of April 8, 1872.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-10\">4. A court of equity will not permit the defendant, which has received the benefits of the contract, to impeach it for want of authority in the Board of Public Works to make it, or for informalities. Such a contract was not forbidden in the organic act, and it had been recognized by the District authorities in a course of dealing continued for 21 years with the plaintiff and third parties. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Chichester, </em>L. R. 2 Ex. 356; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>3 Macq. 382; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>5 H. L. Cases, 381; see also <em>Riche </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>L.

The plaintiff has a right in the nature of lien for all proper expenditures and advances in and about the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>erty entrusted to its agency. This right is a lien on personal property. Story on Agency, sec. 373; <em>Lovett, </em>40 N. H. <em>511; Wilson, </em>40 N. H. 88; <em>Muller, </em>55 N. Y. 326; <em>Farrington, </em>30 Miss. 578; <em>Nevan, </em>8 Iowa, 207<em>; United States Express Co., </em>67 Ill. 1, 40; 1 Pom. Jur., sec. 390; see Powell v. <em>Thomas, </em>6 Hare, <em>300; Ramsden </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>L. R. 1 H. L. 129.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-5\">In <em>Ramsden </em>v. <em>Dyson, </em>L. R. 1 H. L., it is said : \u201c If tenant at will builds on land, in belief that he thereby acquires title afterwards to claim a lease of land, and landlord allows him so to build, knowing that he is acting in that belief, and does not interfere to correct error, <em>semble, </em>that equity will interfere to compel grant of lease.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b61-6\">This describes the facts of the case at bar. The plaintiff has made advances for buildings and improvements upon defendant\u2019s property, as defendant\u2019s agent, with defendant\u2019s knowledge and acquiescence. Defendant threatens to eject plaintiff at law and seize upon the buildings and improvements without compensation. Plaintiff asks the equity court to restrain these proceedings until compensation is made. It is a plain case for relief under the general prayer of the bill. <em>Tayloe v. The Merch. F. I.

T. Thomas, </em>Attorney for the District of Columbia, and <em>Mr. A. B.

The apparent motive of the market company in claiming, and seeking to secure, the possession and control of the wholesale market place was not only to prevent possible competition, but also to obtain revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Its claim was that section 16 invested it with the power \u201c to establish the rules and regulations which shall govern the wholesale market upon the open space,\u201d granted to the municipal government. The only open or debatable question was, according to its view, \u201c whether it was the intention of Congress that this company should claim any revenue therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">We think it plain that this section will not bear the construction given it by the representatives of the market company. As is so often the case in acts of Congress, this section represents legislation concerning a thing separate and distinct from the special subject-matter of the title and body of the act in which it has been inserted. It was a distinct grant to the city government of Washington \u201c to hold and use under such rules and regulations as the said corporation may prescribe, the open space,\u201d etc. \u201c Said corporation\u201d unquestionably refers to the municipal corporation, and cannot by any rule of construction, grammatical or otherwise, refer to the market company.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">This claim of power over the grounds specially granted to the city is far in excess of that which the market company has over the grounds specially given to it. The section containing its own grant confers upon the municipal government \u201c the power to make and enforce such regulations with regard to the said market and the management thereof as in their judgment the convenience, health and safety of the community may require.\u201d Moreover, it has the power to dictate the minimum prices at which stalls and privileges shall be let, and rents once fixed can only be raised on application to it and the hearing of both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">These limitations are proper and necessary for the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tection of the people, whose representative the municipal government is, and are such as are usual in all fair and well considered legislative grants of similar rights and privileges. Having thus wisely limited the grant made to the market company, for which also an annual charge is exacted, and subjected it to the general supervision and control of the municipal government, it is inconceivable that Congress intended to make a grant to the city for public purposes subject to the unlimited control of a private corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">2. It remains now to consider the contention, that, irrespective of the construction claimed for section 16, the correspondence with the municipal officers, and their acquiescence for years in the exercise of authority by the market company, constitute a binding contract under which said company has the right to hold, use and regulate the wholesale market place, free from interference by the municipal authority, and subject to dispossession only by the express authority of Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The letter of November 8, 1871, to Governor Cooke and his approval endorsed thereon, are entitled to no weight. He was vested with no authority whatever in the premises, and could not confer a franchise or make a contract for the District. What he could not do directly, certainly could not be done indirectly. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Milan, </em>127 U. S. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Although his approval was \u201c subject to such regulations as the Legislative Assembly may hereafter prescribe,\u201d the matter seems never to have been referred to that body, where, if at all, the power to authorize such a contract existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">This first communication is quite different, too, from the latter one. It asked permission to grade the grounds and to erect inexpensive platforms for the business of the market, with power to collect reasonable revenue for their use. In the second, the statement is made that the company has graded the grounds, purchased certain buildings thereon from the city of Washington, and commenced to erect certain large, open platform sheds, etc. The intention was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>then announced, to retain sufficient of the revenues to pay-all expenses of management and repairs of buildings and ten per cent, per annum upon cost of improvement, and to pay the remainder to the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The conclusion was in the following words : \u201c If by authority of Congress, the company should at any time be dispossessed of the use and occupancy of the market grounds, it shall be entitled to receive a fair compensation for its buildings and improvements thereon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The market company continued its possession, improvements and collection of revenue without action upon this communication. The first action with regard to it appears in the letter of Alex. R. Shepherd, vice-president. of the Board of Public Works, dated April 26, 1874, in which he informs the company that the said board had <em>that day </em>voted to approve the proposed arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">This letter is not even evidence of the official action of the board, which was composed of five members, much less a contract between the District and the market company. The law creating the board expressly required that its contracts should be in writing signed by the parties making the same, and when made that a copy thereof should be filed in the office of the secretary. 16 Stat. 427, sec. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The power of the officers and agents of a public corporation to make contracts is to be strictly construed, and when a direction is given with respect thereto it must be pursued. Dillon Municipal Corp., sec. 445; Id. sec. 449; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Milan, </em>127 U. S. 139; <em>Pettis </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>56 Ind. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Again, the board was expressly forbidden \u201c to make contracts to bind the District to the payment of any sums of money except in pursuance of appropriations made by law, and not then until such appropriations shall have been made. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">But, without regard to the foregoing, had a contract been formally entered into between the board and the company, it would be void because clearly in excess of the powers vested in said board by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The ordinary matters of municipal control and regulation were conferred by the law upon the Legislative Assembly. 16 Stat. 425, sec. 18. The only power given to the Board of Public Works was the control and regulation of the repair of streets and alleys. Id. sec. 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The wholesale market space at the intersection of the named streets and avenues can hardly be called a street, since its setting apart as an open space for a market by act of Congress. But concede that it is to be considered as a street, the power to regulate its repair as a street did not confer the power to authorize the erection of buildings thereon, much less a contract to pay for them. The District Government and Board of Public Works combined would not have had the power to authorize buildings in a street or other public reservation, in the absence of an express grant of that power by Congress. Dillon, Municipal Corp., sec. 660; 15 Am. and Eng. Encyclopedia of Law, 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Neither the Governor nor the Board of Public Works having the power to bind the District by express contract, it is idle to contend that they could accomplish the same purpose indirectly by acquiescing in the usurpation of power by the market company and permitting it to proceed upon the assumption that a contract right existed, and thus work an estoppel upon the public and the succeeding District Government. It is clear that the District can no more be concluded by their nonfeasance than it could be bound by their acts of malfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">It follows that the decree dismissing the bill was right, and <em>it must be affirmed with costs to the appellee.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
