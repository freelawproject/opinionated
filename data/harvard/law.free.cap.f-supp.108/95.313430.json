S. Morris Hillquit and the S. S. Henry L. Benning: The contract contained a provision that if it should be determined that the vessels lacked or contained desirable features as defined in clauses (2) and (3) of Section 3 (d) of the Act, the purchase price should be decreased, within the limits of the floor price of the vessels, or increased, by such amounts as the Maritime Administration might determine pursuant to the cited clauses of the Act. The Administration later estimated that certain heavier-than-usual booms on the two vessels were desirable features, and the plaintiff deposited $3,150 to pay for them; It now sues to get back the $3,150, asserting, as we have said, that under the statutory formula, for the calculation of the selling price of the vessels, the charge of $3,150 was not authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">The Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 was intended to fix, by a self-operating statutory formula, the selling price of the Government\u2019s surplus ships. Except for the matter of the existence and value of desirable features, which would in any event be a small factor in the price, the determination of the price was a mere mathematical calculation, once the then Maritime Commission had determined, for the type of vessel in question, the prewar' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>domestic cost and the war domestic cost of such vessels. It will be observed that, in the original Act of 1946, in Section 3 (d) (1) it was provided that there should be deducted from the \u201cstatutory sales price\u201d the cost of putting the vessel in class. But in Section 12 (a) the Commission was authorized, itself, to have the vessels put in class, before selling them. The Commission seems to have followed this practice. When the vessel was put in class before it was sold there was, of course, no occasion for making the deduction authorized by Section 3 (d) (1). But apparently to avoid the necessity for appropriating the money necessary to put ships in class, Congress by Public Law 862, 80th Congress, 62 Stat. 1196, 1199, enacted the proviso to Section 3 (d) hereinbefore quoted. This proviso permitted the Commission to ascertain by taking competitive bids how much it would cost the purchaser to have the ship put in class, and then reduce the price by that amount below the \u201cfloor\u201d price of the ship, which was done in the instant case, or below whatever price above the floor the statutory formula .produced if, as rarely happened, it did result in a price higher than the floor price.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Our question relates to the \u201cdesirable features\u201d provision of the statute. The plaintiff says that in the application of the statutory provisions they should be taken in the order in which they appear in the statute. As applied to the Benning, the computation would be as follows: The prewar domestic- cost under 3 (c) was $1,278,000. Under 3 (d) the \u201cstatutory sales price\u201d was $639,000, or 50 percent of the prewar domestic cost. Section 3 (d) (1) authorizing a deduction for the cost of putting the vessel in class would not be applied since the plaintiff asserts, and the Government\u2019s practice seems to confirm, that 3 (d) (1) was superseded by the proviso in Public Law 862 which authorized that deduction to be taken last. Section 3 (d) (2) would have no application since the Benning did not lack any desirable features. Section 3 (d) (3) would apply, and $2,200, the value of the desirable features present, would be added to the \u201cstatutory sales price\u201d of $639,000, giving the sum of $641,200. Section 3 (d) (4) providing for depreciation would apply, tentatively, to authorize a reduction of $271,558, but since that-would carry the price below the statutory floor of 31% percent of the domestic war cost, set by the last paragraph of Section 3 (d), the floor of $544,506, would be substituted. From the floor would be deducted the allowance for putting the ship in class, $118,721, leaving $425,785-.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The practical effect of the plaintiff\u2019s method of adding the desirable features item to the statutory sales price at the beginning and then depreciating the sum is to make the item uncollectible in practically all cases, since the depreciation nearly always would carry the price below the floor, hence it is necessary to return to the floor. The desirable features item is thus lost somewhere under the floor, together with, it may be said, a large part of the depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The Government\u2019s method of calculation is to put to one side the desirable features item until the rest of the calculation is completed. By that time we have gone below the floor, <em>via </em>depreciation, but have returned to it, as required by the statute. Then the Government would add the desirable features item to the floor price, thus making it collectible in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The plaintiff, in support of its method of calculation, points first to the sequence of the statute itself. The Government says that the plaintiff is inconsistent since it would not agree that the deduction for putting the vessel in class should be taken first, although provision for that appears first in the statute, in 3 (d) (1). If that were done, the class adjustment subtraction from the statutory sales price would result in a price below the floor, and thus leave no room for any allowance for depreciation. Thus the plaintiff would pay the Government the statutory sales price less the class adjustment, and would pay the repair yard the amount of the -class adjustment, the total cost being the statutory sales price with no reduction whatever for depreciation. By that method the plaintiff would have had to pay some $95,000 more for each ship. That is the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Government\u2019s alternative counterclaim, which it urges if we conclude that the plaintiff is right in its contention as to the desirable feature adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We think the Government\u2019s argument of inconsistency is not valid. If Section 3 (d) (1) were the controlling provision as to class adjustment, that would present a problem. But Section 3 (d) (1) had fallen into disuse due to the Commission\u2019s practice of itself causing the work to be done to put the ships in class before it sold them. When it did so, the statutory sales price was not affected, and there was still room for some depreciation allowance before the floor was reached. Then Congress, in Public Law 862, revived the class allowance but we think it made quite plain its intention that the class allowance should be deducted from the floor price, or from whatever higher price had been produced by the statutory calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Government urges that the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s calculation is to give it the desirable features for nothing. This is, in a sense, true. When an arbitrary uniform floor price is fixed by statute for some hundreds of ships of the same type but of different ages and conditions, one purchaser will of course get values which another purchaser will \u25a0 not get, though he pays the same price. For example, as to the two ships here in question, the Benning, because it was older and had had more war service than the Hillquit, had accumulated some $38,000 more of depreciation than the Hillquit. Yet all of that difference had to be disregarded because the floor price of the two ships was the same. Thus, if another person ha'd bought the Hillquit, it might be said that he obtained some $38,000 worth of newness and sounder condition than had the plaintiff in buying the Ben-ning, and that he had gotten all that additional value \u201cfor nothing.\u201d In truth he would have gotten it because the statute required that the selling price of the ships be calculated that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">The plaintiff says that the Government is inconsistent in adding the charge for the presence of desirable features to the floor price but refusing to permit a deduction from the floor price for the absence of desirable features. It seems to be true that this was the Government\u2019s practice. We think the plaintiff\u2019s argument is valid. To turn the Government\u2019s expression about \u201csomething for nothing\u201d against it, it could be said that in such a case a purchaser who paid the full floor price was paying, as to the lacking desirable features, \u201csomething for nothing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Both. parties urge that their position is required by, or is at least consistent with, the terms of the contract of purchase, the pertinent parts of which -appear in Exhibit A of Exhibit 1 attached to the plaintiff\u2019s petition. We do not discuss the language of the contract in detail since we are convinced that the parties did not by their language intend to, and could not if they had intended to, change the plan prescribed by Congress for the sale o-f the ships.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is denied. The plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted. The additional claims of the plaintiff presented in paragraph 12 of the petition will be held in abeyance pending the outcome of negotiations for their administrative settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">JONES, C. J., and HOWELL, WHITAKER and LITTLETON, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
