App. 656, 426 S.E.2d 489 (1993). However, we note that <em>Cafaro </em>applied a rule to permanent total disability which may be applicable only to permanent partial disability. Nevertheless, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The employee, then a fifty-eight year old roofer, injured his left leg, right heel, ankle, hip, nerves, and spine when he fell off a ladder at work in 1983. He later developed \u201csevere traumatic arthritis\u201d and nerve injuries as a result of the fall. He received 500 weeks of temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The employee applied for benefits for permanent and total loss of use of his legs due to his leg and spine injuries. He presented letters from his treating neurologist that he had reached maximum medical improvement and had \u201csuffered a permanent total loss of use of his legs for any substantial gainful employment from the injury that both legs sustained in his fall.\u201d Citing <em>Cafaro, </em>the deputy and the commission denied compensation because the employee had failed to present quantified evidence of the loss of use of his legs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">In <em>Cafaro, </em>a panel of this Court held that \u201c[bjecause the evidence in support of the claimant\u2019s application failfed] to rate the functional loss of use of his legs, the claimant failed in his burden of proof to establish entitlement to benefits for permanent partial or total loss of use of his legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 426 S.E.2d at 493. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Applying <em>Cafaro, </em>the commission denied compensation to Hill. However, a close reading of <em>Cafaro </em>suggests that, although correct with respect to permanent partial loss of use of a member under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(D), the rule in <em>Cafaro </em>may not be applicable to permanent total loss of use under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-503(D) provides proportional compensation for partial loss or loss of use of a member. Thus, a numerical rating is required so that benefits may be proportionally awarded according to the percentage loss and determined by the schedule in Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B). <em>See County of Spotsylvania </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977) (requiring the commission to rate \u201cthe percentage of incapacity suffered by the employee\u201d before awarding partial benefits); <em>see also Hungerford Mechanical Corp. </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>11 Va. App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (same). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C), on the other hand, does not provide benefits for permanent, partial disability. It awards benefits for permanent, total disability arising from the \u201closs of . . . both legs.\u201d Where the loss or loss of use is total, no numerical rating is required, because benefits need not be apportioned. The authority relied upon in <em>Cafaro </em>dealt with cases involving permanent, <em>partial </em>loss; however, <em>Cafaro </em>extended the numerical rating requirement to cases of permanent, <em>total </em>loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Despite our concern that the rule in <em>Cafaro </em>may not be applicable to permanent total loss, we and the commission are bound by that decision. Generally, <em>stare decisis </em>does not prevent a court from correcting its own errors or mistakes. <em>Home Brewing Co. v. Richmond, </em>181 Va. 793, 799, 27 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1943). However, while a panel decision of this Court is not forever binding, a \u201cflagrant error or mistake\u201d in a panel decision may be corrected only through the <em>en banc </em>hearing process. <em>Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990); <em>Day v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1078, 1082, 407 S.E.2d 52, 55 (1991) (Barrow, J., concurring).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Therefore, although we do not agree with Cafare?s extension of the rating requirement to cases of permanent total loss, we are bound by it. For this reason, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Benton, J., and Cole, S.J. concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-13\"> The commission did not address the employer\u2019s contention that the employee\u2019s disability could have been caused by conditions not related to the injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> This rating is \u201cnot necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d Hungerford, 11 Va. App. at 677, 401 S.E.2d at 415.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\"> The Supreme Court did not discuss language in Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D)(ii) which suggests that a panel of this Court is not bound by a previous panel decision, because it allows an <em>en banc </em>review where \u201ca decision of [a] panel is in conflict with a prior decision of the Court or of any panel thereof.\u201d Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D); <em>see </em>Day, 12 Va. App. at 1082 n.l, 407 S.E.2d at 55 n.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
