The sole issue on appeal is whether George\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome is a disease within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-400 and the holding of <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">In <em>Merillat, </em>the claimant suffered from a torn rotator cuff which resulted from repetitive overhead lifting and manipulation with his left arm. The Supreme Court of Virginia held that a plain reading of Code \u00a7 65.1-46,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the occupational disease statute, requires that the condition for which compensation is sought as an occupational disease must first qualify as a disease. It concluded that the claimant\u2019s condition was not a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">It appears from the record that the commission assumed but failed to find that George\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome, which also resulted from repetitive activity, was a disease. That assumption was justified in light of this Court\u2019s holding that carpal tunnel syndrome is compensable as an occupational disease upon proof of the six requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-400. <em>Knott v. Blue Bell, Inc., </em>7 Va. App. 335, 337 n.2, 373 S.E. 2d 481, 482 n.2 (1988). However, we interpret <em>Merillat </em>to require a separate finding, based upon credible evidence, that the condition is a disease. <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Therefore, we remand this case for the commission to make a factual finding whether George\u2019s carpal tunnel syndrome is a disease within the meaning of that term in Code \u00a7 65.2-400. <em>See Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. East, </em>17 Va. App. 499, 438 S.E.2d 769 (1993); <em>Department of State Police v. Haga, </em>18 Va. App. 162, 442 S.E.2d 424 (1994). In view of the developments in the law since this case was decided before the commission, we direct the commission to allow both parties the opportunity to present additional evidence concerning whether the condition is a disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Elder, J., and Cole, S.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-11\"> Title 65.1, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, was recodified effective 1991 as Title 65.2. Code \u00a7 65.1-46 was redesignated \u00a7 65.2-400. There were no substantive changes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
