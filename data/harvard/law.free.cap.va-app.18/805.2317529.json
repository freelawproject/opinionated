Ledbetter asserts that (1) the circuit court had no subject matter jurisdiction to try the case on the new warrant and should have remanded the case to the general district court, (2) by issuing a new warrant, the nature and character of the offense was changed with respect to the defense he had intended to offer, (3) the Commonwealth was estopped from asserting that Ledbetter could be tried under a state statute at the circuit court level when the city had asserted in the general district court that the warrant charging a violation of a city ordinance was valid, and (4) the trial in the circuit court was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and by statute. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">On July 11, 1992, Ledbetter was arrested for DUI in the City of Bristol. A city warrant was issued charging \u201c[a] violation of Section 18.2-266 [sic], Code or Ordinances of this city, county, or town.\u201d In the City of Bristol General District Court, Ledbetter moved to strike the City\u2019s evidence on the ground that this warrant charged a violation of a city ordinance, \u00a7 14-53.2, which was not in compliance with Code \u00a7 15.1-132 requiring substantial conformity of such statutes to the state code.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In the alternative, Ledbetter asserted that the warrant was defective because it charged the violation of a city ordinance but recited a Virginia Code section. The court continued the case to allow the parties to brief the issues. The City Attorney submitted a brief asserting the compliance of the city ordinance with Code \u00a7 15.1-132 and stating that \u201cno attempt is being made by the City to convict the Defendant in the instant case on the state statute.\u201d The court overruled Ledbetter\u2019s motion to strike and found him guilty of violating the city DUI ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">Ledbetter appealed his conviction to the Circuit Court of the City of Bristol. Prior to trial in the circuit court, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney made a motion to dismiss the warrant as defective and to issue a new warrant charging Ledbetter with a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. Ledbetter did not object to the dismissal of the original warrant. However, he objected to the new warrant being issued, asserting that jeopardy had attached in the general district court and that the Commonwealth was estopped from denying the City\u2019s prior assertion that the warrant did not charge a violation of the Virginia Code. Ledbetter further asserted that an appeal of a general district court\u2019s judgment, while calling for a trial <em>de novo </em>pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-136, did not permit the prosecution to repudiate the evidence and argument of the prior trial. The trial court overruled Ledbetter\u2019s objections, stating that Code \u00a7 16.1-137 \u201ccontemplates a situation such as this.\u201d Evidence was then received. In closing argument, Ledbetter\u2019s counsel reiterated his objections and further asserted that the trial on the new warrant violated the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy. Ledbetter was convicted of DUI, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">CIRCUIT COURT\u2019S AUTHORITY TO ISSUE NEW WARRANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Ledbetter\u2019s first three arguments are directly addressed by Code \u00a7 16.1-137, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-7\">Upon the trial of the warrant on appeal the [circuit] court <em>may </em>. . . amend the form of the warrant in <em>any </em>respect in which it appears to be defective. But when the warrant is so defective in form that it does not substantially appear from the same what is the offense with which the accused is charged, <em>or even when it is not so seriously defective, </em>the judge of the court ... if he sees good reason to believe an offense has been committed . . . <em>may </em>issue under his own hand his warrant reciting the offense [and] . . . trial <em>shall </em>proceed upon the new warrant ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Ledbetter first contends that upon issuing the new warrant, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try the new warrant and should have remanded the case to the general district court for trial under Code \u00a7 17-123. We disagree. To construe a statute, we must first look to its plain language. <em>Neeley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 349, 355, 437 S.E.2d 721, 724 (1993). The judge \u201cmay\u201d issue a warrant \u201cso long as he has reason to believe an offense has been committed.\u201d Once a warrant has been issued, trial \u201cshall\u201d proceed after its issuance. Virginia courts have interpreted this statute as giving the court a free hand in trying the case on appeal. <em>Royals </em>v. <em>City of Hampton, </em>201 Va. 552, 555, 111 S.E.2d 795, 798 (1960); <em>see also Malouf v. City of Roanoke, 177 </em>Va. 846, 855, 13 S.E.2d 314, 322 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The circuit court is expressly given jurisdiction by Code \u00a7 16.1-137 to try the case when it amends a warrant or issues a new warrant. Ledbetter asserts that Code \u00a7 17-123 requires the circuit court to remand to general district court any case where a misdemeanor is charged. We disagree. To hold that Code \u00a7 17-123 requires the circuit court to remand the case after issuing a new warrant would render part of Code \u00a7 16.1-137 meaningless. The circuit court is the proper forum to try cases when it issues a new warrant. <em>See Malouf, 177 </em>Va. at 855, 13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>S.E.2d at 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Ledbetter further asserts that the Commonwealth was estopped from alleging that the warrant upon which he was tried in the general district court was invalid. He bases this assertion on the theory that the City Attorney argued for the validity of the warrant in the general district court. We disagree. On appeal, a conviction in the general district court is annulled, and a trial <em>de novo </em>is held in the circuit court. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-136. The Commonwealth is no more bound by the assertions of the prosecutor in the first trial than is the defendant bound by his counsel\u2019s actions therein. <em>Cf. Walker </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 563, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982); <em>Royals, </em>201 Va. at 555, 111 S.E.2d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Ledbetter\u2019s reliance on <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 359, 382 S.E.2d 270 (1989), is misplaced. In <em>Kelly, </em>we were concerned with a concession made by the Commonwealth at trial which the Attorney General attempted to repudiate on appeal. Our ruling in that case has no application to a <em>de novo </em>appeal from the general district court to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">Ledbetter further asserts that he was unprepared to defend against a warrant charging a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 because his anticipated defense was based on his claim that the city ordinance under which he had been convicted in the general district court was invalid. The plain language of Code \u00a7 16.1-137 provides that the proper remedy for a defendant who believes himself prejudiced by an amendment of a warrant or the issuance of a new warrant is to seek a continuance. In relevant part, the statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">But whether the warrant is amended or a new warrant is issued the court before proceeding to trial on the same may grant a continuance . . . upon such terms ... as may be proper ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Assuming, without deciding, that the issuance of the new warrant prejudiced Ledbetter\u2019s defense, his failure to avail himself of the proper remedy precludes our consideration of his claim of prejudice. The question of whether Ledbetter should have received a continuance was within the circuit court\u2019s discretion. Having failed to give the circuit court the opportunity to provide that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>remedy, Ledbetter failed to preserve the underlying issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">In sum, we hold that the circuit court acted within the discretion granted to it by Code \u00a7 16.1-137 in issuing a new warrant alleging a violation of the state DUI statute. Under the facts and circumstances in this case, the circuit court had good reason to believe that an offense had been committed. The warrant issued by the circuit court did not fundamentally change the nature of the offense with which Ledbetter had been charged in the defective warrant. Further, the circuit court correctly followed the express directions of the statute by trying the case itself rather than remanding it to the general district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The cases relied upon by Ledbetter are distinguishable from this case. In <em>Eddy v. Commonwealth, </em>119 Va. 873, 89 S.E. 899 (1916), the lower court replaced the original warrant charging a violation of a city ordinance upon which the defendant was convicted in the lower court with a warrant charging a violation of the Code of Virginia after the defendant\u2019s appeal had matured in the circuit court and without her knowledge. <em>Eddy </em>did not involve the circuit court\u2019s authority to amend an old warrant or issue a new warrant consistent with the charge upon which the defendant was tried in the lower court. In <em>Humphreys </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 43 S.E.2d 890 (1947), the circuit court added a new charge to the warrant. Here, Ledbetter was tried under a state statute that was identical to the city ordinance. Unlike the defendant in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 766, 146 S.E.2d 197 (1966), Ledbetter was aware at all times that he was to be tried for a violation of a DUI statute. Similarly, the defendant in <em>Malouf </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, 177 </em>Va. 846, 13 S.E.2d 319 (1941), was unaware of the changes made by the circuit court to the warrant. The evidence shows Ledbetter had notice that the circuit court was issuing a new warrant, and he could have requested a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">Ledbetter also asserts that the trial on the new warrant was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. This position is without merit. <em>See Justices of Boston Mun. Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294 (1984). An appeal <em>de novo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>from a general district court to a circuit court annuls the former judgment as completely as if no trial had ever occurred. <em>Gaskill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 486, 489, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965). To allow a defendant to appeal a conviction in the general district court <em>de novo </em>and then plead double jeopardy in the circuit court would grant every criminal defendant who appealed an automatic pass to freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Additionally, Ledbetter asserts for the first time on appeal that Code \u00a7 19.2-285 bars his trial on the new warrant because he was subject to a greater penalty than might have been imposed in the general district court. Under well-established rules of appellate review, we will not consider any issue not raised at the trial level. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Coleman, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
