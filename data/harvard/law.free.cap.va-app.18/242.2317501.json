Richards contends that the trial court erred in finding that the knife he was carrying, though visible by common observation, was concealed because it was deceptive in appearance. We agree and reverse Richards\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">At trial, Officer B.L. Royer (Royer) of the Lynchburg City Police Department testified that, while investigating an assault in which Richards was the victim, Royer observed an object sticking one-half to three-quarters of an inch out of Richards\u2019s right back pants pocket. Royer further testified that he did not know what the object was and asked Richards to identify it. When Richards told Royer that the object was a knife, Royer asked Richards to remove it from his pocket. Royer identified that object, presented as a Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit, as a spring-blade knife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When Richards removed it from his pocket, the blade was extended. On cross-examination, Royer testified that, at the time of the arrest, the spring mechanism on the knife was inoperable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">After closing argument, the trial court ruled that the knife was not carried so as to be hidden from common observation. None<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>theless, the trial court further ruled that the knife was of such deceptive appearance as to disguise the weapon\u2019s true nature, rendering it concealed under the statute. The court sentenced Richards to two years in prison suspended on the condition that Richards spend one weekend in jail and be of good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In this Commonwealth, a person is prohibited from carrying \u201cabout his person, hidden from common observation . . . (ii) any dirk, bowie knife, switchblade knife, [or] ballistic knife ... or (v) any weapon of like kind .... [A] weapon shall be deemed to be hidden from common observation when it is observable but is of such deceptive appearance as to disguise the weapon\u2019s true nature.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A). \u201cThe purpose of the statute was to interdict the practice of carrying a deadly weapon about the person, concealed, and yet so accessible as to afford prompt and immediate use.\u201d <em>Schaaf </em>v. Commonwealth, 220 Va. 429, 430, 258 S.E.2d 574, 574-75 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We have not before had occasion to address the question of whether \u201chidden from common observation\u201d requires the weapon to be totally hidden from view. The majority of other state jurisdictions holds that a weapon may be concealed although technically visible and that such determination is a matter for the trier of fact. <em>See, e.g., People </em>v. <em>Charron, 220 </em>N.W.2d 216, 218 (Mich. Ct. App. 1974) (even though blade of knife protruding from defendant\u2019s rear pocket was visible to police officers when defendant was in the act of sitting down or standing up, a question of fact existed as to whether there was concealment of the weapon within meaning of criminal statute); <em>McKee </em>v. <em>State, </em>488 P.2d 1039, 1042-43 (Alaska 1971) (weapon is concealed if it is hidden from ordinary observation, and need not be absolutely invisible to other persons, but the jury must be instructed as to this definition). In this instance, the trial judge made a factual finding that the weapon was not hidden from common observation and, therefore, not concealed under the first definition of that term found in the Code. Under well accepted principles of appellate review, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987), we accept that finding of fact. Accordingly, this case does not present us with an opportunity to define the limits of the phrase \u201chidden from common observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth argued that the statute was nonetheless applicable because the \u201cweapon\u2019s true nature\u201d was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>guised because it was a \u201cballistic knife.\u201d The Commonwealth asserts on brief that Richards \u201cdid not contend at trial nor does he argue on appeal, that the knife he possessed was incorrectly characterized as a ballistic knife.\u201d Contrary to this assertion, the record clearly reflects that at trial Richards opposed the use of that characterization. Moreover, the characterization of the weapon is a central issue of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In any case, the trial court did not affirmatively find that the weapon was a ballistic knife. Rather, the finding was that the weapon was a \u201cspring knife.\u201d A \u201cspring knife\u201d could be either a ballistic knife or a switchblade knife. A ballistic knife is defined by statute as \u201cany knife with a detachable blade that is propelled by a spring-operated mechanism.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-308(E). The record clearly reflects that Richards\u2019s knife was not a ballistic knife. The blade was not detachable. In addition, the spring-operated mechanism, had it been operable, could not have propelled a detachable blade.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Similarly, the evidence does not support a finding that the weapon was a <em>functional </em>switchblade. A switchblade knife is a knife with a blade that opens automatically by operation of inertia, gravity, or both upon the release of a spring mechanism. <em>See In re John Doe, </em>828 P.2d 272, 273-74 (Haw. 1992). The spring mechanism of Richards\u2019s knife was inoperable and the blade, which was fixed in the extended position, could not be moved. Accordingly, the trial court erred in finding that the weapon was a \u201cspring knife,\u201d regardless whether that term was meant to refer to a ballistic or switchblade knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The trial court ruled that the handle of the \u201cspring knife\u201d was deceptive in its appearance so as to disguise the true nature of the knife and based the determination of guilt on that finding. As it is clear that the trial court based its determination of guilt on its mistaken belief that Richards carried a \u201cspring knife,\u201d we hold that the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The facts of this case do not present the question whether a <em>functional </em>ballistic knife or switchblade is <em>per se </em>deceptive in appearance so as to disguise the weapon\u2019s true nature. Nor do the facts involve a knife of unusual appearance, such as a belt buckle knife, a fountain pen knife, a swagger stick knife, or some other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>knife of inherently deceptive design. Accordingly, Richards\u2019s weapon, to be subject to the statute, must be classified as either a dirk or a bowie knife or a weapon of a like kind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">An examination of the weapon\u2019s blade reveals that it most closely resembles a dirk. Clearly, it is a weapon of like kind contemplated in the statute. Nothing about the appearance of the handle suggests that it is anything other than a knife. We hold that where, as here, the weapon from common observation is just as it appears, a dirk or weapon of like kind, it cannot be said to be \u201cof such deceptive appearance as to disguise its true nature.\u201d Accordingly, Richards cannot be said to have concealed the weapon under either provision of the statute defining the term \u201chidden from common observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">For these reasons, we reverse Richards\u2019s conviction and dismiss the charge against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-12\"> Under normal circumstances, weapons and other contraband are retained by the trial court when the record is forwarded to this Court on appeal. In this instance, because the nature of the weapon was central to the issue on appeal, the weapon was forwarded to the Court of Appeals upon Richards\u2019s motion and was available for the panel to examine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\"> The terms \u201cdirk\u201d and \u201cbowie knife\u201d are not defined by the statute, nor has any appellate decision in this Commonwealth clarified the difference. We assume that the two terms have their usual meaning. A \u201cdirk\u201d or weapon of like kind is any stabbing weapon having two sharp edges and a point, including daggers, short swords and stilettos. A \u201cbowie knife\u201d or weapon of like kind is any stabbing weapon having a single sharp edge, a dull or serrated flat edge and a point, such as a hunting knife, a fishing knife or a survivalist\u2019s knife. It is generally agreed that in using such terms, legislatures intend to exclude from concealed weapons statutes innocuous household and industrial knives which may be carried for legitimate purposes. The determination of whether a particular knife falls within the meaning of a term used in the statute is a question of fact determined by the trier of fact according to the circumstances of the case. <em>See, e.g., People </em>v. <em>Barrios, </em>8 Cal. Rptr. 2d 666, 667-68 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that a common bread knife was not a dirk); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>497 N.E.2d 29, 29-30 and n.1 (Mass. App. Ct. 1986) (holding that a closed pocketknife was not a dirk). <em>Compare Armendariz v. Texas, </em>396 S.W.2d 132 (Tex. Crim. App. 1965) (pocketknife in a locked-open position, was a dagger) <em>with Bacon v. State, </em>586 A.2d 18 (Md. 1991) (penknife did not lose identity as penknife by blade being opened and locked).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
