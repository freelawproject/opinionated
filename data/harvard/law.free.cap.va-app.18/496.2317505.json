He contends (1) that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions, and (2) that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony given by an expert witness which invaded the province of the jury. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand this case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">The record contains extensive conflicting evidence raising factual questions that the jury decided adversely to appellant. Upon familiar principles, when sufficiency of the evidence is raised, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Appellant was indicted and convicted for sexual offenses he allegedly committed against his stepdaughters, \u201cH\u201d and \u201cJ,\u201d on various occasions between May 1988 and November 1990. During that time period, \u201cH\u201d was between ten and twelve years old, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cJ\u201d was between six and eight years old. When they testified at trial, \u201cH\u201d was fourteen years old and \u201cJ\u201d was ten years old. The events occurred in their house where they lived with appellant, their natural mother, Lori Lee (Lori), and younger sister, who was born of the marriage between appellant and Lori. At trial, neither child gave specific dates on which the offenses occurred. However, they placed the dates between May 1988 and November 1990 and related the times of the occurrences to other events, such as Mother\u2019s Day weekend, Christmas, or other things they were doing when they testified appellant began his sexual abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u201cH\u201d testified that appellant bound and gagged her, engaged her in sexual and anal intercourse, had oral sodomy with her, and penetrated her vagina with a vibrator. She described sexual intercourse as putting his penis in her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In late November 1990, \u201cH\u201d told a social worker and the police of a recent incident. Appellant was arrested and jailed. \u201cH\u201d testified that because of previous threats appellant had made and because she was afraid of the economic consequences of appellant\u2019s incarceration, she recanted her accusation and appellant was released from jail. Appellant spent Christmas at the family house but left the next day and did not return until June 14, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In March 1991, \u201cH\u201d told Lori, Police Officer Rogers, and a social worker all of the events she described at trial. In addition, she related the events to a therapist, Julia Canestrari (Canestrari).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u201cJ\u201d testified that appellant began to engage in sexual acts with her sometime during 1989 or 1990, after her half-sister was born in October 1988. She said that the acts began when appellant entered her bed and inserted his fingers into her vagina. \u201cJ\u201d corroborated some of \u201cH\u2019s\u201d testimony. She said that appellant \u201cstuck his penis in [her] vagina and [her] older sister\u2019s vagina.\u201d She related that this occurred at a time when they had been watching a video titled, \u201cThe Man From Snowy River.\u201d In addition, \u201cJ\u201d testified that appellant had inserted a magic marker into her vagina, required her to put her mouth on his penis and \u201cjust made [her] suck his penis,\u201d and penetrated her in a wooded area next to their church.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cJ\u201d explained that she did not tell Lori, her natural father, or her grandparents that these acts were being committed upon her because appellant had threatened that if she told anyone, he would take her mother and baby sister \u201cfar, far away\u201d and she would never see them again.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Dr. Elliott W. Lucas (Lucas), a gynecologist, whose qualifications were stipulated, examined \u201cH\u201d on September 13, 1991 for evaluation due to a history of sexual assault. Lucas testified that a pelvic examination of \u201cH,\u201d then thirteen years old, revealed that she had no hymen and that it was unusual for a child \u201cH\u2019s\u201d age to have no hymen. He further testified that this finding was consistent with penetration of the vagina, that \u201c[i]t is possible to be born without [a hymen], but most women are born with one,\u201d and that use of tampons \u201ccould\u201d be consistent with a hymen breaking. Lucas\u2019s examination of \u201cJ\u201d revealed that her hymen was \u201cvery scarred\u201d and \u201cpartially torn,\u201d which is usually \u201cconsistent with either some type of sexual abuse or use of some type of object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Canestrari\u2019s testimony was proffered by the Commonwealth \u201cas an expert in the field of child abuse\u201d for the purpose of explaining \u201cthe phenomenon of recanting in child sexual abuse cases and why that might occur.\u201d Canestrari testified that she graduated in 1984 from Randolph-Macon College where her major was in psychology and, in addition, she attained a Master\u2019s in Social Work (MSW) from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1988. Canestrari described her current occupation as a \u201cchild and adolescence therapist.\u201d She had worked in that profession for four years but had not engaged in a particular specialty within that capacity. Canestrari\u2019s work consisted of providing \u201coutpatient mental health services to children, adults, and their families, with a variety of issues including depression, major mental illness to trauma to family dynamics.\u201d She had provided case management and crisis intervention services, pre-screening children to determine if hospitalization was required, and \u201creferring them to appropriate mental health services, social services, medical services, whatever they needed.\u201d Canestrari had received training in sexual abuse cases, one session relating to sexual offenders. Approximately one-third of her case load involved seeing patients for sexual abuse. \u201cH\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d were among the patients she saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The prosecution proffered Canestrari as an expert to explain the phenomenon of recanting in child sexual abuse cases and why that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>might occur. The trial court was further assured by the prosecutor that Canestrari would not testify specifically about these children, only generally about the particular phenomenon, because \u201crecanting\u201d was \u201can issue in this case.\u201d The prosecutor assured the court that Canestrari would be asked no more questions concerning her \u201cseeing \u2018H\u2019 and \u2018J.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel then observed to the trial court, \u201cit looks like to me what they are trying to do is get this lady to come in and say, T believe that they are telling the truth and I am an expert and I can explain away recanting.\u2019 \u201d The trial court responded to that statement by making the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">THE COURT: I tell you what, I\u2019m going to allow her to testify to this phenomenon, but if she goes afield and brings these children into it, I\u2019m going to declare a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged his satisfaction with that ruling by saying, \u201cThank you, Your Honor.\u201d At that time, no objection was made to the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">To bolster Canestrari\u2019s qualifications as an expert witness, the prosecutor asked whether she was \u201cfamiliar\u201d with the term <em>'\u2018''recant\" </em>if she had read any literature or if she were \u201caware of that phenomenon in regard to child sexual abuse cases,\u201d and where she had gained her \u201cknowledge of that phenomenon.\u201d Canestrari responded that she had read one article by a psychiatrist that was \u201cused in the field\u201d that \u201cexplains the syndrome of why kids recant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">When the prosecutor asked Canestrari to \u201cexplain that study,\u201d the trial court sustained appellant\u2019s objection that requested that she be qualified first. Canestrari was then asked to \u201cexplain what recanting is.\u201d Appellant objected on the basis that her explanation would be based solely on a single article she had read that was recommended by a co-worker. The court overruled the objection, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">She [has] an MSW and BA in psychology. That is coupled with the training seminars and I think her knowledge would be from other than just reading this one article ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">She testified that she had read the article about it, but she also should be familiar with it from other experiences as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>well. That\u2019s why I ruled as I did. I note your exception for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Canestrari was then asked if she knew the reasons why \u201ca child who has been sexually abused may recant.\u201d Appellant objected to the question as being \u201coverly broad.\u201d The trial court overruled that objection and Canestrari responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Yes. Children, when they have been hurt in a sexual way, it\u2019s usually by a person \u2014 a trusted person, a parent or a friend of the family, and the person in that trusted position often uses the threat of, you will lose a family member; I will kill your dog; I will kill your mother, if you tell, and they tell the child on the one hand that, what we are doing is okay, but you can\u2019t tell anybody, so in the child\u2019s head, they are very confused about what it means and they understand by the secrecy that something\u2019s wrong although they\u2019re being told it\u2019s all okay since this is a person they trust and depend on maybe for food, shelter, clothing, for safety. Usually when they do, in fact, tell that they have been hurt it\u2019s out of a moment of anger or in a crisis and all the things that the person has said may come true, you\u2019ll lose your mother; I may be sent out; the family will be separated; you won\u2019t have food, happens because the family may react to the crisis and, in fact, the father or the perpetrator may be sent out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">At this point, appellant renewed his objection on the ground that Canestrari was \u201cbasically going through and reciting everything that [the child] has said.\u201d He then objected to \u201cher continuing her testimony.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Canestrari then was asked whether there were any other reasons why a child might recant. She gave the following response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">Just plain fear. It\u2019s very scary to stand up to an adult system that probably won\u2019t believe them. So they are a lot of times afraid, and those may sound real familiar, but that\u2019s typical from case to case why kids recant. Although it may apply directly to this case, that\u2019s exactly what happens from case to case to case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">In his cross-examination of Canestrari, appellant stated, \u201c[s]ome <em>people </em>recant because they lie, too, don\u2019t they?\u201d She an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>swered that it is a \u201cpossibility\u201d and added, \u201cbut the studies show that the majority of the times kids don\u2019t lie about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Appellant testified and denied every charge made by \u201cH\u201d and \u201cJ.\u201d He presented the children\u2019s mother, Lori, as a hostile witness on his behalf. Lori described a sometimes violent relationship, including a statement that appellant had raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Appellant presented other witnesses. However, none supplied evidence that required the trial court to conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts. Appellant contends that \u201cH\u2019s\u201d and \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d testimony was so incredible that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence is insufficient as a matter of law. We disagree. The trial judge and jury had the opportunity to observe the witnesses, assess their demeanor as they testified, and weigh their testimony. The weight to be given to the evidence is within the province of the fact finder. <em>See Bridgeman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601-02 (1986). Unless the finding of the trial court is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it, we will not disturb its findings. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680. Accordingly, we find that the evidence is sufficient to support the verdicts and judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Appellant does not challenge Canestrari\u2019s expertise in the field of sexual abuse of children. Even if, in an appropriate case, Canestrari is considered an expert witness, that would not necessarily ensure the admission of the proffered testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See 2 </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17-18, at 51 (4th ed. 1993). To be admissible in a criminal case, the expert\u2019s testimony must meet the requirements stated in <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 318 S.E.2d 386 (1984); otherwise, the opinion of the expert is of no evidential value. <em>See </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 17-18. When the opinion of the expert is properly admitted, that opinion may be weighed by the fact finder as any other relevant admissible evidence. <em>McLane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 197, 206, 116 S.E.2d 274, 281 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3 and its predecessor essentially adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence, allowing experts to base their opinions on facts made known or perceived by them at or before trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>whether such facts are admissible or not, provided they are facts of a type normally relied on by other experts in the field. <em>Simpson, 221 </em>Va. at 566, 318 S.E.2d at 391. However, <em>Simpson </em>notes that the General Assembly specifically limited Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3 to \u201cany civil proceeding,\u201d disclosing that the legislature intended to retain the historic restrictions upon expert testimony in criminal cases. <em>Id. Simpson </em>establishes that an expert may give opinions either \u201c \u2018based upon his own knowledge of facts disclosed in his testimony or he may give an opinion based upon facts in evidence assumed in a hypothetical question.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 565, 318 S.E.2d at 391 (quoting <em>Walrod v. Matthews, </em>210 Va. 382, 388, 171 S.E.2d 180, 185 (1969)). At trial, the prosecutor did not ask Canestrari to respond to a hypothetical question, and Canestrari did not, of her own knowledge, possess facts relevant to either the merits of the charges or to the credibility of the recantation made by \u201cH\u201d and, generally, an expert witness in Virginia has not been permitted to base his or her opinion on facts not in the record. <em>Simpson, 221 </em>Va. at 565, 318 S.E.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Canestrari was not asked to assume the truth of facts in evidence and then express an opinion based on those facts, nor was she questioned on her personal knowledge of facts relative to this appeal. She was asked to \u201cexplain what recant is,\u201d to state from her experience in the field of child abuse if it is common for children who have been sexually abused to recant, and whether she knew \u201cwhat [the] reasons are that a child who has been sexually abused may recant.\u201d Canestrari was then permitted to give responses to questions that were not phrased as hypothetical questions and not founded upon her own knowledge of facts relative to the merits of the case. We hold that Canestrari\u2019s testimony should not have been weighed by the jury on the merits of the charges or the issue of \u201cH\u2019s\u201d credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant further argues that the trial court erred when it permitted Canestrari to testify to matters involving the credibility of \u201cH,\u201d an ultimate issue within the province of the jury. We hold that the Commonwealth failed to qualify Canestrari as an expert to explain \u201cthe phenomenon of recanting in child sexual abuse cases and why that might occur.\u201d We further hold that the \u201cphenomenon\u201d was not established as a principle generally accepted as reliable by the scientific community or among professionals engaged in child sexual abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Having degrees in psychology and social work and an acquaintance with a single article, by an author whose qualifications were not shown, did not qualify Canestrari to testify to a principle not proved to be reliable. Moreover, because the purpose of the proffered evidence was to bolster the testimony of the abused child who, at different times preceding the trial, had related diametrically opposite accounts of appellant\u2019s guilt, it invaded the province of the jury to decide \u201cH\u2019s\u201d credibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">The credibility of witnesses is a matter for the jury to decide, weighing such factors as the appearance and manner of the witnesses on the stand, their intelligence, their opportunity for knowing the truth and observing the things about which they testify, their interest in the outcome of the case, their bias, and if any had been shown, their prior inconsistent statements and prior criminal convictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Mullis </em>v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 564, 571, 351 S.E.2d 919, 923 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In proffering Canestrari as an expert, it was the prosecutor\u2019s intent to bolster the truth of \u201cH\u2019s\u201d testimony at trial. It is well settled that an expert may not \u201cexpress an opinion as to the veracity of any witness.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 223 </em>Va. 615, 630, 292 S.E.2d 798, 806 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983); <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252-53, 257 S.E.2d 797, 804 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1103 (1980). The prosecutor\u2019s question to Canestrari specifically concerned the testimony of a \u201cparticular . . . witness\u201d and, thus, was clearly \u201cintended to elicit an opinion\u201d of veracity. <em>See Coppola, 220 </em>Va. at 252, 257 S.E.2d at 804; <em>see also Fitzgerald, 223 </em>Va. at 630, 292 S.E.2d at 806. Such evidence is a comment on an ultimate fact within the province of the jury and must be excluded by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Here, on at least one of the occasions that \u201cH\u201d spoke concerning appellant\u2019s guilt, her statement was not truthful. Whether \u201cH\u201d spoke the truth when she testified at trial that appellant had sexually molested her was a precise and ultimate issue. A determination of that issue did not require special knowledge or experience. <em>See Cartera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Because we are unable to determine the possible effect the inadmissible testimony may have had upon the jury verdicts, the judgments of the trial court are reversed and the case remanded to the trial court for such further action as the Commonwealth may be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Coleman, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> We do not here hold that the witness properly qualified as an expert for the purpose for which her testimony was proffered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
