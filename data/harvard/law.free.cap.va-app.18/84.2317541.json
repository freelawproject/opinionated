On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred (1) in denying his motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the sodomy charge; (2) in instructing the jury that proof of penetration on the sodomy charge required proof of penetration only of the outer lips of the vagina and not the vagina itself; and (3) in concluding that the evidence was sufficient to support all of his convictions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">The prosecutrix, a thirteen-year-old child, testified at trial to multiple instances during which appellant forced her to engage in several different forms of sexual contact. Beginning when she was five years old, appellant \u201cwould take [her into] the bathroom and make [her] shake his privates.\u201d Although appellant forced her to engage in this behavior \u201ca lot of times,\u201d she was afraid to tell anyone about it. The child also testified that a \u201ccouple of times\u201d when she was between the ages of six and twelve, appellant removed her pants, \u201crubbfed] his privates down where [her] privates were,\u201d and put his penis in her vagina. She screamed and asked him to stop because it hurt, but he refused to do so. Once, after engaging in vaginal intercourse, appellant put his penis around the child\u2019s \u201cchest area and . . . face.\u201d He tried to put his penis in her mouth, but she held it closed tightly so that he could not. Appellant later told her that if she \u201cever told anybody he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>would rape [her] \u2018til [she] die[d].\u201d On another occasion, when the child was nine or ten, appellant licked her \u201cdown where [her] private part was,\u201d such that his tongue went \u201c[o]n top of [her] crack and kind of inside of [her] crack.\u201d She also testified that his tongue touched her \u201chole\u201d but that she knew it did not go inside \u201c[b]ecause [she] did not feel it go in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The child\u2019s stepmother testified that when the child was seven, the child\u2019s sister told her the child had seen appellant\u2019s penis. When the stepmother asked the child about it, the child reported that it had happened in the bathroom. When the stepmother confronted appellant and asked him how he could do such a thing, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d The stepmother testified that she ordered appellant to move out of their house, which he did, but that, despite her efforts to keep him away from the children, he was later found alone in the house with the children without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">When the child was twelve, she finally reported the incidents to her father\u2019s female friend. The father\u2019s friend testified that she suspected something was wrong because the child appeared to be afraid of appellant. Upon questioning, the child specifically told her of appellant\u2019s licking of her private parts and attempts to put his penis in her mouth. The child also told the story to Detective Auditore, who interviewed her in 1991. On cross-examination, the child admitted that she had received regular physicals during these years, and that she had not reported the incidents to anyone until the father\u2019s friend asked whether \u201canybody [had] sexually messed with [her].\u201d She also admitted that several people, including the prosecutor and social worker, had assisted her in preparing her testimony by reminding her of things she had forgotten.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Detective Auditore testified about his interrogation of appellant. Although appellant initially denied having any sexual contact with the child, he later admitted several different incidents. During 1986, he said, while he was drying his hair with a towel that covered his face, the child sneaked into the bathroom and began to play with his penis. Although he told her to get out, the child\u2019s sister saw the incident and reported it to her mother, who accused him of molesting the child. He related another incident during which he said the child put her hand up the leg of his shorts and began to fondle him. Finally, he admitted to Auditore that \u201che sometimes allow [ed] the child to play with his penis,\u201d but denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>that he ever engaged in intercourse or cunnilingus with the child. A social worker present during Auditore\u2019s interview of appellant corroborated much of Auditore\u2019s testimony. Appellant subsequently called Auditore and said all the child\u2019s stories were lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">On direct examination at trial, appellant admitted only to the incident in which the child had sneaked into the bathroom and fondled his penis. On cross-examination, he admitted telling Audi-tore about an incident in which the child had put her hand up the leg of his shorts. He denied ever telling Auditore that he allowed the child to masturbate him in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Appellant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and at the close of all the evidence. The trial judge ultimately denied both motions. Appellant also objected to jury instruction 7, which stated that the penetration required for the sodomy conviction was established if the Commonwealth had proven \u201c[t]hat the tongue of the defendant penetrated into the outer lips of the [victim\u2019s] female sexual organ.\u201d His proffered instruction was refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The parties agree that penetration is required for a conviction of sodomy by cunnilingus. <em>See Ryan v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 439, 444-45, 247 S.E.2d 698, 702 (1978) (comparing the penetration requirement in case involving alleged sodomy by fellatio to a case of sodomy by cunnilingus). Their dispute is over what must be penetrated. On appeal, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Traverso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). The evidence adduced at trial established that appellant\u2019s tongue penetrated at least the victim\u2019s outer vaginal lips, or labia majora, and touched but did not penetrate the vaginal opening itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Appellant offered the following jury instruction, which the trial court refused: \u201cTo be sodomy, there must be penetration, no matter how slight, of the tongue into the vaginal opening of another. Mere touching of the tongue to the vaginal opening is not sufficient. It is not necessary that there be an ejaculation.\u201d However, the trial court accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered instruction, which stated that penetration was required but that it was established if the evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201c[t]hat [petitioner\u2019s] tongue . . . penetrated into the outer lips of the [victim\u2019s] female sexual organ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Implicit in both the majority and dissenting opinions in <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 109, 409 S.E.2d 466 (1991), is that appellant <em>could </em>properly be convicted of sodomy if the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cpenetrated the outer lips of the female sexual organ . . . with his mouth or tongue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 409 S.E.2d at 470 (Elder, J., dissenting); <em>see id. </em>at 113-14, 409 S.E.2d at 468. The Virginia Supreme Court accepted a substantially similar definition of penetration in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 636, 136 S.E. 564 (1927). In that case, the examining doctor testified that, although the nine-year-old victim\u2019s hymen was intact, \u201cthere might have been penetration of the vulva, or outer portion of the organ, without injury to the hymen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 136 S.E. at 565. On that testimony, the Court concluded that the evidence of penetration was sufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction for rape. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 136 S.E. at 565. Implicit in <em>Rowland </em>is that penetration of any portion of the vulva, which encompasses the \u201cexternal parts of the female sex organs considered as a whole\u201d and includes, beginning with the outermost parts, the labia majora, labia minora, hymen, vaginal opening and vagina, 4 J.E. Schmidt, <em>Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine </em>V-106 (18th ed. 1990), is sufficient to show penetration. Penetration of the vaginal opening, which the testimony in <em>Rowland </em>showed could not have taken place based on the condition of the victim\u2019s hymen, clearly was not required. The case law from other jurisdictions \u201cuniformly\u201d holds that insertion of the defendant\u2019s tongue into the victim\u2019s vagina need not be shown to prove cunnilingus. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benoit, </em>531 N.E.2d 262, 266 n.6 (Mass. App. Ct. 1988), <em>review denied, </em>536 N.E.2d 612 (Mass. 1989); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>443 A.2d 1274, 1278-79 (Conn. 1982); <em>Partain </em>v. <em>State, </em>492 A.2d 669, 672 (Md. Ct. Spec. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 A.2d 1185 (Md. 1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>574 S.W.2d 432, 433-34 (Mo. Ct. App. 1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>405 N.W.2d 600, 606-07 (Neb. 1987); <em>State v. Fraction, </em>503 A.2d 336, 337-38 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 A.2d 426 (N.J. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ludlum, </em>281 S.E.2d 159, 161-63 (N.C. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Appellant argues that the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cpenetrates the labia majora,\u201d in Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.2 and 18.2-67.2:1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>but not in the section at issue here, \u00a7 18.2-67.1, shows that the legislature intended to require more than penetration of the labia majora to support a sodomy conviction. This difference in language is not dispositive, however, for the references to penetration of the labia majora in \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-67.2 and 18.2-67.2:1 proscribe inanimate object sexual penetration, a statutory offense which required express definition. By contrast, the legislature has used the term cunnilingus, a common law crime which is not defined in the code, to describe oral sodomy committed against a female. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, we find more logical the conclusion that the legislature intended to mandate the same degree of penetration for all of these offenses. The jury was properly instructed that penetration of the labia majora was sufficient to support the sodomy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Appellant also argues that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support any of his convictions. He bases his argument on the assertion that the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony was incredible as a matter of law because she waited seven years to report the incidents; forgot certain details of her prior reports and testimony; and appeared to have been coached by the detective, prosecutor and social worker. In addition, appellant argues that her testimony was uncorroborated by any physical evidence. Finally, appellant vehemently denied the charges, and six witnesses testified to his good character. Other than those arguments raised above, however, he does not allege that the evidence was lacking as to any other elements of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Appellant\u2019s arguments clearly fail. \u201cWhen considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a criminal conviction, we must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and accord to the evidence all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Traverso, </em>6 Va. App. at 176, 366 S.E.2d at 721. Unless the jury\u2019s verdict is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it,\u201d it will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>In addition, it is up to the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses, by \u201cweighing such factors as the appearance and manner of the witness on the stand, their intelligence, their opportunity for knowing the truth and observing the things about which they testify, their interest in the outcome of the case, their bias, and if any had been shown, their prior inconsistent statements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Mullis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 564, 571, 351 S.E.2d 919, 923 (1987) (citing <em>Zirkle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 870, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The jury obviously found the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony credible and appellant\u2019s testimony, which was riddled with unexplained inconsistencies, incredible. None of the factors emphasized by appellant renders the child\u2019s testimony either inadmissible or incredible as a matter of law. For example, it was up to the jury to determine what effect, if any, the delay in reporting the incident had on the credibility of the child\u2019s testimony. <em>See, e.g., Corvin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 296, 299, 411 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1991). Under settled principles of law, the child\u2019s testimony alone, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction, even in the absence of corroborating physical or testimonial evidence. <em>Id:, see Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 296, 299, 321 S.E.2d 202, 203-04 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Benton, J., and Koontz, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
