We hold that the commission did not have to make an explicit, numerical rating of the disability for each leg where evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>such a rating by a physician was presented to the commission and the commission determined that the employee was totally disabled because of the impairment she suffered in both legs. Furthermore, because the underlying purpose of the commission\u2019s Rule 13(B)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was served, the commission did not err in applying the rule to limit compensation to the period ninety days before the claimant filed her application for additional compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The employee injured her back in the course of her employment, and the employer accepted the injury as compensable. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement, the employer paid temporary total disability benefits to the employee for 500 weeks, after which time she could no longer receive temporary benefits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-500(D). Almost three years later, the employee\u2019s family physician determined that she \u201chas lost 25% of the functioning of both legs.\u201d Immediately, the employee applied for a change in condition, alleging \u201cpermanent and total incapacity from loss or use of both legs,\u201d based upon her family physician\u2019s rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In his deposition before the hearing, the family physician quoted a letter from a neurosurgeon, who had also treated the employee, describing \u201cintractable right leg pain and a great deal of low back pain.\u201d He testified that this pain was limited to right leg and lower back, and said that a conservative rating was a twenty-five percent loss. He testified that there was \u201cminimal functional loss in the left leg,\u201d but included the left leg in the rating because it was not strong enough to support the fifty-five year old employee when the right leg went out.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The family physician testified that he thought the employee could manage to work a sedentary job if she were provided transportation, could perform her job seated with proper support, and could take breaks. Further, he said her discomfort and need to change positions could pose a problem in employment, as could her need for sedating pain medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The commission held that the employee\u2019s functional loss of both legs and her incapacity to engage in gainful employment \u201care properly considered together as a basis for determining permanent and total incapacity pursuant to the Virginia [Workers\u2019 Compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>sation] Act.\u201d It awarded her compensation for permanent, total loss of the use of both legs, but also held that Rule 13(B) barred the award of benefits for more than ninety days prior to the employee\u2019s application for a change in condition. The employer appealed the award of benefits, and the employee appealed the application of Rule 13(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-503(C)(l) provides compensation for \u201cpermanent and total incapacity\u201d for \u201c[l]oss of . . . both legs.\u201d \u201cIn construing this section, the permanent loss of the <em>use </em>of a member shall be equivalent to the loss of such member, and for the permanent partial loss or <em>loss of use </em>of a member, compensation may be proportionately awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-503(D) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cLoss of use\u201d need not be measured in terms of an anatomical loss. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 715, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). \u201c \u2018[T]otal and permanent loss\u2019 or \u2018loss of use\u2019 do not mean that the leg is immovable or that it cannot be used in walking around the house, or even around the block.\u201d <em>Virginia Oak Flooring Co. v. Chrisley, </em>195 Va. 850, 857, 80 S.E.2d 537, 541 (1954). Although an award of benefits under this section does not depend upon \u201cthe capacity or incapacity of claimant to engage in gainful employment,\u201d this capacity \u201cis a proper element for consideration\u201d in determining the extent of loss of use of a member. <em>Id. </em>at 860, 80 S.E.2d at 542; <em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Va. App. 401, 406, 339 S.E.2d 552, 555 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In determining whether benefits for partial loss are to be awarded, \u201cthe commission must rate \u2018the percentage of incapacity suffered by the employee\u2019 based on the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Hungerford Mechanical Corp. </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>11 Va. App. 675, 677, 401 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (quoting <em>County of Spotsylvania </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977)). \u201cMedical evidence is not necessarily conclusive, but is subject to the commission\u2019s consideration and weighing.\u201d <em>Hungerford, </em>11 Va. App. at 677, 401 S.E.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The commission\u2019s failure to express a numerical rating of the employee\u2019s incapacity<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was not error. In <em>Cafaro Construction Co. v. Strother, </em>15 Va. App. 656, 426 S.E.2d 489 (1993), which also involved a lower back injury causing a functional loss of an employee\u2019s legs, we reversed the commission\u2019s award of benefits where the employee failed to \u201cpresent evidence rating the functional loss of use of his legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662, 426 S.E.2d at 493. We held that the commission erred in relying on the employee\u2019s prior total disability, for which the employee had already been compensated under Code \u00a7 65.2-500, to satisfy the requirements of Code \u00a7 65.2-503. <em>Id. </em>In that case, \u201cbecause the evidence in support of the-claimant\u2019s application failfed] to rate the functional loss of use of his legs, the claimant failed in his burden of proof to establish entitlement to benefits for permanent partial or total loss of use of his legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, <em>Cafaro </em>requires that evidence of such a rating be considered by the commission. In this case, the commission did consider such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s determination that the employee has a functional, permanent loss of both of her legs. Although a rated loss of less than 100% does not constitute a total loss of both legs if an employee can return to work, <em>Borden v. Norman, </em>218 Va. 581, 587, 239 S.E.2d 89, 93 (1977), the evidence in this case supports a finding that this employee could not return to work. She would have required transportation to and from work, could not climb stairs, would need to remain seated and supported, might need to shift position every few minutes because of pain, and would require sedating medication. Although the physician described the loss to the employee\u2019s left leg as minimal, he rated the loss to both as twenty-five percent because the nerve fibers were actually interrupted to the left leg and it would not support her when the right leg failed. The evidence of a rated loss of twenty-five percent of both legs, coupled with the additional evidence of her incapacity for employment, supports the commission\u2019s finding that the employee is permanently unemployable as a consequence of her loss of function in both legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Findings of fact made by the commission are binding on this court if they are supported by credible evidence. Code \u00a7 65.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>706; <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 833, 252 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1979); <em>Jules Hairstylists, Inc. v. Galanes, </em>1 Va. App. 64, 68, 334 S.E.2d 592, 595 (1985). Therefore, we will not disturb the commission\u2019s findings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Next, we address the applicability of the commission\u2019s Rule 13(B). Under this rule, an employee\u2019s application for a review upon a change of condition \u201cmust state the change in condition relied upon,\u201d and \u201c[n]o additional compensation may be awarded more than ninety days prior to the filing of the application.\u201d Rule 13(B) exists to protect the employer\u2019s right to provide medical treatment and rehabilitation to reduce liability by providing the employer notice of a change in the employee\u2019s condition. <em>Bristol Door &amp; Lumber Co. v. Hinkle, </em>157 Va. 474, 478, 161 S.E. 902, 902 (1932); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Peoples Life Ins. Co., 7 </em>Va. App. 61, 70, 372 S.E.2d 161, 166 (1988) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The employee\u2019s application was based on a change in the conditions which had resulted in termination of her compensation. After expiration of the 500 weeks during which she was entitled to benefits for temporary total incapacity, she did not receive compensation. Not until she experienced permanent, total incapacity of both legs was she entitled to a resumption of compensation. Thus, the conditions entitling her to compensation had changed, and the employer was entitled to notice to assure its ability to mitigate its liability .through rehabilitation or treatment. The commission cannot determine if the employer\u2019s efforts to have done so would have been futile more than ninety days before the filing of the employee\u2019s application. Therefore, the commission did not err in applying its Rule 13(B), even though it found that the employee is now permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Baker, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> Now Rule 1.2(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\"> The commission did not make an explicit, numerical rating. However, a rating of 100% might be implied from a finding of total incapacity. A specific numerical rating may be required where proportional benefits are to be awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
