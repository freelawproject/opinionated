The appellants contend that (1) oral notice by Wang, the president of the corporation, to her husband, an employee of the corporation, does not constitute timely notice of injury pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-600, and (2) the insurer was not responsible for medical expenses incurred by Wang before the insurer was notified of the injury and could provide a panel of physicians. We affirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The evidence proved that Wang is an employee, shareholder, director, and registered agent of Solid Gold Corporation. She manages the motel the corporation owns. On April 8, 1991, Wang suffered an injury by accident while attempting to replace a board at the motel. She immediately told her husband of her injury. Wang and her husband testified that Wang\u2019s husband, who was also an employee of the corporation, was responsible for filing workers\u2019 compensation claims with the insurer and handling other insurance matters. The husband testified that he knew little about workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">When Wang\u2019s injury began to cause pain, she visited Dr. William K. Renas, a chiropractor. Dr. Renas treated Wang for pain in her shoulder, back, and neck, and he later referred Wang to a neurologist. After Wang began treatment with Dr. Renas, Dr. Renas sent insurance forms to the agency that handled all the insurance matters for the corporation. The agency then sent to Wang\u2019s husband a packet of information, including the first report of accident forms for workers\u2019 compensation claims. On October 7, 1991, Wang\u2019s husband prepared the form and sent it to the insurer. Wang was still receiving treatment when her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>sent the report to the insurer, and Wang began orthopedic treatment with Dr. Thomas Daugherty in February 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">The deputy commissioner ruled that all treatments received from Dr. Renas and from doctors referred by Dr. Renas were unauthorized and denied Wang\u2019s application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, except for medical treatments that Wang received from Dr. Daugherty. On review, the commission found that Wang gave notice to her employer when she informed her husband, the person designated to handle insurance matters, of her injury. Based on that finding, the commission modified the deputy commissioner\u2019s award to include medical treatment rendered by Dr. Renas and the neurosurgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Code \u00a7 65.2-600(A) states that \u201c[ejvery injured employee . . . shall immediately on the occurrence of an accident . . . give . . . to the employer a written notice of the accident.\u201d The statute further provides that failure to give written notice shall not bar medical benefits if the commission finds that the employee had a reasonable excuse for not doing so and that the employer has not been prejudiced. Code \u00a7 65.2-600(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">At the hearings before the deputy commissioner, appellants defended the case on the ground that Wang was \u201cbarred from receiving any medical benefits because she failed to give timely notice to the [insurance] carrier pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-600.\u201d On review, the commission noted that \u201c[t]he burden regarding notice, however, required [Wang] to give notice to her employer.\u201d Appellants argue on appeal that Wang should be barred from receiving medical benefits because the notice was not written.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Although the issue that appellants now raise was not expressly addressed to the commission, the commission found that the employer had actual notice of the injury. <em>See Department of Game &amp; Inland Fisheries </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>147 Va. 89, 94-95, 136 S.E. 651, 653 (1927). Credible evidence supports that finding. Thus, the appellants have failed to establish any prejudice that resulted from the employer\u2019s failure to receive written notice. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-600(C). <em>See also Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Coffey, </em>13 Va. App. 446, 449, 412 S.E.2d 209, 211 (1991). In addition, the commission properly rejected appellants\u2019 argument that Code \u00a7 65.2-600 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>required Wang to give notice to the insurer. Code \u00a7 65.2-600 requires notice \u201cto the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">We also affirm the commission\u2019s holding that Code \u00a7 65.2-101(14) does not apply to Wang. That section requires that any \u201csole proprietor\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d who elects to be covered as an employee under workers\u2019 compensation coverage must notify the insurance carrier, not the \u201cemployer,\u201d of an injury for purposes of satisfying the Code \u00a7 65.2-600 notice requirement. Appellants urge us to hold that the legislature contemplated that registered agents, directors, and shareholders of corporations must also give notice to the insurance carrier for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-600. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The statute is clear in its description of persons who must satisfy an alternative notice requirement. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has always been liberally construed for the benefit of employees and their dependents.\u201d <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co. v. </em>Williams, 10 Va. App. 516, 519, 392 S.E.2d 846, 848 (1990). If the legislature had intended to include employees such as Wang within the ambit of Code \u00a7 65.2-101(14), it could have done so. The legislature did not write its statute expansively. We will not so construe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">The insurer was given notice of the claim no later than October 1991 when Wang\u2019s husband filed the first notice of accident. The commission correctly ruled that Wang \u201ccannot be penalized for the employer\u2019s failure to promptly report ... to their insurance carrier.\u201d Wang gave the notice as required by the corporation\u2019s procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The appellants have not proved prejudice or Wang\u2019s disregard of her duty to select an authorized physician. The physician selected by Wang became the treating physician. <em>See Davis v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co., </em>3 Va. App. 123, 348 S.E.2d 420 (1986). When the insurer was notified of the injury and was informed that Wang was receiving medical treatment, the insurer did not provide Wang with a panel of physicians as permitted by Code \u00a7 65.2-603.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Elder, J., and Duff, S.J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
