He complains on appeal that the prosecution unconstitutionally exercised its peremptory challenges to remove black and male venirepersons. For the reasons which follow, we disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Because the assigned error relates solely to procedural aspects of the proceeding below, we recite only those facts pertinent to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">Following voir dire, the prosecutor peremptorily struck one black female, Wright, a white male, Blanock, and two black <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>males, Miller and Randolph, from the venire and similarly removed one black male from among three possible alternate jurors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argued to the trial judge that these peremptory challenges were impermissibly motivated by \u201cracial and gender\u201d considerations and not \u201cgood articulable reason [s].\u201d Although defendant failed to incorporate his concerns into either an objection or motion, the court and Commonwealth engaged the issue as a race and gender-based equal protection challenge under <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed a defendant\u2019s \u201cright to be tried by a jury whose members are selected pursuant to nondiscriminatory criteria\u201d and denounced the peremptory exclusion of potential jurors \u201con account of race\u201d as violative of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Recently, in <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. </em>T.B.,_U.S.-, 114 S. Ct. 1419 (1994), the Court extended this protection to embrace \u201c[ijntentional discrimination\u201d by \u201cstate actors\u201d \u201con the basis of gender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, 114 S. Ct. at 1422.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\"><em>Batson </em>and its progeny have outlined the procedures in the trial court necessary to resolve an allegation of discriminatory conduct in jury selection, which have since been often recognized and applied by the appellate courts of this Commonwealth. These protocols were just recently succinctly restated in <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 459, 442 S.E.2d 396 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">The defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory strikes on the basis of race. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>499 U.S. at 409. If this showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a racially neutral explanation for striking the jurors in question. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-97. If the court determines that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>proffered reasons are . . . [race and gender] neutral, the defendant should be afforded an opportunity to show why the reasons, even though facially . . . neutral, are merely pretextual and that the challenged strikes were based on race [or gender]. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Joe, </em>928 F.2d 99, 103 (4th Cir. 1991). But, ultimately, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Clearly, <em>Batson's </em>\u201cproof structure\u201d requires a defendant, confronted with a facially neutral explanation for a prosecutor\u2019s peremptory strikes, \u201cto show both that these reasons were merely pretextual and that race [or gender] was the real reason.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McMillon, </em>14 F.3d 948, 953 (4th Cir. 1994). <em>See also Hill v. Berry, </em>247 Va. 271, 274-75, 441 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1994); <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 451, 443 S.E.2d 414, 415 (1994); <em>Broady </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 281, 285, 429 S.E.2d 468, 471 (1993). The trial court is not required \u201cto seek out and evaluate information or evidence not utilized by either party ... in the absence of . . . counsel\u2019s identification of a false or pretextual reason for the peremptory strikes.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>247 Va. at 453, 443 S.E.2d at 416. The burden of \u201cproving that the prosecution engaged in purposeful discrimination\u201d remains with the defendant and may not be shifted to the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Here, the trial court responded properly to defendant\u2019s challenge of the Commonwealth\u2019s peremptory strikes and required the prosecutor to provide \u201cracially\u201d and \u201csexist neutral reasons\u201d for her conduct. Without contesting the implicit finding by the trial court that the defendant had established a prima facie case of willful discrimination,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the prosecutor explained that she removed venirepersons Wright, Blanock, and Randolph because each was \u201csingle,\u201d not \u201ca parent.\u201d Addressing the related gender issue, the prosecutor observed that it simply \u201cturned out that most of the males were not parents.\u201d She further noted that venireperson Miller \u201cdid not seem to be involved, even at this stage of the proceedings.\u201d The trial judge agreed that Miller exhibited a detached \u201cattitude and demeanor and appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s representations to the court, defendant noted that Miller was \u201cnicely, neatly\u201d dressed, \u201cseemed otherwise attentive,\u201d and argued that Miller\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d during voir dire was \u201cno indication [that] he shouldn\u2019t be with us.\u201d Without specificity, defendant characterized the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for removing the other jurors in issue as \u201cpoor, at best,\u201d and, again, generally protested the racial and \u201csexual makeup\u201d of the petit jury and the race/gender ratios of the prosecutor\u2019s strikes. In response, after acknowledging defendant\u2019s \u201cobjection,\u201d the trial judge \u201center [ed] a finding that the reasons advanced by the Commonwealth for her strikes [were] racially . . . and sexually neutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">\u201cIn evaluating the race [and gender] neutrality of an attorney\u2019s explanation, a court must determine whether, assuming the proffered reasons for the peremptory challenges are true, the challenges violate the Equal Protection Clause as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 359 (1991). If the explanation is constitutionally acceptable, the \u201cdecisive question\u201d before the trial judge then becomes \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s . . . explanation . . . should be believed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. \u201c[0]nce that has been settled, there seems nothing left to review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. A \u201ctrial court\u2019s decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact of the sort accorded great deference on appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 364, and this decision will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 369; <em>James, </em>247 Va. at 462, 442 S.E.2d at 398; <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 456, 460, 438 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1993). This standard of review logically recognizes the trial court\u2019s unique opportunity to observe and evaluate \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility\u201d in the context of the case then before the court. <em>Hernandez, </em>500 U.S. at 365; <em>see Barksdale, </em>17 Va. App. at 460, 438 S.E.2d at 763-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Here, the prosecutor offered facially neutral, nondiscriminatory reasons for striking venir epersons Miller, Wright, Blanock, and Randolph, which correctly prompted the judge to call upon defendant for a response. Defendant, however, disputed the prosecutor\u2019s explanations only with respect to venireperson Miller, asserting that he was \u201cnicely, neatly dressed\u201d and \u201cseemed otherwise attentive.\u201d This argument was obviously intended to counter the Commonwealth\u2019s observation that Miller had exhibited an indif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ference to the proceedings, a view shared by the court. Defendant\u2019s references to Miller\u2019s clothing and demeanor \u201cotherwise\u201d offer nothing to discredit the facially neutral \u201csensory perceptions\u201d of the court and prosecutor which are \u201crelevant and appropriate considerations\u201d in an assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s actions and reasoning. <em>Barksdale, </em>17 Va. App. at 461, 438 S.E.2d at 764. Manifestly, disinterested jurors should be identified and removed whenever possible, irrespective of race or gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Defendant\u2019s characterization of the prosecutor\u2019s explanations for her strikes of the remaining venirepersons in issue as \u201cpoor\u201d was insufficient to establish pretextual surrogates intended to disguise an impermissible discriminatory purpose. Although defendant argues on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s explanations for striking venirepersons Wright, Blanock, and Randolph were unsupported or contradicted by the record, these contentions were not presented to the trial court and will not be considered by this Court for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18; <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 36, 44-45, 360 S.E.2d 371, 376 (1987); <em>see Buck, </em>247 Va. at 453, 443 S.E.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Accordingly, we are unable to conclude that the trial court was plainly wrong in finding that defendant failed to sufficiently prove the requisite purposeful discrimination in this instance, and we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\"> The trial jury was comprised of eight black females, one white female, one black male, and two white males, a ratio of black representation which actually exceeded that of the panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> This doctrine now applies to both criminal and civil litigation, potential jurors, and all litigants. <em>Georgia </em>v. McCollum,_U.S. -, 112 S. Ct. 2348, 2351 (1992); <em>see generally Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400 (1991); <em>Edmondson </em>v. <em>Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-14\"> Although <em>J.E.B. </em>was decided after the instant case was briefed and argued before this Court, the trial court and counsel foretold the decision and also addressed the gender issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b646-7\"> The \u201cactual sequence of events at trial\u201d oftentimes \u201cmerges the separate procedural steps\u201d incidental to a <em>Batson </em>challenge and analysis. <em>James, </em>247 Va. at 462, 442 S.E.2d at 398. However, this \u201c[consolidation . . . does not invalidate the process as long as . . . [it] does not adversely impact the rights of any party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
