Proctor, Jr. (defendant) was convicted in a bench trial of assaulting a police officer. On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erroneously (1) refused to permit a witness to testify, and (2) denied his request for appointed counsel. We agree that the trial court improperly precluded the testimony and reverse the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence disclosed that on February 3, 1991, Officer J. Head of the Colonial Beach Police Department responded to a \u201cdomestic disturbance\u201d at the home of defendant\u2019s mother-in-law. During his investigation, Head decided to interview defendant\u2019s son, a witness to the \u201cargument,\u201d outside of defendant\u2019s presence. Defendant objected, approached the officer and attempted to strike him with his fist. Head, assisted by Officer Wright, \u201csubdued\u201d and arrested defendant. Head\u2019s testimony was corroborated by that of Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Disputing the officers, defendant and his wife testified that defendant simply requested Head to return defendant\u2019s son, which prompted Head to \u201ccharge [ ] back across the street\u201d and assault defendant. Defendant also called his son as a witness, but the court refused to permit him to testify, noting that it <em>\u201cassumed </em>the testimony would, in all respects, substantiate that of the defendant\u201d and \u201cit was needless to subject the child<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to the emotional trauma if the court were going to take it as <em>both </em>corroborative and cumulative testimony.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201c[Cjorroborative testimony and cumulative testimony are not the same thing.\u201d <em>Massey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 436, 442, 337 S.E.2d 754, 758 (1985). Cumulative testimony simply \u201crestates what has been said already and adds nothing to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, though \u201cits introduction may be limited by the court,\u201d \u201ccumulative evidence should sometimes be admitted,\u201d if material. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, corroborative evidence is \u201cexactly the kind of evidence that [a] defendant [is] entitled to develop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 337 S.E.2d at 758. It \u201cdoes not emanate from the defendant\u2019s mouth, does not rest wholly upon [his] credibility, but . . . adds to, strengthens, and confirms [his] testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such evidence is clearly \u201cadmissible, unless excluded by a specific rule or policy consideration.\u201d <em>Cash </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 506, 510, 364 S.E.2d 769, <em>771 </em>(1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">A defendant in a criminal prosecution is constitutionally assured the right \u201cto call for evidence in his favor.\u201d Va. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThis right is central to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system\u201d and guarantees that an accused \u201cwill not be unduly shackled in his effort to develop his best defense.\u201d <em>Massey, </em>230 Va. at 442, 337 S.E.2d at 757. A court may not impose \u201cimpermissible limitations on the exercise of this important right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 337 S.E.2d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Here, the trial court presumed that the witness\u2019 testimony would be both cumulative and corroborative and refused to receive it. Under the circumstances, this ruling impaired defendant\u2019s basic right to call for evidence which favored his cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and remand this case for a new trial if the Town of Colonial Beach be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\"> Because we reverse on this issue, we need not address the remaining assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-13\"> The record fixes the child\u2019s age at both eleven and twelve years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b38-9\"> This right is similarly expressed in the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. <em>See Washington v. </em>Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
