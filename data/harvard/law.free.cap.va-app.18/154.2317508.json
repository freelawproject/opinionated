The Department argues that Social Security payments are a form of insurance payable to a designated beneficiary or a statutory entitlement payable to a disabled employee\u2019s dependents for which the parent should not receive credit toward a court-ordered child support obligation. We hold that a dependent\u2019s Social Security disability benefits, although constituting an independent entitlement, are in the nature of support made in lieu of a disabled employee\u2019s earnings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, whether the trial court credits the payment against an arrearage for court-ordered support depends upon the circumstances of each case and rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. In the case of Danny Skeens, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, under the circumstances, in crediting the accumulated Social Security benefits payable to his dependent children against his court-ordered support arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In 1986, the trial court had held Danny Skeens in contempt for failing to pay court-ordered child support. At the time, the court ordered Skeens to pay $200 per month child support and $100 per month on an accumulated arrearage of $8,261.97. The record does not show whether the order to pay $200 per month was a continuation or modification of the amount of the previous award. The trial judge told Skeens in 1986 that \u201cno further delinquencies will be tolerated and any change in circumstances must immediately be followed up with a petition to decrease or contempt sanctions will be imposed.\u201d Skeens was told \u201cto immediately notify the court of any change in employment, layoff, reduction in wages or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>hours worked.\u201d At the time; Skeens apparently was disabled and receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Skeens never returned to gainful employment after 1986 because he was totally and permanently disabled. In January 1988, Skeens\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits ended, and he began receiving Social Security disability benefits, which were his sole source of income. The record is silent as to whether Skeens had any other assets. After Skeens began receiving Social Security benefits, he did not notify the court that his circumstance had changed, nor did he petition for a modification of his support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Skeens\u2019s court-ordered obligation to pay $200 a month in child support ended in September 1991, when his youngest child became eighteen. At that time, Skeens was in arrears in the amount of $14,017.14. The Department, which had been paying Skeens\u2019s former wife aid to dependent children, issued a mandatory withholding of earnings order directed to the Social Security Administration to collect the support arrearage by withholding a designated amount from Skeens\u2019s monthly Social Security benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Skeens petitioned the court to quash the withholding order and to determine the arrearage and, in doing so, to allow him credit for $7,086.10, the amount that the Social Security Administration had paid to his children in dependents\u2019 benefits on account of his disability. The circuit court denied the motion to quash, but ruled that \u201cequity dictates that Mr. Skeens receive credit for these benefits.\u201d The court credited the entire $7,086.10 that had been paid to the children against the $14,017.14 arrearage and declared the balance in arrears to be $6,931.04.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>The Department contends that the trial court\u2019s ruling is error because it, in effect, amounts to a retroactive modification of the child support order and a modification of a vested final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Child support payments required under a valid court order become vested as they accrue, and the court is without authority to make any change as to past due installments. <em>Cofer </em>v. <em>Cofer, </em>205 Va. 834, 838-39, 140 S.E.2d 663, 666-67 (1965); Code \u00a7 20-112. Generally, the terms of a support decree must be strictly complied with and payments made when due to the designated payee in accordance with the terms of the decree. <em>See Fearon </em>v. <em>Fearon, </em>207 Va. 927, 930-31, 154 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1967); <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>202 Va. 515, 518, 118 S.E.2d 656, 658 (1961). When changed circumstances dictate a modification of a support decree, the appropriate remedy is for the party to petition the court to modify the decree. The party or parties may not unilaterally or bilaterally vary its terms. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">However, although a court may not retroactively modify a child support obligation, allowing a payor spouse credit for nonconforming support payments, in the limited situations where permitted, is not a modification of a support order. <em>See Acree </em>v. <em>Acree, </em>2 Va. App. 151, 152, 342 S.E.2d 68, 69 (1986). A court may, when equitable and under limited circumstances, allow a party credit for non-conforming support payments, provided that the non-conforming payment substantially satisfies the purpose and function of the support award, <em>see Acree, 2 </em>Va. App. at 152, 342 S.E.2d at 69, and to do so does not vary the support award. The payment of money to the child\u2019s custodian in the form of Social Security payments is an indirect payment from the obligor parent for which the parent should receive credit. <em>See supra </em>note 2. However, whether the obligor parent is entitled to credit for such payments against an accumulated arrearage presents a different problem and will depend upon a number of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Other jurisdictions which have held that Social Security benefits are to be credited against a support award have based their holdings on the view that the purpose of a child support or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>der is satisfied when Social Security disability benefits are paid to a dependent child. Regardless of the source of payment, if the child support is paid, the order is satisfied, and the parent on whose account payment is made should receive credit. \u201cThe use of Social Security payments to satisfy a child support obligation is merely a change in the manner of payment; the nature of the funds is the same.\u201d <em>McClaskey </em>v. <em>McClaskey, </em>543 S.W.2d 832, 834 (Mo. Ct. App. 1976). <em>See also Horton </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>132 S.E.2d 200, 201 (Ga. 1963); <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>449 A.2d 947, 948 (Vt. 1982); <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Potts, </em>240 N.W.2d 680, 682 (Iowa 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Of those jurisdictions that have disallowed a credit, most have done so on the theory that application of Social Security payments to reduce a child support arrearage constitutes a retroactive modification of the child support award. <em>See, e.g., Chase v. Chase, </em>444 P.2d 145, 149-50 (Wash. 1968); <em>Moritz v. Moritz, </em>368 N.W.2d 337, 341-42 (Minn. Ct. App. 1985); <em>In re Marriage of Cope, </em>619 P.2d 883, 889 (Or. Ct. App. 1980). We consider this latter approach to be unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">When a trial court grants credit to a payor parent for Social Security benefits received by his children on account of his disability, the court does not alter the amount of child support that the parent has been ordered or is required to pay. The court simply allows a source of funds, indirectly attributable to a parent, to be used to satisfy the parent\u2019s court-ordered support obligation. Thus, a circuit court does not retroactively modify a child support award or forgive an accumulated arrearage by crediting a dependent child\u2019s Social Security benefits to satisfy a support obligation. <em>See Board v. Board, </em>690 S.W.2d 380, 381 (Ky. 1985) (holding that a difference exists between allowing a credit for payment made from another source and modifying the specific dollar amount).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A third approach, and the one that we find to be based on sound rationale when deciding whether to credit Social Security payments against a child support arrearage, is that the trial court has the discretion to grant or deny the payor parent credit, depending upon the circumstances.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">The request before the trial court was to allow a setoff for Social Security benefits against the arrearage in child support. Such a request goes to the discharge procedure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>vested support payments and not to modification of vested support rights. The decision to grant or deny respondent\u2019s request . . . lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\"><em>Department of Public Aid </em>v. <em>McNichols, </em>611 N.W.2d 593, 595 (Ill. Ct. App. 1993). We find the Illinois court\u2019s reasoning persuasive, and we adopt a similar rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">A rule giving the trial court discretion to grant credit, in whole or in part, or to deny credit against an arrearage, depending upon the circumstances, allows the judge to consider the equities of a given situation. Whether a trial court elects to credit all or a portion of Social Security payments against a court-ordered support obligation should depend upon a number of factors, including but not limited to the extent to which the original support award was sufficient or deficient in meeting the child\u2019s needs, whether any modification of the support award has been made based upon the parent\u2019s disability, or a change in the child\u2019s needs, or the parents\u2019 abilities to provide support independent of the Social Security payments, and whether both parents have acted in good faith. To adopt a rule that requires trial courts to always or never treat Social Security payments as satisfying an arrearage in court-ordered support would unduly restrict trial courts from taking into consideration factors or events that would justify different treatment. <em>See Farley v. Farley, </em>412 S.E.2d 261, 265 (W. Va. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">In this case, the trial judge determined that \u201cequity dictates that [Danny] Skeens receive credit for these benefits.\u201d Insofar as we can ascertain from this record, Skeens\u2019s child support obligation had not been reduced or modified after he became disabled for purposes of Social Security benefits and after he began receiving Social Security benefits or after the children began receiving their dependent children\u2019s benefits. Although Skeens should not be rewarded for allowing his child support obligation to go unpaid and to fall in arrears, neither should he be penalized by disallowing him credit for payments that were made to his children from a source of funds that were payable on his account. There is no evidence that suggests that Skeens had any source of income or assets, other than his Social Security disability benefits, from which his support obligation or arrearage could be paid that would justify treating the payment to the children as independent support. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tion by holding that \u201cequity required\u201d that Skeens be given credit on his accrued support obligation, thereby reducing his support arrearage to $6,931.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Moon, C.J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\"> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(1)(A) (1992) provides that when a disabled worker with dependent children establishes entitlement to Social Security disability benefits, the dependent child or child\u2019s custodian need only file an application with the Social Security Administration to be paid benefits independent of the recipient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> <em>See Whitaker </em>v. <em>Colbert, </em>18 Va. App. 202, 442 S.E.2d 429 (1994) (holding that Social Security payments to a disabled parent are income for purposes of computing child support, and Social Security payments to a dependent child shall be credited prospectively against a child support award in which Social Security payments have been considered).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> The Department is subrogated to the rights of Skeens\u2019s former wife to receive child support as a result of the Department having paid her Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Code \u00a7 63.1-251. As a result of subrogation, the entire amount of Skeens\u2019s child support arrearage is owed to the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> We dismiss as without merit the Department\u2019s claim that this appeal should be dismissed because Skeens failed to post an appeal bond in accordance with the requirements of Code \u00a7 16.1-107 when he appealed from the Buchanan County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court to the circuit court. An appeal bond is required of a party applying for an appeal from an order of a juvenile and domestic relations district court . . . establishing a support arrearage or suspending payment of support during the pendency of an appeal. Code \u00a7 16.1-107. <em>See also Scheer </em>v. <em>Isaacs, </em>10 Va. App. 338, 339-40, 392 S.E.2d 201, 202-03 (1990) (appeal bond required prior to husband\u2019s appeal from Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court judgment establishing child support arrearage of $67,805). The Juvenile and Domestic Relations proceeding from which Skeens appealed was his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tion to quash the Department\u2019s withholding order and his motion to be allowed credit for Social Security benefits paid to his children. The order did not establish a support arrearage or enter judgment for an arrearage. Accordingly, no appeal bond was required by Code \u00a7 16.2-107, and the circuit court did not err in so ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
