That statute provides that \u201c[e]very person who intentionally makes an obscene display or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place . . . shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d On appeal, appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to show (1) that his behavior constituted \u201can exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof\u2019 and (2) that his behavior was obscene. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On June 10, 1992, appellant entered the office supply store where Bonnie Faulk worked and asked her for help locating a refill for his pen. While Faulk was assisting him, she looked up and saw that \u201che had dropped his pants,\u201d which were \u201creal short running shorts,\u201d and that he was then \u201cwearing [only] a real skimpy G-string.\u201d Although the G-string covered his penis, \u201cit was very form-fitting,\u201d such that Faulk could see the outline of his penis. She also testified that his buttocks and remaining pubic area were exposed and that she could see his pubic hair. Appellant picked up his shorts and said, \u201cThese darn things just keep falling off.\u201d He then modeled for her, slowly turned around, and asked her what she \u201c[thought] of the whole picture.\u201d He told her \u201che had searched all over town for this particular swim suit\u201d and that he liked to wear it, or nothing at all, when he went out on his boat. He also said the shorts \u201cwere great\u201d because they attached with velcro, which \u201cgave easy access to women who wanted him.\u201d After being in the store for ten or fifteen minutes, appellant put his shorts back on and left, but returned six days later at almost the same time wearing the same shorts. When Faulk\u2019s manager came out of the back room, appellant \u201cstarted to look around, dart his eyes. He got real nervous, real shaken up, . . . grabbed a pen[,] . . . immediately went to pay for it,\u201d and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">When interviewed by the police, appellant stated that his shorts had fallen off accidentally during his first visit to the store and that \u201che didn\u2019t know\u201d why he wore those same shorts into the store on the second occasion but that he eventually threw them away.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction. On appeal of a criminal conviction, we review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, \u201cgranting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680). As quoted above, Code \u00a7 18.2-387 requires proof that defendant intentionally made an obscene display or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place. Appellant does not challenge the fact that his conduct occurred in a public place, nor does he contend on appeal that it was unintentional. The only determinations remaining to be made are whether the portions of his body exposed fell within the proscriptions of the statute, and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s behavior was obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 does not define the terms, \u201cperson, or the private parts thereof.\u201d Under settled legal principles, however, and as pointed out by the Commonwealth, \u201c[t]he Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 708, 710, 347 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1986) (defining term \u201cmanufacture\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-248.1(a)). Although the term, \u201cprivate parts,\u201d is not defined in the Code, other related phrases make clear the legislature\u2019s intent to include the groin and buttocks within that category. In Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2), which defines terms used in the article proscribing various types of criminal sexual assault, for example, \u201cintimate parts\u201d include not only the genitalia, but also the \u201canus, groin, breast or buttocks.\u201d Similarly, Code \u00a7 18.2-390, which restricts the sale and loan of certain items to juveniles, defines \u201cnudity\u201d as \u201ca state of undress so as to expose the human . . . genitals, pubic area or buttocks.\u201d Clearly, the portions of his body that appellant exposed fell within the proscriptions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">As defined in relevant part in Code \u00a7 18.2-372, \u201cobscene\u201d means</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">that which, considered as a whole, has as its dominant theme or purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex, that is, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sexual conduct, [or] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>sexual excitement . . . and which goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters . . . .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Under this definition, the evidence was clearly sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s exposure of his \u201cprivate parts\u201d was obscene. The trial court was entitled to conclude that appellant\u2019s statements, in conjunction with his actions, clearly established that his actions had as their dominant purpose an appeal to the prurient interest in sex as defined in the Code. It is clear that appellant\u2019s statements are not proscribed. The statute in question prohibits an obscene exposure in a public place. Appellant\u2019s statements merely aided in establishing his intent in acting as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Clad in a skimpy G-string which covered only his penis and anus, leaving his pubic area and buttocks exposed, appellant modeled for Faulk, asking her, \u201cWhat do you think of the whole picture?\u201d He told her about his search for the perfect swimsuit and how he liked to go out on his boat, wearing either the swimsuit or nothing at all. He also told her how much he liked his velcro shorts because they \u201cgave easy access to women who wanted him.\u201d Although he claimed that his shorts had fallen off accidentally and that they did so frequently, he made no attempt to put them back on until immediately before leaving the store. He returned a week later wearing the same shorts. When he saw that Faulk was not alone, he became flustered and left. From these facts, the trial court was entitled to conclude that the dominant purpose of appellant\u2019s conduct was \u201ca shameful . . . interest in nudity, sexual conduct, [and] sexual excitement . . . [going] substantially beyond customary limits of candor . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We cannot conclude that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">Koontz, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-10\"> In order to conform with the requirements of the First Amendment, the statute also requires that the conduct be without \u201cserious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372. Appellant concedes on appeal that his conduct had no such value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Although Walter Geoffrey Hart\u2019s conduct was indecent, vulgar, and bizarre, the evidence did not prove either that his conduct was proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-387 or that his conduct was obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-387 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">Every person who intentionally makes an obscene display or exposure of his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where others are present, or procures another to so expose himself, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The garment that Hart wore was described as a G-string or a bathing suit. The record contains no indication, however, that Hart\u2019s garment would have been inappropriate or unlawful if worn on a beach or at a place where sunbathing was appropriate. Hart does not dispute, however, that the garment was skimpy and did not cover his buttocks. The record establishes that the garment was inappropriately worn in a retail store and was offensive to the salesperson who watched Hart deliberately release his shorts to display this garment and his buttocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Although Hart\u2019s buttocks were fully exposed, his genitalia and anus were covered by the garment. His exposed buttocks are the only body part at issue in our determination whether the statute covers his conduct. I do not agree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that buttocks are included within the scope of the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 18.2-387. The majority reaches its conclusion by equating the statutory term \u201cintimate parts\u201d with \u201cprivate parts\u201d and by drawing inferences from the statutory definition of \u201cnudity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The statute that we are required to interpret and apply uses terms that are derived from the common law. The word \u201cperson,\u201d when used in connection with exposure of the body, has traditionally been considered in the common law to be a \u201ceuphemism for the penis.\u201d <em>Duvallon v. District of Columbia, </em>515 A.2d 724, 726-28 (D.C. 1986). In addition, the term \u201cprivate parts\u201d has a generally accepted meaning, also derived from the common law, and refers to male or female genitalia. <em>State v. Jones, </em>171 S.E.2d 468, 468-69 (N.C. App. 1970). Those common law terms are not gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>erally understood to include an individual\u2019s buttocks. <em>See Duvallon, </em>515 A.2d at 728. <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>597 P.2d 13, 14 (Haw. 1979) (female breasts are not private parts or genitalia).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Neither Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(2), which defines \u201cintimate parts\u201d for purposes of criminal sexual assault, nor Code \u00a7 18.2-390(2), which defines \u201cnudity\u201d for purposes of restricting sale of certain items to juveniles, changes the accepted common law definitions of \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cprivate parts.\u201d Indeed, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature defined the terms \u201cintimate parts\u201d and \u201cnudity\u201d so as to give a broader meaning than would have been the case if the statutes had used the terms, \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cprivate parts.\u201d Hart did not expose his genitalia; therefore, his conduct did not bring him within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Moreover, although the statute is styled \u201cIndecent exposure,\u201d a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-387 may not be sustained unless the proof establishes that the \u201cdisplay or exposure\u201d was \u201cobscene.\u201d Mere nudity is an insufficient basis to declare conduct obscene. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 490, 493, 201 S.E.2d 798, 800, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 902 (1974). Indecency is different than obscenity. <em>FCC v. Pacifica Found., </em>438 U.S. 726, 739-41 (1978). Moreover, proof that conduct was indecent is insufficient to prove that it was obscene. <em>See Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, </em>492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). A salient distinction between indecency and obscenity is the element of prurience. <em>Pacifica Found., </em>438 U.S. at 740. <em>See also Miller </em>v. <em>California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973); <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 487 (1957). To establish that an act is obscene the proof must establish a \u201cprurient interest in sex,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-372, and not just sexual desires. <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 </em>U.S. 491, 498-99 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The majority, though conceding that Hart\u2019s words are not themselves obscene, concludes that his words provide the necessary indicia to establish that his conduct was obscene. \u201c[S]ex and obscenity are not synonymous.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>354 U.S. at 487. \u201cSexual expression which is indecent but not obscene is protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Sable Communications, </em>492 U.S. at 126. Hart\u2019s comments, as was his conduct, were vulgar and indecent, but his comments and his conduct did not rise to the level of an obscenity. Though his comments were certainly offensive to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>woman to whom he spoke, even in conjunction with his conduct, they did not satisfy the test of prurience.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In upholding this conviction, the majority equates indecency with obscenity. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
