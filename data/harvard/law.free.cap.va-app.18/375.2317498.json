Tumlin (Tumlin) appeals a denial of permanent partial disability benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-56) by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission). The issue presented in this appeal is whether Code \u00a7 65.2-510 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-63) and our decision in <em>Murphy v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>12 Va. App. 633, 406 S.E.2d 190, <em>aff\u2019d en banc, </em>13 Va. App. 304, 411 S.E.2d 444 (1991), apply to benefits payable under Code \u00a7 65.2-503.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we hold that Code \u00a7 65.2-510 does not apply to awards made under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 under any circumstance. Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Tumlin began working for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. (Goodyear) in 1977. In 1984, Tumlin suffered a non-employment-related injury to his right ankle and in 1985 and 1987, respectively, non-employment-related injuries to his left ankle. On May 18, 1990, Tumlin suffered an employment-related injury to both feet. Tumlin received temporary total disability benefits from May 19, 1990, to August 12, 1990. He returned to sedentary work August 13, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">On December 10, 1990, Tumlin allegedly suffered an employment-related injury to his left wrist. On that day, Tumlin complained of unsafe working conditions to the plant safety director, informing her that \u201cif I go [to the assigned work place], I\u2019ll have another accident.\u201d After Tumlin failed to return to work following a medical examination for the December 10 alleged injury, his work record was reviewed, and a termination decision was made based upon repeated absences, malingering, and poor work habits. That decision was reviewed by a union grievance proceeding and upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">In Tumlin\u2019s initial claim for benefits arising out of the alleged accident on December 10, 1990, the deputy commissioner found that the evidence supported a finding that Tumlin staged the accident, that his termination was for cause, and that Tumlin had failed to seek selective employment following his discharge. Accordingly, benefits were denied for the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. A <em>per curiam </em>memorandum opinion of this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Tumlin now appeals an unfavorable result to a subsequent claim for permanent partial disability pursuant to former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-503) resulting from the May 18, 1990, accident. The deputy commissioner found that the medical evidence did not establish that Tumlin\u2019s partial disability in his feet was causally related to the accident. Furthermore, the deputy commissioner found that Tumlin was not entitled to benefits because of his termination for cause and subsequent failure to seek selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the disability was not causally related to the May 18, 1990 accident. The commission found that the evidence showed Tumlin had, after reaching maximum medical improvement, sustained a permanent thirty-five percent loss of function of the right foot and a permanent ten percent loss of function of the left foot. However, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits on the ground that <em>Murphy </em>barred eligibility for benefits after a for-cause termination from selective employment procured by the employer. In so doing, the commission also relied upon its own opinion in <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Woolard, </em>VWC 146-22-91 (1992), holding that the term \u201cany compensation\u201d in former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 applied to both wage loss and disability compensation when benefits are barred by reason of a for-cause discharge under <em>Murphy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">THE CAUSATION ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">We begin by addressing Goodyear\u2019s assertion that the commission erred in finding that Tumlin established a causal connection between his permanent partial disability and the May 18, 1990, accident. We are guided by well established principles. \u201cFactual findings of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Commission will be upheld on appeal if supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>James </em>v. <em>Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989). If reasonable inferences may be drawn from credible evidence, \u201cthey will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal.\u201d <em>Hawks v. Henrico County School Bd., </em>7 Va. App. 398, 404, 374 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1988). Here, the commission inferred from the evidence that the non-work-related injuries to Tumlin\u2019s ankles were unrelated to the medical rating of permanent disability in Tumlin\u2019s feet. The inference drawn by the commission was reasonable. The record contains no medical evidence of any permanent disability resulting from the injuries to Tumlin\u2019s ankles. Moreover, the record does not reflect any medical evidence to suggest that in the absence of the injury to Tumlin\u2019s ankles, the permanent disability of Tumlin\u2019s feet would be less or non-existent. Accordingly, we hold that the commission\u2019s determination that Tumlin suffered a permanent partial disability to both feet in a work-related accident on May 18, 1990, is supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">THE DISCHARGE FOR CAUSE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">There is no dispute that Tumlin was properly discharged for cause from appropriate selective employment provided by his employer. That matter has been resolved by a prior appeal in this Court. The present dispute concerns the legal effect of that discharge upon Tumlin\u2019s eligibility for benefits for permanent partial loss of the use of his feet as provided for in Code \u00a7 65.2-503 (formerly Code \u00a7 65.1-56).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">As previously noted, in reaching its decision that Tumlin\u2019s discharge for cause barred his right to permanent disability benefits, the commission relied in part upon our decision in <em>Murphy </em>and its decision in <em>Moyer. </em>With regard to <em>Murphy, </em>the commission concluded: \u201cThe current status of the law appears to be that a claimant may not cure an unjustified refusal of light work procured by the employer [where the employee is terminated for cause].\u201d In <em>Moyer, </em>the commission concluded that \u201cthe statutory reference to \u2018any compensation\u2019 [in former Code \u00a7 65.1-63] included compensation for a permanent disability rating.\u201d Thus, in Tumlin\u2019s case the commission concluded that Tumlin\u2019s claim was barred and noted that \u201c[w]hile this may be a harsh result, the legislature was aware of the decision ... in <em>Murphy, . . . </em>when [former Code \u00a7 65.1-63] was recodified effective October 1, 1992 as [Code] \u00a7 65.2-510.\u201d In short, the commission interpreted <em>Murphy </em>to be applicable to a permanent partial loss of use of a body part under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 and the current provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We begin our analysis with a review of the pertinent provisions of the former Code sections applicable at the time of Tumlin\u2019s accidental injury in 1990 and the current Code sections into which these sections have been recodified. Aware that <em>Murphy </em>has been the subject of considerable litigation before the commission and appeals to this Court, we take this approach to clarify the current applicability of <em>Murphy </em>relative to Code \u00a7 65.2-510 as well as to resolve the present appeal under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">Initially, we note for purposes of this appeal that Code \u00a7 65.2-503 made no substantive change in the entitlement for loss, or loss of use, of a foot as previously provided for in former Code \u00a7 65.1-56. Both statutes use the term \u201ccompensation\u201d for the benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>provided to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cIf an injured employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall not be entitled to <em>any compensation </em>at any time during the continuance of such refusal.\u201d (emphasis added). In contrast, Code \u00a7 65.2-510 currently provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cIf an injured, employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall <em>only be entitled to the benefits provided for in \u00a7 65.2-603 </em>(medical expenses and vocational rehabilitation services) during the continuance of such refusal.\u201d (emphasis added). It is readily apparent that the legislature has exempted the benefits provided by Code \u00a7 65.2-603 from the bar to benefits under the current provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510. Code \u00a7 65.2-603 benefits are not an issue here and, clearly, <em>Murphy </em>has no application to such benefits. However, for the reasons that will become apparent, the result we reach in Tumlin\u2019s appeal is the same under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 or the current Code \u00a7 65.2-510. That result is guided by the proper application of the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in the context of former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 and the current provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In <em>Murphy, </em>we held that under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 \u201cwhere a disabled employee is terminated for cause from selective employment procured or offered by his employer, <em>any subsequent wage loss </em>is properly attributable to his wrongful act rather than his disability.\u201d 12 Va. App. at 639-40, 406 S.E.2d at 193 (emphasis added). Our holding in <em>Murphy </em>is limited to its factual context. There, we were concerned with wage loss resulting from a compensable back injury. We were not concerned with benefits or \u201ccompensation\u201d for the permanent loss, or loss of use, of a body part under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-503).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Moreover, when <em>Murphy </em>was decided it was well established that \u201c[t]he benefits provided by [former] Code \u00a7 65.1-56 for the loss or loss of use of a body member are payable \u2018irrespective of continued employment, loss of wages, or like considerations.\u2019\u201d <em>County of Spotsylvania </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>218 Va. 565, 568, 238 S.E.2d 813, 815 (1977) (quoting <em>Nicely </em>v. <em>VEPCO, </em>195 Va. 819, 823, 80 S.E.2d 529, 531 (1954)). Thus, \u201c[t]he right to compensation under [former Code \u00a7 65.1-56] does not depend on incapacity for work or loss of earnings, but <em>is indemnity for permanent </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>loss of use, total or partial, of the injured [body] </em>member.\u201d <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Bateman, </em>4 Va. App. 459, 461-62, 359 S.E.2d 98, 99 (1987) (emphasis added). Accordingly, benefits or \u201ccompensation\u201d payable under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56, and now Code \u00a7 65.2-503, are not compensation for wage loss, but, rather, indemnification for the permanent loss or loss of use of a body part based upon the statutorily presumed lifetime loss of the economic benefit the employee would have derived from the injured body part. Accordingly, <em>Murphy, </em>being limited to a wage loss analysis, is inapplicable to benefits or compensation paid under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 or currently under Code \u00a7 65.2-503.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Having determined that <em>Murphy </em>has no explicit application to the present appeal, we turn now to the remaining question-\u2014 whether permanent partial disability benefits are barred by the employee\u2019s termination for cause from selective employment procured for him under some theory analogous to the reasoning in <em>Murphy. </em>We hold that they are not. We note that prior to our decision in <em>Murphy, </em>the commission had consistently ruled that refusal of selective employment and/or medical treatment did not affect compensation under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56. <em>See Clairborn </em>v. <em>General Foam Plastics Corp., </em>55 O.I.C. 89 (1973); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Beazly Found., </em>48 O.I.C. 50 (1966). No decision of the commission so holding has been addressed in a published opinion from an appellate court of this Commonwealth. Accordingly, this is an issue of first impression for this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">It is a well settled principle that \u201c[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). Guided by this principle, the term \u201cany compensation\u201d must be read in conjunction with the phrase \u201cduring the continuance of such refusal\u201d found in former Code \u00a7 65.1-63. Thus, the compensation contemplated by this Code section pertains only to ongoing economic losses following and attributable to an affirmative act of the employee. The \u201ccompensation\u201d to which the employee is not entitled during the continuance of the unjustified refusal of selective employment is compensation for wage loss that otherwise would have been paid to the employee. In contrast, former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 pertains to a right to statutorily scheduled benefits, and that right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>accrues at the time of the compensable injury. Such benefits are indemnification for permanent loss of a body part and are payable irrespective of continued unemployment or loss of wages. Accordingly, a subsequent refusal by the employee to participate in appropriate selective employment procured for him or her or a justifiable termination of the employee for cause from such employment cannot retroactively interfere with the right of indemnity already accrued to the employee. In short, because the right to the benefits provided by former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 accrues at the time of the injury to the employee and is not dependent upon a subsequent wage loss, the provisions of former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 are not applicable to the payment of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Finally, we disagree with the commission\u2019s suggestion that the recodification of Code \u00a7 65.1-63 as Code \u00a7 65.2-510 following our decision in <em>Murphy </em>evinces a legislative intent to bar eligibility for permanent partial disability benefits. We hold that the present provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-510 merely exempt medical expenses and vocational rehabilitation services from the bar of this Code section and make no other change in the prior law. Moreover, we will assume the legislature was aware of our decision in <em>Murphy, </em>as the commission noted in this case, and that the legislature properly interpreted that decision. The legislature was not faced with avoiding a \u201charsh result\u201d where such a result was not required by the existing statutory scheme or our decision in <em>Murphy. </em>Accordingly, there was no need to amend Code \u00a7 65.2-510 to provide expressly that permanent partial disability benefits under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-503) are not barred by an unjustified refusal of selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">In sum, we hold that the commission properly determined that Tumlin suffered a permanent partial disability to both feet in a compensable accident on May 18, 1990. We hold that an unjustified refusal of selective employment based upon a termination for cause from that employment is not a bar under former Code \u00a7 65.1-63 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-510) to eligibility for permanent partial disability benefits provided by former Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-503). Finally, we further hold that our decision in <em>Murphy </em>is not applicable to such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>For these reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s denial of an award in favor of Tumlin and remand with instructions to enter an award in an amount appropriate under former Code \u00a7 65.1-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-12\"> Tumlin\u2019s industrial accident and claim for benefits arose in 1990 prior to the October 1, 1992, effective recodification of Title 65.1 as Title 65.2. In order to resolve the present appeal and to clarify our holding in <em>Murphy </em>relative to the current pertinent Code sections, we will address both the former and current Code sections in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
