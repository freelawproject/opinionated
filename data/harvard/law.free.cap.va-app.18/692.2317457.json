Therefore, the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to ask a defense witness if he had threatened the Commonwealth\u2019s witness without determining whether the question was based on a reasonable belief that the witness had made such threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">While cross-examining a defense witness, the prosecutor asked the witness if he and another man had threatened the Commonwealth\u2019s main eyewitness. The defense witness responded that he had not. The Commonwealth\u2019s witness had already testified but had not indicated that she had been threatened by anyone. She merely stated that she had been afraid to tell all that she knew about the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Defense counsel objected to the question when it was asked, contending that it lacked foundation. The trial judge overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">The scope of cross-examination in general, and the extent of testimonial impeachment in particular, are left to the sound dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>cretion of the trial court and are not subject to review unless plainly abused. <em>Spruill </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 475, 485, 271 S.E.2d 419, 425 (1980); <em>Naulty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 523, 529, 346 S.E.2d 540, 543 (1986). Furthermore, we allow \u201cgreat latitude\u201d on cross-examination. <em>Henning </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>235 Va. 181, 188, 366 S.E.2d 109, 113 (1988). Generally, <em>\u201canything tending to show the bias on the part of a </em>witness\u201d may be elicited. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[wjhile the liberties of the cross-examiner are very great,\u201d they are not unlimited. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>134 Va. 613, 622, 114 S.E. 563, 565 (1922) (holding improper unsubstantiated questions insinuating sexual relationship between defendant and wife of victim); <em>but see Adams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 321, 111 S.E.2d 396 (1959) (holding similar questions proper where witnesses admitted to sexual relations).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\u201cA prosecutor should not ask a question which implies the existence of a factual predicate for which a good faith belief is lacking.\u201d <em>ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function </em>\u00a7 3-5.7(d) (3d ed. 1993); <em>see </em>6 John Henry Wigmore <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1808(2) (Chadbourn rev. 1976); <em>see also United States </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>525 F.2d 84, 91 (7th Cir. 1975); <em>Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility </em>DR 7-105(C)(1-2) (1983). For example, when a prosecutor attempts to impeach a defendant\u2019s character witness by inquiring whether the witness is aware of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct, the prosecutor must in good faith base his or her questions upon \u201cfacts, general rumor or report,\u201d as determined by the judge outside the presence of the jury. <em>Weimer v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 47, 53-54, 360 S.E.2d 381, 384 (1987); <em>see Kanter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>171 Va. 524, 532, 199 S.E. 477, 481 (1938); <em>State v. Brown, </em>371 S.E.2d 609, 612 (W. Va. 1988); <em>State v. Bronson, </em>423 S.E.2d 772, 779 (N.C. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In other contexts as well, where a witness denies a prosecutor\u2019s insinuations, the prosecutor may be required to produce evidence of the fact. <em>See People v. Sprouse, </em>418 N.E.2d 1070, 1077 (Ill. App. Ct. 1981) (regarding impeachment by prior inconsistent statement). <em>But see State v. Calmese, </em>541 S.W.2d 349 (Mo. 1976) (holding only foundation required for impeachment, based on witness\u2019s offer to pay to drop charges, was question whether witness had done so). The effect of improper questions must be assessed in the context of the particular trial and will in most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>cases constitute reversible error. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>519 F.2d 1368, 1370 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Harding, </em>525 F.2d at 91; <em>but see Wysinger </em>v. <em>State, </em>448 So. 2d 435, 438 (Ala. Crim. App. 1983) (holding it not reversible error where prosecutor\u2019s questions did not add any substantial evidence to the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The trial court erred when it failed to ascertain whether the prosecutor\u2019s question was grounded in a reasonable belief that the factual premise of the question was true. In posing the unfounded question, the prosecutor impermissibly suggested to the jury that the defense witness had threatened the Commonwealth\u2019s main witness. Moreover, the prosecutor neglected, either in his case in chief or in rebuttal, to substantiate the question by asking his own witness whether she had been threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The error in allowing this unsubstantiated question was not harmless. A nonconstitutional error is harmless if \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (en banc). \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">This defense witness was one of several whose testimony impeached the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s only eyewitness to the crime. However, he was the only one who testified that the Commonwealth\u2019s witness could not have seen the shooting. Thus, if the jury believed his testimony, it would necessarily have disbelieved the Commonwealth\u2019s witness and would have had to acquit the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Although the defense witness denied that he had threatened the Commonwealth\u2019s witness, the prosecutor\u2019s question suggested that he had. This suggestion, offered by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, may have affected the jury\u2019s willingness to believe the defense witness. Therefore, we cannot say, \u201cwithout usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d /if.; <em>see also Weimer, </em>5 Va. App. at 57-58, 360 S.E.2d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Because we have determined that the conviction must be reversed and remanded for a new trial as a result of the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>tion\u2019s improper question, we need not address the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Benton, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
