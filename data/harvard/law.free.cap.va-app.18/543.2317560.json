On appeal, he complains that the trial court erroneously acceded to the jury\u2019s request, made during its deliberations, to rehear the testimony of two witnesses. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Although the sufficiency of the evidence is not an issue in this appeal, a review of the record is necessary to explain our disposition of defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">On September 3, 1991, Officer Samuel E. Nellums of the Vice and Narcotics Division of the Norfolk Police Department was engaged in an undercover investigation of illicit drug activity in that city. While soliciting contacts with \u201cdrug dealers or drug users,\u201d Nellums was approached by Kevin Shore (a/k/a Kevin Shore Meekins). Shore asked Nellums \u201cwhat [he] was looking for,\u201d and Nellums answered, \u201c \u2018A 20-piece,\u2019 \u201d a \u201cstreet term[ ]\u201d meaning \u201c$20 worth of crack cocaine.\u201d Shore assured Nellums that he could provide the drug and directed him to a nearby motel. While Nellums waited in his vehicle, Shore entered Room 101 of the motel and returned with the cocaine. Using identified currency, Nellums paid Shore for the drug and watched as he re-entered Room 101. At Shore\u2019s request, Nellums again waited, and Shore was arrested upon his return to the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">A search of Shore\u2019s person incidental to his arrest disclosed no money, and Investigator J.D. McFatter, a participant in the \u201carrest team,\u201d proceeded to Room 101 and knocked at the door. Defendant responded, and, after McFatter identified himself and advised defendant \u201cwhy [they] were there,\u201d defendant orally waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and consented to a search of the motel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>room. Items discovered in the room by police included a \u201c38 Smith &amp; Wesson snub-nosed revolver . . . with four . . . bullets\u201d and a \u201cbag\u201d of suspected marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">McFatter testified that defendant, when questioned at the scene, admitted engaging the room under his \u201cbusiness name,\u201d George Wilson, and willingly \u201cproduced [$126] from his left front pocket,\u201d which included the cash Nellums had previously given to Shore. In a later written statement, defendant admitted ownership of the revolver and marijuana. He attributed the identified money to a \u201cMr. Mickens [Meekins]\u201d who had \u201ccome to the room and asked for change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">At trial, Special Agent Thomas S. Sochor of the United States Immigration Service testified for the Commonwealth. Sochor described his \u201cprimary duties\u201d as the apprehension of \u201caliens . . . deportable in the United States.\u201d Without objection, Sochor recalled a prior encounter with defendant, which occurred during an unrelated investigation of the \u201cidentities and alienage [s]\u201d of other persons. On that occasion, defendant initially identified himself as \u201cGeorge Wilson\u201d but later \u201crecanted\u201d and provided his \u201ctrue\u201d name. Sochor further testified, also without objection, that he subsequently determined that defendant \u201cmay be a deportable alien because of previous convictions\u201d and that he obtained a \u201ccertified copy of [defendant\u2019s] record of convictions\u201d for \u201cuse[ ] in deportation proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He noted that police had contacted him following defendant\u2019s arrest because they believed defendant \u201cwas wanted\u201d by Sochor.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Defendant testified and claimed that he was sharing the motel room at the invitation of a \u201cMr. Williams\u201d at the time of arrest. He admitted exchanging money with \u201ca guy\u201d in room 102 shortly before McFatter\u2019s arrival but denied any involvement with the cocaine, marijuana, or firearm. Defendant further testified that Sochor was \u201cmistakenly identifying\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Shortly after the jury commenced its deliberations, the trial judge received an unsigned note from the jury room which read, \u201c(1) We need the immigration officer\u2019s testimony\u201d and \u201c(2) We need the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d In response, and with the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>proval of counsel, the court advised the jury that the attorneys and court reporter had been notified of the request and summoned to the courtroom and instructed them to \u201cplease continue deliberating.\u201d Shortly thereafter, the trial judge received a second note, signed by the jury foreman, which reported, \u201cWe can not [sic] come to agreement without testimony requested earlier. Request testimony be provided as quickly as possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Upon arrival of counsel, the trial judge assembled the jury in open court, intending to recess the proceedings and consider the issue with counsel. The foreman then \u201cstate [d] emphatically [that] without [the requested] testimony [the jury would] not reach a verdict.\u201d In answer to specific inquiries from the court, the foreman first requested a reading of defendant\u2019s testimony only with respect to the \u201cdenominations of bills that [defendant] gave in response to [the] request for change\u201d but, later, added, \u201cWe would like ... to have [defendant\u2019s] entire testimony as he stated when he was on the bench.\u201d The foreman also confirmed that the jury wished to rehear the testimony of Sochor. Further inquiry of the foreman revealed that \u201ca difference of memory,\u201d of \u201crecall,\u201d among the jurors had prompted the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Defendant objected to a reading of any testimony as \u201coveremphasizing and prejudicial.\u201d The Commonwealth, also concerned with an \u201coveremphasis\u201d of testimony, suggested that \u201call\u201d the evidence be repeated to the jury. After an extended colloquy with counsel and a thorough consideration of the issue, the trial court permitted the court reporter to read to the jury \u201ceverything that the defendant said, the direct and cross-examination, and everything Investigator Sochor said.\u201d The trial court observed, \u201c[Sochor\u2019s] testimony was probably one fifth to one seventh of the defendant\u2019s,\u201d but \u201cthat\u2019s what they want, and I think that\u2019s fair, and ... I intend to give it.\u201d When defendant further argued that portions of Sochor\u2019s testimony went \u201cbeyond the parameters of what involved the defendant and this issue before the Court,\u201d the court reminded defendant that he had not objected to this evidence initially, and it was \u201ctoo late . . . now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The jurors were again convened in open court and informed by the trial judge that the court reporter was \u201cgoing to read for [them] the requested testimony.\u201d The judge cautioned the jury, however, that it \u201c[did not] want to give special emphasis\u201d to this evidence and instructed, \u201c[Y]ou should regard all the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>all the witnesses and not . . . limit yourself to the testimony that you will be given to review.\u201d Sochor\u2019s entire testimony and a portion<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of defendant\u2019s testimony were then read to the jury by the court reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Defendant contends on appeal that it was error for the jury to rehear the testimony of Agent Sochor because it \u201cwas so prejudicial by its very nature [that its repetition] constitute [d] a denial of his right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d This argument apparently presents an issue of first impression in Virginia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u201cWhether a jury, after retirement, may, upon their request have a particular portion of the evidence read to them is ordinarily a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d 11B Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence <em>Jury </em>\u00a7 57 (1986) (citing <em>Nixon </em>v. <em>Shaver, </em>176 S.E. 849, 851 (W. Va. 1934)). This approach leaves the issue to the determination of the trial judge, based upon a consideration of the \u201cparticular circumstances present,\u201d and is in accord with the majority of jurisdictions. Annotation, <em>Right to Have Reporter\u2019s Notes Read to Jury, </em>50 A.L.R.2d 178 (1956); <em>see, e.g., Roper v. State, </em>608 So. 2d 533, 535 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992); <em>Nelson v. State, </em>431 S.E.2d 450, 452 (Ga. Ct. App. 1993); <em>Smiley </em>v. <em>State, </em>579 N.E.2d 136, 137-38 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>296 N.W.2d 870, 877-78 (Minn. 1980); <em>State v. Lee, </em>439 S.E.2d 547, 571 (N.C. 1994).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The underlying rationale for this treatment of the question was recently restated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>845 S.W.2d 787 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cWhen a jury retires to consider their verdict, their discussion may produce disagreement or doubt or failure of definite recollection as to what a particular witness said in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>of his testimony. If they request enlightenment on the subject through a reading of his testimony, in the absence of some unusual circumstance, the request should be granted. The true administration of justice calls for such action. Where there is a doubt in the minds of jurors as to what a witness said, it cannot be prejudicial to anyone to have that doubt removed by a rehearing of his testimony. ... If . . .a jury is to be considered intelligent enough to be entrusted with powers of decision, it must be assumed they have sense enough to ask to have their memories stimulated or refreshed only as to those portions of the testimony about which they are in doubt or disagreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 792-93 (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolf, </em>207 A.2d 670, 675-76 (N.J. 1965) ). A court may not \u201csimply refuse to grant the jury\u2019s request for fear of placing too much emphasis on the testimony of one or two witnesses.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>221 N.W.2d 350, 352 (Mich. 1974). \u201cIf there is any emphasis being placed on the evidence, it is being placed there by the jury.\u201d <em>Jenkins, </em>845 S.W.2d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Though we find the majority rule preferable to a needlessly complex or restrictive solution, and adopt it here, we caution that the practice is appropriate only to limited circumstances and should be carefully undertaken by trial courts on a case-by-case basis. It would be difficult to catalog all factors pertinent to a resolution of such jury requests or to enunciate a bright line test suitable to every instance; however, relevant circumstances include: the threat of \u201cunbalanced testimonial emphasis,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pimental, </em>645 F.2d 85, 87 (1st Cir. 1981), the length of the testimony in issue, <em>Hill v. State, </em>151 S.E.2d 818, 820 (Ga. Ct. App. 1966) , the time already consumed in jury deliberation, the complexity of the trial and related issues, and the nature and specificity of the evidence subject of the testimony, <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>469 N.E.2d 287, 291 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984). Moreover, the probative value and benefit of the testimony in issue to the factfinding process must always be weighed against its prejudicial effect to the accused, if any. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>875 F.2d 559, 562 n.2 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 867 (1989); <em>People </em>v. <em>DeRossett, </em>604 N.E.2d 500, 515-16 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Here, the testimony of interest to the jury was specifically identified and relevant to matters in issue. Continued deliberations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>urged by the court following the request, had failed to resolve the impasse, and the trial judge was pointedly advised that the jury \u201c[would] not reach a verdict\u201d without an opportunity to rehear the designated evidence. The testimony ultimately read to the jury was neither lengthy nor complex and included evidence introduced by both the Commonwealth and defense. Before the reading, the court prudently and correctly instructed the jury to avoid any undue emphasis in its consideration of that evidence. <em>See Fitchard </em>v. <em>State, </em>424 So. 2d 674, 677 (Ala. Crim. App. 1982) (trial judge cautioned the jury to consider the repeated testimony \u201cin conjunction with all of the other evidence\u201d and had taken \u201ca// <em>possible precautions </em>to ensure that no undue importance\u201d would attach to it (emphasis added)). \u201c \u2018Unless the record shows to the contrary, it is to be presumed that the jury followed an explicit cautionary instruction promptly given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Albert </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 734, 741, 347 S.E.2d 534, 538 (1986) (quoting <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Under such circumstances, we find that defendant has failed to establish that the trial judge abused her discretion in permitting the reading. <em>See Wansley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 419, 421, 137 S.E.2d 870, 872 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 922 (1965). Appellate courts will not interfere with the discretionary decisions of a trial court unless it is clear that such discretion has been abused. <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 627, 631-32, 145 S.E.2d 192, 195 (1965), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 U.S. 942 (1966); <em>see Slayton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 367, 38 S.E.2d 479, 484 (1946) (discretion implies \u201c \u2018conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action,\u2019 \u201d based upon the \u201c \u2018reason and conscience of the judge\u2019 \u201d under the law and circumstances (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Defendant further argues that the court erred in declining to redact portions of Sochor\u2019s \u201cprejudicial testimony that had previously found its way into the . . . record.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although defendant failed to specify before the trial court those portions of this testimony of concern, the trial judge, without objection, addressed only the references to defendant\u2019s prior felony record, noting that this evidence was otherwise properly before the jury as an element of the firearm offense. While the prejudicial effect to defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>which might result from a repetition of such evidence was a factor for the trial judge to consider in ruling on the jury\u2019s request and redaction an available remedy, we cannot find that its inclusion in the reading constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\"> Defendant had not objected to the earlier introduction of this document through another witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> The record indicates that the foreman interrupted the reading of defendant\u2019s testimony and advised, \u201c[W]e are satisfied right to that point.\u201d The referenced \u201cpoint\u201d is not identified in the record, but the reading of defendant\u2019s testimony then concluded without objection by defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\"> <em>But see Jackson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.
