Jones contends (1) that evidence used against him at trial was secured during a warrantless arrest that violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and (2) that the Commonwealth failed to try him within the time prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree that the evidence did not prove probable cause for arrest and reverse appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The owner of an apartment complex on Jacqueline Street testified that he had complained to the City of Richmond police of recurrent trespassing problems at the apartments and of drug dealing in the parking lot. He posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs in the parking lot and asked the police for their assistance in monitoring the property. He also testified that despite the presence of the signs residents of the apartments were permitted to have visitors and guests on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Officer George B. Wade and three other officers, none of whom were in uniform, drove by the apartment complex at 4:30 p.m. in an unmarked car. Wade noticed an automobile \u201cparked on the opposite side of [Jacqueline Street] at the far end of the complex.\u201d Two persons were in the automobile. He also observed Jones and another man standing on a sidewalk near the automobile at the southwest corner of the apartment complex where Jacqueline and Allen Streets intersect. The officers drove around the apartment complex, entered the parking area, stopped their vehicle, and \u201cexited [their] vehicle in the parking lot area toward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the direction of [Jones].\u201d When the plainclothed officers exited their car to approach Jones, Jones ran. Two of the officers chased Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">As the officers chased Jones, Wade had a conversation with the other person who had been standing next to Jones. That person identified himself. When Wade learned that he resided in the apartment complex, Wade left him. Wade then saw the other officers chasing Jones toward the apartments and went to assist. Jones stopped running as he approached Wade.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">When Wade asked Jones where he lived, Jones gave his address on Allen Street, the street at the intersection where the officer first sighted him. Wade recognized that Jones\u2019s address was not the address of one of the apartments and arrested Jones for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Jones testified at the suppression hearing that he ran because he did not recognize the men in jeans and t-shirts coming toward him and because he heard someone say, \u201crun.\u201d He also testified that when he stopped he told Wade that he was visiting his sister and niece, both of whom lived in the apartment complex. Wade testified that Jones \u201ccould have said\u201d that he was visiting \u201ca cousin or something ... in the complex.\u201d Wade also testified that a woman he believed to be Jones\u2019s friend told him that Jones was visiting a relative. After Wade arrested Jones for trespassing, he searched Jones and discovered in his pockets $1,342 in cash and a small glassine packet of heroin. The trial judge denied Jones\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained following the arrest for trespassing. Jones was convicted and filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">\u201cThe fourth amendment permits an officer who has probable cause [to believe a person is engaged in criminal activity] to make a warrantless arrest.\u201d <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 399, 407-408, 412 S.E.2d 189, 194 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>244 Va. 218, 420 S.E.2d 713 (1992). \u201c[P]robable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 222 </em>Va. 816, 820, 284 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>A person is guilty of trespassing \u201c[i]f [that] person without authority of law goes upon or remains upon the lands, buildings or premises of another, or any portion or area thereof, after having been forbidden to do so, either orally or in writing, by the owner, lessee, custodian or other person lawfully in charge thereof, or after having been forbidden to do so by a sign or signs posted by such persons.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-119. Although the criminal trespass statute does not contain an express requirement of intent, the statute has been construed to require proof of a willful trespass. <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va. (2 Rob.) 791, 791 (1843); <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 65, 70, 366 S.E.2d 274, 278 (1988). Moreover, a good faith claim of right to be on the premises negates the requisite intent to engage in a criminal trespass.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cCriminal intent is an essential element of the statutory offense of trespass, even though the statute is silent as to intent, and if the act prohibited is committed in good faith under claim of right . . . although the accused is mistaken as to his right, unless it is committed with force ... no conviction will lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Reed, </em>6 Va. App. at 71, 366 S.E.2d at 278 (quoting 75 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trespass </em>\u00a7 87 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Wade testified that when he saw Jones and the other man standing near the automobile he concluded that they were trespassing because they were \u201changing out\u201d and because Jones ran as their car approached. The trial judge concluded that the officer\u2019s belief sufficed to establish probable cause. Because Jones does not question whether the proof established that he was on the premises when Wade saw him standing on the sidewalk near the automobile on Jacqueline Street, we assume, for purposes of this decision, that he was. We conclude, however, that the facts and circumstances did not give Wade probable cause to believe that Jones was trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Wade had no reason to believe that Jones specifically had been forbidden, orally or in writing, to go upon the premises of the apartment complex. Wade conceded that the apartment complex owner never told him that Jones had been told to stay off the premises or that guests of residents could not be on the premises. Thus, in order for Jones\u2019s presence on the premises to give rise to probable cause to arrest for trespassing, Wade must have had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>reasonable basis to conclude that Jones was neither a resident nor a guest of a resident. Because Wade did not know Jones, he merely assumed that Jones was on the premises in disregard of the posted signs that announced, \u201cNo Trespassing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Jones\u2019s mere presence with another man on the premises at four o\u2019clock in the afternoon near an automobile parked on a street by an apartment complex was insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that Jones was neither a resident of the apartment complex nor legitimately upon the premises at the invitation of a resident. The officer\u2019s observation permitted only a bare suspicion. Indeed, the officer\u2019s assertion that Jones and the other man were \u201changing out\u201d did not add sufficient information to raise his suspicion of trespassing to probable cause. Wade\u2019s testimony did not establish that Jones and the other man, who was a resident of the apartment complex, were idly standing by the automobile for a lengthy period of time. The officer\u2019s testimony did not establish that the police observed Jones for more than a brief instance before they accosted Jones and his companion. Moreover, Wade testified that he knew, before arresting Jones, that the person with whom Jones was \u201changing out\u201d resided at the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Jones\u2019s flight also could not have reasonably raised the officer\u2019s suspicion to the level of probable cause. The evidence established that when an automobile without any discernible markings drove into the parking lot in the direction of Jones and three men in jeans and t-shirts exited the automobile, Jones ran and several men chased him. Those facts provide no reasonable basis for the officer to conclude that Jones\u2019s flight occurred because he was a trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">As Jones was being chased by the out-of-uniform police officers, Wade learned that the man who had been standing with Jones was a resident of the apartment complex. After Jones was detained, Wade learned that Jones was not a resident of the apartment. However, the record contained no indication that Wade made any inquiry whether Jones was a guest of the resident who was standing with Jones. Jones and another person then present informed Wade that Jones was on the premises to visit a relative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, Wade ignored circumstances that explained Jones\u2019s pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ence and, furthermore, Wade had no facts that contradicted the information that he learned. These facts and circumstances known to Wade fail to establish probable cause to arrest Jones for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The Commonwealth argues, however, that this case is controlled by our decision in <em>James </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 98, 379 S.E.2d 378 (1989). That case is readily distinguishable on its facts. Although <em>James </em>involved the flight of an accused and a finding of probable cause to believe the accused was trespassing, <em>id. </em>at 101-02, 379 S.E.2d at 380, the similarities between that case and the facts of this case end there. In <em>James, </em>an off-duty police officer, who had been hired by an apartment complex to protect against a recurrence of a rash of rapes, \u201cpeeping tom\u201d incidents, and trespassing, discovered the accused in the apartment complex, at eleven o\u2019clock at night, following a woman who had just exited her car. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 379 S.E.2d at 379. The officer, who was in uniform, hailed the accused, identified himself as a police officer, and asked to speak to the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 379 S.E.2d at 379. At that point, the accused fled. <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s opinion in <em>James </em>specifically noted that the police officer identified himself before James fled. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 379 S.E.2d at 380. Moreover, the late hour and the absence of reason to be on the property significantly distinguish the facts of <em>James.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Because the police did not have probable cause to arrest Jones for trespassing, the evidence obtained during the search incident to the arrest and following the arrest should have been suppressed. <em>See Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 814-15 (1985); <em>Commonwealth v. Ealy, </em>12 Va. App. 744, 750-51, 407 S.E.2d 681, 685-86 (1991); <em>Walls </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 639, 651-52, 347 S.E.2d 175, 182 (1986). We, therefore, reverse the conviction and remand the case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Koontz, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-12\"> At oral argument, Jones\u2019s counsel conceded that he erroneously calculated the number of days between arrest and trial. He further conceded that the correct calculation established no violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-243. Accordingly, we need not address the speedy trial issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> Jones testified at the suppression hearing that he informed Wade that he had been on the premises to visit his niece and sister, who lived there. Wade testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Q: Did he indicate to you at any time during this occasion that his sister lived there at the apartments that he had been visiting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">A; He stated something to the effect that he had some type of relative, cousin or something to that effect, that possibly did live in that apartment complex; yes, sir.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
