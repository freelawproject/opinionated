App. 53, 434 S.E.2d 921 (1993). We granted a rehearing <em>en banc </em>and stayed the mandate of that decision. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we uphold the commission\u2019s finding that claimant\u2019s neck injury arose out of his employment, and we affirm the commission\u2019s award of benefits to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Claimant was employed with Ogden Allied Aviation Services as an aircraft refueler at Dulles Airport. Claimant\u2019s job involved connecting fuel hoses to commercial aircraft and observing the fuel gauges in the underside of the aircraft\u2019s wing to determine when the aircraft was completely fueled. On March 21, 1990, claimant looked directly overhead \u201cin an unusual or awkward position\u201d at the gauge of the aircraft he was refueling and heard a pop in his neck. He knew immediately that \u201csomething was wrong.\u201d Within fifteen minutes, his neck began \u201cto tighten up.\u201d According to an emergency room report, Dr. George Kennedy diagnosed that the claimant suffered an acute cervical sprain. Dr. Kennedy prescribed physical therapy and medication for the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Relying on <em>County of Chesterfield </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 376 S.E.2d 73 (1989), and <em>Plumb Rite Plumbing Service v. Barbour, </em>8 Va. App. 482, 382 S.E.2d 305 (1989), the deputy commissioner denied the claim, holding that the claimant did not prove that his neck movement and the act of looking up was not \u201ctoo common to the public at large to be considered a peculiar risk of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>The commission reversed. It based its decision on the finding that \u201cclaimant\u2019s work requires that he tilt his head back to an angle that allows him to look directly overhead at the . . . fuel gauges . . . and to do so on a regular basis.\u201d The commission found that because this task placed the claimant in \u201can unusual or awkward position in which to work,\u201d the injury that the claimant received on March 21, 1990, as a consequence of performing this task in this manner caused the injury and, therefore, the injury arose out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">To be compensable, the claimant must prove an injury by accident. \u201cIn order to carry his burden of proving an \u2018injury by accident,\u2019 a claimant must prove that the <em>cause </em>of his injury was an <em>identifiable incident or sudden precipitating event </em>and that it resulted in <em>an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\" Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 589, 385 S.E.2d 858, 865 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">A claimant must prove \u201cthat the conditions of the workplace or that some significant <em>work related exertion </em>caused the injury. The mere happening of an accident at the workplace, not caused by any work related risk or significant work related exertion, is not compensable.\u201d <em>Barbour, </em>8 Va. App. at 484, 382 S.E.2d at 306 (emphasis added). <em>See Richmond Memorial Hosp. </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>222 Va. 283, 285, 278 S.E.2d 877, 878-79 (1981) (claimant\u2019s injury must arise from risks peculiar to his employment or must be sustained in the course of an employment activity to which the public is not exposed).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">In order to perform his job, claimant was required to perform the physical act of looking directly overhead at the fuel gauges of the aircraft. He described this action by saying, \u201c[ijt\u2019s almost straight up and down when you have to look at the gauges . . . [tjhey\u2019re immediately over your head.\u201d He also stated, \u201cto watch the gauges with the door panel open, you can\u2019t look at a small angle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">The act of looking up is a common occurrence that most people do daily and often. However, insofar as looking directly overhead being a requirement of claimant\u2019s employment, he described a movement far different from looking up in a way that would be commonplace to the general public. The commission found the claimant\u2019s act of looking directly overhead to have been an awk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>ward, strained act that was required as part of claimant\u2019s job. In that sense, the act of looking directly overhead was peculiar to the claimant\u2019s employment as an aircraft refueler.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The claimant proved an identifiable incident, the act of looking directly overhead in an \u201cunusual or awkward position,\u201d causing an injury, a sudden physical change in the body. He testified that when he looked directly overhead, \u201c[I] felt it like a pop in my neck, and ... I knew right then that something was wrong. And after about an hour, it was pretty tight, I couldn\u2019t hardly move it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Contrary to the employer\u2019s contention at oral argument, the majority of the panel did not, and a majority of the Court sitting <em>en banc </em>does not, uphold an award of benefits for a neck injury that resulted from repetitive trauma caused by the claimant constantly looking up and down at the gauges over a long period of time. <em>See Merillat Indus., Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 433, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant, at the time of the injury, performed his work task in \u201can unusual or awkward position.\u201d As a consequence, because the injury to his neck was caused by exertion on that occasion that was peculiar to his employment, his injury arose out of his employment. Accordingly, we affirm the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Koontz, J., Willis, J., Elder, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b767-10\">Moon, C.J., with whom Baker, J., Barrow, J., and Bray, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGC\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">I would reverse the commission\u2019s decision for the reasons stated in my dissent to the panel opinion. <em>See Ogden Allied Aviation </em>v. <em>Shuck, </em>17 Va. App. 53, 55-57, 434 S.E.2d 921, 923-24 (1993).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
