App. 551, 439 S.E.2d 622 (1994).

For the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the Court affirms the decision of the trial court. Therefore, the stay of the mandate of the January 11, 1994 opinion is lifted, and the case is affirmed in accordance with that opinion and its adoption by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-16\">Judges Benton, Coleman, Koontz and Elder, for the reasons stated in Judge Benton\u2019s dissent from the original decision, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.
