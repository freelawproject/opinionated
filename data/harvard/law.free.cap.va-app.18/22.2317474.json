On appeal, he asserts that the trial court (1) abused its discretion in appointing an attorney for wife in her pursuit of a fault-based divorce and in directing husband to pay $4,000 to that attorney for services rendered; (2) erred, in awarding spousal support, by failing to consider the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-107.1; and (3) erred in ordering husband to pay a lump sum in settlement of \u201cmarital and separate property.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that our review of this appeal is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The relevant facts are as follows: Wife filed her bill of complaint for divorce on January 30, 1991. Husband initially retained an attorney, but the trial court allowed that attorney to withdraw on April 22, 1992. The trial court denied husband\u2019s request for appointed counsel, and husband thereafter proceeded <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Wife served husband with notice of her intent to appear before the court on September 9, 1992, to request, in relevant part, entry of a final decree of divorce, award of spousal support, equitable distribution, and award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Wife, her attorney, and husband (proceeding <em>pro se) </em>appeared on September 9, 1992. Wife filed her motion requesting attorney\u2019s fees and costs and presented a \u201csketch final decree . . . with several blanks for the Judge to complete.\u201d The statement of facts contains no record of any objections made by husband to wife\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees or her draft decree. No transcripts were filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">On November 25, 1992, the trial court entered the decree, awarding wife a divorce based on husband\u2019s \u201cconstructive desertion\u201d on January 23, 1991, \u201cfor a period of more than twelve months.\u201d It ordered husband to pay to wife permanent monthly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>spousal support and a lump sum in settlement of their remaining marital and separate property. It also ordered husband to pay a portion of wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Finally, it awarded wife fifty percent of husband\u2019s pension plan and declared the decree a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-107.3 in order to accomplish that division. To be sure that the decree complied with the provisions of that section, the court directed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">this cause is retained on the Chancery Docket for the next sixty (60) days for the purpose of amending the language of this decree, if necessary, for acceptance as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). If no amendment is filed within 60 days, this cause is dismissed from the court\u2019s docket.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Although husband did not object to the decree by endorsement, he subsequently retained new counsel and, by motion filed December 22, 1992, notified wife of his intent to \u201cmove the . '. . Court . . . for a redetermination of [the] lump-sum monetary award; a clarification of the marital share of the Court Ordered Profit Sharing Retirement Plan; and present argument with reference to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d The record contains no information as to the disposition of this motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Husband noted his appeal to this Court on December 28, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">We conclude this appeal is barred as to all issues. Rule 5A:18 states that \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court . . . will be considered as a basis for reversal unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d The purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to \u201cafford[] \u2018the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kaufman </em>v. Kaufman, 12 Va. App. 1200, 1204, 409 S.E.2d 1, 3-4 (1991) (quoting <em>Weidman v. </em>Babcock, 241 Va. 40, 44, 400 S.E.2d 164, 167 (1991)). It applies equally to both <em>pro se </em>litigants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>those who are represented by counsel. <em>See Townes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 307, 319, 362 S.E.2d 650, 656-57 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 971 (1988) (decided under Rule 5:25, the Supreme Court\u2019s counterpart to Rule 5A:18).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">[A party] may meet the mandates of Rule 5A:18 in many ways. For instance, [he] may make clear the ground for his objection in a motion to strike the evidence or in closing argument. [He] may also state the grounds therefor during a motion to set aside the verdict or a motion to reconsider. Likewise, [a party] may, if he or she has previously failed to do so, include an objection and reasons therefor in the final order or at least tender such an order to the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\"><em>Lee v. Lee, </em>12 Va. App. 512, 515-16, 404 S.E.2d 736, 738 (1991) (en banc) (citations omitted); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-384 (amended by Act of Mar. 30, 1992, ch. 564, 1992 Va. Acts 725, which noted that \u201cthe provisions of this act are [merely] declaratory of existing law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">We hold first that appellant\u2019s challenge to the issue of spousal support was improperly preserved for appeal. The statement of facts contains no indication that husband registered any objections to wife\u2019s draft decree. Furthermore, he did not endorse the decree. Although he filed a motion to reconsider, spousal support was not one of the issues he attempted to raise in that motion. Because we find no indication in the record that appellant complied with the requirements of Rule 5A:18, we conclude that his challenge to the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">We hold that appellant\u2019s assignments of error concerning the equitable distribution and award of attorney\u2019s fees also are barred by Rule 5A:18. As stated above, the record contains no indication that appellant objected to these rulings either at the hearing or by endorsement of the decree itself. He attempted to raise these issues in a motion to reconsider filed on December 22, 1992, but our review of the record shows that this motion was not timely filed. Following entry of the decree on November 25, 1992, the trial court retained jurisdiction to alter it only until December 16, 1992, the twenty-first day following its entry. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Counsel for appellant asserted during oral argument that the trial court\u2019s retention of the cause on the chancery docket for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sixty days to clarify the QDRO provisions caused the order to be not final, thereby extending the period during which a timely motion for reconsideration could be filed. We reject this argument, holding that the trial court\u2019s decree was a final order when entered. Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) permits the court to retain jurisdiction to the extent necessary to \u201c[mjodify any order . . . intended to affect or divide any pension . . . plan or retirement benefits ... for the [limited] purpose of establishing or maintaining the order as a qualified domestic relations order.\u201d In \u201cretain[ing] [the matter at issue in this case] on the Chancery Docket for the next sixty (60) days for the purpose of amending the language of the decree, if necessary, for acceptance as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO),\u201d the court merely tracked the language of the statute. It made no attempt to preserve jurisdiction so as to alter the substantive provisions of the QDRO, such as adjustment of the amount of pension benefits to be awarded. Indeed, the entry of an order purporting to \u201cchange the substance of the original order or provide an interest in a pension that was not provided in the order\u201d would contravene the intent of the legislature in enacting this code section. Peter N. Swisher, Lawrence D. Diehl &amp; James R. Cottrell, <em>Virginia Family Law\u00a7 </em>11-34, at 429 &amp; n.12 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We conclude, therefore, based on the language of both the statute and the order, that any amendments contemplated by the trial court involved purely ministerial acts related to the QDRO, rather than alteration of its substantive provisions. Therefore, the trial court did nothing more than retain the matter on the docket so that it could more easily exercise the jurisdiction granted it under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4). Here, the order was final when entered because it \u201cdispose[d] of the whole subject, [gave] all the relief contemplated, provide [d] . . . reasonable completeness for giving effect to [its terms], and [left] nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend ministerially the execution of the order.\u201d <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Truck &amp; Equip. Corp., </em>205 Va. 579, 585, 139 S.E.2d 31, 35 (1964) (quoting <em>Marchant &amp; Taylor </em>v. <em>Mathews Co., </em>139 Va. 723, 734, 124 S.E. 420, 423 (1924)); <em>see also Weizenbaum </em>v. <em>Weizenbaum, </em>12 Va. App. 899, 901, 407 S.E.2d 37, 38 (1991) (holding that an order granting a divorce and denying periodic spousal support but taking under advisement wife\u2019s motion for lump sum alimony was a final, appealable order as to the divorce on the date of entry). Because the decree was final upon its entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>on November 25, 1992, the motion to reconsider filed on December 22, 1992, was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">For these reasons, Rule 5A:18 bars our review of appellant\u2019s challenges to the equitable distribution, award of attorney\u2019s fees and spousal support. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Benton, J., and Koontz, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\"> The parties proffered to this Court on appeal that the trial court heard argument and denied the motion on December 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
