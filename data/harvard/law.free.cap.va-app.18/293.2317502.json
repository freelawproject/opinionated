He argues on appeal that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of his prior criminal conduct and convicted him without sufficient evidence. We disagree and affirm the decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-680). \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The evidence disclosed that, at 11:07 p.m. on the evening of August 12, 1989, Suffolk police investigators executed a search warrant for a residence and motor vehicle owned by defendant. Four individuals were found inside the house. Gail Smith and Calvin West were in the \u201cliving room\u201d and Ramona Freeman and defendant were together in bed in a bedroom. Defendant\u2019s vehicle was \u201cparked in front\u201d of the dwelling, locked and unoccupied. Investigators Bari and Duck conducted the searches with Bari serving as evidence custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Evidence discovered in the home included a \u201cclear glass test tube\u201d inside an \u201cice bottle\u201d on a kitchen shelf and \u201cplastic baggie corner [s]\u201d in both the kitchen and bedroom trash cans, all of which contained cocaine residue. Cocaine was also found in each of eleven plastic bags which dropped from \u201cbehind the back\u201d of a sofa in the living room. Additionally, a \u201cradio pager beeper\u201d was located in the bedroom and $325 cash was in defendant\u2019s sock. The search of defendant\u2019s truck revealed six clear bags of cocaine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>hidden in a bag beneath \u201cthe front seat of the driver\u2019s side,\u201d and a \u201cbottle\u201d of Inositol powder. A \u201csmall set\u201d of scales was \u201cbehind the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d and a bank document, addressed to defendant, was in the glove box.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Without objection, Investigator Duck was qualified by the Commonwealth as an \u201cexpert in the packaging, evaluation of powder cocaine and crack cocaine.\u201d He testified that the eleven individual packages of cocaine uncovered in the residence had a total value of $275 and noted that each carried \u201cdifferent . . . colored tie wraps\u201d to identify a particular \u201cdenomination.\u201d The six bags of cocaine discovered in the truck were valued at a \u201clittle over $400 a piece,\u201d $2,500 \u201coverall.\u201d This evidence reflected a quantity and packaging of cocaine which the expert considered to be inconsistent with \u201cpersonal use.\u201d He testified that the scales \u201cwould be used to weigh it [cocaine] out\u201d for sale and described the Inositol as a \u201ccutting agent\u201d for the drug. Duck explained that the \u201cbeeper\u201d was commonly used in the drug trade as a \u201ccontact point [] for clientele.\u201d Under these circumstances, Duck opined, without objection, that the cash in defendant\u2019s sock was \u201cdrug money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Gail Smith, one of the persons present in the house during the search, testified, over defendant\u2019s objection, that she had purchased cocaine from him at the same residence \u201cbetween 8:00 [and] 9:30\u201d a.m. that very day, returning at approximately 10:00 p.m. to \u201cfind someone to buy [more] . . . cocaine with.\u201d Although Smith denied any \u201cpromises\u201d had been offered by the Commonwealth in exchange for this testimony, Duck acknowledged, \u201cWe told her she wasn\u2019t going to be charged if she wanted to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Defendant denied involvement in the offense. He presented several witnesses to establish that the truck was frequently borrowed by others and testified that two men had taken the vehicle at approximately 6:30 p.m. on the evening of the offense, returning it after defendant \u201cwas asleep.\u201d Duck, however, recalled that the truck had been parked at the residence from 6:00 p.m. until the search and was found locked, with defendant in possession of the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Defendant first complains that the trial court improperly admitted and considered evidence of defendant\u2019s sale of cocaine to Smith, \u201csome fourteen to fifteen hours prior to the discovery\u201d of the drugs subject of this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>It is well settled that evidence of other crimes or bad acts of an accused is generally inadmissible in a criminal prosecution. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970); <em>Sutphin v. Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 241, 245, 337 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1985). \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to prevent confusion of offenses, unfair surprise to the defendant and a suggestion of \u2018criminal propensity,\u2019 thus preserving the \u2018presumption of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crump v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va. App. 286, 289, 411 S.E.2d 238, 240 (1991) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 497, 502, 303 S.E.2d 890, 893 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">However, \u2018\u201c[t]he law will not permit one accused of [a] crime to go unpunished simply because the Commonwealth cannot prove his guilt without bringing in some evidence which tends to show that he has committed other crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>15 Va. App. 407, 413, 424 S.E.2d 566, 571 (1992) (citations omitted). Thus, the \u201cgeneral rule . . . must sometimes yield to society\u2019s interest in the truth-finding process,\u201d and numerous exceptions allow evidence of prior misconduct \u201c[w]henever the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u201d <em>Lewis, 225 </em>Va. at 502, 303 S.E.2d at 893; <em>see Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805. For this reason, \u201crather than stating the rule as an exclusionary rule with numerous exceptions, it may be more helpful to phrase [it] in terms of relevancy.\u201d 1 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 12-14 (4th ed. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">We have oftentimes identified and addressed these exceptions, and the lengthy list need not be once again repeated here. <em>See Lafon v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 411, 417, 438 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1993); <em>Sutphin, </em>1 Va. App. at 245-46, 337 S.E.2d at 899. However, among these, \u201cintent\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d are well-recognized \u201celements of criminal acts . . . subsumed within the exceptions to the general rule\u201d which may be \u201cshown by prior bad act evidence when relevant to prove . . . the crime charged.\u201d <em>Lafon, </em>17 Va. App. at 417, 438 S.E.2d at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Evidence that tends to establish a fact at issue is relevant and material and, therefore, admissible, if its probative value is not outweighed by any prejudicial effect. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 240 </em>Va. 78, 90, 393 S.E.2d 609, 617, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 908 (1990); <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987). Despite the prejudice \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>herent\u201d in proof that the accused has committed other crimes, this rule is no different when such evidence is offered to establish knowledge or intent, provided there exists a \u201crelation or connection\u201d between the prior misconduct and the facts in issue which sufficiently establishes relevancy and materiality. <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 213, 221-22, 429 S.E.2d 229, 234-35, <em>aff'd en banc, </em>17 Va. App. 248, 436 S.E.2d 193 (1993). Once evidence is determined to be relevant and material, \u201c[t]he responsibility for balancing . . . probative value and prejudice rests in the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d and its decision \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse.\u201d <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 380, 390, 399 S.E.2d 614, 620 (1990); <em>Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 90, 393 S.E.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Here, defendant was tried on an indictment which alleged that he possessed cocaine with the \u201cintent to sell, give, deliver or distribute\u201d it. The Commonwealth was required to prove that defendant \u201cintentionally and consciously possessed\u201d the drug, either actually or constructively, with knowledge of its nature and character, together with the intent to distribute it. <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 87, 99-102, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497-99 (1990) (en banc); Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Constructive possession may be shown by defendant\u2019s acts, declarations or conduct which support the inference that the contraband was \u201csubject to his dominion or control.\u201d <em>Josephs, </em>10 Va. App. at 99, 390 S.E.2d at 497-98. The \u201cparticular intent\u201d to distribute is an additional element of the offense, proof of which is \u201cessential to . . . conviction.\u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). \u201cBecause direct proof of intent is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence\u201d which is \u201c \u2018consistent with guilt\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018inconsistent\u2019 \u201d with and \u201c \u2018exclude [s] every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Clearly, evidence of the recent prior sale of the offending drug to Smith was relevant and material to these several issues indispensable to conviction. It proved that defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed and offered cocaine for sale at his residence only hours before the search revealed the caches of the drug remaining about the premises. The situs, quantity and packaging of the cocaine discovered by the officers, together with related paraphernalia and money, established an obvious nexus between that contraband and the prior sale by defendant of the same drug to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Smith, from the identical location, only hours previously. <em>See Wilson, </em>16 Va. App. at 223-24, 429 S.E.2d at 236. Evidence of the recent sale was highly probative of defendant\u2019s subsequent and nearly contemporaneous possession of the cocaine in issue and his attendant knowledge and intent with respect to it. Moreover, it tended to disprove his denial of any involvement whatsoever with the drug. <em>See Satterfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 630, 636-37, 420 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1992) (en banc). Under such circumstances, when the potential prejudice of the disputed evidence is weighed against its compelling probative value, we find that it was properly admitted and considered by the trial court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction is also without merit. Cocaine and related drug paraphernalia were found hidden in several rooms of his residence and his truck, parked just outside the home, under circumstances clearly evincing an intent to distribute the drug. <em>See Servis, </em>6 Va. App. at 524-25, 371 S.E.2d at 165. Defendant was present in the house and in actual possession of the keys to the locked vehicle and cash suggestive of \u201cdrug money.\u201d An individual to whom defendant had just recently sold cocaine had returned to, and was present on, the premises expressly to purchase and consume additional quantities of the drug. Further, defendant testified falsely that others had used his truck immediately prior to the search. Such evidence provided ample proof that defendant consciously possessed the cocaine discovered by the officers, aware of its nature and character and with the requisite intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Moon, C.J., Baker, J., Barrow, J., Coleman, J., Willis, J., Elder, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\"> We consider this appeal <em>en banc </em>pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.02(D) because a majority of the Court determined it appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> The intimate connection between defendant\u2019s prior misconduct and the subject offense, with its related evidentiary value, clearly distinguishes this case from <em>Donahue </em>v. Commonwealth, 225 Va. 145, 149, 300 S.E.2d 768, 770 (1983) (prior distribution of drugs by the accused to unidentified persons \u201cin an automobile\u201d over a month before the offense then before the court), <em>Eccles </em>v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 20, 22, 197 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1973) (prior consumption of drugs by the accused on \u201cdifferent occasions\u201d), and <em>Boyd </em>v. Commonwealth, 213 Va. 52, 52-53, 189 S.E.2d 359, 359-60 (1972) (prior \u201cunrelated\u201d drug sales by the accused to unnamed purchasers at unspecified locations \u201ca few days\u201d preceding the offense then before the court).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A3v\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Without reason, this decision overrules three decisions of the Supreme Court of Virginia. <em>See Donahue </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 154-56, 300 S.E.2d 768, 773-74 (1983); <em>Eccles </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 197 S.E.2d 332 (1973); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 52, 189 S.E.2d 359 (1972). I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">For the reasons stated in <em>Donahue, Eccles, </em>and <em>Boyd, </em>I would hold that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the prior criminal conduct. Evidence of other crimes is not admissible for the purpose of showing the defendant has a criminal propensity and was conducting himself in accordance with that propensity. I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
