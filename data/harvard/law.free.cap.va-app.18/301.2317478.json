App. 179, 436 S.E.2d 187 (1993), a majority of a panel of this Court reversed a conviction for violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-361. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted and heard on February 18, 1994. For the reasons stated in the panel\u2019s majority opinion, we reverse the conviction and lift the stay of this Court\u2019s October 12, 1993, mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b309-15\">Baker, J., with whom Moon, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aund\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s finding that \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s response is a clear acknowledgment that he understood the issue.\u201d Counsel for appellant candidly admitted that he did not raise the double jeopardy issue, yet the majority holds that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>trial court ruled on that issue. Respectfully, I suggest that the majority has given new meaning to the word \u201cspecificity\u201d contained in Rule 5A:18. I would affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment because appellant failed to meet the specificity requirement of Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
