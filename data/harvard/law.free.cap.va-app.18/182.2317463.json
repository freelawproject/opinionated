On appeal, defendant complains that the trial court erroneously overruled her motion to remove a juror from the panel for cause. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Because the substantive facts are not in issue, this opinion addresses only portions of the record related to the disputed juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">Prior to voir dire, the court informed the venire summoned for trial that defendant and another had allegedly \u201cplanned and carried out\u201d the murder of defendant\u2019s husband upon his return from overseas duty for the United States Navy. These offenses, together with the related investigations and prosecutions, generated considerable media coverage throughout the Hampton Roads area, including the City of Virginia Beach. Concerned that this notoriety would impair the selection of an unbiased jury, defendant requested individual voir dire of prospective jurors to facilitate a \u201cthorough inquiry\u201d of the issue without exposing other jurors to \u201cprejudicial and incompetent material.\u201d The Commonwealth, however, objected to this procedure, and the trial judge decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>proceed with the \u201cgeneral questions that we normally ask\u201d of the entire venire, followed by \u201cindividual voir dire\u201d of any venireperson that disclosed prior knowledge of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">During the collective voir dire, twelve persons raised their hands when the trial judge asked, \u201cHave you acquired any information about this case from the news media or any other source?\u201d In accordance with the court\u2019s earlier ruling, these individuals were identified and recalled individually for further voir dire by the court and counsel. Although this additional inquiry resulted in the removal of four persons from the panel for cause, the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify two others, one of whom was Mary McFetridge, the juror in issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> McFetridge was, however, later striken from the panel by peremptory challenge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant contends that McFetridge\u2019s responses during voir dire \u201crevealed hesitance and uncertainty regarding her ability to remain impartial\u201d as a result of both \u201cpre-trial publicity\u201d and \u201cthe fact that her husband\u2019s employment was the same as the deceased.\u201d She asserts that McFetridge was \u201cswaying in her feelings . . . to one side\u201d and was unsure \u201cas to whether she would be able to apply the concept of presumption of innocence.\u201d Because these circumstances created \u201cat least [a] reasonable doubt\u201d that McFetridge could properly discharge her responsibilities as a juror, defendant argues she should have been removed for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">It is well established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">[t] he right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. This guarantee is reinforced by legislative enactment and by the rules of court. It is the trial judge\u2019s duty to secure an impartial jury for the parties. Resolution of the question of a juror\u2019s impartiality depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. At a minimum, however, the law re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>quires that the juror \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d Any reasonable doubt regarding the prospective juror\u2019s ability to give the accused a fair and impartial trial must be resolved in favor of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><em>Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 642, 645, 376 S.E.2d 541, 543-44 (1989) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u201cThe true test of impartiality lies in the juror\u2019s mental attitude,\u201d <em>Educational Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.

Through voir dire and other competent evidence, the trial court must examine the venirepersons for signs of a mind set that \u201c \u2018would prevent or substantially impair the performance of [the] duties [of] a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satcher v.

Nevertheless, prospective jurors must demonstrate for the record an ability and a willingness to \u201c \u2018lay aside . . . impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Such evidence of impartiality, indispensable to jury service, \u201cmust emanate from the juror . . . unsuggested by leading questions.\u201d <em>Educational </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Books, </em>3 Va. App. at 389, 349 S.E.2d at 907; <em>see Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300, 227 S.E.2d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u201cThe partiality or impartiality of an individual juror is a factual issue best determined by the trial court.\u201d <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 480, 331 S.E.2d 422, 431 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986). \u201cBecause the trial judge has the opportunity ... to observe and evaluate the apparent sincerity, conscientiousness, intelligence, and demeanor of prospective jurors,\u201d the disposition of a challenge for cause is an exercise of judicial discretion which will not be disturbed on appeal, absent manifest error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 123-24, 360 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1015 (1988); <em>Moten </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>14 Va. App. 956, 958, 420 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1992). On appellate review, we must consider the \u201cvoir dire as a whole, rather than in isolated parts,\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 543, 548, 364 S.E.2d 483, 486, <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1017 (1988), according the appropriate \u201cdeference to the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Moten, </em>14 Va. App. at 958, 420 S.E.2d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Here, during collective voir dire by the court, McFetridge indicated no \u201cinterest in the outcome of the case\u201d or opinion with respect to defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. She acknowledged an understanding of the presumption of innocence and the burden and standard of proof for conviction. Later, when examined separately by the court, she again denied any \u201copinion or conclusion\u201d relative to guilt or innocence and affirmed an ability to \u201crender a fair and impartial decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Although McFetridge acknowledged \u201cparticular interest in . . . articles about [the] case\u201d because her husband was a \u201cNaval flight officer,\u201d she was convinced that she \u201cwould be able to keep that separate,\u201d \u201cstay impartial\u201d and properly consider the evidence and instructions of the court. At the conclusion of the entire collective and individual voir dire, the trial judge summoned McFetridge to the courtroom a third time, and she once again confirmed an \u201cability to give the defendant and the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>wealth a fair and impartial trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Clearly, the record, taken as a whole, establishes McFetridge as a conscientious and perceptive juror, fully cognizant of the duties and responsibilities attendant to that service. Her responses during voir dire revealed an impartial mind, untainted by prejudgment and receptive to consideration of the case in accordance with the evidence and instructions of the court, notwithstanding prior knowledge and interest in the offenses. She, therefore, stood indifferent to the cause and was properly retained on the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Baker, J., and Coleman, J., concurred</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\n<em>APPENDIX</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\"><em>COLLECTIVE VOIR </em>DIRE:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">THE COURT: Now, I need at this juncture to ask you-all a series of questions to find out whether you have any knowledge of this case, whether you are acquainted with any of the participants in this case, or whether there is anything in your background that would affect your ability to fairly and impartially try this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">THE COURT: Do any of you have any interest in the trial or the outcome of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">[no response]</p>\n<p id=\"b195-16\">THE COURT: Have any of you formed or expressed any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-18\">[no response]</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">THE COURT: All right.
