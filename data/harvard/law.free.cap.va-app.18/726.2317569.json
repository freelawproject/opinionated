Cook (husband) appeals from a decree of divorce entered on December 23, 1992 by the Circuit Court of the City of Hampton (trial court) that granted Cheryl L. Cook (wife) a divorce <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>on the ground of one-year separation, pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-91(9)(a). The decree ordered husband to pay wife $100 per month in spousal support, $265.61 per month in child support, and wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees of $500. In addition, the trial court found that husband\u2019s retirement pension from the United States Air Force was marital property, and awarded wife seventeen percent of any pension payments made \u201cif and when received\u201d by husband \u201cwithout any limit on the total dollar amount received.\u201d Custody of the couple\u2019s minor child was awarded to wife, with specified visitation rights granted to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>On appeal, husband asserts that the trial court erred in (1) finding that husband\u2019s military pension is marital property as he only has \u201can expectancy\u201d should he complete nine additional years of service, (2) granting wife a percentage of husband\u2019s military pension where the marriage lasted less than ten years, (3) awarding spousal and child support without any corroborating evidence, and (4) entering the final decree of divorce where the hearing was set <em>ex parte </em>by wife, over husband\u2019s objection. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Husband and wife were married on June 2, 1984 in Dover, Delaware, and thereafter resided together in the City of Hampton, Virginia. One child, a son, was born of the marriage. The parties had been married seven years prior to their separation. At the May 26, 1992 commissioner\u2019s hearing, husband testified that he had been in the Air Force for eleven years, having enlisted in October 1981. Husband further stated that any expected Air Force pension would not accrue until he completed twenty years of military service, leaving him with nine years of service left to complete at the time of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">It is well settled in Virginia that all pensions, including military pensions, may be classified as marital property subject to equitable distribution. <em>See Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>7 Va. App. 472, 478, 375 S.E.2d 387, 391 (1988); <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>1 Va. App. 75, 78, 335 S.E.2d 277, 279-80 (1985). In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">All property including that portion of pensions, . . . acquired by either spouse during the marriage, and before the last separation of the parties, ... is presumed to be <em>marital property </em>in the absence of satisfactory evidence that it is separate property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-10\">[T]he court may direct payment of a percentage of the marital share of any pension, . . . whether <em>vested or nonvested, </em>which constitutes marital property and whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time. However, <em>the court shall only direct that payment be made as such benefits are pay</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>able. </em>No such payment shall exceed fifty percent of the marital share of the cash benefits actually received by the party against whom such an award is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">For the purposes of determining the equitable distribution of husband\u2019s military pension, the parties were married for seven years prior to the separation. At that time, husband had completed eleven years of military service and was in the Air Force during the entire time the parties were married. As husband argues, except for conditions not apparent here,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he must complete twenty years of active military service before his pension rights become vested. <em>See Sawyer, </em>1 Va. App. at 78-79, 335 S.E.2d at 280; Code \u00a7 20-107.3(G). However, in accord with our construction of Code \u00a7 20-107.3, awards may be decreed prior to the pensioner\u2019s receipt of payments even though future payments may be \u201can expectancy.\u201d Based on this record, it was not error to award wife seventeen percent of husband\u2019s pension to be paid when received. <em>See Zipf </em>v. <em>Zipf, </em>8 Va. App. 387, 398, 382 S.E.2d 263, 269 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210 (1981), that prevented state courts from dividing military retirement pay pursuant to state community property laws, Congress enacted the Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a) (West 1983 &amp; Supp. 1985), effective February 1, 1983. The USFSPA legislatively overruled <em>McCarty </em>and returned to state courts the power to treat \u201cdisposable retired or retainer pay,\u201d subject to \u00a7 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as community property in accordance with state law. <em>See Mansell </em>v. <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 584-85 (1989). The USFSPA placed limitations on the power of state courts to make awards to spouses of certain retirees. <em>See, e.g., Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 594-95 (holding that the USFSPA did \u201cnot grant state courts the power to treat as property divisible upon divorce military retirement pay that has been waived to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>veterans\u2019 disability benefits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Husband\u2019s ten-year limitation issue is one of first impression in the Commonwealth. The USFSPA created the \u201cdirect payment mechanism\u201d in \u00a7 1408(d)(1)3 and authorized the appropriate military finance center to pay the court ordered apportioned share of a former spouse\u2019s military retirement benefits directly to a former spouse if certain requirements are met. <em>See Carmody </em>v. <em>Secretary of Navy, </em>886 F.2d 678, 679 (4th Cir. 1989); <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 585. In <em>Carmody, </em>the Fourth Circuit held that direct payment of a former spouse\u2019s military retirement pay, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(l)-(2), is contingent upon a marriage of at least ten years. <em>Carmody, </em>886 F.2d at 679. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(2) permits direct payment only if a former spouse has been \u201cmarried to a military member for at least ten years, and obtain [ed] a court order that is final and regular on its face that provides for the payment of a specific amount or percentage of the service member\u2019s retirement pay.\u201d <em>Carmody, </em>886 F.2d at 679; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Although husband and wife have not met the ten-year requirement, that is \u201cnot a barrier\u201d to a court\u2019s division of the former spouse\u2019s military retirement pay. It is but a \u201cfactor in determining how the entitlement is to be collected.\u201d <em>Carranza </em>v. <em>Carranza, </em>765 S.W.2d 32, 33-34 (Ky. Ct. App. 1989); <em>see also Mansell, </em>490 U.S at 591 n.13; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>563 N.E.2d 633, 634-35 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990); <em>Scott v. Scott, </em>519 So. 2d 351, 352-53 (La. Ct. App. 1988); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>750 P.2d 1313, 1314-15 (Wyo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>1988); <em>Konzen </em>v. <em>Konzen, </em>693 P.2d 97, 99 (Wash.), <em>cert. denied, </em>473 U.S. 906 (1985); <em>Oxelgren v. Oxelgren, </em>670 S.W.2d 411, 412-13 (Tex. Ct. App. 1984). While 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(2) prevents direct payment to the divorced wife, it was not error for the trial court to declare husband\u2019s military pension to be marital property and award wife seventeen percent of that pension upon his receipt of pension payments, notwithstanding that husband and wife were married for less than ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Upon familiar principles, we review the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to wife, the party prevailing below. <em>Steinberg </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>11 Va. App. 323, 325, 398 S.E.2d 507, 508 (1990). The recommendations of the commissioner in chancery concerning spousal and child support were approved by the trial court and incorporated into the divorce decree from which this appeal emanates. \u201cOn appeal, a decree which approves a commissioner\u2019s report will be affirmed unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 577, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">\u201cThe determination whether a spouse is entitled to support, and if so how much, is a matter within the sound discretion of the court and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clear that some injustice has been done.\u201d <em>Dukelow v. Dukelow, </em>2 Va. App. 21, 27, 341 S.E.2d 208, 211 (1986). In determining an appropriate contribution to the child\u2019s support, the trial court is vested with discretionary power and its \u201caward [s] will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>3 Va. App. 80, 81, 348 S.E.2d 46, 47 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Husband has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion. We further find from our review of the record that wife\u2019s testimony was sufficiently credible to support the trial court\u2019s award of spousal and child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">We have reviewed the record in this case and find that husband was given a copy of the proposed final divorce decree and ample notice that wife\u2019s counsel would submit the proposed decree to the trial court for entry. However, husband failed to appear at the time and place of that notice and, accordingly, it was not error for the trial judge to enter the decree as presented on December 23, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-9\"> <em>E.g., </em>physical disability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\"> 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4) defines disposable retired or retainer pay as \u201cthe total monthly retired or retainer pay to which a member is entitled\u201d less certain deductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">After effective service on the Secretary concerned of a court order with respect to the payment of a portion of the retired or retainer pay of a member to the spouse or a former spouse of the member, the Secretary shall, <em>subject to the limitations of this </em>section, make payments to the spouse or former spouse in the amount of the disposable retired or retainer pay of the member specifically provided for in the court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\"> 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(d)(2) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">If the spouse or former spouse to whom payments are to be made under this section was not married to the member for a period of 10 years or more during which the member performed at least 10 years of service creditable in determining the member\u2019s eligibility for retired or retainer pay, payments may not be made under this section to the extent that they include an amount resulting from the treatment by the court under subsection (c) of disposable retired or retainer pay of the member as property of the member or property of the member and his spouse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b740-8\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALr\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">I concur in Parts I and III of the majority opinion. Because I believe a caveat is necessary with respect to Part II, I concur in that part only with the following reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The final decree of divorce recited that the wife \u201cis awarded Seventeen (17%) Percent of [the husband\u2019s] United States Air Force Retirement Pay if and when it is received by [the husband] without any limit on the total dollar amount received.\u201d The retirement pay that a court may equitably distribute is limited, however, by federal law to that portion of the total monthly retired pay that is \u201cdisposable retired or retainer pay.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">[T]he Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act . . . authorizes state courts to treat \u201cdisposable retired or retainer pay\u201d as community property [or property subject to equitable distribution]. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(1). \u201c\u2018Disposable retired or retainer pay\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cthe total monthly retired or retainer pay to which a military member is entitled,\u201d minus certain deductions. \u00a7 1408(a)(4) (1982 ed. and Supp. V).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-12\"><em>Mansell </em>v. <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. 581, 584-85 (1989) (footnote omitted). Thus, the final decree of divorce may not be read to subject the husband\u2019s total retirement pay to the award of seventeen percent to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-13\">\u201c[U]nder the Act\u2019s plain and precise language, state courts have been granted the authority to treat disposable retired pay as . . . property [subject to equitable distribution]; they have not been granted the authority to treat total retired pay as . . . property [subject to equitable distribution].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. In creating benefits to counteract the decision in <em>McCarty </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>453 U.S. 210 (1981), Congress also \u201cplace[d] limits on state courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>designed to protect military retirees.\u201d <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 594. That limit may not be exceeded by an order of a state court. <em>Hisquierdo </em>v. <em>Hisquierdo, </em>439 U.S. 572, 590 (1979). Accordingly, because the final decree cannot confer a benefit that exceeds the authority granted by Congress in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(4), I concur in Part II only to the extent that the term \u201cRetirement Pay\u201d in the final decree is read to mean \u201cdisposable retired . . . pay.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
