Defendant Mark H. West challenges a circuit court\u2019s refusal to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds his possession of marijuana with intent to distribute indictment. He maintains that on March 10, 1992, he was charged with both possession with intent to distribute more than one-half ounce but less than five pounds of marijuana and simple possession of marijuana and that he later pled guilty to simple possession in the general district court. Because this Court has no jurisdiction to decide a defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal in a criminal case, we transfer the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is limited to the subject matter set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 17-116.05 and 17-116.05:1. Our jurisdiction to decide appeals from interlocutory orders is provided by Code \u00a7 17-116.05(4), which further limits that jurisdiction to cases involving administrative agency appeals, workers\u2019 compensation appeals, and domestic relations appeals from an interlocutory decree or order in cases \u201c(i) granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction or (ii) adjudicating the principles of a cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This appeal involves no such order or decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">West argues that, regardless of this Court\u2019s lack of statutory appellate jurisdiction to decide his appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, constitutional due process and equal protection principles require that appellate process be open to him. Otherwise, West argues, he is subjected to a second \u201ctrial\u201d and loses the very right the Fifth Amendment protects. <em>See Abney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 660 (1977); <em>United States v. Blackwell, </em>900 F.2d 742, 745 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Article VI, \u00a7 1, of the Virginia Constitution is the source of original and appellate jurisdiction for Virginia courts. \u201cThe Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>stitution provides that \u2018the <em>Supreme Court </em>shall, by virtue of this Constitution, have appellate jurisdiction ... in cases involving the life or liberty of any person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 174, 185, 431 S.E.2d 648, 654 (1993) (emphasis added). The general appellate jurisdiction, therefore, is in the Supreme Court and not in the Court of Appeals. Code \u00a7 17.116-05 sets forth jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals. This does not authorize an interlocutory appeal by a defendant in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Accordingly, West\u2019s interlocutory appeal is transferred to the Supreme Court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>Transferred.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Willis, J., and Fitzpatrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
