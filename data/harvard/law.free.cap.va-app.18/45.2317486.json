We hold that evidence from which the jury could have found that (1) the defendant and two accomplices attempted to buy marijuana, (2) the defendant knew of the intent of one of the accomplices to sell his share of the marijuana, and (3) the defendant expected to share in the proceeds of the accomplice\u2019s sale, was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of conspiring to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">Police arrested the defendant at a hotel in York County when he and two accomplices sought to purchase thirty pounds of marijuana from two undercover police officers. An informant, who had agreed to assist the Virginia State Police, arranged the proposed purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The defendant arrived at the hotel with the informant and two other men, Kelly and Moore. Upon their arrival, an undercover officer retrieved two bags, one containing one twenty-pound block of marijuana, and the other containing eleven individually wrapped bags of marijuana. The defendant and Moore opened and examined the contents of both bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The participants discussed the proposed price of the marijuana. Kelly asked one of the officers the price of the twenty-pound block of marijuana. The defendant then asked if the price was $28,000 for the entire thirty pounds, and the officer confirmed that it was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>After determining that Kelly intended to buy additional marijuana in the future, the undercover officer offered to sell both bags of marijuana for $26,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The defendant and Kelly then discussed how they would divide the price of the marijuana. The defendant told Kelly, \u201cGive the man twenty-two,\u201d ($22,000) for the twenty-pound block. The defendant also said that he had to have ten pounds for himself. During the course of the discussion, the defendant told Kelly (referring to the twenty-pound block), \u201cI know what you\u2019re going to make off that.\u201d They agreed that Kelly would pay $21,000 for the twenty-pound block and the defendant would pay the difference. After arriving at this agreement, the defendant said that Kelly wanted another hundred pounds the following week and that he \u2014 the defendant \u2014 wanted a hundred dollars profit per pound from Kelly for every pound they ordered. The defendant added, \u201cIf they [the accomplices] want a hundred, I probably might want an additional twenty or thirty pounds myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Finally, the defendant stated to the officer, \u201cI gave you five, they gave you twenty-one.\u201d The officer said, \u201cI guess we have a deal here.\u201d At this point, other officers entered the room and arrested the defendant, Kelly and Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The defendant characterizes this purchase of marijuana as \u201ctwo separate buyer-seller transactions.\u201d He argues that he purchased ten pounds of marijuana for himself, and that the accomplices bought twenty pounds of marijuana for themselves. While admitting that the evidence shows that the three \u201cpooled their monies\u201d to purchase the marijuana, he argues that he and his accomplices each negotiated their individual shares out of the thirty pounds, thus showing a lack of agreement to purchase and distribute the marijuana jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201c[A] single buyer-seller relationship, standing alone, does not constitute a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Zuniga v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va. App. 523, 528, 375 S.E.2d 381, 385 (1988). Thus, if the defendant\u2019s characterization of two separate transactions is correct, no conspiracy existed between the accomplices and the defendant. <em>See Feigley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>16 Va. App. 717, 723-24, 432 S.E.2d 520, 525 (1993). Furthermore, the defendant was not charged with a conspiracy to purchase marijuana. He was charged with conspiring to possess marijuana with an intent to sell it; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>therefore, the evidence must support a finding that he and at least one other person conspired to possess the marijuana with such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201cThe agreement is the essence of the conspiracy offense.\u201d Zuniga, 7 Va. App. at 527-28, 375 S.E.2d at 384. A conspiracy is \u201can agreement between two or more persons by some concerted action to commit an offense,\u201d <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 368, 372, 288 S.E.2d 491, 493 (1982), and may be proven by circumstantial evidence. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982); <em>Amato </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 544, 551-52, 352 S.E.2d 4, 9 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Direct Sales Co. v. United States, </em>319 U.S. 703, 711 (1943), we apply a two-step test to determine whether a conspiracy exists in the sale of a controlled substance. <em>Zuniga, </em>7 Va. App. at 529, 375 S.E.2d at 385. The first step is whether \u201cthe seller knows the buyer\u2019s intended illegal use\u201d; the second step is wh\u00e9ther the seller \u201cintends to further, promote and cooperate in\u201d the buyer\u2019s venture. <em>Direct Sales, </em>319 U.S. at 711. Although <em>Direct Sales </em>involved a vertical transaction, i.e., one between a seller and a buyer, rather than a horizontal one, i.e. one between two buyers, the principles of the test may also be applied to a transaction between two buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">When one buyer knows that the other buyer intends to possess the substance with intent to distribute it, the first step in the test is met. <em>See Zuniga, 7 </em>Va. App. at 529, 375 S.E.2d at 385. In this case, the defendant\u2019s statement that he knew what Kelly was \u201cgoing to make off that,\u201d was evidence from which the jury could find that the defendant had knowledge that Kelly intended to possess the marijuana with the further intent to distribute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">An intention to further aid in a buyer\u2019s venture may be found in a seller\u2019s continued financial interest in the venture. In <em>Zuniga, </em>the seller sold cocaine to the buyer on credit, and his intent to further the buyer\u2019s venture could be inferred from his interest in getting his money back. <em>Zuniga, </em>7 Va. App. at 532, 375 S.E.2d at 387. In this case, the defendant\u2019s statement that he expected one hundred dollars from every pound of marijuana that Kelly sold was evidence from which the jury could conclude that he intended to further Kelly\u2019s venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Both parts of the test for determining the presence of a conspiracy in a sale of a controlled substance were met in this case. From the two statements the defendant made during the transaction concerning his knowledge of what Kelly intended to do with the marijuana and his expectation of sharing in the profits of Kelly\u2019s sale of the marijuana, the jury could have found that a conspiracy existed between the defendant and Kelly. Sufficient evidence, therefore, supports the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The defendant also contends that the undercover officer did not have probable cause to arrest him. \u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge . . . alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Derr </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 215, 219-20, 368 S.E.2d 916, 918 (1988). The arresting officer personally observed the transaction and heard the defendant\u2019s statements. We hold, therefore, that the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Baker, J., and Bray J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
