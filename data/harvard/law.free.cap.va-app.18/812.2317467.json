Clark, 17 Va. App. 474, 438 S.E.2d 304 (1993). The employer\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted on January 20, 1994, and the mandate of the December 14, 1993 opinion was stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-17\">The appeal was reheard <em>en banc </em>on June 2, 1994. For the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the Court affirms the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>decision of the commission in all respects except as to the determination of the conclusive presumption of permanent total disability. On that issue, for the reasons stated in the original majority opinion, the finding of the commission is reversed. Accordingly, the stay of the mandate of December 14, 1993 opinion is lifted and the case remanded to the commission for final action consistent with that opinion and its adoption by this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Chief Judge Moon and Judges Coleman and Baker, for the reasons stated in Judge Coleman\u2019s dissent from the original decision, 17 Va. App. at 477-78, 438 S.E.2d at 306 (Coleman, J., dissenting), would reverse the findings of the commission and dismiss the claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
