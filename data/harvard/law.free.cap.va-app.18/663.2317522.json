Gray was issued a summons by state trooper J.P. Holley (Holley) after Holley\u2019s radar device measured Gray\u2019s vehicle traveling seventy-seven miles per hour in a sixty-five mile per hour speed zone. At trial, the court reduced the offense to traveling seventy-four miles per hour, found Gray guilty of that offense, and assessed a fine of twenty-seven dollars plus court costs. In this appeal, Gray contends that her conviction should be overturned on the ground that the Commonwealth failed in its burden of proving that the radar device used to measure the speed of her vehicle was calibrated properly. We disagree and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">At trial, Gray conceded that she was traveling above the speed limit, but maintained that she was traveling \u201cwith the flow of traffic\u201d between sixty-five and seventy miles per hour, probably \u201ccloser to seventy.\u201d Holley testified that he performed multiple tests on the radar device at the beginning of his patrol shift as he was required to do. These tests involve preprogrammed checks of the device\u2019s internal calibrations and field tests of the device using tuning forks both while the patrol vehicle is stationary and while it is moving, and a separate test against the patrol vehicle\u2019s speedometer. Holley testified that the device registered accurately during all of these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Holley further testified that the two tuning forks used to test the radar had been calibrated recently as shown on a certificate verifying their accuracy. Gray objected to the introduction of the calibration certificate on the ground that it was not a true copy of the original. The trial judge, while preserving Gray\u2019s objection, received the certificate \u201cconditionally\u201d into evidence. Without objection, Holley was permitted to testify that the patrol vehicle\u2019s speedometer had been calibrated recently for accuracy and to identify a certificate confirming that calibration. Both certificates were then marked and received into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Holley then testified that he used the radar device to measure the speed of Gray\u2019s vehicle. Gray objected to the introduction of the evidence of the radar device\u2019s use \u201cjust so I preserve [the objection].\u201d The court noted Gray\u2019s objection and allowed Holley to testify. Holley further testified that Gray was upset and told him that she would lose her license if she received another speeding ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Gray moved to strike the evidence, asking the trial court to rule on her objection to the introduction of the tuning fork certificate. She argued that on this ground the Commonwealth had failed to prove the accuracy of the radar device. Gray asserted that Holley was required to perform all the tests and that without proof of the efficacy of the tuning fork test, the accuracy of the radar was inconclusive. The trial judge opined that the speedometer test alone would be enough to assure the accuracy of the radar. The trial judge then stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to take your motion under advisement and your objection is preserved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">After Gray presented her case, she renewed her motion to strike, restating her objection to the introduction of the tuning fork calibration certificate. The trial judge asked Gray\u2019s counsel whether Code \u00a7 46.2-882 required proof of both the tuning fork accuracy and the speedometer accuracy to prove accuracy of the radar device. Counsel conceded that the statute did not expressly require both tests, but added that Holley had testified that he was required to perform both tests. The Commonwealth asserted that Code \u00a7 46.2-882 requires proof of accuracy by one method only. The trial judge stated, \u201cI think the speedometer calibration is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the radar\u201d and on that basis found Gray guilty of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In this appeal, Gray reasserts that pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-882, the Commonwealth was required to prove the accuracy of both the tuning fork and speedometer tests performed by Holley. She also argues that the lack of a \u201ctrue copy\u201d of the tuning fork accuracy certificate prevented the Commonwealth from meeting that burden.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-882 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">The speed of any motor vehicle may be checked by the use of radar .... The results of such checks shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the speed of such motor vehicle in any court or legal proceeding where the speed of the motor vehicle is at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">In any court or legal proceeding in which any question arises about the calibration or accuracy of any radar . . . device as defined in this section used to check the speed of any motor vehicle, <em>a certificate, or a true copy thereof, showing the calibration or accuracy of the speedometer of any vehicle or of any tuning fork employed in calibrating or testing the device, </em>and when and by whom the calibration was made, shall be admissible as evidence of the facts therein stated. No calibration or testing of such device shall be valid for longer than six months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The statute allows the speed of motor vehicles to be checked by radar. The results of such checks are accepted as <em>prima facie </em>evidence where speed is an issue. <em>Sweeny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 668, 670-71, 179 S.E.2d 509, 511-12 (1971). The statute must be strictly construed, <em>id., </em>but we are not required to adopt a curious, narrow or strained construction. <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 531, 535-36, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3, <em>appeal denied, </em>360 S.E.2d 715 (Va. 1987). By using the alternative conjunction \u201cor\u201d the legislature clearly intended to provide alternate methods of proving the accuracy of the radar device.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">It is well established that the Commonwealth must prove that the radar device \u201chad been properly set up and adjusted\u201d and \u201cmust have been recently and accurately tested.\u201d <em>Royals </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 876, 882, 96 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1957). In <em>Thomas v. City of Norfolk, </em>207 Va. 12, 147 S.E.2d 727 (1966), the appellant contested whether sufficient evidence in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>proved that the radar device had been recently tested for accuracy. The Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">While the matter has not heretofore been presented to us it is well recognized in other jurisdictions that evidence of a test of radar equipment by tuning forks in this manner is admissible as tending to prove the accuracy of the equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">In the absence of evidence to the contrary in the present case, the trial court accepted, as it had a right to do, the evidence of [tuning fork tests] as adequate proof of the accuracy of the radar set.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 14, 147 S.E.2d at 728 (citations omitted). <em>Thomas </em>clearly stands for the proposition that testing a radar device by tuning forks alone is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the equipment, a position widely adopted by other jurisdictions. <em>See Myatt v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 163, 171-72, 397 S.E.2d 275, 280-81 (1990) (Cole, J., dissenting). In <em>Myatt, </em>this Court found that insufficient evidence had been entered to support the accuracy of the tuning forks, noting, however, that a subsequent amendment to the statute would have cured the defect. <em>Id. </em>at 167 n.4, 397 S.E.2d at 277 n.4. It stands to reason that if tuning fork tests alone are sufficient to convict, the speedometer test is equally efficacious, a position which again finds support in other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Kincaid, </em>453 N.W.2d 738, 740 (Neb. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Judge Benton, in his dissent, asserts that because Holley was required to perform both the tuning fork and speedometer tests prior to placing the radar device into service each day, the Commonwealth was required to prove the efficacy and accuracy of both tests at trial. Although it is true that Holley could not have put the radar device into service had it not passed each of the tests, that fact alone does not raise the subsequent burden of proof placed on the Commonwealth by Code \u00a7 46.2-882 when evidence of the radar\u2019s use is introduced at trial. Rather, the requirement of duplicate testing merely suggests that when proof is required in court, the Commonwealth will be able to elect between methods of proof according to the evidence available. Where, as here, the Commonwealth by reason of a technical, rather than factual, defect cannot demonstrate the accuracy of both methods, proof by a single method will suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Accordingly, we hold that it was not error for the trial judge to accept Holley\u2019s testimony that the radar properly registered the speed of her vehicle when tested against the vehicle\u2019s speedometer. We further hold that the certificate of that speedometer\u2019s accuracy constituted <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the accuracy of the speed recorded by the radar when trained on Gray\u2019s vehicle. For these reasons, we affirm Gray\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\"> While Gray objected to its introduction, the certificate of tuning fork accuracy was received into evidence by the court. Although the trial judge indicated that he would take her objection under advisement, the record before us does not indicate that the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>was ever sustained. Moreover, during closing argument the trial judge stated that both certificates were in evidence. Accordingly, it would have been possible for the trial judge to accept the accuracy of all tests performed by Holley. However, because the admission of the tuning fork certificate is, at best, equivocal, and because the trial judge specifically stated that he was relying solely on the speedometer test, we will address the specifics of Gray\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b676-7\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0x\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 46.2-882 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">The speed of any motor vehicle may be checked by the use of radar .... The results of such checks shall be accepted as prima facie evidence of the speed of such motor vehicle in any court or legal proceeding where the speed of the motor vehicle is at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">In a decision construing Code \u00a7 46-215.2, the predecessor to this statute, the Supreme Court held that the statute \u201cdoes not eliminate the necessity for the Commonwealth to prove that the machine used for measuring speed had been properly set up and recently tested for accuracy.\u201d <em>Royals </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>198 Va. 876, 881, 96 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1957). The Court also \u201c\u2018recognized not only the necessity to carry out tests for accuracy on radar machines before and after they are used, but also the necessity for proving such tests by proper evidence in a subsequent prosecution for speeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Biesser </em>v. <em>Town of Holland, </em>208 Va. 167, 169, 156 S.E.2d 792, 793-94 (1967) (quoting <em>Crosby v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 266, 268, 130 S.E.2d 467, 468 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">After the Court rendered the <em>Biesser </em>decision, the legislature amended the statute to address the proof problem. The statute as further amended now contains the following additional language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">In any court or legal proceeding in which any question arises about the calibration or accuracy of any radar, electrical, or microcomputer device as defined in this section used to check the speed of any motor vehicle, a certificate, or a true copy thereof, showing the calibration or accuracy of the speedom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>eter of any vehicle or of any tuning fork employed in calibrating or testing the device, and when and by whom the calibration was made, shall be admissible as evidence of the facts therein stated. No calibration or testing of such device shall be valid for longer than six months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-882. Although this paragraph of Code \u00a7 46.2-882 creates an exception to the hearsay rule to allow admission into evidence of a calibration certificate, it does not purport to determine the sufficiency of the evidence required to establish the accuracy of the radar.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The legislative intention is obvious on the face of the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Manifestly [the] Code . . . was amended ... to obviate the necessity of having two troopers testify in every contested speeding case which involves the use of radar. It was the intention of the General Assembly to provide, in cases where any question arises as to the calibration or accuracy of any radio microwave or any other electrical device, that such accuracy could be shown by a certificate of the officers who conducted the tests of the device, and who had knowledge of its accuracy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">The statute contemplates that the speed of motor vehicles may be checked by radar; that the results of such checks be accepted as prima facie evidence where speed is an issue; and that persons may be convicted on the certificates filed in accordance with the statute. However, the statute must be strictly construed and there should be a full compliance therewith if a certificate is to be used as evidence. In prosecutions for speeding arising through the use of radar, the accuracy of the radio microwave, or other electrical device which measures the speed of a vehicle, is critical, for it is the reading reflected by this device which brings about the arrest and the conviction of a defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em>Sweeny v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 668, 670-71, 179 S.E.2d 509, 511-12 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">If the Commonwealth relies upon evidence of speeding based on the readings from a radar device, the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the accuracy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>radar. <em>See Biesser, </em>208 Va. at 168-69, 156 S.E.2d at 793; <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 609, 611-12, 139 S.E.2d 40, 42 (1964); <em>Royals, </em>198 Va. at 879-80, 96 S.E.2d at 814. In convicting Pearl Spears Gray, the trial judge specifically did not consider the results of the tuning fork tests. The trial judge ruled that the evidence proved the radar was reflecting the correct speed of Gray\u2019s automobile. The trial judge reached that conclusion upon evidence that the radar had reflected the correct speed of the patrol vehicle when Holley tested the radar and upon the certificate in evidence that the speedometer of the patrol vehicle was accurate. In view of Officer Holley\u2019s testimony, the trial judge erroneously concluded that the speedometer calibration alone proved beyond a reasonable doubt the accuracy of the radar.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In reviewing this issue, we are guided by the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">It is well established that \u201c[t] he judgment of the court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. However, a trial court\u2019s conclusion based on evidence that is \u2018not in material conflict\u2019 does not have this binding effect on appeal.\u201d A \u201ctrier of fact . . . \u2018may not arbitrarily disregard uncontroverted evidence of unimpeached witnesses which is not inherently incredible and not inconsistent with facts in the record,\u2019 \u201d and a finding under such circumstances presents a question of law, reviewable by this Court on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\"><em>Watson v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 124, 125-26, 435 S.E.2d 428, 429 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Officer Holley, who operated and tested the radar unit, testified that he was \u201crequired\u201d to perform two tests for internal calibration, one involving the use of tuning forks and one involving speed of a vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He further testified that if the radar unit does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cmeet all those criteria,\u201d it may not be used. The officer\u2019s testimony contains no further explanation regarding the requirement to conduct all these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The officer also testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\"><em>Q ... . </em>And the process that you described that you used on a daily basis, that you were trained to do to test this device, depends substantially, if not entirely, on the accuracy of those tuning forks, does it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">A Yes. And like I said, everything, you can\u2019t have one thing go wrong, it has to meet all, I mean, you have to make sure all the lights are working, the display shows up what it\u2019s supposed to as well as the tuning forks. You can\u2019t have ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">Q I understand, but on top of those other things being working, actually the tuning fork is critical to the testing of the machine, is it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-9\">A Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence established a critical link between determining the accuracy of the radar and the tuning fork tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>The trial judge had no knowledge whether the manufacturer of the radar required all of these tests to determine accuracy of the radar or whether the tests were administrative requirements. To the extent that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was silent as to the reason for the requirements, the trial judge was not at liberty to disregard the officer\u2019s testimony and to conclude that the accuracy of the tuning fork test was irrelevant to proof of the accuracy of the radar unit. The officer\u2019s testimony established that he was required to use all of these tests as a measure of whether the radar unit may be used. The officer\u2019s testimony, taken in context, reveals that the critical issue is whether the radar device passed each test. On the basis of the evidence proved at trial, the trial judge erroneously ruled \u201cthat the speedometer calibration is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the radar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The majority opinion misconstrues <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>City of Norfolk, </em>207 Va. 12, 147 S.E.2d 727 (1966), when it interprets that case as establishing the principle that regardless of the other evidence the result of a tuning fork test <em>ipse dixit </em>proves beyond a reasonable doubt the accuracy of the radar set. The Court in <em>Thomas </em>clearly did not go as far as the majority perceives; the Court merely stated that a tuning fork test \u201cis admissible <em>as tending </em>to prove the accuracy of the equipment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 147 S.E.2d at 728 (emphasis added). Any doubt about the intent of that language is resolved because in the very next sentence the <em>Thomas </em>opinion states that <em>ii[i]n the absence of evidence to the contrary . . ., </em>the trial court. . . had a right [to accept] the evidence of [tuning fork tests] as adequate proof of the accuracy of the radar set.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The officer\u2019s testimony in this case presents evidence to the contrary sufficient to negate the <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The Commonwealth also argues that Gray incorrectly asserts that the trial judge had no evidence of the calibration of the tuning forks. Although when Gray objected to the exhibit, the trial judge stated that he would \u201cconditionally receive\u201d the exhibit, the record establishes that the exhibit was not considered by the trial judge. When the trial judge conditionally received the document, the trial judge explicitly preserved Gray\u2019s objection. The objection stated that the exhibit, which was notarized by a person whose title was not specified, and which purported to be a \u201ccopy\u201d of the original, was not properly authenticated as required by Code \u00a7 8.01-390. <em>See Ingram </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 335, 340, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>338 S.E.2d 657, 659-60 (1986). <em>See also Carroll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 686, 690 n.3, 396 S.E.2d 137, 140 n.3 (1990). On no less than three later occasions, Gray renewed the objection. Moreover, there was no proffer by the Commonwealth that later evidence would provide a connection that would clarify the admissibility of the exhibit. <em>See Cutchin </em>v. <em>City of Roanoke, </em>113 Va. 452, 472, 74 S.E. 403, 406 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">More significantly, however, the ruling of the trial judge at the conclusion of the case leaves no doubt that the trial judge did not consider the certificate as evidence. In making his ruling, the trial judge stated: \u201cI think that the speedometer calibration is sufficient to prove the accuracy of the radar.\u201d By its very terms, that ruling is declaratory of the judge\u2019s intention to rely solely upon the certification of the speedometer\u2019s accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction and dismiss the prosecution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> The officer testified that the radar unit is designed to operate when the patrol car is stationary or moving and that he is required to conduct various tests to verify the calibration of the radar. He also testified that the radar unit has two window monitors mounted in his patrol car: one that indicates the speed of the target vehicle and one that indicates the speed of the patrol vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">The first test involves pressing a switch on the radar after it has been connected to a power source. That switch should cause the number thirty-two (32) to appear on both window monitors if the internal workings of the device are properly calibrated. The officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>is then required to press a light display button. If the internal parts of the radar are functioning properly a series of the number eight (8) will appear on both window monitors and a series of lights will illuminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">After testing the internal calibrations, the officer is required to test the radar while in the stationary mode by using two tuning forks. The vibration of one tuning fork should cause the target window monitor to display the number thirty-five (35). The vibration of the other tuning fork should cause the target window monitor to display the number sixty-five (65). He is then required to use the same tuning forks to test the radar unit while in the moving mode while his vehicle is stationary. During this test, the simultaneous vibration of the two tuning forks should cause the target window monitor to display the number thirty (30) and the patrol window monitor to display the number thirty-five (35).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-13\">Lastly, he is required to test the radar unit by comparing the reading on the window monitors against the speed as indicated on the patrol vehicle\u2019s speedometer. To conduct this test, he must drive the patrol vehicle five miles per hour above the posted speed limit of the roadway on which the unit is to be operated and then five miles per hour below the posted speed limit of the same roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">The officer testified that the radar unit has to satisfy all of those criteria and that the tuning fork test was critical to establishing the accuracy of the radar unit. He also testified that he is required to perform these tests at the beginning of his duty shift and at the end of his duty shift.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
