He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B)( 17) with the Industrial Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Caudle-Hyatt, by whom he was regularly employed as an asbestos insulator between 1966 and 1983. Caudle-Hyatt received notice of the claim and denied liability. At Wood\u2019s request, the commission placed the claim on its inactive docket while Wood pursued common law tort actions against various asbestos manufacturers. Through his attorney, Wood negotiated offers of settlement totalling $88,000 for the tort claims. Wood notified Caudle-Hyatt in writing by certified mail of the terms of the settlement offers and stated that he intended to accept them unless Caudle-Hyatt objected within ten days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Caudle-Hyatt re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>sponded by denying that it was liable for Wood\u2019s asbestosis claim, including medical expenses. Caudle-Hyatt also stated that it would not pay any portion of his attorney\u2019s fees for obtaining the tort settlement. Caudle-Hyatt\u2019s response, thus, did not agree or object to Wood\u2019s proposed tort settlement, nor did it mention any subrogation rights. Wood settled the tort claims for $88,000, an amount that exceeded the sum that Wood might receive in workers\u2019 compensation benefits for stage one asbestosis, exclusive of whatever medical expenses he might incur.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Wood then requested that his workers\u2019 compensation claim for asbestosis be placed on the commission\u2019s hearing docket. After a hearing, the deputy commissioner entered a compensation award against Caudle-Hyatt, finding that Wood was last injuriously exposed to asbestos while working for Caudle-Hyatt. The award, which required Caudle-Hyatt to assume responsibility for Wood\u2019s future reasonable medical expenses, was suspended, at the request of Wood\u2019s counsel, until the amount of the monthly benefits under an award exhausted the net proceeds that Wood had received from the third-party tort recovery. The deputy commissioner also ordered Caudle-Hyatt to pay $1250 as a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee for representing the claimant before the commission on the compensation claim. The deputy commissioner made no allowance, however, for claimant\u2019s request pursuant to the holding in <em>Sheris v. Travelers, </em>for a <em>pro rata </em>share of reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the extent that the tort recovery had relieved the employer of its workers\u2019 compensation liability up to the net amount of Wood\u2019s third-party recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Wood sought review of the deputy\u2019s award to the commission because it did not grant benefits for stage one asbestosis and did not order Caudle-Hyatt to pay its reasonable <em>pro rata </em>share of attorney\u2019s fees and costs for being relieved of its workers\u2019 compensation liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On review, the commission reversed the deputy\u2019s award for medical benefits, finding that all of Wood\u2019s compensation benefits were barred because he had settled his third-party tort claim prior to the entry of a compensation award. The commission accepted Caudle-Hyatt\u2019s position that the employer could not have participated in the third-party tort settlement because its workers\u2019 compensation liability had not been determined and, therefore, it had no subrogation rights to assert at the time. In support of its find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ing, the commission relied on our holding in <em>Streich </em>v. <em>Tidewater Dock &amp; Structures, </em>14 Va. App. 779, 780, 418 S.E.2d 913, 914 (1992), to support its conclusion that an employer\u2019s subrogation rights do not exist until a compensation award is entered against it. The commission reasoned that by settling the tort claims before obtaining a workers\u2019 compensation award, Wood had elected to pursue his common law remedy and thereby had impaired or destroyed the inchoate subrogation rights that Caudle-Hyatt would have obtained. The commission held that, under <em>Streich, </em>the employer had no interest in the third-party claim\u201d because no \u201cruling establishing . . . entitlement to compensation\u201d had been made at \u201cthe time of [the third-party] settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 781, 418 S.E.2d at 914. The commission ruled that \u201cCode \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-309, -310, and -311 [creating employer\u2019s subrogation rights and providing for apportionment of reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees] do not become operative\u201d because no subrogation claim existed. Thus, the commission held that Wood was not entitled to a compensation award, including medical benefits, nor was Caudle-Hyatt required to pay its <em>pro rata </em>share of Wood\u2019s reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees for the tort case, but only a fee for representing Wood before the commission on the compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">At the review hearing before the commission, Caudle-Hyatt alternatively contended that, even if it had subrogation rights, it did not consent to Wood\u2019s third-party tort settlement and, thus, he had prejudiced their subrogation rights by settling the claims without their consent. The commission found that if Caudle-Hyatt had subrogation rights, Wood\u2019s settlement of the tort claims without their consent would have prejudiced those rights. Thus, Wood\u2019s claim for compensation would also be barred on that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">An employee injured in the course of employment by a negligent third party may pursue a common law remedy against the tort-feasor and a claim for compensation benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, but may obtain only one full recovery for the injury. <em>Noblin v. Randolph Corp., </em>180 Va. 345, 358-59, 23 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1942). If the employee pursues both remedies, at such time that the employee makes a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the \u201cclaim . . . shall operate as an assignment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the employer of any right to recover damages,\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A), and the employer \u201cshall be subrogated to [the right to recover damages] in his own name or in the name of the injured employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, making a \u201cclaim\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation benefits works as an assignment under Code \u00a7 65.2-309 of the employee\u2019s \u201cright to recover damages\u201d from the tort-feasor. The commission\u2019s basic premise\u2014that an employer has no subrogation right in its employee\u2019s third-party tort claim until a compensation award has been entered against it\u2014is, therefore, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In reaching its conclusion, the commission relied on language from the <em>Streich </em>decision. In <em>Streich, </em>a claimant who was receiving compensation benefits under an award was barred from receiving further benefits because he settled his third-party tort claims without the employer consenting to or having notice of the terms of the settlement. The commission misconstrues the scope of the <em>Streich </em>decision. The commission considered <em>Streich </em>only from the perspective of whether the employer had asserted its subrogation rights and not whether the subrogation rights existed. The commission relied on dictum in <em>Streich </em>and interpreted that dictum in a manner that is inconsistent with the clear language of Code \u00a7 65.2-309. The Act does not require that a workers\u2019 compensation \u201caward\u201d be entered before an employer is subrogated to its employee\u2019s \u201cright to recover damages.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309(A) states unequivocally that \u201c[a] <em>claim </em>against an employer ... for injury . . . benefits shall operate as an assignment to the employer of any right to recover damages which the injured employee . . . may have against any other party.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-309 contains no requirement that an \u201caward\u201d must first be entered before an employer obtains subrogation rights. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (defining an \u201caward\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Thus, notwithstanding language in <em>Streich </em>that may be read to suggest otherwise, we hold that under Code \u00a7 65.2-309, an employer acquires its subrogation rights in an employee\u2019s third-party tort claim when the employee makes a \u201cclaim\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which may be done either by filing a claim with the commission or by giving notice to the employer of the compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Here, Wood had \u201cfiled\u201d his \u201cclaim\u201d with the commission before he proceeded with or settled his third-party tort claims. Thus, the assignment of \u201cany right to recover damages\u201d occurred and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>employer was \u201csubrogated\u201d to the employee\u2019s \u201cright to recover damages\u201d at that time. Thus, the commission erred in holding that Caudle-Hyatt had no subrogation right in Wood\u2019s \u201cright to recover damages\u201d when he settled his third-party tort claims. <em>See Gartman v. Allied Towing Corp., </em>467 F. Supp. 439, 440 (E.D. Va. 1979) (subrogation arises when employee \u201cmakes\u201d a \u201clawful claim against [his] employer for compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Although Code \u00a7 65.2-309 provides that the employer, in the exercise of its subrogation rights, may \u201cenforce\u201d these rights in its \u201cown name or in the name of the injured employee,\u201d the cause of action belongs to the employee, who may also pursue that right. <em>See Noblin, </em>180 Va. at 358-59, 23 S.E.2d at 214. However, to protect the employer who may be required to provide the employee workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the employee may not pursue his common law remedy in such a manner or settle his claim to the prejudice of the employer\u2019s subrogation right and thereafter continue to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Safety-Kleen Corp. v. Van Hoy, 225 </em>Va. 64, 70, 300 S.E.2d 750, 754 (1983). <em>See also Ball v. C.D.W. Enters., </em>13 Va. App. 470, 473, 413 S.E.2d 66, 68 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The commission ruled in the alternative that Wood\u2019s settlement of the third-party claim prejudiced Caudle-Hyatt\u2019s subrogation rights. The employee necessarily prejudices his employer\u2019s subrogation rights and, thus, is barred from obtaining or continuing to receive benefits under a workers\u2019 compensation award when an employee settles a third-party tort claim without notice, or without making a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, or without obtaining the consent of the employer. <em>Stone v. George W. Helme Co., </em>184 Va. 1051, 1060, 37 S.E.2d 70, 75 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Where an employee receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits fails to notify the employer of a third-party settlement, the employee destroys the employer\u2019s subrogation rights without affording it an opportunity to exercise or protect those rights. <em>Streich, </em>14 Va. App. at 780, 418 S.E.2d at 914. Accordingly, when an \u201cemployer [is] not notified nor its consent requested, the settlement [is] deemed to be without its approval.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen an employer\u2019s right to subrogation is defeated by an employee\u2019s settlement with a third party without the knowledge or consent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the employer, the employee\u2019s benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are terminated.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>Warwick Plumbing &amp; Heating Corp., </em>5 Va. App. 409, 412, 364 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1988). This is especially true when an employee settles a third-party claim for less than the potential amount of workers\u2019 compensation coverage. <em>Safety-Kleen, </em>225 Va. at 69, 300 S.E.2d at 753; <em>Green, </em>5 Va. App. at 412, 364 S.E.2d at 6; <em>Ball, </em>13 Va. App. at 473, 413 S.E.2d at 68. In such situations, the employer\u2019s rights are significantly impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Wood promptly notified Caudle-Hyatt by certified mail of the terms of the proposed settlement, and he requested that Caudle-Hyatt consent or voice its objection within ten days. Caudle-Hyatt did not object to the proposed settlement. Moreover, Caudle-Hyatt has at no time stated any basis for objecting to the terms of the settlement, which appears to have been in its best interest. In fact, the amount of Wood\u2019s third-party settlement was in excess of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that Wood could receive for stage one asbestosis, exclusive of the medical expenses that he might incur.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Wood is entitled to one full recovery and no more, whether that be his workers\u2019 compensation benefits or common law tort damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By filing his workers\u2019 compensation claim and by giving his employer notice of the terms of his proposed third-party tort settlement, and by requesting that the funds from the third-party settlement be exhausted before the employer was required to pay the compensation award, Wood has afforded his employer, Caudle-Hyatt, every opportunity to protect its subrogation rights. An employee is no longer required to elect between pursuing a tort action or workers\u2019 compensation claim, nor is the employee required to forego his or her tort claim. The employee may pursue both remedies, provided the employee does not impair the employer\u2019s subrogation right, but is entitled to only one full recovery. <em>Stone, </em>184 Va. at 1057, 37 S.E.2d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Here, unlike the employer in <em>Safety-Kleen </em>who had no \u201cknowledge [of] or [did not] consent\u201d to the terms of the settlement, Caudle-Hyatt was given an opportunity to object to or participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>in the settlement and was informed of the terms of the settlement. We hold that under the facts of this case, Caudle-Hyatt has not established that the terms of the settlement were prejudicial to it. Accordingly, because Caudle-Hyatt does not contest that Wood has stage one asbestosis, for which he otherwise would have been entitled to an award against Caudle-Hyatt, the commission shall enter the award, which shall be suspended until such time that the amount of the monthly benefits and reasonable and necessary medical expenses exhaust Wood\u2019s net third-party tort recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">An employer who benefits from an employee\u2019s third-party tort settlement, by recouping or being relieved of paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits, is required by Code \u00a7 65.2-311 to pay its <em>pro rata </em>share of a claimant\u2019s reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees in effecting the recovery. <em>Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Bower, </em>243 Va. 183, 186, 413 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1992). Although the traditional jurisdiction of the commission would allow it to assess attorney\u2019s fees solely for services concerning workers\u2019 compensation claims, the legislature has specifically provided in Code \u00a7 65.2-311 that the commission is the forum for apportioning attorney\u2019s fees between the employer and employee for expenses and services in obtaining a tort recovery, \u201ceither by judgment or voluntary settlement.\u201d A claimant is not required to bear the full financial burden of recovering common law tort damages which benefit the employer. <em>See Stancil </em>v. <em>United States, </em>200 F. Supp. 36 (E.D. Va. 1961). Claimants who pursue their rights against tort-feasors should be encouraged to settle such claims, provided the employer has notice of the terms of the settlement and an opportunity to consent or object to it and provided the settlement does not, in fact, prejudice the employer\u2019s subrogation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The commission\u2019s ruling that Caudle-Hyatt was only required to pay Wood\u2019s attorney for representing him before the commission on the compensation claim was also predicated upon the commission\u2019s erroneous interpretation and application of the <em>Streich </em>decision. The commission held that Caudle-Hyatt was not required to pay its <em>pro rata </em>share of reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees because Code \u00a7 65.2-311 was not \u201coperative\u201d since Caudle-Hyatt had no subrogation rights. As we have ruled, Caudle-Hyatt\u2019s subrogation rights arose when Wood filed his \u201cclaim\u201d for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Although no award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>had been entered against Caudle-Hyatt nor its liability determined, when Wood filed his claim, Caudle-Hyatt had a subrogation right to recover damages that it could have exercised in its own name or in Wood\u2019s name. Had it done so, it would have had a commensurate obligation, had it pursued a settlement to protect Wood\u2019s right, and would have been required to obtain court approval of any settlement. Code \u00a7 65.2-309(C). \u201cThere is no rational distinction between the benefit an employer enjoys from being reimbursed for compensation payments already made and the benefit of being released from the obligation to make future payments.\u201d <em>Bower, </em>243 Va. at 187, 413 S.E.2d at 57. The Supreme Court has adopted the <em>Sheris </em>\u201creasoning [as] persuasive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 413 S.E.2d at 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Caudle-Hyatt received substantial benefit from Wood\u2019s settlement of his third-party tort claim. Accordingly, should Caudle-Hyatt be liable to Wood for workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his asbestosis under Code \u00a7 65.2-503(B)(17), it must pay its <em>pro rata </em>share of reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees. Otherwise, \u201cthe employer would be relieved of a substantial obligation as a result of [the employee\u2019s] efforts without being required to compensate\u201d the claimant for its share of the legal costs and expenses incurred. <em>Bower, </em>243 Va. at 187, 413 S.E.2d at 57. The commission shall award Wood a <em>pro rata </em>amount of his reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees in proportion to the benefit that Caudle-Hyatt received by virtue of Wood\u2019s third-party tort settlement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">This case is remanded to the commission for entry of an award of compensation benefits and determination of a <em>pro rata </em>share of expenses and attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Barrow, J., and Benton, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-11\"> Effective October 1, 1991, the Industrial Commission of Virginia was changed to the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\"> The June 18, 1991, letter from claimant\u2019s counsel to Caudle-Hyatt informed them that the settlement offer was \u201cfor an amount in excess of $88,000, [that the claimant] considered] the . . . offers . . . fair and reasonable [and the claimant] intend[ed] to accept the[] offers ... on June 28th unless [Caudle-Hyatt objected] prior to that time.\u201d The letter also informed Caudle-Hyatt that the claimant would seek \u201ccontribution of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to <em>Sheris </em>v. <em>Travelers,\" </em>491 F.2d 603 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 831 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> Should Wood\u2019s stage one asbestosis progress to stage two or three asbestosis, and, depending upon Wood\u2019s medical expenses, conceivably, the workers\u2019 compensation benefits could exceed the net amount that Wood recovered in his tort settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b408-9\"><em>See Bohle </em>v. <em>Henrico County Sch.
