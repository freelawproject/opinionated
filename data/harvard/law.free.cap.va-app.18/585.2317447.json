Hawley Brooks appeals the finding by the trial court that he is the biological father of Baby Doe (infant) and the related order that he pay child support of $1213.50 per month. He argues that the evidence was insufficient to determine paternity and that the court erroneously imputed income to him in fixing the support obligation. For the reasons which follow, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">\u201c \u2018Under familiar principles we view [the] evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. Where, as here, the court hears the evidence <em>ore </em>terms, its finding is entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pommerenke </em>v. <em>Pommerenke, </em>7 Va. App. 241, 244, 372 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1988) (citation omitted). It is well established that the credibility of witnesses and the weight accorded to their testimony are matters solely within the purview of the trial court, and its findings will be reversed on appeal only if \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>Wyatt </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>11 Va. App. 225, 230, 397 S.E.2d 412, 415 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">\n<em>PATERNITY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Infant was born to Carolyn M. Rogers on October 10, 1986. On January 5, 1989, she filed a support petition with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court, which named Brooks as the putative party and \u201crequest [ed] that paternity be established . . . and the amount of support determined.\u201d The district court ordered the parties to submit to DNA and HLA blood testing and, following a subsequent <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, concluded that Brooks was infant\u2019s \u201cnatural father.\u201d Brooks appealed this decision to the circuit court for a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>At the inception of the circuit court proceedings, Brooks moved to exclude any \u201cprobability of paternity\u201d evidence which was based upon the blood testing. While he did not dispute the \u201creliability\u201d of this evidence, Brooks argued that it was dependent upon \u201cneutral assumptions,\u201d without consideration of significant \u201csocial evidence\u201d peculiar to this case and indispensable to an accurate interpretation of the tests. Attendant to this motion, the parties conducted extended pretrial examination of Dr. Uwe Heina, an expert in the field of genetic blood testing offered by Rogers, after which Brooks withdrew his objection to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">During this pretrial hearing, Dr. Heina explained that the testing methodology was designed to be \u201ccompletely objective.\u201d Both the DNA and HLA tests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">look at the mother and child to see what they share and then what is left over had to come from the biological father of the child, in which case you look at what the alleged father has; and if he matches, then you have to refer to a data base to see how rare that genetic type is to give you some indication of how often it will match randomly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Guided by this protocol, Heina concluded that the probability of Brooks\u2019s paternity, \u201cversus a random man of the Caucasian population not [a close] relative,\u201d was 99.98% under the DNA test and 99.08 % under the HLA test.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Heina noted, however, that if the evidence established that Brooks\u2019s son had \u201cequal access [,] as far as intercourse the same number of times,\u201d to Rogers as Brooks, the \u201cmaximum\u201d probability of Brooks\u2019s paternity would diminish to 88.88% on the DNA test and the HLA test would be uninformative. He also confirmed that if Brooks was sterile or did not have access to Rogers within the \u201cwindow of conception,\u201d the probability of his paternity would be zero. Heina further recognized that \u201c[a]ny factor that the Court deem[ed] pertinent,\u201d including the credibility of witnesses, would also be relevant to the probability of paternity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>analysis. Thus, the \u201cneutral values\u201d of the formula would yield to the particular circumstances of each case, thereby ensuring a more accurate interpretation of the tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">During trial, Rogers testified that she first met Brooks at a \u201cChristmas party ... in December of 1985.\u201d She claimed two subsequent sexual liaisons with him, the first at his home on January 31, 1986, and, again, \u201cabout two weeks after that.\u201d When Rogers became aware of her pregnancy, she \u201cknew [Brooks] was the father\u201d because she did not have \u201crelations with anyone else\u201d during the probable time of conception.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Brooks denied \u201cintimate contact of any kind with [Rogers].\u201d Moreover, he testified that he had undergone a vasectomy in Puerto Rico during 1984. When he was unable to relocate that physician \u201csix to eight weeks\u201d following the procedure, Brooks had obtained a \u201creview\u201d of his post-operative condition from Dr. Tobacci, located on a nearby island. In a related report, dated May 5, 1984, Dr. Tobacci indicated that the \u201cincisions look good . . . seminal fluid collected, no live sperm noted, vasectomy complete.\u201d Brooks also produced medical records which suggested that infant was conceived between January 10 and 17, 1986, prior to the alleged trysts with Rogers.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On rebuttal, Dr. Heina testified that even \u201cbeing absolutely certain that the vasectomy occurred\u201d and \u201c[assuming a failure rate of one in a thousand,\u201d the genetic evidence was \u201cso high\u201d in this instance that it, nevertheless, indicated a 99.75% probability that Brooks fathered infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In determining paternity, the court is guided by Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-49.1 and -49.4. Code \u00a7 20-49.4 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">The standard of proof in any action to establish parentage shall be by clear and convincing evidence. All relevant evidence on the issue of paternity shall be admissible. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: (1) Evidence of . . . sexual intercourse between the known parent and the alleged parent at the probable time of conception; (2) Medical . . . evidence relating to the alleged parentage of the child based on tests performed by experts . . . ; (3) The results of scientifically reliable genetic tests, including blood tests, if available, weighted with all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>evidence ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Here, the court clearly considered all of the relevant evidence, expressly including the statutory \u201cfactors,\u201d in concluding that Brooks was the biological father of infant. Dr. Heina related the probability of Brooks\u2019s parentage derived from objective blood analyses. He acknowledged that the particular circumstances of each case were relevant to interpretation of the tests and testified to the probabilities based upon the evidence in this instance. Heina\u2019s testimony was proper, and it remained for the fact finder to weigh and consider it with the other evidence. Code \u00a7 20-49.4. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1; <em>Buckland v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 290, 296, 329 S.E.2d 803, 806-07 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The record discloses that the trial judge \u201csimply [did not] believe that there was a vasectomy,\u201d there is no evidence of sexual activity betwe\u00e9n Rogers and Brooks\u2019s son during the relevant period, and the \u201cwindow of conception\u201d for infant was never established conclusively. The genetic evidence, however, was totally consistent with Rogers\u2019s testimony and offered compelling proof of paternity. Under such circumstances, the record provided ample support for the trial court\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence that Brooks was the father of the child, and that decision will not be disturbed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>CHILD SUPPORT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">At the subsequent hearing related to support of infant, Brooks testified that he had been employed by NationsBank and its corporate predecessor for thirteen years before being terminated, without fault, on February 29, 1992. At the time of discharge, Brooks was a senior vice-president, earning approximately $5367 per month. Brooks was then also the \u201c100 percent owner\u201d of B&amp;D Electric Supply, Inc., a business which he began in 1978, and \u201cfigured [he] could just go to B&amp;D and live peacefully.\u201d At the time of the hearing, he was employed at B&amp;D \u201c100 percent of the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">For the years 1989 and 1990, Brooks received an annual salary from B&amp;D of $72,000 and $71,000, respectively. However, due to an \u201cextensive corporate defecit [sic],\u201d Brooks testified that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201cnot drawn a salary . . . since April 30, 1991.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A \u201cProfit Analysis\u201d for B&amp;D reflected operating losses of $97,605, actual, and $85,138, annualized, for the years 1991 and 1992, respectively. At the time of the hearing, Brooks\u2019s gross income included only dividends and a military retirement, and his evidence indicated a \u201cnegative cash flow\u201d each month. Brooks acknowledged that he would soon receive approximately $250,000 from a \u201cthrift plan\u201d and \u201cpension\u201d from NationsBank, which he intended to \u201croll. . . into a defined benefit plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Based upon this and other relevant evidence, the trial court calculated the presumptive amount of child support pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-108.2 and then \u201cimpute[d] income [from] B&amp;D Electric . . . of $5300.00\u201d per month to Brooks. The court noted that it \u201ccould have imputed the additional income . . . from [Brooks\u2019s] Thrift Plan and pension as well as higher yields from his [investment] accounts, but chose not to do so because of the imputed income from B&amp;D Electric.\u201d This imputation of income significantly increased Brooks\u2019s support obligation above the guideline amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In determining child support, there is a rebuttable presumption that the amount determined in accordance with the statutory guidelines, Code \u00a7 20-108.2, is the correct award. Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-108.1(B) and -108.2(A). However, once the presumptive amount is ascertained, the trial court may, after consideration of \u201crelevant evidence pertaining to . . . factors\u201d specified in Code \u00a7 20-108.1, conclude that \u201capplication of such guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>12 Va. App. 18, 21, 401 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1991). The court may then adjust the amount based on such factors, provided the departure is supported by \u201cwritten findings in the order . . . that the application of [the] guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B); <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>14 Va. App. 960, 964, 420 S.E.2d 246, 248-49 (1992). The order \u201cmust identify the factors that justified deviation . . . and explain why and to what extent the factors justified the adjustment\u201d in \u201cenough detail and exactness to allow for effective appellate review of the findings.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>12 Va. App. at 22, 401 S.E.2d at 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Child support addresses the \u201cwelfare and best interests of the child, not the convenience or personal preference of a parent.\u201d <em>Hur </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>13 Va. App. 54, 60, 409 S.E.2d 454, 458 (1991). A parent may not \u201cpurposefully choose to pursue a low paying career which operates to the detriment of . . . [the parent\u2019s] children.\u201d <em>Payne v. Payne, </em>5 Va. App. 359, 364, 363 S.E.2d 428, 431 (1987). Thus, \u201c[i]mputed income to a party who is voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily under employed\u201d is among the several statutory factors \u201caffecting the obligation [and] the ability of each [parent] to provide child support\u201d which may justify deviation from the presumptive amount. Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B); <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Liskey, 12 </em>Va. App. 1, 5, 401 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1991). To properly assess this factor, the trial court must consider' the \u201c[e]arning capacity . . . and financial resources,\u201d \u201c[education and training . . . and the ability and opportunity ... to secure such education and training\u201d of the parents, as well as \u201c[s]uch other factors ... as are necessary to . . . the equities for the parents and children.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108.1(B); <em>Cochran v. Cochran, </em>14 Va. App. 827, 830, 419 S.E.2d 419, 421 (1992) . If the court determines from the evidence that imputation of income to a parent is justified, the award is \u201ccalculated by adding ... a just and appropriate amount [to] the amount reflected in Code \u00a7 20-108.2,\u201d accompanied by the requisite written findings. <em>Richardson, 12 </em>Va. App. at 19-20, 401 S.E.2d at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">When imputed income and the resulting child support are \u201csupported by the evidence and the trial judge has not otherwise abused his or her discretion, the deviation . . . will be upheld on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 401 S.E.2d at 896; <em>see also Kaufman </em>v. <em>Kaufman, 7 </em>Va. App. 488, 494, 375 S.E.2d 374, 377 (1988). However, support must be based upon \u201ccircumstances in existence at the time of the award\u201d and not upon speculation or conjecture. <em>Payne, </em>5 Va. App. at 363, 363 S.E.2d at 430. Both the determination to impute income and the related amount must result from application of the statutory factors to the evidence before the court. <em>See, e.g., Brody </em>v. <em>Brody, </em>16 Va. App. 647, 651, 432 S.E.2d 20, 22 (1993) (parent recently resigned employment with established earnings); <em>Barnhill </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>15 Va. App. 696, 701, 427 S.E.2d 209-10, 213 (1993) (parent voluntarily changed employment with reduced income); <em>Cochran, </em>14 Va. App. at 830-31, 419 S.E.2d at 421 (parent declined employment with history of \u201csubstantial\u201d earnings); <em>Hur, </em>13 Va. App. at 60-61, 409 S.E.2d at 458-59 (par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ent unemployed despite available earning potential).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Here, the trial court justified a departure from the presumptive child support amount by imputing income to Brooks from B&amp;D. However, there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s implicit and necessary finding that Brooks was either voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, which resulted in a diminution of income. No evidence was presented that recent earnings of B&amp;D were adequate to sustain the imputed salary, that the financial reversals of B&amp;D were attributable to any neglect or other acts of Brooks, that he had misrepresented its assets or performance, that he had ignored other available and suitable employment opportunities, with attendant earnings, or that he had otherwise engaged in conduct to his economic disadvantage. The trial court, therefore, imputed income to Brooks without sufficient evidence to support that factor in justification of guideline departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the determination that Brooks was the natural father of infant but reverse the related child support award and remand the cause for a redetermination of Brooks\u2019s support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-9\"> According to Dr. Heina, the basic \u201cformula for calculating the probability of paternity\u201d is:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">\n<em>Paternity index x Prior [probability]</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">\n<em>(Paternity index x Prior [probability]) + (1 - Prior [probability])</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\"> Brooks collected a total salary of $21,667 for 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
