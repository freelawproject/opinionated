Williams (claimant) appeals a decision of the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) that terminated his temporary total benefits based upon an \u201con the record\u201d hearing decision that he was able to return to his preinjury employment. Claimant contends that (1) the commission is subject to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA) and must comply with the statutory scheme for rule promulgation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>(2) the commission\u2019s \u201con the record\u201d hearing violated his right to due process of law. Finding no error, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision. However, we do not decide here whether the commission may shorten the rule-making procedures in any case. We decide only that, in this case, the claimant was not denied due process by the procedure followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Upon familiar principles, on appellate review, we will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to employer, the party prevailing below. <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Mullins, </em>10 Va. App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). On September 7, 1990, in the course of his employment with Virginia Electric &amp; Power Company (employer), claimant suffered a compensable injury to his left knee. Claimant subsequently sought medical treatment from Dr. Ira M. Cantin, an orthopaedic surgeon who is recognized as claimant\u2019s treating physician. Claimant was granted an award based upon a Memorandum of Agreement which ordered payment of temporary total disability benefits for work incapacity beginning June 11, 1991. On February 5, 1992, claimant was seen by Dr. Cantin, and the doctor\u2019s letter to employer reported:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">Again, the patient complains of some pain in the left knee, however, examination of the knee is <em>entirely normal. </em>There is a normal range of motion, no effusion, no instability and no quadriceps atrophy as compared to the opposite side.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">All of his complaints are subjective and from the objective standpoint the examination is essentially normal. I therefore have no reason to believe that this patient cannot return to his regular occupation or for that matter return to any type of occupation he desires. Based on the lack of any objective findings there should be no restrictions on his activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">(Emphasis added.) On February 21, 1992, employer filed an Employer\u2019s Notice of Application for Hearing with the commission to terminate claimant\u2019s temporary total benefits. The \u201cchange\u201d relied upon by employer was Dr. Cantin\u2019s February 5, 1992 report which returned claimant to his pre-injury employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">By letter of March 19, 1992, Deputy Commissioner Elizabeth J. Phillips advised both parties that she had received employer\u2019s Notice of Application for Hearing requesting that claimant\u2019s ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>efits be terminated. Her letter stated that, \u201c[a]fter reviewing this file, we have selected this case for an on the record hearing to insure a swift decision\u201d and advised that \u201c[i]f you believe a trial-type evidentiary hearing is necessary, you must notify me in writing within 7 days of the date of this letter, setting forth the reasons why this case cannot be decided on the record.\u201d Finally, positional statements were to be submitted, along with documentary evidence by April 15, 1992, and rebuttal evidence was to be submitted by April 20, 1992. After that date, the record would close, and the commission would make a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On April 15, 1992, both claimant and employer filed positional statements with the commission. Claimant\u2019s statement lodged an objection to his case being decided without an evidentiary hearing and asked to depose the treating physician \u201cbased on the inconsistent position adopted by the physician and in light of other physician [sic] who opine surgery is necessary and has placed claimant into a leg brace.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Attached to claimant\u2019s statement was Dr. Richard T. Holden\u2019s medical report, dated March 24, 1992. This doctor\u2019s report was the only evidence submitted by claimant. The report merely states as follows: \u201cPatient is retired. Dr. Holden says he does not need this.\u201d The diagnosis section states as follows: \u201cChondromalacia Left Patella.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The report also states that claimant will not have another appointment for two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">However, employer contended that claimant was estopped from objecting to the \u201con the record\u201d hearing because such objection should have been made by March 26, 1992, within seven days of the deputy\u2019s directive. Employer attached Dr. Cantin\u2019s February 5, 1992 letter and a Job Requirements Summary giving claimant\u2019s job description at the time of his injury. Employer also contended that Dr. Cantin \u201cis in the best position to accurately assess the claimant\u2019s work capabilities\u201d because he has been the only treating physician following claimant\u2019s knee injury of September 7, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>By letter of April 24, 1992, the deputy commissioner denied claimant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing as \u201cuntimely\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe issues in this case are medical ones which may be fairly resolved on the basis of the record itself, the expert testimony contained therein, and submission by the parties.\u201d Moreover, the deputy commissioner overruled employer\u2019s objection and gave claimant permission to depose Dr. Cantin, claimant\u2019s treating physician. Finally, the closing of the record was extended until June 10, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On June 19, 1992, based upon a factual finding that Dr. Cantin had returned claimant to his pre-injury employment, the deputy commissioner found that claimant\u2019s temporary total benefits should be terminated. Claimant then filed an Employee\u2019s Request for Review, dated July 9, 1992, challenging the opinion and the procedure by which the case was selected for an \u201con the record\u201d hearing. On December 15, 1992, the full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision in favor of employer and summarily dismissed claimant\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated by the manner in which his claim was adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">I. Virginia Administrative Process Act</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA) \u201csupplement [s] . . . laws conferring authority on agencies either to make regulations or to decide cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:3. As used in the VAPA, \u201c \u2018[zz] <em>gency\u2019 </em>means any authority, instrumentality, officer, board or other unit of the state government empowered by the basic laws to make regulations or decide cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4. However, the commission is exempt from the VAPA regulations concerning rule promulgation when it acts in a quasi-judicial function. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.1(D)(2) provides that \u201c[t]he award or denial of claims for workers\u2019 compensation\u201d is an agency action which is exempt from the operation of the VAPA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In this case, employer\u2019s application based upon a change in condition asked the commission to determine whether claimant was entitled to receive continuing temporary total disability benefits. Code \u00a7 65.2-703(B), which states that the commission\u2019s rules governing discovery shall be adopted pursuant to the Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>tive Process Act, is not applicable. The commission did not create any new rule, but merely implemented an expedited procedure to determine the continuing award or denial of claimant\u2019s benefits. For this determination, the commission was acting in a quasi-judicial function and, therefore, was not subject to the VAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-201 (A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">It shall be the duty of the Commission to administer this title and adjudicate issues and controversies relating thereto. The Commission shall make rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708 states that \u201cupon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded.\u201d Claimant\u2019s case is governed by Code \u00a7 65.2-708 because employer filed an application based upon a change in claimant\u2019s condition. This statute does not require a full hearing, nor does it state that the commission\u2019s review is subject to the VAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Furthermore, Rule 1 of the Industrial Commission<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sets forth the procedures to be followed at a hearing. However, Rule 1 does not specifically require a full evidentiary hearing in each case that comes before the commission, nor does it prohibit an \u201con the record\u201d hearing. Therefore, we agree with the commission\u2019s decision to utilize an \u201con the record\u201d hearing in this case because the commission is not subject to the VAPA and its procedure complied with its own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>II. The \u201cOn The Record\u201d Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Claimant further contends that the commission erred when it granted employer\u2019s change in condition application, in which employer alleged that claimant was able to return to his regular employment on February 5, 1992. Claimant asserts that the commission\u2019s utilization of its \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure to decide this case violated his right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">This case arises pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-708, not Code \u00a7 65.2-704, as is asserted in claimant\u2019s brief. The Supreme Court has held that \u201cafter the Commission has made its award and it has become final the procedure for review of disputes which may arise in connection with the award must be under [Code \u00a7 65.2-708].\u201d <em>Manchester Board &amp; Paper Co. v. Parker, </em>201 Va. 328, 330, 111 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1959). Code \u00a7 65.2-708 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u00a7 65.2-708. Review of award on change in condition. \u2014 A. Upon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award. No application filed by a party alleging a change in condition shall be docketed for hearing by the Commission unless any medical reports upon which the party is relying are submitted to the Commission. No such review shall affect such award as regards any moneys paid except pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-712, 65.2-1105, and 65.2-1205.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-704 was applicable to claimant\u2019s case prior to his acceptance of the award order based upon a Memorandum of Agreement with employer. Because an award has been made in this case and employer subsequently filed a change in condition application, Code \u00a7 65.2-704 is no longer appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">We find that Code \u00a7 65.2-708 empowers the commission with the discretionary authority to review a change in condition application and alter the initial award. Code \u00a7 65.2-708 does not require that the commission hear the parties or their witnesses, nor does it require public proceedings or a full evidentiary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ing. Moreover, the commission\u2019s utilization of the \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure to \u201creview an award,\u201d without the time and cost of an evidentiary hearing, is not prohibited by Code \u00a7 65.2-708.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">III. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In light of the evidence and facts before us, we find that the commission\u2019s utilization of the \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure satisfied the requirements of due process and adequately protected claimant\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">While some degree of formality or the use of standardized uniform procedures and forms may be more conducive to an orderly and expeditious process, rigid or technical rules of pleading, evidence, or practice in the conduct of hearings shall <em>not </em>apply so long as the procedures adopted protect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-8\"><em>Sergio's Pizza </em>v. <em>Soncini, </em>1 Va. App. 370, 376, 339 S.E.2d 204, 207 (1986) (emphasis added) (citing Rule 1 of the Industrial Commission of Virginia). However, the procedure utilized by the commission on employer\u2019s application for review on change of condition and in this case, the \u201con the record\u201d hearing, \u201cmust afford the parties minimal due process safeguards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\u201c[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976). In <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254 (1970), the United States Supreme Court restated the Court\u2019s earlier declaration that the \u201cfundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 267. \u201cProcedural due process has been said to require that before an individual is deprived of any significant property interest he be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>an opportunity, at a meaningful time in a meaningful manner, for a hearing appropriate to the nature of his case.\u201d <em>James v. Arlington Bd. of Supervisors, 226 </em>Va. 284, 289-90, 307 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">This is not a case that required an evidentiary hearing because there is no conflict or dispute in the claimant\u2019s medical evidence. Based upon the specific facts before us and because employer\u2019s change in condition application raised a purely medical issue, we find that the \u201con the record\u201d hearing offered claimant an adequate opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">On February 5, 1992, the treating physician, Dr. Cantin, stated that claimant\u2019s knee examination was \u201centirely normal\u201d and he was capable of returning, not only to his pre-injury employment, but any other type of occupation. Dr. Cantin signed a job requirements summary indicating that claimant was capable of performing the duties of his regular employment with employer. Claimant did not see any other physician following his compensable, work-related injury of September 7, 1990 until March 24, 1992, and this occurred shortly after employer\u2019s February 21, 1992 application for review based upon a change in condition. Claimant saw Dr. Holden, and his report is the only evidence submitted by claimant to refute employer\u2019s medically based assertion that claimant was able to return to work. However, Dr. Holden\u2019s report did <em>not </em>raise a conflict in the medical evidence, nor did it find that claimant was unable to return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Moreover, despite claimant\u2019s contention in his April 15, 1992 statement to the deputy commissioner, that more than one physician had recommended surgery and another physician placed claimant in a leg brace, we find no evidence of such a medical diagnosis in the record. As stated in Commissioner O\u2019Neill\u2019s opinion, claimant\u2019s deposition of Dr. Cantin did not reveal any conflicting medical testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Upon deposition on May 27, 1992, Dr. Cantin stated the same opinion as reported above from his letter of February 5, 1992: [Claimant] was considered to be able to return to his pre-injury employment or to any other employment of his choosing. Dr. Cantin also stated that [claimant\u2019s] current chondromalacia of his knee is due to wear and tear . . . normal use and that when he last saw [claimant] on February 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>1992, \u2018I did not feel there was any further treatment necessary.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Furthermore, the commission did not make a decision until December 15, 1992, and claimant failed to supplement this record with updated reports from Dr. Holden or any other physician. Claimant\u2019s case involved a sole medical question of whether he was physically able to return to his pre-injury employment, and Dr. Holden\u2019s report failed to raise any conflict in the medical evidence. Employer\u2019s evidence, based upon Dr. Cantin\u2019s medical reports, is dispositive of the medical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We find no \u201cgenuine controversy\u201d in this case, and there' is no indication that an evidentiary hearing would have produced any additional medical evidence to refute employer\u2019s assertion that claimant was able to return to his pre-injury employment. Claimant has not submitted any medical evidence to challenge Dr. Cantin\u2019s opinion, the only treating physician after the injury. Dr. Cantin concluded, based upon a current examination, that claimant had the physical ability to resume his employment with employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure meets constitutional due process requirements, and due process is satisfied in this case by the opportunity to submit written evidence and argument. <em>See Pan American Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n, 322 </em>F.2d 999, 1004-05 (D.C. Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">We also reject claimant\u2019s argument that the \u201con the record\u201d hearing procedure prevented him from presenting a \u201cproper defense\u201d before the commission. The utilization of the \u201con the record\u201d procedure allowed both claimant and employer to submit evidence, engage in discovery, submit briefs, and file reply briefs. Over employer\u2019s procedural objections, the deputy commissioner extended the time period for the closing of the record and permitted claimant to take Dr. Cantin\u2019s deposition, thereby affording claimant the opportunity to cross-examine employer\u2019s only expert witness. In fact, claimant could have presented additional evidence through medical reports or depositions of other physicians, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">We find no error in the commission\u2019s procedure, nor in its final determination, because the \u201con the record\u201d hearing satisfied due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>process requirements and the record contains no conflicting medical evidence regarding claimant\u2019s work capacity to preclude the termination of compensation benefits. In light of the evidence before us, claimant received, \u201cat a meaningful time [and] in a meaningful manner,... a hearing appropriate to the nature of his case.\u201d <em>James, </em>226 Va. at 289-90, 307 S.E.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Barrow, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\"> Claimant\u2019s appellate brief does not mention this language; there is no physician\u2019s report in the record that confirms possible surgery or a leg brace, and claimant\u2019s attorney never mentioned such facts during oral argument before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b580-8\"> <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>262 (26th ed. 1985) defines \u201cchondromalacia\u201d as \u201csoftening of the articular cartilage, most frequently in the patella.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b581-9\"> In <em>Ledet </em>v. <em>Labor Pro.
