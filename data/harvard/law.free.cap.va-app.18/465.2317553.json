Rosenthal, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b474-8\">COLEMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acd\">In this criminal appeal, we hold that the language in Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) authorizing enhanced punishment \u201c[u]pon a second or subsequent conviction\u201d does not limit the number of convictions the Commonwealth may prove in order to establish that there has been a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Raymond Dotson was convicted by a jury for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) by knowingly distributing cocaine after having previously been convicted twice of cocaine distribution. At Dotson\u2019s trial, over his objection, Investigator Howell testified that Dotson had been arrested for distributing cocaine twice before and pled guilty to the two offenses. Dotson objected to the testimony and admission into evidence of two previous offenses, arguing under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), the Commonwealth is only required and may only prove one prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) provides that a defendant may receive an enhanced punishment for distributing a schedule I or II controlled substance \u201c[u]pon a <em>second or subsequent conviction </em>of such a violation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (emphasis added.) Even though the defendant \u201cis entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt concerning the statute\u2019s construction,\u201d <em>Harward </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 363, 365, 330 S.E.2d 89, 90 (1985), \u201cthe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always to be preferred to any curious, narrow, or strained construction,\u201d <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 456, 459, 309 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>The defendant contends that the words \u201cupon a second or subsequent conviction\u201d limit the Commonwealth to proving only one prior conviction. If the General Assembly had wished to limit the number of prior convictions to be considered by the jury under Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C), it could have done so expressly. <em>See Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 425, 428, 230 S.E.2d 236, 238 (1976). When the General Assembly uses different terms in the same section, each word is presumed to have a different meaning. <em>Klarfeld </em>v. <em>Salsbury, </em>233 Va. 277, 284-85, 355 S.E.2d 319, 323 (1987). By using the term \u201csecond or subsequent conviction,\u201d the General Assembly means something more than just a \u201csubsequent\u201d conviction. We believe the clear intent of the legislature is to enhance punishment by proving that there has been a second conviction, or if more than a \u201csecond,\u201d then such \u201csubsequent\u201d convictions as there have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">This Court has recently held that the language \u201ca third, or any subsequent offense\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) \u201caddresses not merely third offenses, but . . . [also] plainly recognizes offenses that are subsequent to the third.\u201d <em>Pittman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 33, 34, 434 S.E.2d 694, 695 (1993). In <em>Pittman, </em>we upheld the ruling that permitted the Commonwealth to prove all six of the defendant\u2019s prior offenses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Likewise, the language \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d \u201cplainly recognizes\u201d convictions that are subsequent to the first and second. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Pittman </em>rationale controls our decision here. The legislature intended to enhance the punishment in the same manner for a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction\u201d for multiple violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-248, the same as it did for enhancing punishment for \u201ca third, or any subsequent offense\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he general rule [of <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 176 S.E.2d 802 (1970)] that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible ... is subject to the exception that evidence of other crimes is properly received if it is relevant and probative of an issue on trial, such as . . . the required predicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>for enhanced punishment.\u201d <em>Pittman, </em>17 Va. App. at 35, 434 S.E.2d at 695. <em>See also Calfee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 253, 255, 208 S.E.2d 740, 741 (1974). Because the Commonwealth could not know which, if either, of the prior distribution convictions the jury might accept or might be challenged, \u201cit was entitled to utilize its entire arsenal\u201d to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 18.2-248(C). <em>See Pittman, </em>17 Va. App. at 35-36, 434 S.E.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err by admitting testimony that Dotson had been twice arrested and pled guilty to both charges of distributing cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Fitzpatrick, J., and Hodges, S.J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b474-11\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C) provides in full,</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Any person who violates this section with respect to a controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II shall upon conviction be imprisoned for not less than five nor more than forty years and fined not more than $500,000. Upon a second or subsequent conviction of such a violation, any such person may, in the discretion of the trial court or jury imposing the sentence, be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for any period not less than five years and be fined not more than $500,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) provides in pertinent part,</p>\n<p id=\"A9H\">\u201cAny person convicted of an offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-103 [concealing or taking possession of merchandise] . . . [upon] a third, or any subsequent offense, . . . shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> In order to minimize prejudice to the appellant, the trial court did not allow the Commonwealth to admit the appellant\u2019s conviction orders for the prior two offenses because they contained sentencing information. We do not need to address whether the admission of the orders would have been prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-9\"> Retired Judge William H.
