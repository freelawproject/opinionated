On the other hand, by their answer to the petition for such writ of mandate and injunction, Somo and Strauss, both generally and specifically, denied practically each and every issuable fact essential to the establishment of the asserted right of Goodway and Butler. In addition- thereto, by their affirmative answer to said petition for a writ of mandate, Somo and Strauss alleged that at another recently called and conducted meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, certain directors thereof were elected, who thereupon proceeded to and did regularly and legally reelect Somo the president, and Strauss the secretary, of said corporation; and that thereupon they accepted such respective offices and are now acting as such officers. It thus appears that Somo and Strauss are in office, at least as hold-overs, and that they claim that in due and legal form they have been re-elected to their respective office; while neither Goodway nor Butler ever has occupied either of said offices, but claims the right thereto by virtue of other elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">From time immemorial, as popularly expressed, \u201cpossession is nine points of the law\u201d. Although not in identical language, but as far as affects the instant litigation, that policy has been enacted into statutory law, as substantially set forth both in subdivision 6 of section 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in subdivision 6 of section 3423 of the Civil Code, wherein it is provided that \u201can injunction cannot be granted ... to prevent the exercise of a public or private office, in a lawful manner, by the person in possession\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In 32 Corpus Juris, at page 239, the rule, with appropriate citations affecting each of the different propositions there laid down, is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">\u201cIn the absence of special legislation, officers of a corporation will not be enjoined from acting as such within their chartered powers and in the exercise of discretion, for malfeasance in office or other reasons, even though they are only <em>de facto </em>officers, for the reason that there is an adequate remedy at - law by <em>quo warranto. </em>It is not the province of equity to decide the right to an office, although it may do so as an incident to matters otherwise within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>jurisdiction; and while there is some authority to the contrary, it has very generally been held that, where an injunction to prevent an officer from acting as such is really to test the validity of his election, it will be refused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is true that a decision contrary to the inhibitions contained in the statutes to which reference has been had may appear to have been made in the case of <em>Consumers Salt Co. </em>v. <em>Riggins, </em>208 Cal. 537 [282 Pac. 954], But on examination of the foundation for such ruling, it will be observed that the facts therein were \u201cnot in dispute\u201d; which situation does not obtain in the instant case. To the contrary, as hereinbefore has been indicated, practically every material fact upon which a decision of the rights of the respective parties to the instant litigation could be founded actually is in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">It is apparent that in the proceedings in the lower court a correct determination of the rights of the respective parties necessarily involves not only a decision of several important and essential questions of law, but as precedent thereto, and as a foundation therefor, likewise requires a conclusion as to each of many different issues of fact. In view of the fact that Somo and Strauss, petitioners herein, are mm in possession of the respective offices which are the subject of the controversy, together with the situation that practically every material fact upon which a gnal conclusion regarding the respective rights of the parties to the action depends is in dispute, it is thought that the statutory provisions to which attention has been directed are so clearly applicable and mandatory as to indicate a lack of jurisdiction in the lower court, in the absence of a trial or judicial hearing as to the issues involved, to enter its summary order by which the persons in <em>de facto </em>possession of the offices of the corporation effectually will be dispossessed thereof and their powers and emoluments, as such, if any, transferred to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">It is ordered that the demurrer interposed by the respondents to the petition herein be, and it is, overruled. It is further ordered that, preceding a hearing and determination by it of the issues of law and of fact presented by the proceedings in the lower court, the respondents Superior Court of the County of Los Angeles and the judge thereof, be, and each of them is, prohibited from making or issuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>or entering any order in the proceeding referred to herein by which Somo and Strauss, or either of them, will be restrained or prevented from exercising the duties of the respective offices of president and secretary of the said corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Conrey, P. J., and Tort, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
