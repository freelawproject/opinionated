J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ani\">Appellant, together with another, was informed against for the crime of robbery, and also with having suffered two prior felony convictions. He admitted one conviction, but denied the second and entered a plea of not guilty to the information charging robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">The issues were submitted to a jury who returned a verdict of guilty of robbery in the first degree and found it to be true that defendant had been previously convicted of the felony, namely, a violation of the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act, a felony, and that he had served a term of imprisonment therefor in the United States penitentiary at McNeil Island.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">From the judgment and from the order denying a motion for a new trial defendant appeals upon all the statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">No appearance has been made by defendant to support his appeal, nor has any brief been filed in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>behalf. We have, however, examined the record and transcript of the testimony, but can find no errors of any materiality therein. The defendant was fairly tried and legally convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The order and judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Thompson, J., and Plummer, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
