Bespondent court sentenced Oliver to a term of one year in the county jail. It is the contention of the district attorney that under the circumstances of the case, the court was without authority to impose a misdemeanor sentence, and that the punishment required to be imposed is by way of sentence to a term in the state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Apparently the respondent has been convinced that it was in error, for we have presented to us a stipulation that the peremptory writ of mandate may issue. On examination of the authorities\u2014particularly referring to Penal Code, sections 489 and 664, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>116 Cal. App. 412 [2 Pac. (2d) 843], and <em>Ex parte Hope, </em>59 Cal. 423\u2014we are satisfied that this court should approve the stipulation thus made.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Let the peremptory writ issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
