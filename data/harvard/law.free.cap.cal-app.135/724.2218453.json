The alleged criminal violation of the temporary code consists of charging seventy-five cents for cleaning a man\u2019s three-piece suit when the price for that work had been fixed at one dollar by a vote of the trade associations of Alameda County.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The statute in question contemplates that the commissioner of corporations shall approve all the provisions of the code, which approval is to be concurred in by the director of the department of industrial relations. There was no schedule of prices included in the code approved by the commissioner or director. There was, therefore, no violation of any of the provisions involved. Since the arrest of petitioner a code of fair competition which fixes the schedule has been approved under the act of Congress. From what we have said it follows that petitioner should be and he is discharged from custody and his bail exonerated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
