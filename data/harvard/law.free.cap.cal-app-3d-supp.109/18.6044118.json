The docket<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entry of July 6, 1979 recites: \u201cDefendant duly arraigned. Gives true name as charged. Complaint read and defendant advised of the nature of the charges, and advised of the following [constitutional rights]... continued to August 2, 1979 at 8:30 a.m., for plea. Copy of complaint and report to defendant.\u201d On August 2, the cause was called and continued for plea on defendant\u2019s motion to October 1, 1979. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 20\">*Supp. 20</page-number>October 1, defendant pleaded not guilty and the matter was set for a pretrial hearing on November 8, 1979, \u201cand a 1538.5 Penal Code motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">On November 1, 1979, defendant filed his \u201cNotice of Motion to Suppress.\u201d The motion was dated October 31, 1979. The hearing date for the motion was continued several times. The motion was heard and denied on February 25, 1980. Defendant filed his notice of appeal March 10, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The issue we face in this case is whether defendant may have a <em>pretrial </em>appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress under Penal Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 1538.5, subdivision (j). We hold that his motion was not timely made and therefore, under the provisions of section 1510, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Section 1510 reads as follows: \u201cThe denial of a motion made pursuant to Section 995 or 1538.5 may be reviewed prior to trial only if the motion was made by the defendant in the trial court not later than 45 days following defendant\u2019s arraignment on the complaint if a misdemeanor, or 60 days following defendant\u2019s arraignment on the information or indictment if a felony, unless within these time limits the defendant was unaware of the issue or had no opportunity to raise the issue.\u201d Defendant has made no assertion that he was unaware of the search and seizure issue advanced in his suppression motion or that he had no opportunity to raise that issue earlier than he did. Thus the exceptions provided in section 1510 do not apply to the facts of this case. The issue is when did the \u201c45 days following defendant\u2019s arraignment\u201d begin to run and did more than 45 days expire before defendant made his motion. Taking the latter matter first, we assume, for the purposes of this decision, that the earliest the defendant\u2019s motion was made was October 1, 1979, when the docket notation of a potential section 1538.5 motion was made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If defendant was arraigned, for section 1510 purposes, on July 6, 1979, 86 days elapsed before October 1. If, however, the time for making a section 1538.5 motion began to run from the date of entry of the plea, here October 1, 1979, less than 45 days had run at the time of noticing the motion (Oct. 1) or filing the motion (Nov. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 21\">*Supp. 21</page-number>No cases have been decided construing the word \u201carraignment\u201d in section 1510. Section 988 establishes the elements of an arraignment as follows: \u201cThe arraignment... consists in reading the accusatory pleading to the defendant and delivering to him a true copy thereof.. .and asking him whether he pleads guilty or not guilty.... \u201d The docket entry of July 6 states that defendant was \u201cduly arraigned\u201d and that the complaint was read and a copy was given to defendant. According to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, \u201cduly\u201d is synonymous with \u201cproper, regular, sufficient.\u201d In the absence of any other record, we hold that the defendant was asked how he pleaded on July 6, along with all the other elements of a proper arraignment. Thus the arraignment was complete on July 6 and the matter was continued for the next stage of the proceedings, entry of a demurrer or plea pursuant to section 1002 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The elements of an arraignment have been considered in the speedy trial context in cases construing section 1382. Those cases are somewhat in conflict as to whether the defendant needs to announce his plea before the arraignment is complete. <em>Chartuck </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 931 [123 Cal.Rptr. 816] holds that the arraignment is completed when defendant is asked for the plea, not when the plea is entered. <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1970) 14 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [92 Cal.Rptr. 479] holds to the contrary. <em>Chartuck </em>considered <em>Terry </em>(an appellate department decision) and declined to follow it. We are bound by <em>Chartuck. (Auto Equity Sales Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) A Court of Appeal decision, <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 112 [119 Cal.Rptr. 184] cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, but the point involved in our case is dicta in <em>Simpson. </em>At issue there was whether the time the case must be brought for trial began anew after transfer of a case to a different venue. That decision did not depend on when defendant was arraigned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">We can discern no reason to treat the elements of arraignment in section 1510 applications differently from section 1382 applications. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 22\">*Supp. 22</page-number>plain meaning of section 988 is that the arraignment stage is terminated when the defendant is asked whether he pleads guilty or not guilty. Defendant\u2019s arraignment was completed on July 6, 1979. His motion was made too late to entitle him to a pretrial appeal. However, our decision does not foreclose defendant, if he should be convicted, from asserting that his rights against unlawful search and seizure were violated, on an appeal from a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The appeal is dismissed as untimely made. The order to show cause is discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, P. J., and Fainer, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-12\"> A court reporter was present at each of the court proceedings referred to in this opinion. At the hearing of the order to show cause on May 22, 1980, we invited defendant to furnish us with transcripts of those proceedings but none have been supplied. Our opinion is based on the docket as the only available record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\"> All further section references are to sections of the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-8\"> This assumption runs in defendant\u2019s favor. Under <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 76 Cal.App.3d 731, 734 [143 Cal.Rptr. 109], the motion could be considered first made on November 1, 1979, when it was filed in the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> Two other cases discuss the issue of arraignment completion for section 1382 purposes. <em>Valdes </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 434 [138 Cal.Rptr. 50] noted the conflict in the cases but did not decide the issue as the record before that court showed defendant was never asked to plead and the matter had been continued for both arraignment and plea. <em>Hankla </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1972) 26 Cal.App.3d 342, 362, footnote 6 [102 Cal.Rptr. 896], sides with the <em>Chartuck </em>view, but in dicta. <em>(Chartuck </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d, at p. 935.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
