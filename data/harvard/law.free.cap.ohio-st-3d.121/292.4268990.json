The portion of the building and grounds that is the subject of the exemption was leased to and used by another entity, Portage Path Behavioral Health, which operates the Portage Path Community Health Center (\u201cPortage Path\u201d) at the site. Portage Path provides behavioral health services to the general public pursuant to a provider agreement with the Summit County Alcohol, Drug Addition, and Mental Health (\u201cADAMH\u201d) Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">{\u00b6 2} Exemption is sought for charitable use pursuant to R.C. 5709.12(B) and 5709.121 by virtue of the behavioral health services provided by Portage Path at the site. The Tax Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) denied exemption, ruling that Northeast cannot rely for an exemption on the charitable activities of Portage Path, because Northeast itself does not qualify as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d under R.C. 5709.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal to this court, Northeast renews its argument that four factors justify exempt status for the property: (1) Northeast\u2019s own status as a qualifying entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) Northeast\u2019s affiliation with Portage Path; (3) Portage Path\u2019s activities on the subject premises; and (4) Portage Path\u2019s ultimate enjoyment and use of any income generated by Northeast\u2019s activities. According to Northeast, these factors establish that Northeast qualifies as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d under R.C. 5709.121 and that, as a result, Northeast may rely on the lessee\u2019s own charitable activities to claim exemption for the premises. R.C. 5709.121(A)(1)(b). We disagree, and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">{\u00b64} Northeast\u2019s articles of incorporation establish the entity\u2019s nature as a nonprofit corporation organized to \u201ccarry out the purposes of any organization described in sections 501(c)(3) and 509(a)(1) or (2) of the Internal Revenue Code, as it now exists or is hereafter amended.\u201d More specifically, the corporate regulations set forth the purpose of Northeast: to \u201coperate in connection with and carry out the exempt purpose of Portage Path Community Mental Health Center.\u201d Its purpose includes \u201cpromoting] mental health by meeting a community need to concentrate the mental health resources of the region in order to increase and improve the diagnosis and treatment of emotional illness.\u201d Additional stated purposes include the training of mental health professions and research on mental illness. The articles and regulations contain typical provisions prohibiting private inurement of corporate assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 5} Portage Path furnishes behavioral health services to the public pursuant to a provider agreement with the Summit County ADAMH board. The agreement allows Portage Path to obtain reimbursement for services if it abides by various covenants. Among other things, the agreement states, \u201cNo person in need of service, who is otherwise eligible, shall be denied services based on that person\u2019s inability to pay for necessary services providing the agency adheres to the guidelines for the \u2018Ability to Pay Scale.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">{\u00b6 6} Organizationally, a majority of the 15 trustees who govern Northeast must be on the board of Portage Path. According to Jerome Kraker, the president of both Northeast and Portage Path, who testified at the BTA hearing, Northeast and its board of trustees \u201cexist to support Portage Path and mental health operations in Ohio.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">{\u00b6 7} Kraker offered testimony in support of the charitable status of Portage Path, testifying among other things that \u201cPortage Path provides behavioral health psychiatric services to the residents of Summit County who otherwise would not be able to afford such services.\u201d Those services include a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week emergency service, a \u201c24-7\u201d suicide hotline, and a partial hospitalization program. Patients do not pay the cost of care entirely out of pocket; Portage Path uses a sliding scale of fees based on financial-need criteria, with Summit County reimbursing most, but not all, unpaid costs. Another 35 percent of patients are covered by Medicare or Medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">{\u00b6 8} With respect to the use of the 5,700 square-foot building at issue, Kraker testified that as of 2003, some 68 percent of the space was used by Portage Path. Nine hundred eighty square feet were leased to a physician for his office, and another 582 square feet were leased to Lab Care, which performs much of its lab work for Portage Path patients by referral. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination characterizes Lab Care as for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>{\u00b6 9} As for rent, Portage Path was obligated to pay $5,500 per month, but in practice, Northeast would discount the rent to make sure Portage Path was not paying more than 68 percent of the cost of operating the building. In 2003, the private physician paid $17,425, and Lab Care paid $11,000. Those amounts were not subject to being discounted, and to the extent they exceeded building cost, the surplus would \u201cbenefit Portage Path Behavioral Health.\u201d Notably, Portage Path\u2019s rent was not discounted so that the total rent proceeds from all tenants would equal the building costs \u2014 in other words, Northeast retained any surplus generated by the sum of Portage Path\u2019s paying its costs and of the other tenants paying fixed amounts. Indeed, the financial statements for 2002 and 2003 showed that rent revenue exceeded building-associated costs for both years.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">{\u00b6 10} In addition to owning and leasing property, Northeast engaged as of the tax-lien date in providing psychiatric-staffing services, albeit from a different location. Those services supplied revenues of $932,446 for 2003 and $616,096 for 2002, offset by related expenses of $809,833 and $566,041 respectively. On cross-examination, Kraker admitted that furnishing psychiatric-staffing service and leasing property constituted \u201cprimary operations\u201d of Northeast at the relevant time. During the two years, expenses exceeded revenues by virtue of a \u201cLifescapes\u201d program, an off-site mental health clinic operated by Northeast. No testimony was offered on direct examination concerning the Lifescapes program.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\n<em>Northeast does not qualify as a charitable institution.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">{\u00b6 11} The central issue we confront is whether a nonprofit entity constitutes a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d under R.C. 5709.121 when it (1) enjoys Section 501(c)(3) status under the Internal Revenue Code and (2) is organized to hold and lease real property for use by another charitable institution. That question is crucial because the court has long held that under the general exemption for \u201cexclusive charitable use\u201d of property set forth at R.C. 5709.12(B), it is the <em>oumer\u2019s use </em>of the property, not a lessee\u2019s use, that determines whether the property should be exempted. See <em>First Baptist Church of Milford v. Wilkins, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 12-13, citing <em>Lincoln Mem. Hosp., Inc. v. Warren </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 109, 110, 42 O.O.2d 327, 235 N.E.2d 129. Under that principle, the property at issue plainly would not qualify for exemption, because Northeast is using that property for leasing, not for providing mental health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">{\u00b6 12} As a result Northeast must qualify, if at all, under R.C. 5709.121. That provision expanded the charitable-use exemption to encompass (among other situations) the situation in which an entity that qualifies as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d itself leases property to another charitable institution for charitable pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>poses. R.C. 5709.121(A)(1)(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>First Baptist Church, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 15, 16; <em>Community Health Professionals, Inc. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 432, 2007-Ohio-2336, 866 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 17, 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">{\u00b6 13} Logically, the first among Northeast\u2019s arguments is the contention that because Northeast has a federal certification as a 501(c)(3) organization, it should enjoy a legally conclusive presumption that it qualifies as a charitable institution under R.C. 5709.121, so long as it complies with its articles and bylaws. We do not consider this contention, because it is jurisdictionally barred. Northeast did not specify the failure to apply such a presumption as an error, either in its notice of appeal to the BTA or in its notice of appeal to the court. That omission is striking in light of the Tax Commissioner\u2019s explicit statement that \u201c[ajlthough organized as an IRC 501(c)(3) corporation there is no evidence in the record that shows that the applicant is a charitable entity.\u201d By not asserting as error the failure by the commissioner and the BTA to apply a presumption based on 501(c)(3) status, Northeast failed to create jurisdiction to obtain relief on that ground. See <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 23, 24; <em>Daytov-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">{\u00b6 14} Next, we address Northeast\u2019s contention that the totality of evidence in the record established its status as a \u201ccharitable institution\u201d as a matter of law. In this regard, the most significant precedent is our decision in <em>OCLC Online Computer Library Ctr., Inc. v. Kinney </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 198, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. In that case, we stated that the status of an institution as \u201ccharitable\u201d under R.C. 5709.121 depends upon the \u201ccharitable activities of the taxpayer seeking the exemption,\u201d not the \u201ccharitable nature of the institutional customers.\u201d Id. at 201, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. A clear corollary of that principle applies in this case, namely, an entity that leases property to another must establish its charitable status based on the range of <em>its own activities </em>and may not rely upon the activities of a particular lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the BTA reasonably and lawfully concluded that Northeast\u2019s own activities did not qualify it as a charitable institution for purposes of R.C. 5709.121. Northeast generates substantial revenue through leasing and through providing psychiatric-staffing services. Although Northeast ties Portage Path\u2019s rent to that entity\u2019s share of building maintenance costs, other tenants pay without regard to cost, including a for-profit physician\u2019s office and a laboratory-services provider. Additionally, in 2003, Northeast operated an off-site mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>health clinic, but no evidence was presented as to whether that clinic operated on a charitable basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 16} Northeast argues that its income-producing activities actually redound to the advantage of the charitable activities of Portage Path, which derives the ultimate economic benefit on account of its control of Northeast. It is true that Northeast operates on a nonprofit basis, and there is no evidence of private inurement of its earnings. But that fact alone does not establish charitable status. To be sure, we have held that charitable activities may generate incidental revenue and still qualify as charitable. <em>Community Health Professionals, Inc. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 432, 2007-Ohio-2336, 866 N.E.2d 478, \u00b6 23; <em>Girl Scouts-Great Trail Council v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 24, 2007-Ohio-972, 862 N.E.2d 493, \u00b6 17. But that does not mean, as Northeast appears to suggest, that all income-producing activities will qualify as charitable merely because their proceeds are applied to charitable purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 17} In this regard, Northeast\u2019s reliance on <em>Akron Golf Charities, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 11, 516 N.E.2d 222, is misplaced. The entity in that case existed in order to organize an annual golf outing that raised money for local charities. By contrast, Northeast engages in the ongoing business activities of leasing and providing staffing services \u2014 activities that generate substantial revenue and that have not been found in other cases to be charitable in character. See <em>Hubbard Press v. Tracy </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 564, 566, 621 N.E.2d 396 (printing envelopes for use by churches not in itself a charitable activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 18} The present case resembles <em>OCLC. </em>In that case, OCLC engaged in \u201cthe business of providing a computerized library network, the storing of library related bibliographical catalog data, and the selling or licensing the use of equipment necessary to gain access to such stored data or to communicate with member organizations having a contractual relationship to OCLC.\u201d <em>OCLC Online Computer Library Ctr., Inc. v. Kinney </em>(Oct. 11, 1983), BTA No. 81-D-602. As the BTA explained in <em>OCLC, </em>such continuous business activity is not charitable inasmuch as \u201c[t]here are many data processing corporations providing data storage capabilities for the benefit of its users.\u201d Id. We affirmed the decision of the BTA in <em>OCLC, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 198, 11 OBR 509, 464 N.E.2d 572. It is <em>OCLC, </em>not <em>Akron Golf Charities, </em>that applies to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 19} Northeast also seeks support from our decision in <em>Community Health Professionals, Inc. v. Levin, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 432, 2007-Ohio-2336, 866 N.E.2d 478, but that case is inapposite. In that case, the property owner, Community Health Professionals, did lease portions of the property to affiliated charitable institutions, but that activity was incidental to its main purpose: it \u201cprovide[d] skilled, in-home nursing care and hospice services to those in the community who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>approval and a care plan from a physician.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 3. By contrast, none of the services that Northeast provides has been shown to be charitable in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 20} The BTA reasonably and lawfully found that Northeast\u2019s activities were not charitable and properly concluded that Northeast was not entitled to an exemption under R.C. 5709.121.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>Portage Path\u2019s status as a chanty is not before the court.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 21} Under R.C. 5709.121(A)(1)(b), both the lessor and the lessee of real property must be charitable institutions. In his final determination, the commissioner found no evidence that Portage Path qualified as a charitable institution. At the BTA, Northeast presented evidence that Portage Path (1) provided its care pursuant to an ADAMH-board provider agreement, (2) did so on a sliding-scale basis, and (3) did so without regard to ability to pay. The BTA found that \u201cPortage Path is a charitable entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 22} The Tax Commissioner contends, as an alternative ground for affirmance, that the BTA lacked a factual record to support this finding. Because we affirm the BTA\u2019s determination that Northeast is not a charitable institution, and because that determination disposes of Northeast\u2019s exemption claim, we need not address the question whether the BTA correctly found that Portage Path itself qualifies as a charitable institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 23} We do note, however, that the commissioner\u2019s contention is jurisdiction-ally barred. In order to contest the finding, the Tax Commissioner needed to file a protective cross-appeal and assign the finding as an error of the BTA. <em>Polaris Amphitheater Concerts, Inc. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 330, 2008-Ohio-2454, 889 N.E.2d 103, \u00b6 13-15. As <em>Polaris </em>explains, \u201cOur cases do not permit us to rectify an alleged error of the BTA unless that error was set forth in a proper notice of appeal, even if the alleged error aggrieved the party only because of the success of another party\u2019s appeal.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14. Because the commissioner did not file a protective cross-appeal, the court has no jurisdiction to grant him relief on that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">{\u00b6 24} For all the foregoing reasons, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it affirmed the commissioner\u2019s denial of Northeast\u2019s exemption application. We therefore affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-13\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aeg\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-8\">. 2005 Am.Sub.H.B.

As a result, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 26} Property is exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.12 if it belongs to an institution, <em>charitable or otherwise, </em>and it is used by that institution exclusively for a charitable purpose. <em>True Christianity Evangelism v. Zaino </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 117, 118, 742 N.E.2d 638. R.C. 5709.121(A)(2) provides that the phrase \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d within R.C. 5709.12(B) includes property \u201cbelonging to a <em>charitable </em>* * * institution\u201d that \u201cis made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational, or public purposes and not with the view to profit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 27} The majority holds that the property in question is not exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.12(B) as \u201cproperty belonging to institutions that is used exclusively for charitable purposes\u201d or, under R.C. 5709.121(A), as \u201cproperty belonging to a charitable or educational institution\u201d that \u201cis made available under the direction or control of such institution * * * for use in furtherance of or incidental to its charitable, educational or public purposes and not with the view to a profit.\u201d In the first instance, the majority holds that Northeast \u201cis using the property for leasing, not for providing mental health care.\u201d In the second instance, the majority holds that Northeast is not a charitable institution, and therefore it cannot rely on the definition in R.C. 5709.121, which applies only to charitable institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">{\u00b6 28} I would hold that the property in question is exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.12 because it belongs in fact to Portage Path, which is a charitable institution, and it is used by Portage Path exclusively for a charitable purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. Chapter 340 of the Ohio Revised Code created Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health (\u201cADAMH\u201d) districts in Ohio to provide community-based mental-health care. R.C. 340.02. Each district contains an ADAMH board. Id. ADAMH boards are required to hire service providers to administer mental-health-care services. R.C. 340.03(A)(8)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 30} In Summit County, the ADAMH board contracted with Portage Path to provide \u201cbehavioral health psychiatric services\u201d to persons irrespective of whether they are able to pay for such care. Jerome T. Kraker, president of both Northeast and Portage Path, testified that the board of trustees determined that it would be financially advantageous for Portage Path to own its own treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>facility. However, Kraker testified that Portage Path\u2019s contract with ADAMH did not provide Portage Path with authority to purchase property. Thus, Portage Path created Northeast to acquire and hold property, which it leased back to Portage Path. Northeast is nothing more than a mechanism used to acquire property for Portage Path.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 31} Northeast\u2019s organizational documentation requires a majority of its board of trustees to be members of Portage Path\u2019s board of trustees. In fact, all of Northeast\u2019s trustees are trustees of Portage Path. Portage Path and Northeast also share the same president. Thus, Portage Path controls the actions of the Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 32} This evidence indicates that Northeast is merely an instrument created and controlled exclusively by Portage Path and used by Portage Path primarily to secure property for its treatment center. This structure is similar to that in <em>First Baptist Church of Milford v. Wilkins, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 496, 2006-Ohio-4966, 854 N.E.2d 494, in which a church sought a tax exemption for its print shop, which was used by a nonprofit corporation called Bearing Precious Seed-Milford, Inc. (\u201cBPS\u201d) to print Bibles. BPS and the church shared the same trustees, and testimony indicated that BPS was part of the church. Id. at \u00b6 28 (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting). In my dissent, I concluded that the nonprofit corporation was nothing more than an alter ego of the church, and therefore in determining whether the property was exempt from taxation, we should conclude that the church itself was the user of the print shop. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 33} Applying that logic in the instant case, I would hold that for purposes of R.C. 5709.12, the property in question in fact belongs to Portage Path, not Northeast. Thus, I believe that the first element required for an exemption under R.C. 5709.12 is satisfied because the property in question effectively belongs to Portage Path, which is a charitable institution, as determined by the BTA below.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b6 34} In order to be exempt from taxation, R.C. 5709.12 also requires that the property in question be \u201cused exclusively for charitable purposes.\u201d Pursuant to the \u201csplit listing\u201d application for exemption, the only property sought to be exempted was the property used by Portage Path for its treatment center. Portage Path uses the property as a treatment center to provide mental-healthcare services to those who could otherwise not afford such treatment. The BTA below held that these services were charitable in nature as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">{\u00b6 35} Therefore, I would find that the property in question belongs to a charitable institution, Portage Path, and that it is used by Portage Path exclusively for the charitable purpose of providing mental-health treatment for those who could not otherwise afford such treatment. Accordingly, I would hold that this property is exempt from taxation under R.C. 5709.12.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Vorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., and Mary C.

As Northeast states in its brief, \u201cCorporate structure should not obscure charitable purpose, nor create anomalies in exemptions.\u201d Funding for social services such as mental-health care for the underprivileged is scarce enough and is increasingly being cut during these tough economic times. Permitting the taxation of the property herein further deprives a charitable-care provider of funding to continue treatment, much of which is provided by the state through the ADAMH board in the first place. Peter is being robbed to pay Paul instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 37} Where the BTA has denied a tax exemption that is not consistent with legislative intent, the General Assembly has acted to correct such decisions. For example, in <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Limbach </em>(June 26, 1992), BTA No. 86-H-566, 1992 WL 153126, *14, the BTA denied a propex\u201cty-tax exemption to the American Chemical Society, a nonprofit professional association. In 1993, the General Assembly amended R.C. 5709.12 to establish that associations like those in <em>Limbach </em>were \u201cconclusively presumed\u201d to be charitable or educational institutioxxs. See 144 Ohio Laws, Pax-t IV, 6487, 6491. Similarly, if the majority has misconstrued the General Assembly\u2019s intent in denying a tax exemption in the instant case, a legislative fix may be needed here as well. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
