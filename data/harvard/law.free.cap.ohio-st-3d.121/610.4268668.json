In July 2007, respondent was convicted of felony theft, and his license to practice law has been under suspension since October 23, 2007, pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(4). See <em>In re Parrish, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 1434, 2007-Ohio-5636, 875 N.E.2d 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association, charged respondent with numerous violations of the Disciplinary Rules in a 12-count amended complaint. A panel appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the case, including the parties\u2019 extensive stipulations and respondent\u2019s testimony, made findings of misconduct, and recommended respondent\u2019s permanent disbarment. The board accepted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendation. Respondent has not objected to the board\u2019s report and recommendation. We accept the recommendation of permanent disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">{\u00b6 3} The amended complaint comprised 12 counts pertaining to respondent\u2019s conduct in two matters: (1) the Father Vincent O\u2019Dea trust and (2) the John and Debra Sabo litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">\n<em>The Father Vincent ODea Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">{\u00b6 4} In May 2002, Father Vincent O\u2019Dea hired respondent to represent him in trust and estate matters. Father O\u2019Dea had already established an inter vivos trust to provide funds for certain charitable organizations, and he directed respondent to prepare a power of attorney naming Father James Ragnoni as Father O\u2019Dea\u2019s agent. Following Father O\u2019Dea\u2019s death in September 2002, Father Ragnoni, acting as trustee, retained respondent as attorney for the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>and the trust. At the time of Father O\u2019Dea\u2019s death, the trust contained over $1.3 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">{\u00b6 5} On March 5, 2004, Father Ragnoni signed a \u201cLetter of Authority,\u201d prepared by respondent, authorizing the establishment of \u201ca trust account in the name of \u2018The Father Vincent O\u2019Dea Trust Account\u2019 * * * listing] as signatories [Father Ragnoni] and attorney Parrish.\u201d Listing himself as trustee, respondent then opened a new account (titled \u201cFather Vincent O\u2019Dea Trust\u201d) into which the existing trust funds were transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">{\u00b6 6} On March 9, 2004, less than one week after receiving signatory authority on the trust account, respondent wrote himself a check for $6,000. This was the first of 15 checks on the account that were signed by and made payable to \u201cJ. Peter Parrish,\u201d eventually totaling $96,685. Respondent also electronically transferred $50,000 from the Father Vincent O\u2019Dea Trust to his business account in November 2004 and $25,436.85 from the trust to his own attorney trust account in August 2005. Eventually, respondent withdrew more than $172,000, not to pay for legal fees or other work for the trust, but \u2014 as he explained \u2014 \u201cto maintain [the] illusion\u201d that he \u201cwas still a successful sole practitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 7} On January 29, 2006, unaware of the misappropriation, Father Ragnoni discharged respondent as trust counsel, replaced him with Joyce Salisbury, and requested return of the file. Respondent, however, did not return the file. Throughout the next month and a half, attorney Salisbury repeatedly asked respondent to return the trust-fund file, to no avail. On March 9, 2006, Salisbury filed a complaint for concealment in probate court. In response, respondent informed Salisbury that he would deliver the file on March 13; Salisbury explained that if he did not, she would file a grievance with relator. Respondent did not return the file on March 13, and Salisbury filed a grievance on March 15. Salisbury eventually determined that at least $172,000 had been misappropriated from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">{\u00b6 8} On July 31, 2007, respondent pleaded guilty to third-degree felony theft, was sentenced to a four-year suspended sentence with a 20-day jail term and was ordered to pay $250,000 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">{\u00b6 9} During his representation of Father O\u2019Dea and the trust, respondent did not carry professional-liability insurance. He informed neither Father O\u2019Dea nor Father Ragnoni of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">\n<em>The John and Debra Sabo Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">{\u00b6 10} In October 2000, John and Debra Sabo hired respondent to defend them in a dispute with a contractor. In May 2001, the contractor filed to foreclose under a mechanic\u2019s lien on the Sabos\u2019 property, and respondent filed an answer and counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>{\u00b6 11} As the representation continued, however, respondent neglected the Sabos\u2019 case in at least three situations. First, respondent did not respond to the contractor\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and default judgment was entered on the validity of the lien. Second, after a motion to compel discovery was granted and the Sabos timely provided discovery responses to respondent, respondent did not provide them to opposing counsel. Finally, after receiving at least five continuances from May 2005 to April 2006, respondent failed to appear for a June 2006 pretrial conference, and his absence resulted in dismissal of his clients\u2019 counterclaim for failure to prosecute. Respondent did not inform the Sabos of his failure to appear or of the dismissal of their counterclaim. In August 2006, the Sabos discharged respondent and retained new counsel, who filed a motion for relief from judgment or reconsideration. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">{\u00b6 12} During his representation of the Sabos, respondent did not carry professional-liability insurance. He did not inform the Sabos of this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">{\u00b6 13} Based on the parties\u2019 stipulations and respondent\u2019s testimony at the hearing, the board found clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), 1-104(A) (a lawyer shall inform a client if the lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance), 2-106(A) (a lawyer shall not charge an illegal or clearly excessive fee), 6-101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him), 7-101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not intentionally prejudice or damage his client), and 9-102(B)(4) (a lawyer shall promptly pay or deliver funds or property to the client). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 14} In determining the recommended sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the panel and board reviewed the aggravating and mitigating features of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 15} Adopting the panel report and recommendation, the board found four of the nine aggravating factors set forth in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1). The board found that respondent had acted with a dishonest or selfish motive in misappropriating over $172,000 from the O\u2019Dea trust and that he had misappropriated funds repeatedly over a 22-month period. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), and (d). The board also found that the victims of the misconduct were vulnerable and had been harmed by respondent\u2019s misconduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aa-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Jones Day, John Q. Lewis, and William Warren, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AH-\">James Sammon, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">{\u00b6 16} The board found two factors in mitigation: absence of a prior disciplinary record and a cooperative attitude toward the disciplinary proceedings. BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d). The board rejected respondent\u2019s contention that he had acted under a mental disability, see BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g), and this .finding has not been challenged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">{\u00b6 17} Relator advocated respondent\u2019s disbarment. Concluding that \u201cthe harm Respondent caused greatly outweighs the mitigation he presented,\u201d the board adopted the recommendation to disbar.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 18} We accept the findings of the board and adopt its recommendation to disbar respondent. To maintain the illusion that he had a successful legal practice, respondent misappropriated over $172,000, money that his client had intended to serve charitable purposes. The thefts began less than a week after securing signatory authority on the trust and continued for almost two years. Respondent harmed other clients through his continued neglect of their case, leading to the entry of a default judgment on an important issue, as well as the dismissal of their counterclaim. In neither case did respondent maintain professional-liability insurance or inform his clients that he did not. The presumptive disciplinary measure for respondent\u2019s conduct is disbarment, and this sanction is appropriate here. See, e.g., <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Jones, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 46, 2006-Ohio-6367, 857 N.E.2d 1221, \u00b6 22; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Wherry </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 584, 587, 722 N.E.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 19} Respondent is therefore permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b747-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
