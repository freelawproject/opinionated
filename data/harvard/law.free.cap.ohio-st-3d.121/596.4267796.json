Lewis of Hinckley, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0073002, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 2000. In April 2008, relator, Medina County Bar Association, filed a complaint against respondent alleging that he had forged a judge\u2019s signature on a previously time-stamped judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent stipulated to the facts and violations set forth in the complaint, namely Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(b) (prohibiting illegal conduct adversely reflecting on a lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness), 8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h) (prohibiting conduct adversely reflecting on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the matter on September 27, 2008, and recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be suspended for one year. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law but not its recommendation, advocating instead a two-year suspension. Respondent filed objections to the board\u2019s report, urging a six-month suspension with all six months stayed. The appropriate sanction to be imposed is the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">{\u00b6 3} Respondent was retained by Danielle Burkhard in 2007 to represent her before the Berea Municipal Court on traffic charges. Of vital importance to Burkhard was the retention of occupational driving privileges. Although the court had a standard form, motions and entries drafted by an attorney were usually accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent drafted his own motion and judgment entry for driving privileges in Burkhard\u2019s case and presented several copies to a court deputy clerk on May 21, 2007. According to respondent, the clerk began to time-stamp the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>documents, but then handed them back and told respondent to use the standard forms instead. Respondent scheduled a hearing for Burkhard and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">{\u00b6 5} On May 25, respondent and Burkhard attended a pretrial. According to respondent, after the pretrial, Burkhard asked about the process of receiving driving privileges. He claims that Burkhard asked, \u201cWhat does the driving privileges look like?\u201d Respondent admits that he answered her by pulling out the rejected time-stamped judgment entry from four days earlier and, in Burk-hard\u2019s presence, signing the judge\u2019s name to it and giving it to her. Respondent then let Burkhard leave with the document and did not \u201ceven think twice about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 6} Burkhard later met with her probation officer and discussed driving privileges. Burkhard gave the officer the judgment entry with the judge\u2019s forged signature. The probation officer apparently recognized the signature as a forgery and informed the Berea Municipal Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 7} At the panel hearing, respondent could offer no explanation for his actions. He testified, however, that it was never his intent to make Burkhard believe that she had driving privileges at that time. He attributed his behavior to a \u201cserious lapse of judgment\u201d and expressed shame and remorse for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 8} In urging a shorter, stayed suspension, respondent emphasized (1) his full cooperation with the disciplinary process, (2) his lack of any prior disciplinary offenses, (3) the absence of any pattern of misconduct, (4) the admission and recognition of the wrongfulness of his acts, (5) the lack of client harm, and (6) his good reputation in the community. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d) 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (d), and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent insisted that his actions lacked a selfish or dishonest motive. He produced an affidavit from Raymond J. Wohl, clerk of courts for Berea Municipal Court, who stated, \u201cDriving privileges are routinely granted in OVI cases, such as Ms. Burkhard\u2019s.\u201d Respondent argues that the forged instrument did not advance Burkhard\u2019s desire for driving privileges. Respondent did not present Burkhard\u2019s testimony to corroborate his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">{\u00b6 10} The panel unanimously found that respondent \u201cwas not truthful on the witness stand when he testified that the only reason he forged the Judge\u2019s signature was because his client wanted to see what a Judgment Entry granting occupational driving privileges would look like. This explanation is simply not believable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">{\u00b6 11} The board deferred to the panel\u2019s credibility determination, as do we. Respondent\u2019s lack of credibility coupled with the seriousness of the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>persuades us that an actual rather than a stayed suspension is warranted, and we accept the panel\u2019s recommended sanction. Respondent, in the presence of his client, forged a judge\u2019s signature on a time-stamped judgment entry and then gave it to the client. In doing so, moreover, respondent, in his own words, did not \u201cthink twice about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for one year. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b732-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b732-8\">Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b732-9\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYfk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">{\u00b6 13} The majority suspends Lewis from practicing law for one year because of the seriousness of his signing a judge\u2019s name to an entry without permission and because the majority did not find credible his explanation for the conduct. Because I find Lewis\u2019s explanation credible, I believe that a lesser sanction is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">{\u00b6 14} While our usual practice is to defer to a panel on judging credibility, \u201c[w]e are the ultimate arbiters in disciplinary proceedings.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Powers, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 473, 2008-Ohio-4785, 895 N.E.2d 172, \u00b6 21. It is undisputed that Lewis scrawled a signature on the judge\u2019s signature line of an entry without the judge\u2019s permission and that doing so was a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, I believe Lewis\u2019s assertion that he never intended to pass off the entry as genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">{\u00b6 15} Neither Lewis nor the bar association called Lewis\u2019s client as a witness at his disciplinary hearing. Lewis testified as follows: At a pretrial hearing on her traffic charges, Lewis\u2019s client asked him whether she had driving privileges; he informed her that she did <em>not </em>have such privileges. Because his client wanted to see what a document granting driving privileges looked like, Lewis retrieved the proposed driving entry that had been rejected by the clerk\u2019s office, scrawled a signature on it, and said, \u201cThis is what a driving privileges entry would look like if you had that.\u201d He then gave her the entry. While he later recognized that signing the document was a \u201cserious lapse of judgment,\u201d Lewis maintained that he never intended his client to believe that the entry was valid and provided her temporary driving privileges. While this explanation, on its face, appears questionable, I believe that the evidence supports Lewis\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">{\u00b6 16} Even after signing the entry, Lewis arranged hearings, scheduled on several different dates, for the purpose of seeking temporary driving privileges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>for his client. Ultimately, these hearing dates were canceled at the client\u2019s request, and a plea was reached before the issue of temporary driving privileges was resolved. Had Lewis considered the entry valid, there would have been no need for these hearings.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1K\">John C. Oberholtzer, John Crilly, and Kelly O\u2019Kell, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Av8a\">Crabbe, Brown &amp; James, L.L.P., Larry H. James, and Christina L. Corl, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 17} The signature on the entry bore no resemblance to the judge\u2019s actual signature, as evidenced by the fact that Lewis\u2019s client\u2019s probation officer brought the entry to the attention of municipal court clerk, who launched an investigation that determined the signature not to be genuine. Even the attorney questioning Lewis at the disciplinary hearing stated, \u201cWhen I look at that entry and I see something on it, that appears to be scratching.\u201d Had Lewis intended the entry to seem authentic, he certainly would have taken more care to accurately depict the judge\u2019s signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">{\u00b6 18} Moreover, Lewis never attempted to file the entry or pass it off as genuine. It was his client who presented it to her probation officer, despite having been told by Lewis that she did not have driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, because the municipal court involved herein routinely grants temporary driving privileges to first-time drunk-driving offenders, Lewis had nothing to gain by forging the entry, but had everything to lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 20} I believe that these facts corroborate Lewis\u2019s testimony that signing the entry was only to show his client what an entry granting driving privileges looked like; it was not intended to make anyone believe that the entry was genuine. Thus, while signing the entry for any reason was still an incredibly foolish act and a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, I believe that it was not done with the intent to benefit his client or to defraud the judge or the judicial system. Because of these facts, and because this is Lewis\u2019s first disciplinary violation, I would impose a stayed one-year suspension of Lewis\u2019s license to practice law. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b733-9\">Lanzinger, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
