Baumgartner\u2019s bail was revoked when she violated a condition by filing a lawsuit in a federal district court without the express written permission of the common pleas court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-15\">{\u00b6 2} Baumgartner claims that the court of appeals erred in dismissing her petition because habeas corpus is the proper vehicle to challenge excessive bail after a judgment of conviction and because one of the conditions of bail \u2014 that she file no lawsuit in any court against any public official without the express written permission of the common pleas court judge \u2014 -was excessive. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Pirman v. Money </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 591, 594, 635 N.E.2d 26; <em>Mayer v. Bristow </em>(2000), 91 Ohio St.3d 3, 19-20, 740 N.E.2d 656 (no authority \u201cpurports to authorize a single state common pleas court to control the processes of every state and federal court throughout the United States\u201d); <em>Ex Parte Hull </em>(1941), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>312 U.S. 546, 549, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (\u201cthe state and its officers may not abridge or impair petitioner\u2019s right to apply to a federal court\u201d).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMq\">Sandra J. Finucane, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AAT\">Richard Cordray, Attorney General, and Jerri L. Fosnaught, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 3} Even if her claim had merit, dismissal was still warranted. Baumgartner was declared a vexatious litigator in 2004. See http://www.supremecourt.ohio. gov./Clerk/vexatious. Thus, she could not \u201cinstitute legal proceedings in a court of appeals * * * without first obtaining leave of the court of appeals to proceed\u201d in accordance with the vexatious-litigator statute. R.C. 2323.52(D)(3). She did not obtain leave of the court of appeals to proceed before she filed her habeas corpus petition. Once Baumgartner apprised the court of appeals of her status as a vexatious litigator, the court should have dismissed the cause without addressing the merits of her habeas corpus claim. See R.C. 2323.52(1); <em>State ex rel. Sapp v. Franklin Cty. Court of Appeals, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 368, 2008-Ohio-2637, 889 N.E.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Although the court of appeals did not rely on this rationale to dismiss the petition, we will not reverse a correct judgment even if some or all of the lower court\u2019s rationale was erroneous. <em>Goudlock v. Voorhies, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 398, 2008-Ohio-4787, 894 N.E.2d 692, \u00b6 12.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b491-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b491-10\">Lanzinger, J., not participating.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-13\">.
