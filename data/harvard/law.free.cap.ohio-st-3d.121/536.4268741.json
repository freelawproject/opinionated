Hughley \u201chas or had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law, e.g., appeal and postconviction relief, for review of any alleged sentencing error.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jaffal v. Calabrese, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 440, 2005-Ohio-2591, 828 N.E.2d 107, \u00b6 5. In fact, Hughley was ultimately successful in raising this claim in his direct appeal from these convictions. See <em>State v. Hughley, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 90323, 2008-Ohio-6146, 2008 WL 5049965, \u00b6 37-41. Insofar as Hughley appears to claim that he is entitled to be released from prison, habeas corpus, instead of mandamus, is the appropriate action. <em>State ex rel. Gordon v.
