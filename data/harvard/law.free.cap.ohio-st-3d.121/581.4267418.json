For the reasons that follow, we hold that the question of the admissibility of the statements under Evid.R. 807 does not require a prior determination of the child\u2019s competence to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">{\u00b6 2} During Memorial Day weekend in 2006, appellant Doron Silverman and his family<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> visited his parents and sister Batya Silverman in Indianapolis. After dinner, Batya went back to her apartment with Silverman\u2019s four-year-old son, M.S., who stayed the night with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">{\u00b6 3} Batya and M.S. spent the next day at the apartment complex\u2019s swimming pool. After going back to her apartment, Batya decided to bathe M.S. to wash off the chlorine from the pool. Batya, whom M.S. called \u201cPoti,\u201d was undressing M.S. when he pulled on his penis, pointed to it, and said to her, \u201cPoti, put your mouth on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">{\u00b6 4} Batya was shocked by this statement because it was the first time M.S. had ever said anything like that to her. She asked her boyfriend, Joe Farber, to come in and hear what M.S. had said. Farber first asked M.S., to no avail, why he said that to Batya. He then questioned M.S. whether he had ever seen that in a movie; M.S. answered no. M.S. also said no when Farber inquired whether he had ever seen his parents do that. Finally, when Farber asked where M.S. learned it, M.S. responded, \u201cDaddy did it. No more talk.\u201d With that, Batya and Farber decided not to pressure M.S. any more at that time, and they finished up the bath.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">{\u00b6 5} Silverman and his wife came over to Batya\u2019s that night, but M.S.\u2019s earlier comment was not mentioned. M.S. again stayed the night at Batya\u2019s, and the next day Farber and Batya asked M.S. if he remembered what he had told them in the bathroom the previous day. M.S. said that he did, and they asked M.S. again if he had learned it from watching a movie or his parents, to which M.S. replied that his daddy had done it. When asked if he did it to his father too, M.S. said yes. Batya explored this line of questioning, and when she asked M.S. if he had kissed his father\u2019s penis, he answered, \u201cNo, I lick it.\u201d M.S. further indicated that Silverman was the only person who did this to him, that it was a secret, and that he did not want to talk any more because he would get in trouble. By the end of the conversation, M.S., who had been coloring, was stabbing the paper with his pen and shaking his clenched fists.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">{\u00b6 6} Batya\u2019s mother then arrived unannounced at Batya\u2019s apartment. Batya relayed to her what M.S. had said. They left M.S. with Farber and another friend of Batya\u2019s and went back to Batya\u2019s parents\u2019 house. When Silverman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>arrived, Batya told him about M.S.\u2019s comments. Silverman did not respond to this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">{\u00b6 7} After further conversation, the family decided not to call the police and that M.S. and his sister would remain in Indiana for several days while Silverman received help. However, Batya learned about a week later that the children had been returned to Silverman\u2019s care, which was sooner than the family had originally planned. Soon thereafter, she contacted the Montgomery County children services agency and the West Carrollton police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">{\u00b6 8} The police interviewed Silverman and his wife on June 13. During the interview, Silverman explained that because his wife was a stay-at-home mother, his only responsibility with the children was to bathe them. He told the detective that when he would get home from working at Chuck E. Cheese, he would take off his clothes and put on a robe \u2014 sometimes tying it, sometimes not. He and the kids would then take a bath together, and Silverman claimed that M.S. would climb over him like a \u201cjungle gym.\u201d On one occasion, Silverman claimed that M.S. pulled on Silverman\u2019s penis in the bath, and Silverman responded by pulling on M.S.\u2019s. Silverman also told the detective that one time when M.S. was climbing on him, M.S. bit Silverman\u2019s penis while it was erect. When asked how many times Silverman had his mouth on M.S.\u2019s genitals, Silverman said two or three times for about a second each time. When the interview was over, Silverman agreed to write down a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">{\u00b6 9} On July 21, 2006, the Montgomery County Grand Jury returned a three-count indictment against Silverman for rape and gross sexual imposition. Prior to the indictment, however, Silverman\u2019s wife set fire to their residence. M.S. and K.S. were killed in the fire.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">{\u00b6 10} Because of M.S.\u2019s death, the state moved to declare M.S. unavailable for trial and to admit into evidence the statements that he had made to Batya and Farber. After conducting a hearing pursuant to Evid.R. 807, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion and held that M.S.\u2019s statements were admissible. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on only the gross-sexual-imposition charge. Silverman was sentenced to five years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">{\u00b6 11} Silverman appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals, arguing that the trial court erred by admitting M.S.\u2019s statement. Relying upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Said </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 473, 644 N.E.2d 337, the appellate court reversed and overturned the conviction. <em>State v. Silverman, </em>176 Ohio App.3d 12, 2008-Ohio-618, 889 N.E.2d 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>{\u00b6 12} We accepted juiisdiction over the state\u2019s appeal. <em>State v. Silverman, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 1505, 2008-Ohio-3369, 889 N.E.2d 1024. The state how asks us to overrule <em>Said </em>in its entirety or, in the alternative, to limit its holding. Barring that, the state urges us to find that a child\u2019s competence can be established through extrinsic evidence. Because we find that admissibility under Evid.R. 807 is not dependent on the child\u2019s competence, we need not determine if competence can be established by extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">{\u00b6 13} We begin our analysis by examining Evid.R. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">{\u00b6 14} The rule provides an exception to the general exclusion of hearsay statements when a child under the age of 12 at the time of trial or hearing makes an out-of-court statement describing any sexual act that is performed on, with, or by the child. Evid.R. 807(A). For the statement to be admitted, the proponent of the statement must not be able to reasonably obtain the child\u2019s testimony. Evid.R. 807(A)(2). It is axiomatic that the testimony is not reasonably obtainable when the child is deceased at the time of trial or hearing. See Evid.R. 807(B)(3)(a). Notably absent from the rule is any requirement that the child declarant be determined to be competent to testify before the statement is admitted. See <em>Said, </em>71 Ohio St.3d at 480, 644 N.E.2d 337 (Resnick, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cA competency hearing simply is not required by the plain terms of Evid.R. 807(A)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Said, </em>we were confronted primarily with the trial court\u2019s failure to record the hearing determining the competence of a five-year-old witness. The majority held that the failure to record the hearing was reversible error. Id., 71 Ohio St.3d at 475, 644 N.E.2d 337. Having found error, the majority should have stopped there. However, the majority sweepingly declared, without any authority, that \u201cEvid.R. 807 clearly does not dispose of the need to find a child competent.\u201d Id. at 476, 644 N.E.2d 337. Thus, in order to admit a child\u2019s statement under Evid.R. 807 after <em>Said, </em>a trial court is required to find that the child was competent at the time he made the out-of-court statement. Id. at 477, 644 N.E.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">{\u00b6 16} The dissent in <em>Said </em>foresaw the problems with the majority\u2019s rationale and noted that the competence requirement established by the majority \u201cexceeded] the boundaries of Evid.R. 807.\u201d Id., 71 Ohio St.3d at 479, 644 N.E.2d 337. It recognized that \u201c[t]he effect of instituting the majority\u2019s position * * * will be to preclude the admission of otherwise qualified out-of-court statements into evidence. For example, in those situations where the abused victim falls into a coma or dies at some point after making statements to a parent or therapist concerning the source of his or her abuse, the statements would not be admissible, given the child\u2019s inability to attend a competency hearing. That result surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>defeats the obvious purpose for which Evid.R. 807 was adopted.\u201d Id. at 480, 644 N.E.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">{\u00b6 17} The prescience of the dissent was borne out in <em>State v. Meadows </em>(Feb. 12, 2001), 4th Dist. No. 99CA2651, 2001 WL 803822. In that case, a jury convicted the defendant of murdering his three-year-old daughter. The state introduced testimony from several witnesses relating comments made to them by the daughter that the defendant had abused her. The defendant argued that the testimony was not admissible because the state-had failed to satisfy the requirements of Evid.R. 807 and the trial court had not determined whether the daughter was competent under Evid.R. 601 at the time she made her remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">{\u00b6 18} The court of appeals rejected that argument, finding that <em>\u201cSaid </em>* * * exclude[d] hearsay statements that Evid.R. 807 plainly contemplates are admissible.\u201d Id. at *9. It therefore distinguished <em>Said </em>on the basis of the child\u2019s death, finding that in this \u201csituation, the reasoning of the <em>Said </em>Court deviates from the clear provisions of Evid.R. 807.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">{\u00b6 19} The distinction that the Fourth District Court of Appeals drew in an attempt to evade <em>Said </em>is artificial and does not withstand close scrutiny in light of Said\u2019s far-reaching holding. In <em>Said, </em>this court held in no uncertain terms that a competence hearing was required for the statements to be admissible under Evid.R. 807. It left no room for exceptions. If, in the case sub judice, we were to draw a distinction based on the child\u2019s death, we would leave room to question whether <em>Said </em>continues to apply to children who are unavailable due to an infirmity or other medical condition, like a coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">{\u00b6 20} We now hold that the better approach is to return to the plain text of Evid.R. 807. The rule says absolutely nothing about a child declarant\u2019s competence. Despite the fact that the text of the rule lacks this requirement, <em>Said </em>imposed a judicially created rule that contravenes both the language and intent of Evid.R. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">{\u00b6 21} The Supreme Court of Washington recently confronted the same problem we do today. In <em>State v. C.J. </em>(2003), 148 Wash.2d 672, 63 P.3d 765, the court examined the relationship between its competence and child-hearsay-exception statutes. In doing so, the court implicitly overruled its prior decision in <em>State v. Ryan </em>(1984), 103 Wash.2d 165, 691 P.2d 197. See <em>C.J., </em>148 Wash.2d at 694, 63 P.3d 765 (Sanders, J., dissenting). In <em>Ryan, </em>the court had held that a \u201cdeclarant\u2019s competency is a precondition to admission of his hearsay statements.\u201d Id., 103 Wash.2d at 173, 691 P.2d 197. In reaching this conclusion, <em>Ryan </em>relied on the same authority as this court did in <em>Said </em>\u2014 5 Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.1974) 255, Section 1424.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">{\u00b6 22} In contrast, the court in <em>C.J. </em>found that the prerequisites of Washington\u2019s child-hearsay-exception statute, Wash.Rev.Code 9A.44.120, like Evid.R. 807, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>do not contain \u201cany requirement that a declarant * * * be shown to have possessed testimonial competency at the time of the out of court statement.\u201d Id., 148 Wash.2d at 683, 63 P.3d 765. That state\u2019s Supreme Court determined that if the Washington legislature had intended the child to be competent when making the out-of-court statement, it would have included such language in the statute. Id. at 684, 63 P.3d 765. Furthermore, the court reasoned that a finding of incompetence \u201cdoes not make the hearsay statements unreliable.\u201d Id. at 685, 63 P.3d 765. Therefore, so long as the child\u2019s out-of-court statement satisfies Wash.Rev.Code 9A.44.120\u2019s requirements of reliability and corroboration, the statement is admissible if the child is unavailable. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 23} Likewise, the Supreme Court of Colorado has recognized that there is a \u201cflawed assumption that a determination of incompetency at the time of the hearing invariably establishes that the child\u2019s statement was not reliable.\u201d <em>People v. Dist. Court of El Paso Cty. </em>(Colo.1989), 776 P.2d 1083, 1088.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue before the court was whether the trial court properly excluded a four-year-old victim\u2019s hearsay statements regarding her father\u2019s alleged sexual abuse after determining that she was incompetent to testify as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 24} As does the Washington statute previously discussed and Evid.R. 807, Colo.Rev.Stat. 13-25-129 contains an exception from the hearsay exclusion for statements made by a child who has been abused. Under the Colorado law, the child\u2019s out-of-court statement is admissible, when the child is unavailable to testify, if \u201c[t]he [trial] court finds in a hearing * * * that the time, content, and circumstances of the statement provide sufficient safeguards of reliability.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. 13-25-129(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 25} The court in <em>El Paso </em>distinguished the purpose of a hearing on competence, which \u201cdetermines only whether a child can accurately recollect and narrate at trial the events of abuse,\u201d id., 776 P.2d at 1087, from the purpose of the hearsay-exception statute, which permits admission of the statement, without the need to determine competence, when the trial court determines that the \u201cstatement is supported by sufficient safeguards of reliability under [Colo.Rev.Stat.] 13 \u2014 25\u2014129(l)(a).\u201d Id. at 1088. Thus, as long as the child\u2019s statement satisfied those safeguards, it was admissible regardless of competence. Id. at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 26} The plain text of Evid.R. 807, the cogent dissent in <em>Said, </em>and the reasoning of <em>C.J. </em>and <em>El Paso </em>provide compelling reasons to find that the dicta in <em>Said </em>that judicially grafted the competence requirement onto Evid.R. 807 is improper and does not effectuate the rule. Even a cursory look at Evid.R. 807 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>illustrates the high threshold a movant must meet for the statement to be admitted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">{\u00b6 27} First, the court must consider a host of factors \u201csurrounding the making of the statement, including but not limited to spontaneity, the internal consistency of the statement, the mental state of the child, the child\u2019s motive or lack of motive to fabricate, the child\u2019s use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, the means by which the statement was elicited, and the lapse of time between the act and the statement.\u201d Evid.R. 807(A)(1). Second, the child\u2019s testimony must reasonably be unobtainable. Evid.R. 807(A)(2). Finally, there must be independent corroboration of the alleged acts. Evid.R. 807(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 28} Applying these requirements to the case at hand, the trial court carefully reviewed the totality of the circumstances surrounding M.S.\u2019s statements and appropriately determined that there were sufficient indicia of reliability and particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that made the statements as reliable as those admitted under Evid.R. 803 and 804. In particular, the trial court noted that M.S.\u2019s initial statement was unsolicited and spontaneous; subsequent statements were consistent; M.S. was not coached or coerced, and the statements were given without input from Batya and Farber; M.S. recognized the nature of his statements when he refused to answer any more questions; the acts M.S. described are not expected to be within the knowledge of a child that age unless he had observed those acts or was the victim of them; and there was no evidence of a motive to lie about these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 29} Furthermore, the remaining criteria of Evid.R. 807 obviously were satisfied: M.S. was unavailable to testify; Silverman\u2019s confession provided independent corroboration of the sexual acts; and the state provided proper notification of its intent to use the statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statement, therefore, was properly admitted under Evid.R. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 30} We are mindful that today\u2019s holding entails limiting <em>Said </em>to the extent that <em>Said </em>requires that a child be found competent prior to admitting the statement under Evid.R. 807. Although the principle of \u201c \u2018stare decisis is the bedrock of the American judicial system,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Kalish, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 23, 2008-Ohio-4912, 896 N.E.2d 124, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, it is one \u201c \u2018of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, quoting <em>Helvering v. Hallock </em>(1940), 309 U.S. 106, 119, 60 S.Ct. 444, 84 L.Ed. 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Galatis, </em>we recognized this tension and adopted a test for overruling precedent. However, \u201c[considerations in favor of <em>stare decisis </em>are at their acme * * * where reliance interests are involved,\u201d <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720. Individuals conducting their affairs must be able to rely on the law\u2019s stability. See, e.g., <em>United States ex rel. Fong Foo v. Shaughnessy </em>(C.A.2, 1955), 234 F.2d 715, 719. Thus, <em>Galatis </em>must be applied in matters of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c[T]he opposite is true in cases * * * involving procedural and evidentiary rules,\u201d <em>Payne, </em>501 U.S. at 828, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, because a procedural or evidentiary rule \u201cdoes not serve as a guide to lawful behavior.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaudin </em>(1995), 515 U.S. 506, 521, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444. In fact, \u201cas to such rules, stare decisis has relatively little vigor.\u201d <em>Shaughnessy, </em>234 F.2d at 719; see also <em>Williams v. Kidd </em>(1915), 170 Cal. 631, 650, 151 P. 1 (\u201cThere is * * * nothing, of course, in the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>which can apply to a mere rule of evidence in which no one has a vested right\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 33} The instant case addresses an evidentiary rule and procedure \u201cthat do[ ] not alter primary conduct.\u201d <em>Hohn v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 236, 252, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242. <em>Said\u2019s </em>expansive holding did not affect Silverman\u2019s conduct in this matter, so overruling <em>Said </em>will not disrupt any reliance interest. See <em>Pearson v. Callahan </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (\u201cLike rules governing procedures and the admission of evidence in the trial courts, [the] two-step protocol [established in <em>Saucier v. Katz </em>(2001), 533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272] does not affect the way in which parties order their affairs. Withdrawing from <em>Saucier\u2019s </em>categorical rule would not upset settled expectations on anyone\u2019s part\u201d). <em>Galatis </em>therefore is inapplicable because this matter involves an evidentiary rule, and so stare decisis plays a reduced role. <em>Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. at 521, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">{\u00b6 34} For the foregoing reasons, we limit <em>Said </em>and hold that a hearsay statement of a child declarant can be admitted under Evid.R. 807 without a determination of the child\u2019s competence to testify. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b723-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b723-6\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\">.

But I do not agree with the dissent\u2019s rejection of <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256. First, I am not prepared to abandon application of the <em>Galatis </em>test in criminal cases. The ability to rely on a stable legal framework is, if anything, more important in criminal matters where an individual\u2019s liberty may be at stake. Second, I do not agree with the majority that we should abandon the <em>Galatis </em>test in these circumstances. The majority argues that stare decisis plays a \u201creduced role\u201d here because the issue before us involves a rule of evidence rather than a substantive rule of law and there are no reliance interests at stake. Majority opinion at \u00b6 33. The majority goes on, however, to reduce to zero the role of our precedent, offering little more than disagreement with our prior reasoning for why <em>State v. Said </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 473, 644 N.E.2d 337, should be limited or abandoned. The majority relies on United States Supreme Court opinions for the contention that stare decisis is less important in procedural matters. See, e.g., <em>Pearson v. Callahan </em>(2009), \u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565. This approach is certainly not binding on us, and I refrain from either adopting or rejecting it at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">{\u00b6 36} I would note, however, that the majority overstates the arguments from the United States Supreme Court cases. Beyond contending that reliance interests are not implicated by procedural rules, the court in <em>Pearson </em>also noted abundant criticism of the precedent at issue as well as its inconsistent application by the lower courts. Id. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 816-818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565. The court in <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 828-830, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, similarly overruled two cases after acknowledging that several justices had questioned the precedent and that it had \u201cdefied consistent application by the lower courts.\u201d The opinion in <em>Hohn v. United States </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 236, 252, 118 S.Ct. 1969, 141 L.Ed.2d 242, pointed to inconsistent application of the precedent at issue within United States Supreme Court cases themselves. The majority additionally cites <em>United States v. Gaudin </em>(1995), 515 U.S. 506, 521, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444, which does not specifically rely on the inconsistent application of a prior rule to overturn precedent but does emphasize that the precedent relied on an interpretation of the United States Constitution that had since been eroded by subsequent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>{\u00b6 37} Although these cases from the United States Supreme Court do not directly adopt a multipart framework for overruling precedent, they consistently rely on essentially the same factors that we outlined in <em>Galatis. Galatis </em>held that \u201c[a] prior decision of the Supreme Court may be overruled where (1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d <em>Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, at paragraph one of the syllabus. In <em>Pearson, </em>for example, the United States Supreme Court correspondingly relied on arguments that the prior cases were to at least some extent wrongly decided, that the precedent had been inconsistently applied, and that reliance interests were lessened because the case involved a procedural rule. <em>Pearson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 129 S.Ct. at 816-821, 172 L.Ed.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 38} The majority misconstrues the United States Supreme Court opinions, ignoring the factors, other than reliance interests, that were considered by the court before it overruled a prior decision. A thorough examination of the cases cited by the majority actually confirms the prudence of our test in <em>Galatis. </em>Because I believe <em>Said </em>was rightly decided and should be followed here, I find it unnecessary to apply <em>Galatis. </em>But even if one disagrees, as the majority does, our well-established test for overturning precedent should be fully applied. The majority\u2019s opinion actually indirectly applies the first and third steps of the <em>Galatis </em>test, though it comes to the wrong conclusion, in discussing the purported problems with <em>Said </em>and the lack of reliance interests at stake. It nevertheless neglects to apply the second step and concludes that <em>Galatis </em>is inapplicable based only on the third step. For these reasons, as well as those offered by Justice Lanzinger, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b724-7\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AlV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">{\u00b6 39} Because Evid.R. 601 does not yet provide that children victimized by sexual abuse are presumed to be competent to testify, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. In casting aside the need for a competence determination because of its interpretation of Evid.R. 807, the child-hearsay exception, the majority actually overrules <em>State v. Said </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 473, 644 N.E.2d 337. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">{\u00b6 40} The majority concludes that the text of Evid.R. 807 does not require a competence determination and opines that the <em>Said </em>court \u201csweepingly declared, <em>without any authority, </em>that \u2018Evid.R. 807 clearly does not dispose of the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>find a child competent.\u2019 Id. at 476, 644 N.E.2d 337.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 15. However, this statement ignores the court\u2019s reliance on Evid.R. 601 in <em>Said.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\n<em>Competence of a mtness is governed by Evid.R. 601</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 41} While it is true that Evid.R. 807 does not address a child\u2019s competence, Evid.R. 601(A) does address competence:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cEvery person is competent to be a witness <em>except</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 43} \u201c(A) Those of unsound mind, and <em>children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This rule, therefore, presumes that children under ten are incompetent unless certain factors have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">{\u00b6 44} A trial court must conduct a voir dire examination of a child under ten years of age to determine the child\u2019s competence to testify. In making this determination, the court must consider \u201c(1) the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to observe acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child\u2019s ability to recollect those impressions or observations, (3) the child\u2019s ability to communicate what was observed, (4) the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity, and (5) the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.\u201d <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 251, 574 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">{\u00b6 45} Competence is an issue separate from any hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">\n<em>Ohio\u2019s child hearsay exception rale is Evid.R. 807</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b725-13\">{\u00b6 46} Evid.R. 807 was adopted, effective July 1, 1991, as a result of this court\u2019s request to the Supreme Court Rules Advisory Committee and the General Assembly to address the special problems presented by the hearsay statements of children in abuse cases. <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 115, 545 N.E.2d 1220. Notably, however, Evid.R. 601 did not change.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">{\u00b6 47} Evid.R. 807 obliges the trial court to find that the circumstances surrounding the making of the child\u2019s statement make the statement \u201cat least as reliable\u201d as those admitted under Evid.R. 803 (availability of declarant immaterial) and 804 (declarant unavailable). The rule includes factors that should be considered when determining the reliability of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">{\u00b6 48} Evid.R. 807(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b725-16\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cAn out-of-court statement made by a child who is under twelve years of age at the time of trial or hearing describing any sexual act performed by, with, or on the child or describing any act of physical violence directed against the child is not excluded as hearsay under Evid.R. 802 if all of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>{\u00b6 50} \u201c(1) The court finds that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that make the statement at least as reliable as statements admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 803 and 804. The circumstances must establish that the child was particularly likely to be telling the truth when the statement was made and that the test of cross-examination would add little to the reliability of the statement. In making its determination of the reliability of the statement, the court shall consider all of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, including but not limited to spontaneity, the internal consistency of the statement, the mental state of the child, the child\u2019s motive or lack of motive to fabricate, the child\u2019s use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, the means by which the statement was elicited, and the lapse of time between the act and the statement. In making this determination, the court shall not consider whether there is independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">{\u00b6 51} Evid.R. 807(A) also requires that the child\u2019s testimony not be \u201creasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement,\u201d that there be independent proof of the sexual act or act of physical violence, and that the proponent notify all other parties of the content of the statement, the identity of the witness, and the circumstances surrounding the statement at least ten days before the trial or hearing. Evid.R. 807(A)(2) to (4). The remainder of the rule defines the phrase \u201cnot reasonably obtainable.\u201d Evid.R. 807(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 52} Far from imposing a judicially created requirement onto the rule, the majority in <em>Said </em>explained how Evid.R. 807 does not dispose of the need to find a child competent, since competence is not the same issue as hearsay:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cCompetency under Evid.R. 601(A) contemplates several characteristics. * * * Those characteristics can be broken down into three elements. First, the individual must have the ability to receive accurate impressions of fact. Second, the individual must be able to accurately recollect those impressions. Third, the individual must be able to relate those impressions truthfully. See, generally, 2 Wigmore on Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.1979) 712-713, Section 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">(\u00b6 54} \u201cOut-of-court statements that fall within Evid.R. 807, like the other hearsay exceptions, possess a \u2018circumstantial probability of trustworthiness.\u2019 See 5 Wigmore, <em>supra, </em>at 253, Section 1422. In other words, under unique circumstances, we make a qualified assumption that the declarant <em>related </em>what she believed to be true at the time she made the statement. However, those same circumstances do not allow us to assume that the declarant accurately <em>received </em>and <em>recollected </em>the information contained in the statement. Whether she accurately received and recollected that information depends upon a different set of circumstances, those covering the time from when she received the information to when she related it. As a result, even though a statement falls within a hearsay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>exception, two elements of the declarant\u2019s competency remain at issue and must still be established. Thus, a trial court must find that a declarant under the age of ten was competent at the time she made the statement in order to admit that statement under Evid.R. 807.\u201d (Emphasis sic and footnote omitted.) 71 Ohio St.3d at 476-477, 644 N.E.2d 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 55} This court\u2019s rationale for requiring competence determinations shows that the principle established in <em>Said </em>was well grounded and was hardly made \u201cwithout authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>Child-hearsay exceptions in other jurisdictions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 56} Other states have handled the concern over competence by statute, establishing that children under ten are competent if they are victims of certain offenses. See, e.g., Ala.Code 15-25-3(e) (\u201ca child victim of a physical offense, sexual offense, or sexual exploitation, shall be considered a competent witness\u201d); Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. 54-86h (\u201cany child who is a victim of assault, sexual assault or abuse shall be competent to testify without prior qualification\u201d); Utah Code Ann. 76-5-410 (\u201cA child victim of sexual abuse under the age of ten is a competent witness and shall be allowed to testify without prior qualification in any judicial proceeding. The trier of fact shall determine the weight and credibility of the testimony\u201d); Mo.Ann.Stat. 491.060(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 57} Similarly, in federal courts, child victims are presumed competent to testify. Section 3509(c)(2), Title 18, U.S.Code. A court may conduct a competence examination of a proposed child witness only upon submission of a written motion by a party offering proof of incompetence and compelling reasons for the examination. Section 3509(c)(3) and (4), Title 18, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">{\u00b6 58} The majority cites cases from Washington and Colorado to bolster its conclusion that a competence determination is not needed in Ohio. <em>State v. C.J. </em>(2003), 148 Wash.2d 672, 63 P.3d 765; <em>People v. Dist. Court of El Paso Cty. </em>(Colo.1989), 776 P.2d 1083. But the law of both states differs from Ohio\u2019s in significant ways. Unlike Evid.R. 601, the Washington competence statute does not directly create a presumption that children under ten are not competent. The Washington statute simply states that persons are incompetent if they \u201care of unsound mind, or intoxicated at the time of their production for examination,\u201d and \u201cappear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts, respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d Wash.Rev.Code 5.60.050. And Colorado specifically removes the presumption of a child victim\u2019s incompetence in a civil or criminal proceeding for child abuse or a sexual offense if the child is \u201cable to describe or relate in language appropriate for a child of that age the events or facts respecting which the child is examined.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat.Ann. 13-90 \u2014 106(l)(b)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>{\u00b6 59} Evid.R. 601, on the other hand, does not exempt any type of proceeding that involves children from the presumption of incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\n<em>Changes to the competence mies are a matter for the Rules Committee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 60} The court of appeals followed <em>Said\u2019s </em>mandate that \u201ca trial court must find that a declarant under the age of ten was competent at the time she made the statement in order to admit that statement under Evid.R. 807.\u201d 71 Ohio St.3d at 477, 644 N.E.2d 337. Appellant argues that <em>Said </em>should be overruled and that competence hearings should be abandoned when a child\u2019s statement meets all of the requirements of Evid.R. 807 because the child victim\u2019s statements are needed to prosecute sexual abuse cases and Evid.R. 807 guarantees the reliability of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">{\u00b6 61} These are good policy arguments. But Evid.R. 601 still speaks of the presumed incompetence of a child under ten. The Ohio Rules of Evidence are designed to work together with the common law. \u201cThe principles of the common law of Ohio shall supplement the provisions of these rules, and the rules shall be construed to state the principles of the common law of Ohio unless the rule clearly indicates that a change is intended.\u201d Evid.R. 102. Evid.R. 807 does not indicate an intent to disturb Evid.R. 601. Until Evid.R. 601 is modified, and the presumption is changed for cases of this type, competence is still an issue for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 62} I also disagree with the majority\u2019s discussion of <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256. I would not apply the precedent-changing rules to criminal cases, because those rules were created in the context of substantive civil rather than criminal law. In addition, Evid.R. 807 is more than a mere procedural rule when it applies to criminal cases. A defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution (\u201cIn any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed * * * to meet the witnesses face to face\u201d). And as this court noted in <em>State v. Muttart, </em>\u201c \u2018Evid.R. 807\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test is designed specifically with the Confrontation Clause requirements in mind. See Staff Notes to Evid.R. 807.\u2019 \u201d 116 Ohio St.3d 5, 2007-Ohio-5267, 875 N.E.2d 944, \u00b6 37, quoting <em>State v. Dever </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 401, 414, 596 N.E.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 63} <em>State v. Said, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 473, 644 N.E.2d 337, remains good law in Ohio. The General Assembly has provided a child-hearsay exception by approving changes to the Ohio Rules of Evidence offered by the Supreme Court\u2019s Rules Committee. But until there is a presumption of competence for child witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>provided under Evid.R. 601, I would follow precedent.
