Wagenknecht Jr., contests an assessment of unpaid personal income tax as to the 1996 tax year, which the Tax Commissioner issued against him on December 8, 2005. Wagenknecht initiated the present proceedings by filing a petition for reassessment, dated February 7, 2006. The commissioner\u2019s final determination, issued on May 19, 2006, dismissed the petition on jurisdictional grounds. On appeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) granted the commissioner\u2019s motion and summarily affirmed that dismissal. After a careful review of the record in light of Wagenknecht\u2019s arguments, we find no legal error, and we affirm the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">{\u00b6 2} This case originates in a redetermination by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) of Wagenknecht\u2019s adjusted gross income (\u201cAGI\u201d) for 1996. When the IRS makes such an adjustment, R.C. 5747.10 requires an Ohio taxpayer to file an amended Ohio return that incorporates the new AGI figure and computes its effect on the Ohio tax liability for that year. The Tax Commissioner found that Wagenknecht had failed to file the required Ohio personal income tax return and proceeded to compute an Ohio income-tax deficiency based on the new AGI figure. The commissioner also found that \u201c[tjhere is no further pending action before the Internal Revenue Service pertaining to this taxpayer for this tax year\u201d and that \u201c[t]he assessment by the Internal Revenue Service has been finally determined.\u201d Finally, because Wagenknecht had failed to make the required payment on the assessment as required by R.C. 5747.13(E)(2), the commissioner ruled that he lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">{\u00b6 3} Wagenknecht timely filed his notice of appeal at the Board of Tax Appeals on August 3, 2006, asserting among other things that the commissioner had erred by denying jurisdiction under R.C. 5747.13: the applicable division of R.C. 5747.13, according to Wagenknecht, was R.C. 5747.13(E)(8), not R.C. 5747.13(E)(2). Additionally, Wagenknecht contended that the commissioner had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>erred by finding that \u201c[t]here is no further pending action before the Internal Revenue Service pertinent to this taxpayer for this tax year\u201d and pointed to two cases, one pending in the United States Tax Court and one in the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">{\u00b6 4} At the BTA, the commissioner filed a motion to affirm his final determination, which Wagenknecht opposed. Wagenknecht\u2019s response reiterated his assertions that R.C. 5747.13(E)(2), with its prepayment requirement, did not apply, and he referred once more to the two cases pertaining to tax year 1996 that were pending in the federal courts. Wagenknecht also filed subpoenas to summon witnesses to a hearing at the BTA and submitted a number of proposed hearing exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 5} On December 21, 2007, the BTA granted the commissioner\u2019s motion and affirmed his determination. The BTA found that the existing record established that the IRS had increased Wagenknecht\u2019s 1996 federal AGI by $308,600. Although the adjustments altered his Ohio income tax liability, the BTA found that Wagenknecht had \u201cfailed to file an amended return with [the commissioner], as required by R.C. 5747.10,\u201d with the result that \u201cpayment of the assessment, i.e. the tax and interest, became a condition precedent to Mr. Wagenknecht\u2019s ability to have the assessment reviewed\u201d under R.C. 5747.13(E)(2). Because the record showed that Wagenknecht had not paid, the BTA concluded that the commissioner was without jurisdiction to consider Mr. Wagenknecht\u2019s petition for reassessment. By granting the commissioner\u2019s motion, the BTA in effect denied Wagenknecht a hearing, even with respect to jurisdictional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal to this court, Wagenknecht urges three propositions of law that broadly contest his obligation to file tax returns. Subsumed within the sweep of his arguments is, once again, the contention that prepayment of the assessment is not required on account of Wagenknecht\u2019s having allegedly \u201cfiled any required return that is applicable for 1996.\u201d Wagenknecht also faults the BTA for denying him a hearing, in particular one devoted to the jurisdictional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 7} We hold that the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it affirmed the commissioner\u2019s dismissal for nonpayment of the assessment. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\n<em>1. Wagenknecht failed to file the amended return that Ohio law requires.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">{\u00b6 8} As we recently discussed in <em>Gibson v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 517, 2008-Ohio-4828, 895 N.E.2d 548, \u00b6 2, R.C. 5747.13(E)(2) requires prepayment when the taxpayer has not filed an original or an amended return as required by statute. In this case, the BTA affirmed the commissioner, who had issued an assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>based on a federal adjustment to the AGI reported on the 1996 tax return. Although Wagenknecht originally filed an Ohio tax return for 1996, he did not file an amended return after the IRS adjusted the AGI figure. An amended return is specifically required by R.C. 5747.10 \u201cnot later than sixty days after the adjustment has been agreed to or finally determined for federal income tax purposes or any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.\u201d In a situation such as that presented in this case, therefore, the taxpayer may not rely on the filing of the original return to pursue his petition for reassessment. <em>Gibson </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">{\u00b6 9} In his brief and at oral argument, Wagenknecht referred to an affidavit he allegedly submitted to the Department of Taxation in April 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He suggests that submitting such an affidavit may substitute for the filing of an amended return pursuant to R.C. 5747.10. That is mistaken for one overriding reason: R.C. 5747.10 specifically requires that an amended return be submitted \u201cin such form as the commissioner requires.\u201d The affidavit plainly does not equate to the Form IT-1040X, the standard amended return published by the Ohio Department of Taxation, or to any other form prescribed by the commissioner. Accordingly, Wagenknecht did not file an amended return pursuant to R.C. 5747.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>2. The IRS had \u201cfinally determined\u201d Wagenknecht\u2019s AGI.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 10} The Tax Commissioner\u2019s determination recited that the IRS assessment had been \u201cfinally determined.\u201d On appeal of that determination, Wagenknecht had the burden to prove that finding to be clearly unreasonable or unlawful. See <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10. The BTA correctly concluded that the taxpayer failed to carry that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 11} Before this court, Wagenknecht renews his contention that the federal liability remains in dispute in the two federal cases. That argument fails because recent decisions issued by the federal courts in both cases show that the relevant substantive issue \u2014 the amount of Wagenknecht\u2019s 1996 AGI \u2014 is not, as a matter of federal procedural law, a viable issue in either case. First, Wagenknecht cites case No. 06-00726 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit recently affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the part of Wagenknecht\u2019s complaint that related to the amount of federal tax liability on the grounds that jurisdiction \u201crelated to income tax liabilities lies solely in the Tax Court.\u201d <em>Wagenknecht v. United States </em>(C.A.6, 2008), 533 F.3d 412, 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>{\u00b6 12} As for the Tax Court case, that court decided on July 29, 2008, that the \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d was not properly before the court because of a procedural default by Wagenknecht. <em>Wagenknecht v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(2008), T.C. Memo. 2008-179. Indeed, the tax court granted complete summary judgment to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 13} But even if Wagenknecht could argue that further appeals will vindicate his position, another event triggered the unfulfilled requirement that he file the amended return under R.C. 5747.10. The commissioner found that the IRS had <em>assessed </em>the federal deficiency against Wagenknecht, and Wagenknecht never proposed to show that the act of assessment did not occur.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under R.C. 5747.10, the federal government\u2019s act of assessing the deficiency triggers the filing requirement, regardless of the finality of the federal determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, because Wagenknecht was required to file an amended return and failed to do so, he was obligated to prepay the Ohio assessment in order to receive a hearing on his petition for reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">\n<em>S. The amended-retum filing requirement was not unreasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 15} Wagenknecht also contends that Ohio law should not be construed to require him to file a return declaring, under penalties of perjury, an adjusted tax liability so long as he continues to dispute it. This argument fails for two reasons. First, Wagenknecht\u2019s federal AGI had been \u201cfinally determined,\u201d so that his personal disagreement with that figure was no longer legally significant: R.C. 5747.10(A) required him to file an Ohio amended return and pay the amount of any deficiency. Second, Wagenknecht overlooks the possibility of filing correspondence along with the return that could express his reservations about the federal assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">J. <em>Wagenknecht advances substantive arguments that may not be heard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 16} Wagenknecht asserts that the federal government committed factual and legal errors when it assessed a deficiency against him. His theories include the contention that he was not required to file a federal Form 1040 because of IRS noncompliance with the federal Paperwork Reduction Act and the nonapplicability of Form 1040 to the general public. Additionally, Wagenknecht maintains that the commissioner may not rely on the validity of a federal assessment when he issues an assessment for failure to pay under R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>5747.10(A) \u2014 on this view, the commissioner may issue his own assessment only after performing an independent determination of the validity of the federal assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">{\u00b6 17} These arguments raise challenges to the merits of the assessment. Ordinarily such arguments would be considered and resolved through the petition for reassessment. But Wagenknecht failed to invoke the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction because he neither filed the amended return nor paid the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">{\u00b6 18} Although Wagenknecht appears to treat his substantive arguments as bearing on the jurisdictional issue, they do not. The substantive arguments contest the <em>validity of the commissioner\u2019s </em>assessment; they do not, even if meritorious, release Wagenknecht from the duties under R.C. 5747.10 or 5747.13(E)(2) either to have filed the amended return or to pay the assessment in order to receive consideration of his petition for reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>5. Wagenknecht ivas not entitled to a hearing at the BTA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 19} Wagenknecht sought a hearing at the BTA, and in his notice of appeal to the court, he stated that the BTA \u201cerred by not allowing Appellant to present evidence at a hearing before the Board (which evidence was proffered in Appellant\u2019s Response In Opposition To Appellee\u2019s Motion To Affirm The Tax Commissioner\u2019s Final Determination), to prove that the Appellant was not required to make payment with the Petition for Reassessment.\u201d In <em>Brown v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-0hio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 10, we noted that R.C. 5717.02, the statute that governs appeals from determinations of the Tax Commissioner, states that \u201cupon the application of any interested party,\u201d the BTA \u201cshall order the hearing of additional evidence.\u201d We observed that the mandatory language of R.C. 5717.02 implied \u201cas a general matter that the BTA has no power analogous to that of a court in a civil action to grant summary judgment under Civ.R. 56 or dismissal for failure to state a claim under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11. Against that background, we must address the question whether the BTA could decline to hold a hearing and affirm the dismissal of the petition for reassessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 20} We hold that the BTA properly issued a summary affirmance. The only legitimate <em>jurisdictional </em>issues in the case concerned (1) Wagenknecht\u2019s obligation to file an amended return under R.C. 5747.10 and (2) his obligation to prepay under R.C. 5747.13(E)(2). Quite simply, the factual proof that Wagenknecht proposed to present at the BTA related to the procedural and substantive validity of the commissioner\u2019s assessment, not to the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the petition. Although Wagenknecht did offer to prove the pendency of the federal cases, he never offered to prove that the federal government had not issued an assessment \u2014 an event that by itself triggers the requirement to file the amended return. Nor did he assert that he had in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>paid the assessment. Under these circumstances, the BTA correctly found an absence of jurisdiction as a matter of law. As we have held, a litigant\u2019s right to a hearing under R.C. 5717.02 does not encompass a right to present evidence on points that are not jurisdictionally before the BTA. See <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap1\">Carl R.

Clifford, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 21} For all the foregoing reasons, the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it affirmed the commissioner\u2019s dismissal of the petition for reassessment. We therefore affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-8\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. The document was attached as an exhibit to a brief filed at the BTA but does not constitute a part of the statutory transcript certified by the commissioner to the BTA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-11\">. Indeed, the United States Tax Court stated that the IRS had assessed the federal deficiency for 1996 on January 10, 2003. T.C. Memo 2008-179 at 5. Ordinarily, we do not refer to decisions of other courts in collateral cases to determine the operative facts in a case pending before this court. In the present case, however, referring to the federal decisions for the assessment date is not improper because Wagenknecht places them at issue when he argues that those cases show a continuation of the federal dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
