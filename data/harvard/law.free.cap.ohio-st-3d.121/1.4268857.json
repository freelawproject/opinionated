Ealy for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the involuntary civil commitment of his son because his son had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to raise his claims. See <em>Youngs v. Rogers </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 27, 19 O.O.3d 223, 417 N.E.2d 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">{\u00b6 2} Ealy\u2019s reliance on R.C. 5122.30 does not warrant a different result. \u201cWhile R.C. 5122.30 does provide for habeas corpus relief to persons who are detained pursuant to R.C. Chapter 5122, this court has consistently held that if a petitioner has an adequate remedy at law the extraordinary writ of habeas corpus will not issue.\u201d <em>Roden v. Hubbard </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 37, 38, 19 O.O.3d 228, 417 N.E.2d 1255. In fact, Ealy\u2019s son did appeal his commitment order, which was dismissed after he failed to respond to a show-cause order. The fact that alternate remedies have already been invoked does not entitle petitioner to a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Everett v.
