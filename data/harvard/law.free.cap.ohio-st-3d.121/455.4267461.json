We determined that a conflict exists and also accepted the discretionary appeal on the issues of whether R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) and (B)(5) apply as exceptions to the public housing authority\u2019s immunity. We hold that the operation of a public housing authority is a governmental function under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2) rather than a proprietary function and remand for the trial court to determine whether the R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) exception to immunity applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellee, Danielle Moore, and her four children lived at 106 South Park Street, Oberlin, Ohio, in an apartment owned by appellant, the Lorain Metropolitan Housing Authority (\u201cLMHA\u201d). On the evening of October 19, 2003, Moore left to run errands, leaving Derrick Macarthy, the father of three of the four children, in the apartment with them. One of the children started a fire in a bedroom while Macarthy was sleeping on the living room couch. Macarthy and two of the children escaped, but Dezirae Anna Nicole Macarthy and D\u2019Angelo Anthony Marquez Macarthy were killed in the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 3} On October 12, 2004, Moore, individually and in her capacity as the administrator of the estates of Dezirae and D\u2019Angelo Macarthy, and in her capacity as the parent and next friend of the deceased children\u2019s siblings Jamar Moore and Deilani Macarthy, filed a lawsuit against defendants LMHA, its executive director Homer Verdin, and other unknown employees, for the wrongful deaths of Dezirae and D\u2019Angelo. Moore claimed that because LMHA removed the apartment\u2019s only working smoke detector and negligently failed to replace it, Derrick Macarthy did not wake in time to rescue two of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court noted in its findings of fact that a police officer on the scene believed that Derrick Macarthy\u2019s behavior indicated that he was under the influence of cocaine at the time of the fire and that an outside agency, conducting an annual inspection of the premises two weeks before the fire, reported that there was a working smoke detector in Moore\u2019s unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted summary judgment to the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the grounds that LMHA was a political subdivision entitled to immunity pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2744. The court found that the operation of a public housing authority is a governmental function and that none of the exceptions to immunity, and particularly R.C. 2744.02(B)(4), applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">{\u00b6 6} On appeal to the Lorain County Court of Appeals, Moore argued that the trial court erroneously found that LMHA performs a governmental function. The court of appeals agreed, reversing the summary judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings. <em>Moore v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth., </em>Lorain App. No. 06CA008995, 2007-Ohio-5111, 2007 WL 2810014. We accepted LMHA\u2019s discretionary appeal in conjunction with the certified conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">A. <em>Political Subdivision Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">{\u00b6 7} The General Assembly enacted the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act, codified at R.C. Chapter 2744, in 1985 in response to this court\u2019s abolishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of common-law sovereign immunity in <em>Haverlack v. Portage Homes, Inc. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 26, 2 OBR 572, 442 N.E.2d 749. <em>Cramer v. Auglaize Acres, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 266, 2007-Ohio-1946, 865 N.E.2d 9. The Act sets forth the defenses and immunities available to political subdivisions in civil actions for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). The Act also provides exceptions to immunity in specified circumstances. See R.C. 2744.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">{\u00b6 8} A political subdivision is \u201ca municipal corporation, township, county, school district, <em>or other body corporate and politic </em>responsible for governmental activities in a geographic area smaller than that of the state.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2744.01(F). LMHA is a metropolitan housing authority, defined in R.C. 3735.31: \u201cA metropolitan housing authority created under sections 3735.27 to 3735.50 of the Revised Code, constitutes a body corporate and politic.\u201d The parties do not dispute that LMHA is a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">{\u00b6 9} Whether a political subdivision is protected against tort liability under R.C. Chapter 2744 involves a three-tiered analysis: \u201cFirst, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) sets out a general rule that political subdivisions are not liable in damages. In setting out this rule, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) classifies the functions of political subdivisions into governmental and proprietary functions and states that the general rule of immunity is not absolute, but is limited by the provisions of R.C. 2744.02(B), which details when a political subdivision is not immune. Thus, the relevant point of analysis (the second tier) then becomes whether any of the exceptions in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply. Furthermore, if any of R.C. 2744.02(B)\u2019s exceptions are found to apply, a consideration of the application of R.C. 2744.03 becomes relevant, as the third tier of analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Greene Cty. Agricultural Soc. v. Liming </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 551, 556-557, 733 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">{\u00b6 10} The general rule states that \u201ca political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). R.C. 2744.01 explains whether a given function is proprietary or governmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 11} A \u201cproprietary function\u201d is a function that either (1) is specifically listed in R.C. 2744.01(G)(2), which lists examples of proprietary functions, or (2) is not described in R.C. 2744.01(C)(1)(a), (b), or (C)(2) <em>and </em>\u201cpromotes or preserves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>public peace, health, safety, or welfare and * * * involves activities that are customarily engaged in by nongovernmental persons.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(G)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">{\u00b6 12} By contrast, R.C. 2744.01(C) provides two routes to determine whether a given function is governmental. First, the statute refers to the list in R.C. 2744.01(C)(2) of \u201cspecified\u201d functions that the General Assembly has expressly deemed governmental. In the alternative, a function is governmental if it meets one of three independent standards, enumerated in R.C. 2744.01(C)(1)(a) through (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 13} LMHA, as a metropolitan housing authority, performs a specified \u201cgovernmental function\u201d under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(q). The statute provides that \u201c[u]rban renewal projects and the elimination of slum conditions\u201d are governmental functions. LMHA performs these functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 14} Before creating a metropolitan housing authority, the director of development must determine that either \u201c[ujnsanitary or unsafe inhabited housing accommodations exist\u201d or there is \u201ca shortage of safe and sanitary housing accommodations in that area available to persons who lack the amount of income that is necessary * * * to enable them, without financial assistance, to live in decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings without congestion.\u201d R.C. 3735.27(A)(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 15} Once created, a metropolitan housing authority is required to use its power in order to \u201cclear, plan, and rebuild slum areas within the district in which the authority is created, to provide safe and sanitary housing accommodations to families of low income within that district, or to accomplish any combination of the foregoing purposes.\u201d R.C. 3735.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 16} In order to carry out this mission, a metropolitan housing authority can designate portions of the region as \u201cslum areas\u201d and then provide and maintain housing projects in those areas, in addition to other, attendant powers. R.C. 3735.31(B). The housing project<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which Moore resided is operated by LMHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>{\u00b6 17} This analysis finds further support in R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(g), which provides that governmental functions include the \u201crepair, renovation, maintenance, and operation of buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function.\u201d Housing projects are designed to eliminate slum conditions, and the repair and maintenance of public housing are attendant powers of the public housing authority, performed to further the elimination of slum conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 18} Finally, we note that LMHA\u2019s argument that it performs a governmental function is bolstered by R.C. 2744.01(F). The parties do not dispute that LMHA is a political subdivision under R.C. 2744.01(F), which defines a political subdivision as one \u201cresponsible for governmental activities.\u201d These governmental activities involve a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 19} In view of the foregoing, we hold that the operation of a public housing authority is a governmental function under R.C. 2744.01(C)(2). We therefore need not analyze the three independent standards enumerated in R.C. 2744.01(C)(1)(a) through (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">B. <em>Exceptions to political subdivision immunity under R.C. 2744.02(B)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">{\u00b6 20} Having held that LMHA, as a political subdivision, performs a governmental function by providing public housing, we must now consider whether any of the R.C. 2744.02(B) exceptions to political subdivision immunity apply. The trial court found that the only potential exception was R.C. 2744.02(B)(4), while the court of appeals discussed R.C. 2744.02(B)(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6 LMHA argues that neither exception removes its immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">C. <em>R.C. 2744.02(B)(5)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2744.02(B)(5) states that a political subdivision may be liable when a statute expressly imposes liability: \u201c[A] political subdivision is liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property when civil liability is <em>expressly imposed </em>upon the political subdivision by a section of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, sections 2743.02 [hospitals] and 5591.37 [guardrails] of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moore argues that R.C. Chapter 5321, the Landlords and Tenants Act, is among the statutes that expressly impose liability. But that chapter of the Revised Code imposes civil liability on landlords in general. It does not <em>expressly </em>impose liability on the LMHA or any other political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>D. <em>R.C. 27U-02(B)a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) states that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided in section 3746.24 of the Revised Code, political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is <em>due to physical defects within or on the grounds of buildings </em>that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function, <em>including, but not limited to, office buildings and courthouses * </em>* (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 23} LMHA claims that the legislature intended to apply this exception only to buildings that are similar to \u201coffice buildings and courthouses\u201d and that the salient characteristics of office buildings and courthouses are that, unlike public housing, the public frequents them and transacts business in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 24} But the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d denotes a nonexclusive list of buildings to which the exception may apply. The phrase \u201cbuildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function\u201d is the critical phrase. We conclude that a unit of public housing is a building \u201cused in connection with the performance of a governmental function\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2744.01(C)(2). LMHA is therefore liable for negligence if the deaths in this case were due to physical defects occurring on its property within the meaning of R.C. 2744.02(B)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">{\u00b6 25} The final step in the analysis of (B)(4) is to determine whether absence of a required smoke detector is a \u201cphysical defect\u201d occurring on the grounds of LMHA\u2019s property. Because the trial court did not fully consider this issue, which, if established, would dissolve immunity, we must remand to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">(\u00b6 26} We resolve the certified conflict by holding that the operation of a public housing authority is a governmental function within the meaning of Ohio\u2019s sovereign-immunity statutes. We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand this case to the trial court for a determination of negligence and available affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b594-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b594-12\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AGa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b595-4\">Cupp, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-15\">.

Chapter 2744 and that its operation is a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2744.01(C)(2). I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s premature conclusion that a public housing unit is a building \u201cused in connection with the performance of a governmental function\u201d for purposes of the exception to immunity provided by R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). In my view, this court should not decide that matter at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 28} Here, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of the Lorain Metropolitan Housing Authority and against Danielle Moore, ruling that the provision of low-income housing is a governmental function and that the residential property in this case is not a building \u201cused in connection with the performance of a governmental function\u201d for purposes of the exception to immunity set forth in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4). This statute provides that \u201cpolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property that is caused by negligence of their employees and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in connection with the performance of a governmental function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 29} Moore appealed to the Ninth District, which reversed the trial court and held, as a threshold matter, that the operation of a metropolitan housing facility is a proprietary rather than governmental function. <em>Moore v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth, </em>Lorain App. No. 06CA008995, 2007-Ohio-5111, 2007 WL 2810014, \u00b6 21. Because R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) applies only with respect to governmental functions, the court of appeals never considered Moore\u2019s arguments concerning this exception to immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 30} Although I concur with the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the court of appeals and to hold that a metropolitan housing authority performs a governmental rather than proprietary function, I am of the view that this case should be remanded to the court of appeals to determine in the first instance whether R.C. 2744.02(B)(4) applies here. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s resolution of this issue and its order remanding the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AKy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 31} Much of what a metropolitan housing authority does, or is authorized to do, fits easily within the statutory definition of \u201cgovernmental function\u201d for purposes of political subdivision liability immunity. However, not everything does.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">{\u00b6 32} In my view, the reach of the statutory phrase that the majority opinion relies upon, \u201c[ujrban renewal projects and the elimination of slum conditions,\u201d does not extend so far as to encompass the ordinary day-to-day conduct of a metropolitan housing authority acting as a landlord in operating and maintaining residential rental properties. Such activities are indistinguishable from those engaged in by private landlords. Consequently, I would affirm that part of the judgment of the court of appeals that concludes that the operation and maintenance of residential rental properties are proprietary functions within the meaning of R.C. 2744.01(G)(1). On remand, the trial court should consider whether any of the immunities applicable to a political subdivision\u2019s proprietary functions apply, with the exception of whether civil liability is expressly imposed by the Landlord Tenant Act of R.C. Chapter 5321. On that issue, I conclude, as does the majority opinion, that civil liability is not \u201cexpressly\u201d imposed, as required by R.C. 2744.02(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 33} The operation and maintenance of residential rental properties are not specifically identified as governmental functions within the R.C. 2744.01(C)(2) listing of such functions. They also do not meet the R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(q) criteria of \u201c[u]rban renewal projects and the elimination of slum conditions.\u201d Urban renewal is described as the process of \u201cacquiring, clearing, and redeveloping slums or blighted areas by the use of the power of the government.\u201d Gotherman, Babbit &amp; Lang, 1 Local Government Law (2004) 888, Section 26:15. Although there is no Revised Code definition of \u201celimination of slum conditions,\u201d the terms \u201cblighted area\u201d and \u201cslum\u201d are defined as areas in which the sound growth of the state or a political subdivision of the state is impaired or arrested, the provision of housing accommodations is retarded, economic or social liability is created, or the public health, safety, morals, or welfare is threatened. See R.C. 3735.40(B), adopting the definition set forth in R.C. 1.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 34} Urban renewal projects and similar programs for the purpose of eliminating slum conditions are mentioned or described in various parts of the code, such as R.C. Chapter 163 (appropriation of property by the state government), R.C. Chapter 725 (financing municipal urban renewal projects with revenue bonds), R.C. Chapter 1728 (community urban redevelopment corporations), and R.C. Chapter 5709 (enterprise zones). Condemnation and appropriation are common governmental actions taken in connection with urban renewal. See, e.g., <em>Kim\u2019s Auto &amp; Truck Serv., Inc. v. Toledo, </em>172 Ohio App.3d 1, 2007-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Ohio-2260, 872 N.E.2d 1245; <em>Alliance v. Zellweger </em>(Mar. 12, 2001), Stark App. Nos. 2000CA0093 and 2000CA0094, 2001 WL 256319; <em>Farra v. Dayton </em>(1989), 62 Ohio App.3d 487, 576 N.E.2d 807. Moreover, such governmental actions generally do not run afoul of Section 6, Article VIII, Ohio Constitution, which prohibits a political subdivision from lending its credit. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Tomino v. Brown </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St.3d 119, 549 N.E.2d 505; <em>State ex rel. Bruestle v. Rich </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 13, 50 O.O. 6, 110 N.E.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">{\u00b6 35} None of the foregoing, however, encompasses the ongoing conduct of being a residential landlord. The processes of the actual daily, ongoing operation and maintenance of residential rental property, which may occur following the <em>completion </em>of an urban renewal project, do not constitute the undertaking of an urban renewal project or slum elimination. Although ongoing operation and maintenance of residential rental property may take place as a <em>result </em>of the decision to engage in an \u201curban renewal project or the elimination of slum conditions,\u201d they do not equate to either.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 36} Similarly, the operation and maintenance of residential rental property are not functions that meet any of the three criteria of R.C. 2744.01(C)(1) so as to be considered a governmental activity. I am persuaded by the concise conclusion reached by the appellate court in <em>Parker v. Dayton Metro. Pious. Auth. </em>(May 31, 1996), Montgomery App. No. 15556, 1996 WL 339935, upon which the appellate court in this instant case relied:</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cMaintenance of a public housing facility is voluntary but it is not a function that is imposed on the state as an obligation of sovereignty. Its benefits are conferred only on the limited part of the population that uses it. The activity promotes the public peace, health, safety, and welfare; however, it is a function which involves activities that are customarily engaged in by nongovernmental persons, in this instance private landlords who rent residential premises to tenants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 38} Consequently, I would hold that the operation and maintenance of residential rental property are proprietary functions within the meaning of R.C. 2744.01(G)(1) and that, unless one of the immunities applicable to proprietary functions applies, there remains in dispute a genuine issue of material fact regarding the presence of the smoke alarm within the residential unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">{\u00b6 39} Finally, even if the majority is correct that a metropolitan housing authority\u2019s conduct is a governmental function under its \u201c[ujrban renewal projects and the elimination of slum conditions\u201d authority, I agree with that portion of Justice O\u2019Donnell\u2019s dissent that states that it is premature for this court to determine whether the LMHA\u2019s individual residential rental properties fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the \u201cused in connection with the performance of a governmental function\u201d exception to immunity contained in R.C. 2744.02(B)(4).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxP\">Joseph F.
