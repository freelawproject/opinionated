For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the court of appeals and hold that a juvenile court retains jurisdiction to order a juvenile to serve a previously suspended commitment when the juvenile violates an unexpired condition of community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">{\u00b6 2} The appellant in this case is a child, referred to as J.F. In 2004, J.F. was adjudged delinquent following his admission to seven charged offenses, six of which would have been felonies if perpetrated by an adult. The juvenile court committed J.F. to the Department of Youth Services (\u201cYouth Services\u201d), but suspended that commitment based on several conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">{\u00b6 3} According to the trial court\u2019s entry of March 24, 2004, the conditions of the suspended commitment included compliance with monitored time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> until age 18, completion of community control, and payment of fines, court costs, and restitution. After reviewing the March 2004 entry of the juvenile court, we conclude that the court used the term \u201ccommunity control\u201d in place of \u201cprobation supervision.\u201d The court of appeals came to this same conclusion. <em>In re J.F., </em>Greene App. No. 06-CA-123, 2007-Ohio-5652, 2007 WL 3071879, \u00b6 51. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>transcripts of the dispositional hearing show that the trial court intended to impose probation supervision; while explaining the conditions of suspended commitment, the court stated that J.F. would have to \u201csuccessfully complete probation with Ms. Lyons.\u201d Accordingly, when the court\u2019s entry directed that J.F. would be \u201cplaced on community control under the guidance of Linda Lyons,\u201d the juvenile court actually imposed probation supervision under the guidance of Linda Lyons.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">{\u00b6 4} In March 2006, the juvenile court held a probation-termination hearing regarding J.F., in which the conflation of the terms \u201ccommunity control\u201d and \u201cprobation\u201d persisted. Although the purpose of the hearing was to terminate J.F.\u2019s intensive probation supervision, the resulting entry declared that J.F.\u2019s \u201cstatus on Intensive Community Control\u201d was terminated. That same entry provided that J.F. would be responsible for court fines and costs and the completion of community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">{\u00b6 5} Later in 2006, J.F. was charged with two new offenses that would have been misdemeanors if committed by an adult. J.F. admitted to having committed these offenses. At the dispositional hearing for these new offenses, the juvenile court ordered J.F. to serve the previously suspended commitment to Youth Services for one of the 2004 offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">{\u00b6 6} J.F. appealed, raising four assignments of error. The Second District Court of Appeals rejected his first assignment of error, which is the issue he raises in this appeal, but it reversed and remanded the case on J.F.\u2019s second assignment of error, holding that J.F.\u2019s rights to due process had been violated, because the juvenile court had failed to provide J.F. with prior notice that he could be subject to commitment for violating community control if found to have committed the two new 2006 offenses, and because J.F. was not given notice of which conditions of community control he had allegedly violated. Having sustained J.F.\u2019s second assignment of error, the court of appeals declined to address assignments of error three and four. We accepted J.F.\u2019s discretionary appeal. <em>In re J.F., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1423, 2008-Ohio-969, 882 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">{\u00b6 7} The sole issue in this appeal is whether the juvenile court had the statutory authority to order J.F. to serve the previously suspended commitment to Youth Services. We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">{\u00b6 8} The syllabus in <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, states: \u201cA juvenile court does not have the jurisdiction to reimpose a suspended commitment to a Department of Youth Services facility after a juvenile has been released from probation.\u201d According to J.F., <em>In re Cross </em>requires us to reverse the court of appeals decision, because the juvenile court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>its March 2006 entry had terminated J.F.\u2019s period of community control before his suspended commitment was imposed, thereby precluding the juvenile court from exercising jurisdiction. We disagree with J.F.\u2019s premise that the juvenile court terminated community control in March 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">{\u00b6 9} In January 2002, the General Assembly replaced the rubric \u201cprobation\u201d in juvenile dispositions and adopted new dispositional options under the heading \u201ccommunity control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cCommunity control,\u201d as described in R.C. 2152.19, replaced \u201cprobation,\u201d as described in former R.C. 2151.355, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1125, and 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 9447, which was the subject of our decision in <em>In re Cross. In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-0hio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, at \u00b6 11. An order of \u201cprobation\u201d under former R.C. 2151.355, encompassed the court\u2019s broad, discretionary power to craft appropriate controls for delinquent juveniles, enforced through ongoing judicial oversight. Under former R.C. 2151.355, it was the dispositional order of probation itself that enabled a court to impose and monitor the juvenile\u2019s compliance with the conditions of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">{\u00b6 11} In contrast, R.C. 2152.19 uses the term \u201ccommunity control\u201d to describe discretionary court-ordered and court-supervised requirements on the behavior of delinquent children. R.C. 2152.19. Under R.C. 2152.19, a dispositional order of community control may include one or several conditions \u2014 such as \u201cintensive probation supervision,\u201d \u201cbasic probation supervision,\u201d and \u201ccommunity service\u201d\u2014 all of which are subject to ongoing supervision by the court. Probation, no longer a stand-alone disposition, has become a subcategory or optional element of community control. It follows that the expiration of probation supervision \u2014 as one component of an order of community control \u2014 does not automatically trigger the loss of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction; as long as other community-control sanctions remain in effect, the juvenile remains subject to the court\u2019s supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">{\u00b6 12} This conclusion is consistent with <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258. The broad authority granted to juvenile courts in former R.C. 2151.355 to place a juvenile on probation subject to \u201c \u2018any conditions that the court prescribes,\u2019 \u201d survives in R.C. 2152.19, but the term \u201cprobation\u201d is replaced by \u201ccommunity control.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Id. at \u00b6 26, quoting former R.C. 2151.355(A)(2). R.C. 2152.19 allows a court to impose \u201cany sanctions, services, and conditions that the court prescribes.\u201d Once imposed, such conditions provide \u201cthe tether that allows a court to maintain some connection with a juvenile delinquent.\u201d <em>In re Cross </em>at \u00b6 27. This jurisdiction over a delinquent juvenile, which was attendant to an order of probation under former R.C. 2151.355, now accompanies an order of community control under R.C. 2152.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>{\u00b6 13} When a court issues an order of community control, the jurisdiction of the court exists only so long as the order itself remains in effect. <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, at \u00b6 27-28. In the absence of a statutory limitation on its duration, an order of community control may be indefinite in duration, lasting until the child reaches age 21, or it may be definite, effective until it expires or is modified by the court. Id. at \u00b6 27-28; R.C. 2152.22(A). Unmodified portions of an original order will remain in effect unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, where several conditions are placed on a juvenile in an order of community control, the termination of only some of those conditions will not result in the termination of the order. Any remaining conditions of community control will continue in effect, thereby conferring continuing jurisdiction on the court. A court may order a juvenile to serve a previously suspended commitment after probation supervision has been terminated when the juvenile violates a separate, unexpired condition of community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">{\u00b6 15} For instance, if a juvenile court suspended a juvenile\u2019s commitment and issued an order of community control requiring intensive probation supervision and a period of community service, the court could subsequently remove the condition of intensive probation supervision but would retain jurisdiction over the child until the completion of the community-service period. In such a case, the possibility of the suspended commitment would last until the remaining condition \u2014 the community-service period \u2014 was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">{\u00b6 16} Applying this analysis to the present case, we hold that the juvenile court had continuing jurisdiction over J.F., given that unexpired conditions of community control remained in effect even after J.F.\u2019s probation supervision was terminated. The juvenile court intended to \u2014 and did \u2014 release J.F. from probation supervision, by order in March 2006. Although that order, and the March 2004 order that it modified, mistakenly referred to' probation as \u201ccommunity control,\u201d this mistake is irrelevant for purposes of the issue before us, because the March 2006 order made clear that J.F. would be subject to ongoing community-control sanctions: he was compelled to complete community service. The court retained jurisdiction to ensure that J.F. completed his community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">{\u00b6 17} J.F. urges us to hold that the community service in the March 2006 order was not an element of community control, because, he argues, it was imposed in lieu of fines and court costs, as provided for under R.C. 2152.20(D) for indigent juveniles. However, that statute provides that if community service is imposed on an indigent child in lieu of a financial sanction, then it shall be imposed under R.C. 2152.19(A). Therefore, community service imposed in lieu of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>financial sanction for indigent delinquent children is, by statute, an element of community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">{\u00b6 18} Further, the March 2006 order did not refer to the monitored-time requirement of the March 2004 order, thereby leaving that condition in effect. This is consistent with the probation officer\u2019s request at the hearing that the court release J.F. from intensive probation supervision but leave the monitored time in effect. Monitored time is an element of community control under R.C. 2152.19, and J.F. was to comply with monitored time until age 18 under the terms of the March 2004 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">{\u00b6 19} As of August 2006, when J.F. committed the new offenses, J.F. had not yet reached the age of 18; therefore his community-control sanction of monitored time had not expired. Furthermore, J.F. failed to meet the condition of monitored time \u2014 that he lead a law-abiding life \u2014 when, as he admitted in a 2006 hearing, he committed two offenses in August 2006 that would be misdemeanors if committed by an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">{\u00b6 20} We conclude that the juvenile court had continuing jurisdiction over J.F. to enforce the ongoing conditions of community control. Therefore, the juvenile court was authorized to order J.F. to serve the previously suspended commitment to Youth Services when J.F. violated those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">{\u00b6 21} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the holding of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the Greene County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, for further proceedings consistent with the decision of the Second District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-9\">O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b215-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-14\">. \u201cMonitored time\u201d is \u201ca period of time during which an offender continues to be under the control of the sentencing court * * *, subject to no conditions other than leading a law-abiding life.\u201d R.C. 2152.02(U) and 2929.01(Z).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b215-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6T\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">{\u00b6 22} The issue before us is whether the juvenile court had the statutory authority to order J.F. to serve the previously suspended commitment to the Department of Youth Services. I would answer the question in the negative and hold that a juvenile\u2019s suspended commitment may not be imposed after the juvenile has successfully completed and been released from his community control. In my view, when J.F.\u2019s community control ended on March 1, 2006, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">{\u00b6 23} This court has previously held that \u201c[a] juvenile court does not have the jurisdiction to reimpose a suspended commitment to a Department of Youth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Services facility after a juvenile has been released from probation.\u201d <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-Ohio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, syllabus. When the juvenile\u2019s probation is terminated, \u201c[t]here is no statutory basis for the court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction * * *.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">{\u00b624} At the March 2006 hearing, in addressing J.F., the court stated, \u201c[Yjou\u2019ve successfully completed probation, I hear that you\u2019ve gone above and beyond what you need to do, so I\u2019m terminating you successfully today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">{\u00b6 25} The court\u2019s March 3, 2006 entry terminating community control made no mention of monitored time. Although the appellate court cited J.F.\u2019s probation officer\u2019s comment regarding monitored time at the community-control-termination hearing as evidence that J.F. continued to be under the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>In re J.F., </em>2d Dist. No. 06-CA-123, 2007-Ohio-5652, 2007 WL 3071879, at \u00b6 51, the juvenile court did not state on the record that it was adopting the probation officer\u2019s recommendation. A court speaks through its journal entries. <em>State ex rel. Worcester v. Donnellon </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 117, 118, 551 N.E.2d 183. Therefore, the March 3, 2006 entry terminating J.F.\u2019s community control and allowing him to obtain his driver\u2019s license, without mentioning \u201cmonitored time,\u201d controls. If the court intended to maintain continuing jurisdiction over J.F., the court could have continued him on community control. It did not. It terminated his community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">{\u00b6 26} In my view, monitored time is an element of community control. According to R.C. 2929.01(Z), \u201cmonitored time\u201d is a \u201cperiod of time during which an offender continues to be under the control of the sentencing court or parole board, subject to no conditions other than [to lead] a law-abiding life.\u201d R.C. 2929.17 lists monitored time as one of several nonresidential sanctions that may be imposed when there is no mandatory prison term. Similarly, R.C. 2152.19(A)(4) (disposition orders for delinquent children), lists monitored time as an option under community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">{\u00b6 27} Thus, monitored time is an element of community control, not a disposition itself. If community control is terminated, so, too, is monitored time. On March 3, 2006, the juvenile court terminated J.F.\u2019s community control and told him that he had \u201csuccessfully completed probation.\u201d J.F. relied on the March 3, 2006 entry and the statements made by the court at J.F.\u2019s hearing. In my view, due process mandates that juveniles, too, deserve finality in the judgments rendered against them. By this opinion, the majority has, in essence, nullified the holding in <em>In re Cross, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 328, 2002-0hio-4183, 774 N.E.2d 258, and allowed a probation officer\u2019s comments to supersede a judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">{\u00b6 28} Wdien J.F.\u2019s community control ended on March 1, 2006, the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction to impose the suspended commitment ceased. The two new offenses with which J.F. was subsequently charged should have been considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>independent of any prior adjudication. I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the juvenile court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"An0\">Stephen K.
