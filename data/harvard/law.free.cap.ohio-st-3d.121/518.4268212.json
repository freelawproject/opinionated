The board\u2019s recommendation is before us pursuant to our order of December 21, 2007, in which we suspended respondent from practice on an interim basis and remanded the case to the board for review of evidence respondent had proffered in mitigation of his established misconduct. See <em>Butler Cty. Bar Assn. v. Portman, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2007-Ohio-6842, 878 N.E.2d 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">{\u00b6 3} In recommending an indefinite suspension, the board accepted as mitigating respondent\u2019s efforts to rectify the consequences of his misconduct and the causal connection between his mental disability and his ethical breaches. But the board also rejected respondent\u2019s request that he receive credit for the interim suspension of his license as an offset to the two-year bar for filing a petition for reinstatement that follows an indefinite suspension. We accept the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation for an indefinite suspension; however, on respondent\u2019s objections, we grant him credit for his December 21, 2007 interim suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 4} Relator Disciplinary Counsel commenced this action in June 2006 by filing a two-count complaint charging respondent with various violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring lawyers to cooperate in disciplinary investigations). In December 2006, Disciplinary Counsel and relator Butler County Bar Association amended the complaint, alleging four additional counts of misconduct. Respondent did not answer, and relators moved for default. See Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the board granted the motion, making findings of misconduct as to all six counts and recommending respondent\u2019s permanent disbarment. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>{\u00b6 5} After the board filed its report in this court for review, respondent moved to supplement the record. We granted the motion, returning the case for the board\u2019s consideration of mitigation evidence, including respondent\u2019s claimed mental disability and restitution. Our order also suspended respondent from practice on an interim basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent does not dispute that he committed the misconduct found against him, and on remand, a panel of the board heard evidence presented in mitigation. Finding violations of the Disciplinary Rules and weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the panel recommended respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension from practice and that he receive no credit for his interim suspension. The board again adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>Blech Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct adversely reflecting on his fitness to practice law), 6-101(A)(3) (a lawyer shall not neglect an entrusted legal matter), and 9-102(B)(4) (a lawyer shall promptly pay or deliver requested funds, securities, or other properties that the client is entitled to receive) in representing Keith Blech.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 8} Blech\u2019s wife, from whom he later separated, was involved in an automobile accident with an uninsured or underinsured driver in January 2004. While representing Blech in another case, respondent advised him that if his wife recovered in the lawsuit she had filed, Blech was legally entitled to a portion of the damage award. Respondent then agreed to help Blech collect his share of any damages and asked for a $500 fee to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 9} Blech sent respondent a $500 money order in early July 2005, after respondent had demanded payment at least four more times. After receiving payment, respondent failed to return Blech\u2019s numerous telephone calls and did no work on the case. Despite Blech\u2019s requests, respondent also failed to refund any unearned legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Cooperate in the Investigation of the Blech Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">{\u00b6 10} In late 2005, Disciplinary Counsel sent respondent certified letters of inquiry to his business and home addresses listed on the records of his attorney registration seeking responses by specified dates. The first letter was returned as undeliverable; the second was returned as unclaimed. The return receipt for a third certified letter of inquiry sent to an updated address was signed, but respondent still did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">{\u00b6 11} In January 2006, a \u201cDwight J. Portman\u201d signed for a fourth certified letter, but this inquiry also produced no response. Disciplinary Counsel sent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>fifth inquiry letter the next month, again to both the home and business addresses at which respondent was registered. Each of the certified receipts was signed, but respondent did not answer either letter. Respondent also failed to appear in response to a subpoena for his deposition that was delivered in person to the registered residence address.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 12} By failing to appropriately respond during relator\u2019s investigation, respondent violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Count III </em>\u2014 The <em>Cook Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(4) and Gov. Bar R. V(4)(G) in his attorney-client relationship with Edith and Charles Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 14} The Cooks hired respondent in February 2005 to file a motion for judicial release for their son, who was serving a six-year, nine-month prison term. They paid respondent $500, which he promised to return if he could not procure their son\u2019s release. Though another attorney had already advised the Cooks that their son was not eligible for judicial release until he had served five years of his sentence, the Cooks hired respondent because he intimated that this rule might not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent did not file a motion for judicial release as promised and did no other work for the Cooks. The Cooks made numerous requests for the return of their $500. For over one year, they called respondent, sent him certified letters, and repeatedly went to his office, to no avail. When respondent did not honor any of their requests, the Cooks filed a grievance with relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 16} On March 16, 2008, respondent appeared at a transcribed proceeding to answer the Butler County Bar Association\u2019s questions about the Cook grievance. He represented that he had already refunded the Cooks\u2019 money, a statement that they fervently denied. Respondent also promised to produce various records of his practice, including 15 months of bank statements, by the end of that March. He failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">\n<em>Count TV\u2014 The Mullins Grievance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(4) in his attorney-client relationship with Beverly House and her son, Ronald Mullins.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">{\u00b6 18} House had much the same experience with respondent as the Cooks did. She paid respondent $250 in October 2005 to file a motion for judicial release for Mullins, who was serving a one-year sentence of incarceration. Over the succeeding several months, respondent stopped communicating, refusing to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>turn House\u2019s many telephone calls. In late 2005, a member of the Butler County Prosecutor\u2019s Office arranged a three-way telephone call with House and respondent. Respondent falsely told the other participants in the call that he had already filed the motion for judicial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 19} During the proceedings on March 16, 2006, respondent admitted under oath his failure to file the motion for judicial release. He also admitted his failures to communicate with his client and to repay her unearned fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>Count V </em>\u2014 The <em>Johnson Grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(6), and 6-101(A)(3) in his attorney-client relationship with Douglas Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 21} In February 2005, Johnson paid respondent $550 to defend him against a felony charge. Johnson pleaded guilty to having a weapon while under a disability and was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison. Johnson\u2019s mother afterward paid respondent another $450, for a total of $1,000, for his defense of her son. She apparently also paid respondent to file either an appeal or a motion for judicial release, which he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">{\u00b6 22} Respondent accepted payments from Johnson and his mother, even though the Butler County Common Pleas Court had appointed him to serve as Johnson\u2019s counsel. In March 2005, respondent applied to the court for appointed-counsel fees. Respondent denied on the application that he had already received compensation for his services. The Butler County Auditor paid respondent an additional $1,065 because of the misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\"><em>Count VI </em>\u2014 Malpractice <em>Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">{\u00b6 23} During the proceedings on March 16, 2006, respondent admitted that after allowing his professional liability insurance policy to lapse, he continued to represent clients without providing disclosures or obtaining signed waivers as required. He thereby violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 1-104 (requiring an attorney who does not maintain professional liability insurance with specified limits to disclose and obtain clients\u2019 consent to the deficiency in writing).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">{\u00b6 24} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the duties violated by the lawyer in question and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21. Because each disciplinary case is unique, we are not limited to the factors specified in the rule but may take into account \u201call relevant factors\u201d in determining what sanction to impose. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 25} We have already discussed respondent\u2019s breaches of duties owed to his clients, DR 1-102(A)(4), 6-101(A)(3), and 9-102(B)(4), and to the legal profession and public, DR 1-102(A)(6) and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G). As for similar cases, the panel and board relied on precedent in which we have indefinitely suspended lawyers from practice for acts and omissions that, absent compelling evidence of a mental disability causally related to the underlying misconduct, would have warranted a lawyer\u2019s permanent disbarment. See, e.g., <em>Erie-Huron Counties Joint Certified Grievance Commt. v. Meyerhoefer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 62, 2003-Ohio-2467, 788 N.E.2d 1073 (attorney with qualifying mental disability suspended indefinitely for transferring $21,000 from a client and the client\u2019s decedent\u2019s estate to himself without authorization, failing without cause to distribute assets of a trust for 16 months despite beneficiary requests, and failing without cause to file a client\u2019s income tax returns). Id. at \u00b6 11. Respondent\u2019s neglect of clients, failure to return unearned fees, various misstatements, and failure to cooperate in the disciplinary process do not rise to the level of misconduct in <em>Meyerhoefer; </em>nevertheless, we agree, as do the parties, that an indefinite suspension is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 26} In recommending an indefinite suspension, the panel and board weighed relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. Weighing against respondent are his dishonest motive and the fact that he (1) engaged in a pattern of multiple disciplinary infractions, (2) failed to appropriately cooperate in the disciplinary process, and (3) made a false statement during the process about whether he had refunded the Cooks\u2019 money. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). Factors weighing in respondent\u2019s favor, mainly because of the supplemental mitigation evidence, include that (1) he has no prior disciplinary record, (2) he has paid restitution to all the named clients and repaid the court-appointment fees to Butler County, acknowledging the wrongful nature of his conduct, and (3) he has fully cooperated in the disciplinary process since our remand. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 27} Respondent, who began experiencing depression during law school, suffers from a qualifying mental disability. To have significant mitigating effect, a lawyer asserting mental disability must provide (1) proof of a reliable diagnosis, (2) proof that the disability contributed to cause the misconduct, (3) evidence of the lawyer\u2019s sustained period of successful treatment for the disability, and (4) a reliable prognosis that the lawyer will be able to return to ethical professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>practice under specified conditions, if any. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(i) through (iv). Respondent\u2019s record meets these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 28} Will Caradine, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, performed a mental-health examination on respondent and testified as to his findings. Caradine began treating respondent on a weekly basis in December 2007, diagnosing him with \u201cgeneralized anxiety disorder with depressive features.\u201d Caradine reported that respondent\u2019s psychological profile during the events at issue was characterized by strong anxiety and elements of depression. He described respondent\u2019s anxiety as overwhelming to the point that it interfered with his daily functioning and professional responsibilities. Caradine expressed his opinion that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, respondent\u2019s ethical breaches resulted from these impairments, rather than from any intent to defraud or deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 29} Caradine also reported that respondent was fully invested in the psychotherapy process and had demonstrated himself to be a conscientious person not ordinarily susceptible to ethical shortfalls. He described his therapeutic approach for delving into and resolving issues repressed in respondent\u2019s psyche since childhood. Caradine reported progress, testifying that respondent continues to incorporate the insights gained from therapy and will be able to resume the competent and ethical practice of law. He conditioned his prognosis, however, on respondent\u2019s remaining in therapy indefinitely and continuing with prescribed antidepressant medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">{\u00b6 30} In addition, Stephanie Krznarich, clinical director of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), testified to respondent\u2019s participation, including his commitment to a four-year recovery contract with OLAP. Among the conditions specified by the contract are respondent\u2019s continued compliance with the regimen prescribed by his doctors, acceptance of OLAP\u2019s oversight in identified practice problem areas, and regular check-ins with OLAP personnel. Occupational counseling is also recommended. Krznarich reported that respondent was in full compliance with this contract and that she had no misgivings, assuming his compliance continues, about whether after a two-year suspension he will be fit to petition for reinstatement to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">{\u00b6 31} As the panel and board aptly observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cWhile Respondent\u2019s conduct in neglecting his clients and initially failing to make restitution is egregious, Respondent has now accepted responsibility for his actions, has made restitution, and is actively engaged in treatment for his mental disability. We are encouraged by his commitment to continuing his therapy, his OLAP involvement, and taking his medications as prescribed. Most importantly, we note Respondent\u2019s confidence that in the future, he would be able to recognize if he were suffering a relapse and would be willing to seek help before causing injury to his clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 33} The panel and board thus modified the earlier recommendation of disbarment to one of an indefinite suspension. Both the panel and board decided against allowing respondent credit for his interim suspension, however, reasoning that the interim suspension resulted from initial indifference to the disciplinary process rather than respondent\u2019s mental disability. Objecting to this conclusion, respondent cites his treating psychologist\u2019s testimony as evidence that the anxiety and depressive components of his condition made him powerless to respond and participate as professionally required.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 34} Neither Disciplinary Counsel nor the Butler County Bar Association has opposed the interim credit respondent seeks, and his doctor\u2019s testimony is evidence that respondent was psychologically unable to do more during the investigation and hearing process than appear on the occasion that he did. We credit the expert testimony and attribute respondent\u2019s Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) violations and other procedural improprieties to his mental disability. The objection is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">{\u00b6 35} Having accepted the findings of misconduct, we also accept the recommended sanction, modified to afford respondent credit for his interim suspension. Respondent is therefore indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio, effective as of December 21, 2007. In addition to the requirements of Gov.Bar R. V(B) through (E), respondent\u2019s reinstatement to the practice of law shall be subject to the following conditions recommended by the panel and board:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(1) As conditions for Respondent\u2019s return to the practice of law, he must (a) present an opinion to a [reasonable] degree of professional certainty from a qualified health care professional, that he has successfully completed a treatment program, is continuing treatment, and is capable of returning to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law and (b) provide assessments from his treating psychologist and a qualified occupational counselor regarding any recommended restrictions that should be imposed upon the nature of Respondent\u2019s law practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(2) Upon his return to practice, Respondent must serve probation for three years during which the following conditions must be met: (a) Respondent must continue treatment with a qualified mental health professional, and follow all recommendations of his doctors, including, but not limited to, taking all [medications] as prescribed; (b) Respondent must make regular visits to his treating mental health professional at a frequency to be determined by the treating professional; (c) Respondent must continue participation in the OLAP program as recommended by his OLAP counselor, and (d) Respondent must refrain from any further misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 38} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcW_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Jonathan E.
