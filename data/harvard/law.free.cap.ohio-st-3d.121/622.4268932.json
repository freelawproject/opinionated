State ex rel. Petro, </em>Greene App. No. 2007 CA 1, 2007-Ohio-3454, 2007 WL 1953684, on the following issue: \u201cDoes R.C. 119.12\u2019s \u2018grounds\u2019 requirement, which provides that a notice of administrative appeal must state the \u2018grounds\u2019 for the appeal, require an appellant to specify something beyond restating the statutory formula that the order appealed from is \u2018not in accordance with law and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence?\u2019 \u201d We accepted the discretionary appeal of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services on the same issue and consolidated the cases. 118 Ohio St.3d 1431, 2008-Ohio-2595, 887 N.E.2d 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">{\u00b6 2} For the following reasons, we answer the certified question in the affirmative and reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. We hold that parties filing an appeal under R.C. 119.12 must identify specific legal or factual errors in their notices of appeal, not simply restate the standard of review for such orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee, MedCorp, Inc., is a medical-transport company that provides ambulance and ambulette services to qualified Medicaid patients. Upon an audit of the claims that MedCorp had submitted in 1996 and 1997, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services disallowed all the claims that had been paid. The department subsequently ordered MedCorp to repay $534,719.27 that the department had paid to MedCorp for the disallowed claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-11\">{\u00b6 4} MedCorp appealed the department\u2019s order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 119.12. MedCorp\u2019s notice of appeal stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b757-12\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cPursuant to sections 119.12 and 5111.06 of the Ohio Revised Code, MedCorp, Inc., by and through counsel, hereby appeals from the Adjudication Order issued by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services dated April 19, 2006 * * *. The Adjudication Order is not in accordance with law and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">{\u00b6 6} The department filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that MedCorp\u2019s notice of appeal failed to state the grounds upon which its appeal was based, as required by R.C. 119.12, and therefore did not properly invoke the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. Rather than ruling on the motion to dismiss, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>issued a decision on the merits of the appeal and reversed the department\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">{\u00b6 7} The department appealed to the Franklin County Court of Appeals and raised the question of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, along with a question on the merits. The court of appeals, citing <em>Derakhshan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-261, 2007-Ohio-5802, 2007 WL 3148684, concluded that MedCorp\u2019s notice of appeal set forth sufficient grounds to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court, and it affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to R.C. 119.12, \u201c[a]ny party desiring to appeal [an order of an administrative agency] shall file a notice of appeal with the agency setting forth the order appealed from and the grounds of the party\u2019s appeal.\u201d The precise issue before us is what the statutory phrase \u201cgrounds of the party\u2019s appeal\u201d requires: may an appealing party meet this burden by simply providing a general statement that the underlying order \u201cis not in accordance with law and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence,\u201d as MedCorp did in this case, or are more specific objections required?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">{\u00b6 9} When construing a statute, we first examine its plain language and apply the statute as written when the meaning is clear and unambiguous. See <em>State v. Lowe, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 507, 2007-Ohio-606, 861 N.E.2d 512, \u00b6 9. The words used must be afforded their usual, normal, and/or customary meanings. See <em>Proctor v. Kardassilaris, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 71, 2007-Ohio-4838, 873 N.E.2d 872, \u00b6 12; R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">{\u00b6 10} The Random House Dictionary of the English Language defines \u201cgrounds\u201d in this context as \u201cthe foundation or basis on which a belief or action rests; reason or cause: <em>grounds for dismissal.\u201d </em>(Italics sic.) Random House Dictionary (2d Ed.1987) 843. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary provides a similar definition for \u201cground\u201d: \u201c[t]he reason or point that something (as a legal claim or argument) relies on for validity &lt; grounds for divorce &gt; &lt; several grounds for appeal&gt;.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 723. These definitions support the conclusion that a \u201cground of the pax-ty\u2019s appeal\u201d is the discrete reason or x-easons that caused the party to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">{\u00b6 11} Thus, to comply with R.C. 119.12, an appealing pax-ty must state in its notice of appeal the specific legal and/or factual reasons why it is appealing. The statute does not suggest that parties must present these reasons in exacting detail. Rather, pax-ties must simply designate the explicit objection they are raising to the administrative agency\u2019s order, much in the same way that appellants in a coux-t of appeals must assex-t specific legal arguments in the form of assignments of ex-ror and issues for review, App.R. 16(A)(3) and (4), and appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>lants in this court must advance propositions of law, S.Ct.Prac.R. III(1)(B)(4) and VI (2) (B) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, MedCorp claimed that the department\u2019s audit determination was based on a flawed statistical-sampling methodology for which there is no provision in the department\u2019s internal procedural manuals. Thus, in its notice of appeal, MedCorp could have stated, \u201cThe department erred when it employed a flawed statistical-sampling methodology to support its audit finding against MedCorp\u201d or \u201cThe department used a statistical-sampling methodology not provided for in its internal procedural manuals.\u201d If MedCorp believed that the department acted in contravention of a specific statute, it could have simply said, \u201cThe department\u2019s audit was not conducted in compliance with\u201d that statute. Any of these statements could fairly be called grounds for appeal, and all would have notified the court and the department of the precise argument being-advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">{\u00b6 13} Allowing a party to simply allege that the administrative order in question \u201cis not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\u201d and/or \u201cis not in accordance with law\u201d in its notice of appeal would create a result inconsistent with the clear intent driving the statute. We must avoid constructions that create absurdities, see <em>In re T.R., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 136, 2008-Ohio-5219, 896 N.E.2d 1003, \u00b6 16, and we must construe statutes so as to give effect to the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting them, see <em>Ackison v. Anchor Packing Co., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 228, 2008-Ohio-5243, 897 N.E.2d 1118, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">{\u00b6 14} When a party files an appeal from an order of an administrative agency, it is already making an affirmative statement that it believes that the underlying order \u201cis not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and/or is not in accordance with law\u201d because it must meet that standard to succeed on appeal under the plain language of R.C. 119.12. If we were to adopt MedCorp\u2019s position, those same, general words could be used in virtually every appeal from an administrative agency filed pursuant to the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">{\u00b6 15} By specifically requiring an appealing party to state the \u201cgrounds of [its] appeal\u201d in the notice of appeal, the General Assembly clearly intended that the appealing party should provide some information supporting its conclusion that the order is not in accordance with law and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. If every appealing party could simply restate the standard of review applicable to all appeals without further specification, this requirement would, in effect, be excised from the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">{\u00b6 16} Such a construction would also create several problems. First, a boilerplate restatement of the standard of review fails to put the nonappealing party and the court on notice of the specific issues being appealed. In a case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>may include thousands of pages of proceedings and multiple issues, this lack of specificity at an early stage would waste everyone\u2019s time.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">{\u00b6 17} Second, R.C. 119.12 permits courts to review appeals with or without (1) ordering further comments from counsel, (2) ordering briefing, and (3) admitting additional evidence: \u201cThe court <em>shall conduct a hearing </em>on the appeal * * *. * * * The hearing in the court of common pleas shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action, and the court shall determine the rights of the parties in accordance with the laws applicable to a civil action. At the hearing, <em>counsel may be heard </em>on oral argument, <em>briefs may be submitted, </em>and <em>evidence may be introduced </em>if the court has granted a request for the presentation of additional evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">{\u00b6 18} This provision reveals that the administrative-appeals process was designed to give the trial court flexibility in selecting the process for resolution of the case. The court has the discretion to do as much as hold a full hearing with extensive participation from the parties or as little as review the appeal without oral argument, briefing, or additional evidence. However, this flexibility can be exercised only if the appellant identifies the alleged defects in the order or proceedings from which the appeal is taken. A general statement of factual and legal conclusions gives the trial court no guidance and essentially prevents the court from resolving the case summarily when it may be appropriate to do so (e.g., when the appellant\u2019s specific argument has recently been rejected in a controlling case). While a trial court could conceivably choose to review the entire record and identify specific errors on its own, giving proper effect to the words of the statute eliminates that necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">{\u00b6 19} Finally, several courts of appeals have held that trial courts may not dismiss administrative-agency appeals for failure to prosecute, even when the trial court orders or the local rules require the appellant to file a brief and the appellant fails to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In these circumstances, the notice of appeal will be the trial court\u2019s only source of guidance regarding the specific issues for appeal. If the appellant has provided only a restatement of the standard of review, the trial court will be forced to waste time combing through the record to pinpoint appealable issues. It makes sense that the General Assembly would place on an appellant the burden of identifying the specific grounds of appeal to promote efficient management of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">{\u00b6 20} In view of these reasons and the plain language of R.C. 119.12, we hold that to satisfy the \u201cgrounds of the party\u2019s appeal\u201d requirement in R.C. 119.12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>parties appealing under that statute must identify specific legal or factual errors in their notices of appeal; they may not simply restate the standard of review. While an extensive explanation of the alleged errors is not required at that point in the proceedings, the stated grounds must be specific enough that the trial court and opposing party can identify the objections and proceed accordingly, much in the same way that assignments of error and issues for review are presented in the courts of appeals and propositions of law are asserted in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">{\u00b6 21} MedCorp failed to designate precise errors in its notice of appeal; instead, it simply reiterated the statutory standard of review, that the order was \u201cnot in accordance with law and [was] not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d This statement does not strictly comply with the plain meaning of R.C. 119.12, and thus the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider MedCorp\u2019s appeal. See <em>Hughes v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 47, 2007-Ohio-2877, 868 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">{\u00b6 22} For the foregoing reasons, we answer the certified question in the affirmative, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and dismiss the cause for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">Judgment reversed and cause dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-9\">O\u2019Connor, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b761-10\">Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">.

I agree with the Tenth District Court of Appeals that MedCorp\u2019s notice of appeal set forth sufficient grounds to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. The plain language of R.C. 119.12 does not require an appealing party to state the \u201cgrounds of the party\u2019s appeal\u201d with any specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">{\u00b6 24} It is our duty to enforce a statute as written and not add or subtract from the statute. <em>In re Adoption of Holcomb </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 361, 366, 18 OBR 419, 481 N.E.2d 613. I believe that the majority has added a degree of specificity that the General Assembly did not include in the statute. Had the General Assembly intended to require specific grounds in the notice of appeal, it could have included language in R.C. 119.12 requiring the appealing party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>indicate <em>how </em>the order was not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">{\u00b6 25} As the court of appeals stated in <em>Derakhshan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>Franklin App. No. 07AP-261, 2007-0hio-5802, 2007 WL 3148684, \u201c[w]hile we can appreciate appellee\u2019s desire for more detail about appellant\u2019s arguments, R.C. 119.12 only requires an appellant to \u2018set[ ] forth * * * the grounds of the party\u2019s appeal.\u2019 It does not require an appellant to set forth specific facts to support those grounds, and we expressly decline to adopt such a requirement.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 119.12 is a general statute that covers appeals from many different agencies. Thus, \u201c[t]he language of the statute must be of a general nature to accommodate the many agencies within its purview.\u201d <em>Weissberg v. State, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 37207, 1977 WL 201689 (Dec. 22, 1977). The \u201cgrounds\u201d requirement may be met by simply stating in the operative words of R.C. 119.12 that the order appealed from \u201cis not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence, and/or is not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>Appeal of Stocker </em>(1968), 16 Ohio App.2d 66, 70, 45 O.O.2d 165, 241 N.E.2d 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">{\u00b6 27} MedCorp stated its grounds for appeal in general terms. The statute requires no more than that, and I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision adopting a more stringent standard. Consequently, I would affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-7\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b762-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">{\u00b6 28} I respectfully dissent. The majority opinion takes a dramatic step away from strict statutory construction and, rather than interpreting the words used in R.C. 119.12, simply adds its own requirement to the statute, thereby creating a wholly new procedure for filing a notice of appeal in these kinds of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">{\u00b6 29} The majority also fails to set forth the degree of specificity it requires to identify a legal or factual error in a notice of appeal. Here, for example, MedCorp\u2019s notice stated that MedCorp appealed because \u201c[t]he Adjudication Order [was] not in accordance with law and [was] not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.\u201d Is a specific statutory reference, or perhaps a case citation, necessary to meet the majority\u2019s \u201cspecific legal or factual errors\u201d standard? Courts use standards such as \u201ccontrary to law\u201d in all manner of cases and with good reason: the parties convey a specific legal thought with such expressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>{\u00b6 30} R.C. 119.12 does not set forth the \u201cspecificity\u201d requirement imposed by the majority. Rather, it calls for the notice of appeal to identify only the order appealed from and the \u201cgrounds\u201d of the party\u2019s appeal. It says nothing about legal or factual errors. Thus, in my view, an appeal may be taken on procedural or constitutional grounds by using the words \u201cnot in accordance with law,\u201d as MedCorp sought to do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Zier v. Bur. of Unemployment. Comp. </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 123, 38 O.O. 573, 84 N.E.2d 746, we held that a notice of appeal stating that the appellant appealed \u201cin accordance with his right to appeal under Section 1346M of the General Code\u201d failed to \u201c \u2018set forth the decision appealed from and the <em>errors </em>therein complained of \u201d and therefore failed to confer jurisdiction upon the court of common pleas. (Emphasis added.) <em>Zier </em>at 124, 126-127, 38 O.O. 573, 84 N.E.2d 746, quoting Section 1346-4, General Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">{\u00b6 32} However, the terms \u201cgrounds\u201d and \u201cerrors\u201d are not synonymous. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) defines \u201cground\u201d as \u201c[t]he reason or point that something (as a legal claim or argument) relies on for validity &lt; grounds for divorce&gt; &lt;several grounds for appeal&gt;.\u201d Id. at 723. In contrast, it defines \u201cerror\u201d as \u201c[a] mistake of law or of fact in a tribunal\u2019s judgment, opinion, or order,\u201d id. at 582, and further defines \u201cassignment of error\u201d as \u201c[a] specification of the trial court\u2019s alleged errors on which the appellant relies in seeking an appellate court\u2019s reversal, vacation, or modification of an adverse judgment,\u201d id. at 129. Thus, \u201cerrors\u201d are more specific than \u201cgrounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">{\u00b6 33} Here, in stating that \u201c[t]he Adjudication Order is not in accordance with law and is not supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence,\u201d MedCorp stated grounds for its appeal. Although it could have stated those grounds with more specificity, giving facts to demonstrate how the order was not in accordance with law and how it was not supported by the evidence, the plain language of the statute does not require it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">{\u00b6 34} Tinkering with statutes as the majority has chosen to do here only complicates the practice of law for practitioners, who rely on the words used by the legislature to determine what they must do to properly file a notice of appeal. R.C. 119.12 does not require an appellant to identify a specific legal or factual error, nor does it call for a party to \u201cdesignate precise errors,\u201d majority opinion at \u00b6 21, in its notice of appeal. The majority\u2019s decision to insert these requirements into this statute prevents me from joining it. I would urge the General Assembly to clarify its intent with regard to this important area of law.</p>\n<judges id=\"b763-9\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Asy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Geoffrey E.
