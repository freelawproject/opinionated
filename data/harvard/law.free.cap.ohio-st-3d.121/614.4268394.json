The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice for two years, staying the entire suspension on conditions, based on findings that he attempted to represent clients, both in and out of the courtroom, while intoxicated. We agree that respondent committed professional misconduct as found by the board and that a two-year suspension, conditionally stayed, is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged respondent in a two-count complaint with violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility and the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of board members heard the case, reviewed the parties\u2019 extensive stipulations, and made findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommended the two-year conditionally stayed suspension. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 The <em>August 3, 2006 Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZN\">{\u00b6 3} On the morning of August 3, 2006, respondent was scheduled to appear on behalf of clients in two different proceedings before the Huron County Common Pleas Court. When he arrived at the courthouse, a sheriffs deputy handling security suspected from respondent\u2019s appearance and breath that he was intoxicated. Opposing counsel in one of respondent\u2019s cases came to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>conclusion after trying to discuss the case with him. The lawyer reported his suspicions to a magistrate, and the magistrate confirmed the lawyer\u2019s impressions with the deputy sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 4} The magistrate reported respondent\u2019s condition to the common pleas judge, who brought respondent into his chambers and confronted him. The judge also observed the telltale signs of intoxication, including respondent\u2019s slurred speech and the odor of alcohol. Respondent acknowledged his intoxicated state, apologizing to the judge and conceding that he needed help. The judge forbade respondent to participate in the two hearings scheduled for that day, and respondent agreed to continuances at his cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent stipulated and the panel and board found the evidence clear and convincing that respondent\u2019s conduct during the proceedings on August 3, 2006, violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 The <em>Sandifer Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">{\u00b6 6} In April 2007, Michael Sandifer hired respondent to defend him against a criminal charge in the Norwalk Municipal Court. Sandifer met that month with respondent at his office, expecting to discuss the case. He ended up leaving the meeting abruptly because respondent was obviously intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent also appeared under the influence of alcohol at one of Sandifer\u2019s pretrial hearings. On May 9, 2007, respondent entered the municipal courtroom, walked by Sandifer without acknowledging his presence, and entered the judge\u2019s chambers. In chambers, the judge and the assistant law director prosecuting the case detected the odor of alcohol on him. The judge warned respondent that he would declare a mistrial and find respondent in contempt if he appeared at trial while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent did not heed the judge\u2019s warning. During a lunch break on the day of trial, Sandifer noticed that his attorney\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred and that he again smelled of alcohol. Respondent was unresponsive to Sandifer\u2019s request that he ask specific questions of a witness and instead repeatedly asked his client to remind him of the facts in the case. Sandifer feared that respondent was again under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">{\u00b6 9} A jury found Sandifer guilty as charged. In June 2007, Sandifer discharged respondent, asked for a refund of the $750 fee, and hired a new lawyer. In part because of respondent\u2019s possible intoxication during trial, the judge vacated the conviction, and Sandifer was convicted of a lesser crime. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>August 2007, after reviewing a draft of relator\u2019s complaint, respondent returned Sandifer\u2019s $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">(\u00b6 10} Respondent stipulated and the panel and board found the evidence clear and convincing that respondent\u2019s conduct in the Sandifer case violated Prof. Cond.R. 1.1 (a lawyer shall represent a client competently, with the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation), 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(h) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law). We accept these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">(\u00b6 11} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the duties violated by the lawyer in question and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. Before making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Troy, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 51, 2009-Ohio-502, 901 N.E.2d 809, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 12} We have already identified respondent\u2019s breaches of duties owed to his client, the legal profession, and the judicial system. Regarding sanctions in similar cases, we find <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Scurry, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 201, 2007-Ohio-4796, 874 N.E.2d 521, instructive. In that case, we suspended a lawyer\u2019s license for two years but stayed the suspension on conditions that the lawyer x-eceive assistance in his recovex-y from alcohol dependence. Like respondent, Scurxy also had attempted to conduct his professional affairs while intoxicated, including having meetings with clients. Although Scurry did not appear in court under the influence of alcohol, he did contact a local court on numerous occasions while inebx-iated.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b6 13} In respondent\u2019s case, finding no aggravating factors, the board weighed four mitigating factors in his favor. Respondent has no prior disciplinary record, his misconduct was not motivated by self-interest or dishonesty, he has cooperated fully in the disciplinary process, and he has offered persuasive evidence of his professional competence, good character, and reputation apart from the underlying misconduct. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), (b), (d), and (e). Similar mitigating evidence was px-esented in <em>Scurry, </em>although that lawyer had a history of professional discipline related to alcoholism. 115 Ohio St.3d 201, 2007-Ohio-4796, 874 N.E.2d 521, \u00b6 14. Moreover, both here and in <em>Scurry, </em>the lawyers satisfied BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g)(i) through (iv) (affording mitigating effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>upon a showing that (1) a lawyer has been diagnosed with alcoholism by a qualified health-care professional, (2) the alcoholism contributed to cause the misconduct, (3) he has successfully completed an approved treatment program, and (4) a qualified health-care professional has released him to return, under specified conditions if necessary, to the competent, ethical, and professional practice of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent has a long history of alcohol abuse that includes unsuccessful treatment regimes. Paul Caimi, associate director of the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d), testified about respondent\u2019s assessment as being alcohol dependent, a condition that obviously led to his intoxication on August 3, 2006, and in the Sandifer case. Respondent originally entered into an OLAP recovery contract on June 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">{\u00b6 15} Respondent complied with the terms of that contract to the extent of regularly attending group counseling meetings and getting a sponsor. Because he had no medical insurance and felt he could not leave his practice, however, he did not attend a recommended inpatient treatment program. He relapsed on July 4, 2007, by having an alcoholic beverage. Respondent reported the relapse to Caimi and has maintained sobriety ever since.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">{\u00b6 16} Notwithstanding his sobriety, respondent\u2019s failure to enter an inpatient treatment facility prompted Caimi in February 2008 to formally terminate his contract with OLAP for noncompliance. But in May 2008, respondent reconnected with Caimi and signed another recovery contract. At the time of the July 21, 2008 panel hearing, respondent had recently obtained an assessment from a psychiatrist who specializes in chemical dependence. He was waiting to receive the doctor\u2019s recommendations for a treatment plan, which Caimi understood would this time allow outpatient treatment. Caimi assured the panel that respondent was in compliance with his most recent OLAP contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">{\u00b6 17} The panel and board fully appreciated the threat that respondent\u2019s unmanaged alcohol dependence posed to the public. The panel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cWhen determining the sanction in this case, the Panel is faced with two incidents where Respondent consumed alcohol and attempted to represent clients while under the influence of alcohol. While the record is replete with testimony of Respondent\u2019s relapses from sobriety and failed treatment history, the Panel determined that ultimately the sanction must reflect the appropriate punishment for the violations set forth above. This is not to say that the Panel does not recognize the potential harm that could have occurred by Respondent\u2019s altered state while representing clients. Therefore, considering Respondent\u2019s long history of practice without a disciplinary record as mitigating and in view of his cooperation in the disciplinary process, the Panel recommends that Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>be suspended from the practice of law for a period of twenty-four months, with the period of suspension stayed subject to * * * conditions.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeR\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Philip A. King, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AK6Y\">Christensen, Christensen, Donchatz, Kettlewell <em>&amp; </em>Owens and Kenneth R. Donchatz, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">{\u00b6 19} The board adopted the panel\u2019s recommended conditions, which are aimed at assisting respondent\u2019s recovery and ensuring the public\u2019s protection. These conditions are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">{\u00b6 20} 1. Respondent must comply with the terms of his OLAP contract, including any inpatient or outpatient treatment program determined by OLAP;</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">{\u00b6 21} 2. Respondent must complete a two-year probation in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9), including quarterly reports to a monitoring attorney appointed by relator as to his compliance with OLAP treatment recommendations and his progress; and</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">{\u00b6 22} 3. Respondent must not commit any further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">{\u00b623} We accept the board\u2019s recommendation. Respondent is therefore suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years. The suspension is stayed on the listed conditions. If respondent violates the terms of the stay or his probation, the stay will be lifted, and his license to practice law will be suspended for the entire two years. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-11\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-15\">. Relator charged respondent with violations of the applicable rules for acts occurring before and after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which supersede the Code of Professional Responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
