See <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 540 N.E.2d 266. Therefore, our answer to the certified question is no. In a case involving multiple claims, a judgment in a declaratory judgment action is not a final, appealable order when the trial court finds that an insured is entitled to coverage but has not addressed the issue of damages, even though the order includes a Civ.R. 54(B) certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">{\u00b6 5} Plaintiff-appellee Styrk Walburn was a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by Charles W. Billingsley when it collided with a vehicle driven by Wendy Sue Dunlap on January 23, 2001. At the time of the accident, Walburn was in the scope and course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>{\u00b6 6} On January 23, 2003, plaintiffs-appellees, Styrk and Betty Walburn, filed a complaint against Wendy Sue Dunlap for negligent operation of a motor vehicle that resulted in injuries to Styrk Walburn. They included a claim for the loss of consortium of Betty Walburn. Because Dunlap was uninsured, the Walburns also asserted claims for uninsured- or underinsured-motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage under their own liability insurance policy from Ohio Mutual Insurance Group and under insurance policies issued by appellant, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (\u201cNational Union\u201d), to Walburn\u2019s employer. The Walburns requested an order determining the rights and responsibilities of the parties. The prayer for relief demanded an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">{\u00b6 7} The plaintiffs and National Union filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of the availability of UM coverage. On August 28, 2006, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, denied National Union\u2019s motion, and ordered that the plaintiffs were entitled to UM coverage under the National Union policies. The judgment entry stated, \u201cThis is a Final and Appealable order. The Court finds there is no just cause for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 8} National Union asked the trial court to reconsider its judgment, in part on the basis that it was not a final, appealable order, because the entry did not terminate the action or resolve all the claims against all parties. National Union also filed a notice of appeal with the Fourth District Court of Appeals <em>(\u201cWalburn </em>I\u201d). The trial court granted the motion for reconsideration and vacated the August 28, 2006 judgment. In response, National Union moved the court of appeals to dismiss its appeal. The court granted National Union\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 9} The plaintiffs again filed a motion for summary judgment in the trial court on the issue of Wendy Sue Dunlap\u2019s liability and their entitlement to UM coverage from National Union. The trial court granted partial summary judgment again to the plaintiffs on December 12, 2006. The judgment entry, almost identical to the August 28, 2006 entry, again stated that it was a final, appealable order and that there was no just cause for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">{\u00b6 10} National Union filed a notice of appeal from the December 12 judgment entry <em>(\u201cWalburn </em>II\u201d). The court of appeals raised concerns about the finality of the August 28, 2006 entry and ordered the parties to brief the issue of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the December 12, 2006 entry. The court of appeals subsequently dismissed <em>Walburn II </em>for lack of jurisdiction. The appellate court concluded that the August 28, 2006 order was a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) because it was an order that affected a substantial right made in a special proceeding and the trial court had included a Civ.R. 54(B) certification that there was no just reason for delay. 2007-Ohio-5398, 2007 WL 2916148, at \u00b6 10. The court of appeals also held that the trial court had lacked jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>reconsider and vacate the August 28 final order. Thus, when National Union voluntarily dismissed <em>Walburn I, </em>the court held, its right to appeal was terminated. Id. at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 11} The Fourth District Court of Appeals certified that its decision was in conflict with decisions by the Second, Ninth, and Tenth District Courts of Appeals in <em>Beheshtaein v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>Montgomery App. No. 20839, 2005-Ohio-5907, 2005 WL 2979656; <em>Walter v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>Summit App. No. 21032, 2002-Ohio-5775, 2002 WL 31387116; and <em>Tinker v. Oldaker, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 03AP-671 and 03AP-1036, 2004-Ohio-3316, 2004 WL 1405563.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 12} We determined that a conflict exists and ordered that the parties brief the issue. This cause is also before us on National Union\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cIt is well-established that an order must be final before it can be reviewed by an appellate court. If an order is not final, then an appellate court has no jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 20, 540 N.E.2d 266. \u201cAn appellate court, when determining whether a judgment is final, must engage in a two-step analysis. First, it must determine if the order is final within the requirements of R.C. 2505.02. If the court finds that the order complies with R.C. 2505.02 and is in fact final, then the court must take a second step to decide if Civ.R. 54(B) language is required.\u201d Id. at 21, 540 N.E.2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, the court of appeals applied R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), which provides, \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is * * * [a]n order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding * * The court determined that the trial court\u2019s August 28, 2006 order was a final order because it was a declaratory judgment that decided insurance coverage, thus affecting a substantial right of National Union, citing <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. </em>Because the trial court added a Civ.R. 54(B) certification, the order became final and appealable, according to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 15} We must first determine whether the August 28, 2006 order is a final order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). The answer depends upon whether this case falls within the dictates of <em>Gen. Acc. </em>or, as National Union contends, neither the August 28, 2006 order nor the December 12, 2006 order is a final order because they were not orders that affected a substantial right made in a special proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">{\u00b6 16} <em>Gen. Acc. </em>was an action for declaratory judgment in which the plaintiff insurance company asked the trial court to declare that the defendants Insurance Company of North America (\u201cINA\u201d) and National Union had a duty to defend and indemnify in a companion tort case. INA filed a counterclaim for a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend and also requested that General Accident be required to reimburse the $1 million that INA had contributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>General Accident\u2019s settlement of the underlying action. The trial court issued an order that INA had no duty to defend and included a Civ.R. 54(B) certification that there was no just reason for delay. General Accident appealed. INA moved to dismiss for lack of a final, appealable order. The court of appeals dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Gen. Acc., </em>we held that a declaratory judgment was a special proceeding and that the duty to defend involves a substantial right to both the insured and the insurer. Thus, the trial court\u2019s judgment was a final order under R.C. 2505.02 because it was \u201can order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reasoned that although there were other pending claims, the trial court had made a Civ.R. 54(B) determination that there was no just reason for delay, and thus, the order was a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 18} First, National Union contends that this declaratory judgment is not a special proceeding for purposes of R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). National Union argues that when an insured\u2019s demand for declaratory relief is made in the context of, and inextricably intertwined with, the insured\u2019s action for breach of contract, an order that declares that coverage exists is part of the underlying breach-of-contract action and not made in a special proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, we considered the question of what constitutes a final order in a special proceeding. We held, \u201cOrders that are entered in actions that were recognized at common law or in equity and were not specially created by statute are not orders entered in special proceedings pursuit to R.C. 2505.02.\u201d Id. at syllabus. We later clarified that \u201c[i]t is the underlying action that must be examined to determine whether an order was entered in a special proceeding.\u201d <em>Walters v. Enrichment Ctr. of Wishing Well, Inc. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 118, 121-122, 676 N.E.2d 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 20} On the other hand, \u201c[d]eclaratory judgment actions are a special remedy not available at common law or at equity.\u201d <em>Gen. Acc., </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 22, 540 N.E.2d 266. This definition has since been codified in R.C. 2505.02(A)(2): \u201c \u2018Special proceeding\u2019 means an action or proceeding that is specially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law or a suit in equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 21} Here, the Walburns sought a declaration of the parties\u2019 rights and responsibilities as they pertain to UM coverage for the Walburns\u2019 claims. Under <em>Gen. Acc. </em>and R.C. 2505.02(A)(2), this is a declaratory judgment action that is a special proceeding for purposes of R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>{\u00b6 22} However, this conclusion does not end the analysis. Next, we must determine whether an order that declares that an insured is entitled to UM coverage but does not address damages affects a substantial right for purposes of R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). Since <em>Gen. Acc., </em>R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) has been added to define \u201csubstantial right\u201d as \u201ca right that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 23} National Union contends that an order that declares that an insured is entitled to insurance coverage but does not rule on whether the insured is entitled to damages does not affect a substantial right. National Union cites the conflict case <em>Tinker v. Oldaker, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 03AP-671 and 03AP-1036, 2004-0hio-3316, 2004 WL 1405563, in which the Tenth District Court of Appeals concluded that an order that entitled an insured to UM coverage but did not decide damages did not affect a substantial right and was not a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Gen. Acc., </em>we held that the duty to defend involves a substantial right to both the insured and the insurer. 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 540 N.E.2d 266, at paragraph one of the syllabus. We discussed the immediate consequences to both the insured and the insurer of a decision regarding the duty to defend. If an insurer mistakenly refuses to defend its insured, that insurer is liable for the costs of defending its insured in the initial litigation and of defending itself in a subsequent action by its insured. On the other hand, the insurer may incur substantial costs if wrongfully required to defend an insured in a case that a court may later hold was not within the terms of the policy. Id. at 21, 540 N.E.2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 25} Likewise, an insured, when not provided with a defense, may have to choose a quick settlement over costly litigation, file a separate declaratory judgment action against the insurer, or incur great expense defending without insurance. Id. at 22, 540 N.E.2d 266. Because the duty to defend was of great importance to both the insured and the insurer, we concluded that it involved a substantial right. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 26} A declaration that an insured is entitled to UM coverage presents a different scenario. Here, the court ordered that National Union must provide UM coverage. However, the Walburns must still establish their damages in order to receive the UM benefits. National Union is obligated to pay the Walburns only if they are awarded damages. Thus, a declaration that an insured is entitled to coverage but does not address damages does not affect a substantial right as that term is defined in R.C. 2505.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 27} Cases in which an insured seeks both a defense and indemnification are controlled by <em>Gen. Acc. </em>This case, however, involves only the insured\u2019s entitlement to coverage and does not involve a duty to defend. While a decision regarding the duty to defend immediately affects a substantial right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>insured or insurer, a decision that an insured is entitled to UM coverage, without a determination of damages, does not. Consequently, we hold that an order that declares that an insured is entitled to UM coverage but does not determine damages does not affect a substantial right for purposes of R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). The August 28, 2006 judgment entry in this case did not affect a substantial right made in a special proceeding and, therefore, was not a final order as defined in R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 28} The conflict cases recognized this distinction. In <em>Tinker v. Oldaker, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 03AP-671 and 03AP-1036, 2004-Ohio-3316, 2004 WL 1405563, the plaintiffs were injured in a motor vehicle accident caused by Christy Oldaker. Their complaint arguably sought a declaration that they were entitled to UM coverage from the company that insured Mr. Tinker\u2019s employer and for an award of damages. Id., \u00b6 12, fn. 2. The trial court ordered that the plaintiffs were entitled to UM coverage but did not address damages. The appellate court in <em>Tinker </em>concluded that there was no final, appealable order. \u201c[E]ven assuming the order was rendered in a special proceeding, it did not \u2018affect\u2019 a substantial right.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 29} In <em>Walter v. Allstate Ins., </em>Summit App. No. 21032, 2002-Ohio-5775, 2002 WL 31387116, the plaintiffs sought a declaration that they were entitled to UM coverage under their personal automobile policy for damages that Mary Walter sustained in a collision with another vehicle. The trial court granted summary judgment on the issue of UM coverage, but did not decide damages. \u00b6 6. The Ninth District Court of Appeals determined that an order determining liability but deferring the issue of damages was not a final order. \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 30} In <em>Beheshtaein v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>Montgomery App. No. 20839, 2005-0hio-5907, 2005 WL 2979656, the Second District Court of Appeals concluded that despite the order\u2019s Civ.R. 54(B) certification, the summary judgment on the issue of insurance coverage was interlocutory because other issues involving damages and priority of coverage had not yet been resolved. \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 31} Because this was not a final order, the Civ.R. 54(B) determination of no just reason for delay was of no effect. See <em>Gen. Acc., </em>44 Ohio St.3d at 21, 540 N.E.2d 266. \u201cAs a general rule, even where the issue of liability has been determined, but a factual adjudication of relief is unresolved, the finding of liability is not a final appealable order even if Rule 54(B) language was employed.\u201d <em>Noble v. Colwell </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 92, 96, 540 N.E.2d 1381. A trial court\u2019s use of such language does not convert an otherwise nonfinal order into a final, appealable order. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 32} Consequently, we answer no to the certified question. We hold that in a case involving multiple claims, a judgment in a declaratory judgment action is not a final, appealable order when the trial court finds that an insured is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>coverage but has not addressed the issue of damages, even though the order includes a Civ.R. 54(B) certification.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APx\">Agee, Clymer, Mitchell &amp; Laret and C. Russell Canestraro, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AnFK\">Janik, Dorman &amp; Winter, L.L.P., Steven G. Janik, and Christopher Van Blargan, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 33} The trial court again granted partial summary judgment to the Walburns on the issue of UM coverage under the National Union policy on December 12, 2008. Even though the trial court had included a Civ.R. 54(B) determination in both the August 28, 2006 and the December 12, 2006 orders, because the trial court had not yet determined the issue of damages, neither judgment entry was a final, appealable order, and the parties\u2019 rights to appeal have not yet attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 34} Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals, and we remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-8\">Moyer, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b514-9\">Pfeifer, J., dissents and would dismiss the cause as having been improvidently accepted and certified.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\">. <em>Gen.
