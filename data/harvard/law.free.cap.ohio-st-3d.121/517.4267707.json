Pursuant to Civ.R. 53 and Loc.R. 12(M) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Tenth District Court of Appeals, the matter was referred to a magistrate, who issued a decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law. The magistrate found that Findlay Industries\u2019 evidence had not been timely submitted, relieving the commission of any duty to consider it. Findlay Industries filed no objections to that magistrate\u2019s report, which the court of appeals adopted as its own.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdJA\">William W.

Appellant, however, did not object to those conclusions as Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b) requires. Thus, pursuant to that rule and <em>State ex rel. Booker v. Honda of Am.
