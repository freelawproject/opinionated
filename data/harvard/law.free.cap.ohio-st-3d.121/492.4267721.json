Craftsmen is in the home-renovation business, and it employs salespersons who schedule in-home appointments with prospective customers to discuss their remodeling needs. During the visits, sales personnel take measurements and gather other information to prepare estimates. After that, any further contact between the customer and salesperson takes place in Craftsmen\u2019s showroom, not at the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">{\u00b6 2} Initially, these employees were classified according to the bureau\u2019s State Insurance Fund Manual under former classification code No. 8747 \u2014 \u201ctraveling salesperson \u2014 no handling or delivery of products.\u201d That classification was later changed to code 8742, \u201coutside salespersons,\u201d after the bureau adopted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>National Council of Compensation Insurance (\u201cNCCI\u201d) classification scheme as required by R.C. 4123.29(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 3} The bureau periodically reviewed its classifications and, in 2005, reclassified Craftsmen\u2019s sales employees into code 5605, \u201cconstruction estimators.\u201d This reclassification significantly increased Craftsmen\u2019s premiums. Craftsmen objected to the reassignment, and the matter was heard by the bureau\u2019s Adjudicating Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 4} Craftsmen argued that nothing had changed in its employees\u2019 job description to warrant the reclassification. It asserted that its employees did not satisfy the criteria for code 5605 because its sales staff was not exposed to construction but instead went into existing client homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 5} The bureau pointed out that code 5605 defined a construction site as follows: \u201cA space of ground occupied or to be occupied by a building. The location can have an existing building (commercial or residential) or building under construction.\u201d The bureau maintained that employees were thus on a \u201cconstruction site\u201d preparing estimates, which made code 5605 the appropriate classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 6} The committee upheld the classification. It made no findings of fact and merely summarized the parties\u2019 positions. It closed with these observations and this holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe BWC representative noted that this employer is on the low end of the bell curve of what may be considered a construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cWhile the Committee is not unsympathetic to the employer\u2019s situation, the Adjudicating Committee finds that the reclassification was proper under the NCCI classification system. Therefore, the employer\u2019s protest shall be DENIED and the audit findings affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 9} That decision was affirmed on appeal to the designee of the predecessor of appellant, Marsha Ryan, the administrator of workers\u2019 compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 10} Craftsmen filed a complaint in mandamus against the administrator in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the bureau\u2019s order was contrary to law and did not adequately explain its reasoning as required by <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245. The court agreed. It held that, contrary to the bureau\u2019s representation, the order was not self-explanatory. The court cited code 5605\u2019s scope provision, which limited the classification\u2019s applicability to employees who \u201csell or estimate the costs of construction, erection or rigging activities outside of an office environment <em>mth exposure to construction, erection or rigging hazards at the job/construction site.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The provision also referred to \u201cexposure to field hazards\u201d and further stated that \u201c[ejstimators who go to the job/construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>site to determine the cost of a job have an increase in job hazards compared to the typical outside salesperson.\u201d These comments prompted the court of appeals to conclude:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cOne of the key criteria for determining the applicability of manual 5605 is whether the salespersons are exposed to construction, erection, or rigging hazards and whether the salespersons are subjected to an increase in job hazards compared to the typical outside salesperson. The bureau\u2019s order fails to address this criterifion]. This failure is particularly significant because the bureau\u2019s order acknowledges that the reclassification was a close call.\u201d 2007-0hio-5919, 2007 WL 3261309, at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 12} The court granted a writ that ordered the bureau to vacate its order and issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 13} The administrator now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 14} The administrator contends that the traditional deference that is accorded to the bureau\u2019s expertise in rate-making matters exempts it from having to explain its reclassification decision. Alternatively, she claims that the bureau has adequately explained its reclassification of Craftsmen\u2019s sales staff from code 8742 to code 5605. The court of appeals disagreed with both propositions, and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 15} We have long recognized the bureau\u2019s considerable expertise and experience in premium-related matters. <em>State ex rel. Reaugh Constr. Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1928), 119 Ohio St. 205, 209, 162 N.E. 800; <em>State ex rel. Minutemen, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 580 N.E.2d 777. That expertise, however, does not supersede the duty this court has imposed upon the Industrial Commission and the bureau to adequately explain their decisions. In <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, we held that the Industrial Commission of Ohio must properly explain its decisions, and in <em>State ex rel. Ochs v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 674, 710 N.E.2d 1126, we imposed that same duty on the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 16} The administrator summarizes her second proposition in this passage:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cCraftsmen fits within this occupational description [code 5605] and the BWC need not describe in any more detail why it was making a change. * * * The order rendered by the Adjudicating Committee found \u2018that the reclassification was proper under NCCI classification system.\u2019 Though concise, this is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">{\u00b6 18} The administrator\u2019s position seems to imply that in premium-related matters, if the bureau says something is so, it is so, and that is explanation enough. <em>Ochs, </em>however, reiterated that \u201c[t]he purpose of an explanation require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ment is \u2018to inform the parties and potentially a reviewing court of the basis for the [agency\u2019s] decision.\u2019 \u201d 85 Ohio St.3d at 675, 710 N.E.2d 1126, quoting <em>State ex rel. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 139, 142, 642 N.E.2d 378. The sufficiency of the bureau\u2019s order must, therefore, be measured against a larger audience than just that agency, and what may be self-explanatory to the bureau may not be self-explanatory to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 19} The court of appeals found that the contested order was not self-explanatory. The administrator suggests that even if the Craftsmen employees at issue could fall under either \u201c8742-outside salespersons\u201d or \u201c5605-construction estimators,\u201d it was within the bureau\u2019s prerogative to select one over the other. But as the court of appeals stressed, these are not equivalent categories. One, by definition, entails a greater occupational risk than the other. According to the NCCI\u2019s scope provision for code 5605, one of the distinguishing features between the two is the \u201cincrease in job hazards.\u201d The construction-estimator classification \u201cis available only to employees who sell or estimate the costs of construction, erection or rigging activities outside of an office environment <em>with exposure to construction, erection or rigging hazards at the job/construction site.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 20} It is not enough that the bureau consider a prospective customer\u2019s home to be a job or construction site. There also must be an increased construction hazard to the Craftsmen employee. The bureau\u2019s order did not discuss that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 21} The bureau argues that <em>State ex rel. RMS of Ohio, Inc. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>113 Ohio St.3d 154, 2007-Ohio-1252, 863 N.E.2d 160, is precedent for upholding classification orders that, while cursory, are self-explanatory. <em>RMS, </em>however, differs because the two classifications there were immediately distinguishable. One classification applied to charitable organizations and one did not. Consequently, when the bureau made the lone finding that RMS was not a charitable endeavor, the reason for the chosen classification was self-evident. No comparable distinction exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 22} The bureau\u2019s order, as the court of appeals noted, characterized the classification into code 5605 as \u201ca close call\u201d for an employer that \u201cis on the low end of the bell curve of what may be considered a construction site.\u201d There was no discussion of the increased site hazard that the NCCI clearly anticipated with the classification. The court of appeals correctly ordered the bureau to issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 23} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Sebaly, Shillito &amp; Dyer, L.P.A., and Danyelle S.T.
