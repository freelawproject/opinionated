Maher of Barberton, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0024038, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1977. The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we indefinitely suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice, based on findings that he committed professional misconduct, including multiple acts of dishonesty and failing to provide competent legal representation to clients. We adopt the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and accept the recommendation for an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Akron Bar Association, charged respondent with numerous violations of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring cooperation in a disciplinary investigation), the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A panel of the board heard the case, making findings of misconduct and recommending the indefinite suspension. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">{\u00b6 3} The parties have not objected to the board report.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">{\u00b6 4} Clear and convincing evidence established that respondent committed misconduct in connection with three separate attorney-client relationships. The first case involved a wrongful-death claim arising out of a nursing home incident, the second case involved a civil protection order in a domestic relations dispute, and the third case involved a probate estate and the subsequent bankruptcy of the executor. Clear and convincing evidence also shows that respondent commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ted misconduct by making untrue statements in a previous disciplinary proceeding, <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Maher, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 346, 2006-Ohio-4575, 853 N.E.2d 660 <em>(\u201cMaher I </em>\u201d), to obtain leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\n<em>A. The Respondent\u2019s Professional Duties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Avo\">{\u00b6 5} As a member of the Ohio bar, respondent owes duties to his clients, the general public, the legal profession, and the legal system. In addition to Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), the following ethical standards are at stake:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 6} 1. DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6), which respectively prohibit a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u201d and \u201cother conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">{\u00b6 7} 2. DR 1-104, which in requiring disclosures concerning professional liability insurance provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(A) A lawyer shall inform a client at the time of the client\u2019s engagement of the lawyer or at any time subsequent to the engagement if the lawyer does not maintain professional liability insurance * * *. The notice shall be provided to the client on a separate form * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(B) A lawyer shall maintain a copy of the notice signed by the client for five years after termination of representation of the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">{\u00b6 10} 3. DR 2 \u2014 110(A)(2), which in prohibiting improper withdrawal from legal representation provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c[A] lawyer shall not withdraw from employment until the lawyer has taken reasonable steps to avoid foreseeable prejudice to the rights of his or her client, including giving due notice to his or her client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, delivering to the client all papers and property to which the client is entitled, and complying with applicable laws and rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">{\u00b6 12} 4. DR 6-101(A)(l) and (3), which respectively prohibit a lawyer from handling \u201ca legal matter which he knows or should know that he is not competent to handle, without associating with him a lawyer who is competent to handle it\u201d and neglect of an entrusted legal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">{\u00b6 13} 5. DR 9-102(A) and (B)(4), which respectively require a lawyer to deposit all client funds other than costs and expenses in one or more separate, identifiable bank accounts maintained in the state and to promptly pay or deliver upon request property in the lawyer\u2019s possession that the client is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">{\u00b6 14} 6.

Prof.Cond.R. 1.16, which governs declining or terminating legal representation and provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(d) As part of the termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps, to the extent reasonably practicable, to protect a client\u2019s interest. The steps include * * * delivering to the client all papers and property to which the client is entitled, and complying with applicable laws and rules. Client papers and property shall be promptly delivered to the client. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(e) A lawyer who withdraws from employment shall refund promptly any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned [with an exception not relevant here].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">{\u00b6 22} 9. Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) and (h), which respectively prohibit a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice and \u201cother conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\n<em>B. The Respondent\u2019s Improprieties in Attorney-Client Relationships</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">1. The Ward Case</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">{\u00b6 23} After their disabled son died in a nursing home incident on March 22, 2004, Gary and Susan Ward engaged respondent in April 2004 to pursue damages for the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">{\u00b6 24} Respondent does not now dispute the findings that he breached ethical duties in representing the Wards. Although he did not file suit until the last day of the applicable two-year statute of limitations, respondent failed without cause to fully investigate the negligence claim either before or after he filed the complaint. Moreover, other than obtaining a coroner\u2019s report, respondent made no effort to enlist the expert witness testimony essential to winning the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">{\u00b6 25} Respondent also failed without cause to respond to discovery requests. He did not obey court orders requiring his compliance with these requests, which led the defendant to move for dismissal. When the defendant later moved for summary judgment, respondent was prepared neither to respond nor to go to trial if the court denied the motion. To conceal his lack of preparation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>respondent voluntarily dismissed the Wards\u2019 case in early December 2006 without telling his clients the real reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">{\u00b6 26} Respondent conceded that he should have associated with experienced co-counsel and that he misled the Wards about the reason for the voluntary dismissal of their case. Moreover, though respondent did file an action to open an estate for the Wards\u2019 deceased son for the purpose of pursuing a wrongful-death action, he did not dutifully proceed, and he disregarded orders of the probate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 27} The Wards discharged respondent in December within days of the voluntary dismissal and demanded their files. Later that month, respondent did not honor the written requests of the Wards and their new attorney for their files. Respondent had no basis for withholding the Wards\u2019 files.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 28} Respondent did not produce the Wards\u2019 files until early March 2007, after they filed one of the underlying grievances against him. Respondent did not initially respond to relator\u2019s inquiries about the grievance. Finally, respondent neither carried professional liability insurance nor gave the Wards notice, in writing or otherwise, that he lacked this coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 29} Respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(l) and (3) with his neglect and professional incompetence in the Ward case. He did not sufficiently investigate, comply with discovery requests, or look for a needed expert; nor did he seek competent assistance. He did not determine whether to join potentially liable defendants, and he then dismissed the complaint on false pretenses. Respondent compromised the Wards\u2019 opportunity to recover for their son\u2019s death with delay that risked the loss of evidence, by compromising their ability to dismiss the cause again without prejudice, and by allowing the statute of limitations to pass on claims against other potentially liable parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 30} Respondent violated DR 1-104(A) by not properly disclosing his lack of professional malpractice insurance. He violated DR 1-102(A)(4) by not truthfully disclosing his lack of expertise or the status of the lawsuit. Respondent further violated DR 2-110(A)(2) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(d) by failing without justification to promptly deliver the Wards\u2019 papers on demand. Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, including his failure to respond during relator\u2019s investigation, reflected poorly on his fitness to practice law, in violation of DR 1-102(A)(6) and Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">2. The Stoner Case</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">{\u00b6 31} Terri D. Stoner engaged respondent in October 2006 to enforce a civil protective order (\u201cCPO\u201d) that she had obtained against an assailant. Respondent knew that Stoner expected him to immediately begin proceedings against her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Respondent does not now dispute the findings that he breached ethical duties in representing Stoner. Despite the threat to Stoner\u2019s safety and her repeated requests for additional protection, respondent failed to take any action on her behalf other than to prepare in mid-November 2006 an affidavit that he never filed. Respondent had no excuse for not filing the affidavit or for falsely advising Stoner, when she was able to communicate with him, that he was ably attending to her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 33} Stoner discharged respondent in January 2007 and requested the return of her files and fee. Respondent did not return the files for over six months. Respondent did not refund Stoner\u2019s money, which he had not deposited as unearned into his client trust account, until the panel hearing in March 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent neither carried professional liability insurance nor gave Stoner notice, in writing or otherwise, that he lacked this coverage. He further failed to respond to relator\u2019s initial efforts to investigate Stoner\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">{\u00b6 35} Respondent violated DR 6 \u2014 101(A)(3) with his neglectful inaction in not enforcing Stoner\u2019s CPO. He violated DR 1-104(A) and (B) by failing to properly disclose his lack of professional liability insurance. By failing to deposit unearned fees in a separate client trust account, he also violated DR 9-102(A) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a) and (c). Respondent did not give an honest account to his client about the status of her case, a breach of trust that constitutes a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4). He did not promptly return property to which she was entitled upon his discharge in violation of DR 2-110(A)(2) and 9-102(B)(4) and Prof. Cond.R. 1.15 and 1.16(d). Respondent violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) and Prof. Cond.R. 8.4(d) by disregarding relator\u2019s investigation. Respondent\u2019s acts and inaction reflected poorly on his fitness to practice, in violation of DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">3. The Hinkle Case</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">{\u00b6 36} Larry D. Hinkle engaged respondent in September or October 1997 to represent and assist in administering the estate of Hinkle\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">{\u00b6 37} Respondent does not now dispute the findings that he breached ethical duties in representing Hinkle. Though Hinkle\u2019s mother\u2019s estate was uncomplicated, with assets worth approximately $20,000, it remained open for ten years until the end of 2007, approximately five months after Hinkle retained new counsel because of respondent\u2019s inaction. In failing to wrap up the estate within a reasonable time, respondent defied directives of his client, the probate court, and a bankruptcy trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">{\u00b6 38} Respondent determined early in his representation of the estate that buyers purchasing property of the estate on land contract, who claimed to have paid in full, still owed approximately $10,000. Yet respondent did nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to convey the property or enforce the land contract, disregarding many requests from Hinkle and probate court notices and citations concerning the sale and closing the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 39} Hinkle and his wife filed bankruptcy in 2005. In the interests of Hinkle\u2019s creditors, the bankruptcy trustee repeatedly attempted to communicate with respondent about completing the administration of his mother\u2019s estate. The trustee had no success.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 40} Respondent did not carry professional liability insurance or give Hinkle notice, in writing or otherwise, that he lacked this coverage. Respondent also failed to respond to relator\u2019s initial efforts to investigate the Hinkle grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">{\u00b6 41} Respondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 by failing to administer the Hinkle estate in a timely and reasonably competent manner, a failure that complicated the sale of property in the estate and delayed his client\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy. He violated DR 1-104(A) and (B) by failing to properly disclose his lack of professional liability insurance. His failure to respond to relator\u2019s investigation and to the bankruptcy trustee violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d). Respondent\u2019s acts and inaction reflected poorly on his fitness to practice law and violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\"><em>C. Respondent\u2019s Previous Disciplinary Case </em>\u2014 Maher <em>I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">{\u00b6 42} Respondent was publicly reprimanded in <em>Maher I </em>for neglecting two clients in their pursuit of personal injury claims. As of the March 2006 panel hearing in <em>Maher I, </em>respondent still represented the Wards in their civil suit and Hinkle in probate court. He nevertheless told the hearing panel that he had returned to practicing only criminal and domestic relations law, the areas in which he was most proficient. 110 Ohio St.3d 346, 2006-Ohio-4575, 853 N.E.2d 660, \u00b6 12. Respondent also falsely told the panel that he had acquired professional liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">{\u00b6 43} The panel found that respondent misrepresented these facts to appear conscientious and contrite and to sway the panel toward leniency. With this misrepresentation, respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA lawyer\u2019s neglect of legal matters and failure to cooperate in the ensuing disciplinary investigation generally warrant an indefinite suspension from the practice of law in Ohio.\u201d <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Goodlet, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 7, 2007-Ohio-4271, 873 N.E.2d 815, \u00b6 20; see also <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Gosling, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 474, 2007-Ohio-4267, 873 N.E.2d 282, \u00b6 12; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Mathewson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 365, 2007-Ohio-2076, 865 N.E.2d 891. Evidence of mitigating factors \u2014 that respondent ultimately responded with candor during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>disciplinary process, has begun mental-health treatment, and has had difficulties in his personal life \u2014 do not warrant our departure from this rule.
