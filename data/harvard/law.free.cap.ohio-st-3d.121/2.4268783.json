R.C. 2725.04(D); <em>Day v. Wilson, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 566, 2008-Ohio-82, 880 N.E.2d 919, \u00b6 4. Although Hughley claims that he could not obtain copies of his commitment papers, there is no allegation in his petition that he requested copies of them from his sentencing court. Cf. <em>Goudlock v. Voorhies, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 398, 2008-Ohio-4787, 894 N.E.2d 692, \u00b6 15 (failure by habeas corpus petitioner to detail specific facts to support contention that a bindover entry could not be obtained without impairing the efficiency of the remedy of the writ).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hughley claimed only that the \u201crecord office,\u201d presumably of his prison, would not give him a \u201ccommitment verification form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b137-5\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-15\">.
