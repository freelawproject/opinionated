For the reasons that follow, we hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b238-15\">{\u00b6 2} On the night of September 27, 2006, Sergeant Mitchell Hershberger of the East Canton Police Department responded to an accident at 113 East Nassau Street in East Canton. A witness told Sergeant Hershberger that a red Ford Ranger had collided with a full-size van. The drivers had exchanged words and afterwards left the scene, with the Ford heading west on Nassau Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-16\">{\u00b6 3} Sergeant Hershberger noticed some debris left behind from the Ford. Approximately ten minutes later, he received another dispatch advising him that the Ford was hiding in the area of the former Coyote Restaurant, located about a half mile from East Canton. Hershberger went to the restaurant but did not find the Ford. Believing that the vehicle could be headed towards Canton, Sergeant Hershberger next drove out to Trump Road, about another half mile away.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-17\">{\u00b6 4} When Sergeant Hershberger arrived at Trump Road, he began heading back east, checking various businesses for the Ford. While he was checking a car wash, a motorist told Sergeant Hershberger that a vehicle heading west without any headlights almost hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Sergeant Hershberger got back on the road, continuing to go east towards East Canton, and eventually saw the Ford. Upon finding the truck, he observed that its front end was smashed and its headlights were not on. Sergeant Hershberger stopped the Ford, which appellee Adam Jones was driving, because the vehicle did not have its headlights on.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 6} After he had pulled over the vehicle, Sergeant Hershberger asked Jones and his passenger, appellee Shawn Skropits, whether they had any weapons in the truck, and appellees said that they did. In addition, Jones told Sergeant Hershberger that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, which was why he had left the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">{\u00b6 7} Sergeant Hershberger arrested appellees and charged each of them with one count of carrying a concealed weapon and one count of unlawful possession of dangerous ordnance. Appellees moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the search, arguing that because the stop violated R.C. 2935.03, which governs the territorial jurisdiction in which a police officer may make an arrest, it also violated the Fourth Amendment. After a hearing on the motion, the trial court denied appellees\u2019 requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">{\u00b6 8} Following the denial of their motions to suppress, appellees pleaded no contest to the charges, were found guilty by the trial court, and were sentenced to community control.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Fifth District Court of Appeals. The court of appeals reversed in a divided opinion, holding that there was neither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause to support Sergeant Hershberger\u2019s stop. The dissent, however, would have affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress based on <em>State v. Weideman </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">{\u00b6 10} The state appealed the reversals, and we exercised jurisdiction and consolidated the cases. <em>State v. Skropits, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2008-Ohio-1427, 883 N.E.2d 1075 (cause consolidated); <em>State v. Jones, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1438, 2008-Ohio-1279, 883 N.E.2d 456 (appeal accepted and cause consolidated); <em>State v. Skropits, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1423, 2008-Ohio-969, 882 N.E.2d 444 (appeal accepted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">{\u00b6 11} Our decision in <em>Weideman </em>and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Virginia v. Moore </em>(2008), \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559, are dispositive of this matter. Read together, <em>Weideman </em>and <em>Moore </em>stand for the principle that a law-enforcement officer who personally observes a traffic violation while outside the officer\u2019s statutory territorial jurisdiction has probable cause to make a traffic stop; the stop is not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>-, 128 S.Ct. at 1604, 170 L.Ed.2d 559; <em>Weideman, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">{\u00b6 12} We held in <em>Weideman </em>that \u201c[w]here a law enforcement officer, acting outside the officer\u2019s statutory territorial jurisdiction, stops and detains a motorist for an offense committed and observed outside the officer\u2019s jurisdiction, the seizure of the motorist by the officer is not unreasonable <em>per se </em>under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 13} The facts of <em>Weideman </em>closely mirror those of the present case. In <em>Weideman, </em>a police officer outside of his jurisdiction stopped a vehicle that he had observed traveling left of center. Id. at 502, 764 N.E.2d 997. The trial court denied Weideman\u2019s motion to suppress, but the court of appeals reversed, reasoning that because the officer had been outside of his jurisdiction, the arrest was unlawful under R.C. 2935.03(A)(1) and per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 503, 764 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 14} We reversed the appellate court\u2019s judgment. Specifically, we held that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s interest in protecting the public from a person who drives an automobile in a manner that endangers other drivers outweighs [the defendant\u2019s] right to drive unhindered.\u201d <em>Weideman, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 506, 764 N.E.2d 997. But because the stop was not per se unreasonable, it follows that a court could find that an extraterritorial stop is unreasonable based on the unique facts and circumstances of a particular case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 15} The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore, </em>however, removed any room for finding that a violation of a state statute, such as R.C. 2935.03, in and of itself, could give rise to a Fourth Amendment violation and result in the suppression of evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Officers stopped and arrested Moore for driving on a suspended license. <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1604, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. Under Virginia law, the officers should have issued Moore a summons rather than arresting him because driving on a suspended license was generally not an arrestable offense. Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1602, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. Following Moore\u2019s arrest, the officers found 16 grams of crack cocaine and $516 on his person. Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1601, 170 L.Ed.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">{\u00b6 16} Moore moved to suppress the evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds. Id. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 1602, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. The trial court denied the motion, but the Supreme Court of Virginia ultimately reversed the ruling. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>The United States Supreme Court then reversed that judgment, reinstating the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">{\u00b6 17} <em>Moore </em>explained that \u201cwhen an officer has probable cause to believe a person committed <em>even a minor crime </em>in his presence, the balancing of private and public interests is not in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. at 1604, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. The court further acknowledged that although states could legislate a higher standard on searches and seizures, those laws do not alter the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">{\u00b6 18} Applying Virginia\u2019s law to the facts of the case, the Supreme Court observed that although the statute provided a greater degree of protection than that afforded under the Fourth Amendment, it did not provide a remedy of suppression for a violation. <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1606, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. Thus, because of the need for consistency and bright-line standards when applying the Fourth Amendment, the court concluded that \u201cit is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law.\u201d Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">{\u00b6 19} In the case before us, it is undisputed that there was a violation of R.C. 2935.03(A)(1). However, the majority of the appellate court did not sufficiently appreciate the importance of the fact that Sergeant Hershberger personally observed Jones driving without headlights in the dark in clear contravention of several Ohio statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conduct constituted a traffic violation, thereby giving Sergeant Hershberger probable cause to initiate the stop because he had personally observed the violation. <em>Dayton v. Erickson </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 3, 11-12, 665 N.E.2d 1091 (\u201cwhere an officer has * * * probable cause to stop a motorist for any criminal violation, including a minor traffic violation, the stop is constitutionally valid\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">{\u00b6 20} The appellate court\u2019s focus on the fact that Sergeant Hershberger was outside his jurisdiction and on his reasons for being there is irrelevant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Fourth Amendment analysis. The sole focus of the inquiry should have been on the stop itself because the violation of R.C. 2935.03 does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation for the reasons expressed in <em>Moore. </em>See also <em>Rose v. Mulberry, Arkansas </em>(C.A.8, 2008), 533 F.3d 678, 679-680 (\u201cthe determinative issue is whether an arrest by a city police officer outside of his jurisdiction but made with probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law. * * * [The officer] lacked the authority under Arkansas law to make traffic stops and arrests on the Interstate. Nevertheless, because he had probable cause to arrest for the offense * * * no Fourth Amendment violation occurred\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 21} Although it could have done so,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the General Assembly chose not to provide any remedy for a violation of R.C. 2935.03(A)(1). Thus, pursuant to <em>Moore, </em>we are not in the position to rectify this possible legislative oversight by elevating a violation of R.C. 2935.03 to a Fourth Amendment violation and imposing the exclusionary rule, because the stop in this case was constitutionally sound. <em>Moore</em>, \u2014 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b6 22} Likewise, we must reject appellees\u2019 entreaties that we develop a balancing test for determining when to impose a suitable sanction for a law-enforcement officer\u2019s violation of the territorial limits on arrest powers. Generally, establishing a remedy for a violation of a statute remains in the province of the General Assembly, not the Ohio Supreme Court. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Democratic Party v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 246, 2006-Ohio-5202, 855 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 37. The Fourth Amendment simply does not require this result. <em>Moore, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 1608, 170 L.Ed.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 23} We share the concerns that appellees express about law-enforcement officers who violate the territorial requirements of R.C. 2935.03. However, as discussed above, the remedy for a violation of the statute falls within the realm of the legislative branch. The Fourth Amendment does not provide the remedy that appellees seek in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Moyer, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b243-6\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-16\">. In this respect, Justice Cook\u2019s concurring opinion was prescient in noting that the <em>Weideman </em>majority\u2019s Fourth Amendment balancing analysis was unnecessary when the stop is based upon probable cause. 94 Ohio St.3d at 507, 764 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-17\">. We note that the Fifth District issued its opinions in the cases before us prior to the release of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b241-18\">. See, e.g., R.C. 4513.03 (lights required between sunset and sunrise, during unfavorable weather conditions, or any other time when there is insufficient light, 4513.04 (every motor vehicle required to be equipped with two operable headlights, 4513.14 (headlights must be on during the times set forth in R.C. 4513.03), and 4513.15 (headlights required sufficient to reveal persons, vehicles, or substantial objects at a safe distance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b241-19\">. Our holding today does not modify well-settled law that reasonable suspicion is sufficient to justify an investigatory stop. See <em>United States v. Lopez-Soto </em>(C.A.9, 2000), 205 F.3d 1101, 1104. We discuss probable cause only to highlight the fact that an extraterritorial stop for a traffic violation based on probable cause is reasonable. <em>Whren v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89. Similarly, when the extraterritorial stop is based on reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause, <em>Weideman </em>still controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\">. For example, the General Assembly passed the speedy-trial statutes, R.C. 2945.71 et seq., to protect a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. <em>State ex rel. Micheel v. Vamos </em>(1945), 144 Ohio St. 628, 631, 30 O.O. 225, 60 N.E.2d 305. However, to guarantee that the right to a speedy trial is fully effectuated, the General Assembly also enacted R.C. 2945.73, which explicitly provides for dismissal of a case when the speedy-trial laws are violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b243-7\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAn\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 25} The sole issue before the court is whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a police officer\u2019s extraterritorial traffic stop. The majority reverses the judgment of the Fifth District Court of Appeals and holds that the trial court properly denied Jones\u2019s and Skropits\u2019s motions to suppress the evidence. I concur with that result based on the following three-part analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">(1) <em>Whether an officer\u2019s extraterritorial stop in violation of R.C. 2935.03 requires exclusion of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 26} As the court of appeals stated in its decision, \u201cRevised Code \u00a7 2935.03(A)(1) governs a police officer\u2019s jurisdiction to arrest. It is undisputed in this case that the arresting officer was outside of his territorial jurisdiction when he made the arrest as the subject vehicle was located outside of the East Canton border.\u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>Stark App. No. 2007-CA-00139, 2007-Ohio-5818, 2007 WL 3171206, \u00b6 16. Thus, it may be assumed that the officer violated R.C. 2935.03, and the question becomes whether the exclusionary rule applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 27} In <em>Kettering v. Hollen </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 232, 18 O.O.3d 435, 416 N.E.2d 598, this court unanimously answered the question in the negative. There, the court assumed that a Kettering police officer violated R.C. 2935.03 by stopping a car in the city of Dayton for erratic driving. Id. at 234, 18 O.O.3d 435, 416 N.E.2d 598. The issue was whether the statutory violation required application of the exclusionary rule. Id. Citing numerous cases in support, this court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cIt is clear * * * that the exclusionary rule will not ordinarily be applied to evidence which is the product of police conduct violative of state law but not violative of constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cWe turn now to examine the facts in this case to determine whether a constitutional violation occurred. We find none. At the outset, it is readily apparent that [the officer] had probable cause to arrest the defendant after observing his erratic driving behavior.\u201d Id. at 234-235, 18 O.O.3d 435, 416 N.E.2d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">{\u00b6 30} Thus, a violation of R.C. 2935.03 does not justify exclusion unless the violation also rises to a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>(2) <em>Whether an extraterritorial stop in violation of R.C. 2935.03 is a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment, thus requiring exclusion of evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>State v. Weideman </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997, a Ravenna police officer left his territory to conduct a routine errand, and while outside of the city limits, he observed a driver traveling left of center. Id. at 502, 764 N.E.2d 997. In violation of R.C. 2935.03, the officer stopped the vehicle, conducted a sobriety test, and detained the driver for drunk driving until a state trooper arrived to make the arrest. Id. at 502-503, 764 N.E.2d 997. This court eventually accepted review of the following conflict question certified by the Eleventh District Court of Appeals: \u201c \u2018Whether a stop and detention of a motorist by a police officer, who is <em>beyond </em>his or her jurisdictional limits, for an offense observed and committed <em>outside </em>the officer\u2019s jurisdiction automatically constitutes a <em>per se </em>unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, thereby triggering the mandatory application of the exclusionary rule to suppress all evidence flowing from the stop.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at 504, 764 N.E.2d 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 32} This court answered in the negative: \u201cWhere a law enforcement officer, acting outside the officer\u2019s statutory territorial jurisdiction, stops and detains a motorist for an offense committed and observed outside the officer\u2019s jurisdiction, the seizure of the motorist by the officer is not unreasonable <em>per se </em>under the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the officer\u2019s statutory violation does not require suppression of all evidence flowing from the stop.\u201d 94 Ohio St.3d at 506, 764 N.E.2d 997. Rather, the only issue is whether the officer had probable cause, and \u201c[t]he trial court did not err when it concluded that defendant\u2019s manner of operating her motor vehicle gave [the officer] sufficient probable cause to make the stop.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 33} Our conclusion in <em>Weideman </em>is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Virginia v. Moore </em>(2008), \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. There, a police officer stopped and arrested Moore on the belief that he was driving on a suspended license, but Virginia law provided that an officer could not arrest a driver for this offense. Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1602, 170 L.Ed.2d 559. The issue on appeal to the Supreme Court was whether the officer\u2019s violation of the state statute necessarily resulted in a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The court held that it did not: \u201c[W]hen an officer has probable cause to believe a person committed even a minor crime in his presence, the balancing of private and public interests is not in doubt. The arrest is constitutionally reasonable.\u201d Id. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1604, 170 L.Ed.2d 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">{\u00b6 34} Thus, in this case, the officer\u2019s extraterritorial stop and arrest of Jones and Skropits in violation R.C. 2935.03 is not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment requiring application of the exclusionary rule. The Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ment requires exclusion only when the officer lacked probable cause to make the stop; the fact that the stop was extraterritorial is irrelevant.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Av-\">John D. Ferrero, Stark County Prosecuting Attorney, and Ronald Mark Caldwell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZ6\">Tammi R. Johnson, Stark County Public Defender, and Steven A. Reisch, Assistant Public Defender, for appellee Adam David Jones.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">(3) <em>Whether the officer had probable cause to stop Jones and Skropits.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 35} Here, the police officer testified at the suppression hearing that he had personally observed that the headlights on Jones and Skropits\u2019s truck were nonfunctional, in violation of several sections in R.C. Chapter 4513. When an officer personally observes a traffic violation, the officer has probable cause to initiate a traffic stop. <em>Bowling Green v. Godwin, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 58, 2006-Ohio-3563, 850 N.E.2d 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 36} It could be argued that the broken headlights were mere pretext and that the real reason for stopping Jones and Skropits was the officer\u2019s subjective belief that they were involved in a \u201chit-skip\u201d accident in East Canton, a violation that the officer did not observe. The United States Supreme Court, however, has consistently rejected subjective analyses and other claims of pretext in the context of probable cause. See <em>Whren v. United States </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 806, 813-814, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89, quoting <em>United States v. Robinson </em>(1973), 414 U.S. 218, 221, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427, fn. 1 (\u201cwe have been unwilling to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers * * *.
