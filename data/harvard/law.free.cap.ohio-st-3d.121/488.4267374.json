Appellant, Bio-Medical Application of Ohio, Inc., d.b.a. FMC Dialysis Services of Richland County (\u201cBio-Medical\u201d), owns and operates the Richland County Kidney Dialysis Center. According to the complaint, employees of the center either physically dropped Stevie or allowed him to fall from a mechanical lift device that was used to move him from a wheelchair and into position for dialysis. As a result of the fall, Stevie suffered a fractured hip, abrasions, and other injuries. In February 2004, Stevie died.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 4} Almost two years later, in October 2005, appellee Betty Stevie, as widow and executor of appellee the estate of Donald Stevie, filed a complaint for personal injuries and other tort damages against appellant, Bio-Medical.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 5} Bio-Medical filed an answer and a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Bio-Medical asserted that notwithstanding Stevie\u2019s styling of the claims as claims for personal injury, the claims nevertheless arose in the course of medical treatment, were essentially medical claims falling within the R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) definition of \u201cmedical claims,\u201d and were subject to the R.C. 2305.113(A) one-year statute of limitations. Further, Bio-Medical contended that the claims were time-barred because Stevie\u2019s complaint was filed more than one year after the date of the injury. In a one-sentence entry without any supporting rationale, the trial court granted Bio-Medical\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed Stevie\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 6} Upon review, a divided appellate court concluded that it was not clear from the face of Stevie\u2019s complaint whether or not claims based on Mr. Stevie\u2019s injuries constituted R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) medical claims, which are subject to the one-year statute of limitations. Specifically, the court stated that it could not unambiguously determine whether the complained-of injuries occurred while Stevie was under the care and direction of a medical provider or in a facility specified in the R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) definition of \u201cmedical claim.\u201d <em>Estate of Stevie v. Bio-Medical Application of Ohio, Inc., </em>Richland App. No. 2006 CA 0095, 2008-Ohio-33, 2008 WL 77470, \u00b6 20. Consequently, the appellate court reversed the trial court and remanded the case for a determination of whether Stevie\u2019s complaint alleged an R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) medical claim. Id., \u00b6 20, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 7} Thereafter, Bio-Medical appealed to this court, and we accepted review under our discretionary jurisdiction. <em>Estate of Stevie v. Bio-Medical Application of Ohio, Inc., </em>118 Ohio St.3d 1432, 2008-Ohio-2595, 887 N.E.2d 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 8} Although an action for bodily injury must generally be brought within two years after the cause'of action accrues, R.C. 2305.10(A), certain medical claims are subject to the shorter one-year statute of limitations set forth at R.C. 2305.113.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This one-year limitation statute specifically lists and defines the types of claims included within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 9} As pertinent to this appeal, \u201cmedical claim\u201d has the following specific, defined statutory meaning:</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(3) \u2018Medical claim\u2019 means any claim <em>that is asserted in any civil action against </em>a physician, podiatrist, hospital, home, or residential facility, against any employee or agent of a physician, podiatrist, hospital, home, or residential facility, or against a licensed practical nurse, registered nurse, advanced practice nurse, physical therapist, physician assistant, emergency medical technician-basic, emergency medical technician-intermediate, or emergency medical technician-paramedic, <em>and that arises out of </em>the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person. \u2018Medical claim\u2019 includes the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(a) Derivative claims for relief that arise from the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person;</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 12} <em>\u201c(b) Claims that arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person and to which either of the following applies:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">{\u00b6 13} <em>\u201c(i) The claim results from acts or omissions in providing medical care.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(ii) The claim results from the hiring, training, supervision, retention, or termination of caregivers providing medical diagnosis, care, or treatment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2305.113(E)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">{\u00b6 15} Further, the statute also lists and defines the medical providers included within the R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) definition of \u201cmedical claim.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-13\">{\u00b6 16} Both parties in this appeal assert that the definition of \u201cmedical claim\u201d set forth in R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) is plain and unambiguous. We agree. Therefore, our analysis is limited to applying the legislature\u2019s enactment and giving it effect according to its plain meaning. <em>Slingluffv. Weaver </em>(1902), 66 Ohio St. 621, 64 N.E. 574, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 17} Bio-Medical argues that the R.C. 2305.113(A) limitations period applies even if only one portion of the R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) definition is satisfied. Specifically, Bio-Medical asserts that Stevie\u2019s claim meets the definition of \u201cmedical claim\u201d through the sole application of this clause: \u201c \u2018Medical claim\u2019 includes * * * [c]laims that arise out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person [when the] claim results from acts or omissions in providing medical care.\u201d R.C. 2305.113(E)(3)(b). According to Bio-Medical, because Mr. Stevie\u2019s injury resulted from the acts or omissions of the dialysis center\u2019s staff in connection with his dialysis treatment, Stevie presented a medical claim within the purview of R.C. 2305.113(E)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 18} Bio-Medical may be correct that Stevie\u2019s claim arises out of the diagnosis, care, or treatment of a person. However, Bio-Medical ignores the portion of the statute that also requires that the claim be asserted against one or more of the specific medical professionals or facilities listed in R.C. 2305.113(E)(3). The term \u201cmedical claim\u201d as defined in R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) has two components that the statute states in the conjunctive: (1) the claim is asserted against one or more of the specifically enumerated medical providers and (2) the claim arises out of medical diagnosis, care, or treatment. We must give full meaning to all of the express statutory language. See, e.g., <em>In re Estate of Roberts </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 311, 314, 762 N.E.2d 1001; <em>Wachendorf v. Shaver </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 231, 237, 36 O.O. 554, 78 N.E.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, based on the plain meaning of the legislature\u2019s enactment, we hold that for the purposes of the R.C. 2305.113(A) one-year statute of limitations, a medical claim under R.C. 2305.113(E)(3) is a claim that both (1) arises out of the medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of any person and (2) is asserted against one or more of the statutorily enumerated medical providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, as the appellate court correctly concluded, because Stevie\u2019s complaint did not clearly indicate whether any of her claims were asserted against medical providers enumerated in R.C. 2305.113(E), the trial court\u2019s judgment on the pleadings in favor of Bio-Medical was premature. Remand is appropriate because further proceedings in the trial court are required to determine whether Stevie\u2019s complaint alleges a medical claim within the purview of R.C. 2305.113.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 21} For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Judgment affirmed and cause remanded.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AST\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Benham &amp; Ream Co., L.P.A., Jeffery S.
