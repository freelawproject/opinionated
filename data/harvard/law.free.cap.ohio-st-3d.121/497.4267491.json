The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline recommends that we suspend respondent for two years with one year stayed upon conditions for creating a fictional law firm and for misconduct involving legal fees. We agree that respondent committed these acts of misconduct, and we also find that respondent acted improperly in failing to pay a disputed expert-witness deposition fee and failing to pay child support while contesting that amount through the legal process. In view of these serious ethical violations, we do not accept the board\u2019s recommended two-year suspension with one year stayed and instead indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a complaint against respondent, alleging that he violated numerous Disciplinary Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct in (1) failing to pay a disputed expert-witness deposition fee, (2) failing to pay contested child support, (3) using a misleading law firm name, and (4) accepting legal fees while suspended and improperly sharing legal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">{\u00b6 3} A panel of the board considered the case against respondent. The panel determined that relator proved only that respondent had used a misleading law firm name, accepted legal fees while he was suspended, and improperly shared legal fees, and it recommended that the other two charges be dismissed. After reviewing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the panel recommended suspending respondent for six months, with conditions for reinstatement. The board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct but determined that respondent should be suspended for two years with one year stayed on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 4} Both parties have filed objections to the board\u2019s decision. We will therefore review all four counts in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">II. Counts against Respondent</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>A. Count One </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to pay disputed expert fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 5} This count arises from respondent\u2019s actions in connection with a deposition taken in <em>McCord v. McCord, </em>Franklin C.P. No. 96-DR-03-1234, a child-support matter against his ex-wife, Iris Cooper. Respondent, representing himself, requested the deposition of Theodore Johnson, an expert witness for Cooper. Respondent stated that he would pay Johnson for his preparation and deposition time.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 6} Immediately after the deposition ended, Johnson gave respondent a bill. Respondent gave Johnson a check for the full amount and noted in the memo that the payment was for \u201cTed\u2019s deposition\u201d; he did not note that he was making the payment under protest or with any rights reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 7} The next day, however, respondent stopped payment on the check, and Johnson\u2019s employer incurred bank charges for the returned item. Respondent testified in his disciplinary hearing that he had stopped payment because he felt that Johnson was unprepared and gave incomplete and evasive answers. After payment was stopped, respondent refused to pay Johnson, leading Johnson to file a complaint with relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">(\u00b6 8} Relator claims that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (a lawyer shall not \u201c[ejngage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u201d), 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not \u201c[ejngage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d), and 1-102(A)(6) (a lawyer shall not engage in \u201cconduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law\u201d). Both the panel and the board determined that relator did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that respondent violated these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">{\u00b6 9} We disagree. There is no dispute that respondent induced the expert to attend the deposition with the promise of compensation and then broke this promise once the deposition was completed. There is no foundation for the notion that this was a good-faith dispute over service rendered; it was simply a refusal to pay the fees promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent\u2019s reason for withholding payment \u2014 that he was dissatisfied with the expert\u2019s preparation and responses \u2014 is disingenuous at best. Respondent\u2019s proffered reasons for withholding payment are little more than after-the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fact excuse-making, and respondent has not made serious efforts to show that they are anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 11} Moreover, respondent\u2019s own conduct does not add credence to his claim that he did not get a \u201cdiscovery\u201d deposition. Respondent completed the deposition and presented the expert with a check at the end, only to stop payment on that check the next day. Furthermore, the deposition was not without benefit to respondent; indeed, he paid to have the deposition transcribed and used the testimony in cross-examination of the expert. Despite respondent\u2019s claimed dissatisfaction with the deposition, there is no evidence that he asked the court to compel the witness to testify, that he sought other court remediation, or that he asked the court to exclude the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent\u2019s failure to pay the expert is consistent with his prior discipline for failure to meet an obligation to a client, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. McCord, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 21, 2002-Ohio-2587, 770 N.E.2d 571, and with Count Two of the complaint in this case, for failure to comply with court-ordered child-support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 13} Although the board distinguished this case from McCord\u2019s prior discipline on the grounds that in the previous case there was a court order commanding respondent to pay, this distinction does not change our conclusion. An attorney should pay his debts without a court order. As noted by relator, this court has repeatedly refused to approve applications to sit for a bar examination when the applicant has failed to \u201cscrupulously honor all financial commitments.\u201d <em>In re Application of Manayan, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 109, 2004-Ohio-1804, 807 N.E.2d 313, \u00b6 14. We expect no less from those already admitted to the bar of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, respondent\u2019s order to stop payment and refusal to honor his debt to the expert witness is conduct that reflects at least deceit and misrepresentation and violates DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), and 1 \u2014 102(A)(6). We therefore reject the recommendation of the panel and board and reinstate Count One of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\"><em>B. Count Two </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to pay contested child support</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 15} This count pertains to respondent\u2019s failure to pay child support as determined by the trial court in <em>McCord v. McCord. </em>Respondent and Cooper had two children together, but the original divorce decree, entered in September 1999, did not require either party to pay child support. However, as part of the divorce settlement, respondent and Cooper split their jointly owned stock in a business called Glory Foods, with respondent receiving 35 percent of their stock and Cooper keeping the remainder. The stock was subject to a buy/sell agreement that gave the business the option to buy back shares if they were sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Although the record is unclear, it appears that the stock was held solely in Cooper\u2019s name. After the transfer was made from Cooper to respondent pursuant to the divorce decree, the business determined that there had been a sale of the stock and exercised its option to purchase respondent\u2019s shares for $2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 17} Shortly thereafter, in January 2000, Cooper filed a motion asking the trial court to modify the divorce decree to require respondent to pay child support, claiming that there had been a change in circumstances. Respondent argued that the circumstances had not changed simply because he had sold some of his assets, and he argued that Cooper\u2019s stock was worth close to $4 million, given the value of his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 18} The trial court ordered respondent to pay child support retroactive to 2000. The court also ordered respondent to pay $40,000 within 30 days while the full amount of the arrearage was being determined. Respondent failed to pay this amount and was held in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 19} The amount in arrears was originally determined to be $113,803.46; respondent filed objections and requested a mistake-of-fact hearing. After the mistake-of-fact hearing, the amount became $118,789.40. Respondent requested another mistake-of-fact hearing, appealed the determination, and appealed the underlying child-support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 20} Respondent continued to pursue his objections to the child-support determination for the next three years, proceeding through the legal system: (1) respondent\u2019s original appeal was dismissed for lack of a final, appealable order in March 2005, (2) the amount in arrears was upheld by the trial court on remand in January 2006, and respondent appealed again, (3) the trial court granted attorney fees against respondent in June 2006, and he appealed that decision, (4) the court of appeals consolidated respondent\u2019s appeals and affirmed the trial court\u2019s decisions in both cases in January 2007, and (5) respondent filed an appeal in this court seeking discretionary review in March 2007, and we declined to accept the case for review on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">{\u00b6 21} During this process, respondent was held in contempt of court at least two times, and the courts labeled his actions \u201cdilatory,\u201d noting that he had \u201cdragged this litigation far beyond what it should have been.\u201d Respondent also failed to pay the amount in arrears while these proceedings were ongoing. As a result, the trial court determined that he was in default of a child-support order. In view of this default, this court suspended respondent in September 2004 pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(1). 103 Ohio St.3d 1439, 2004-Ohio-4620, 814 N.E.2d 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">{\u00b6 22} After respondent filed his jurisdictional memorandum in this court, he and Cooper entered into a settlement agreement, whereby respondent agreed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>pay Cooper $100,000 in child support to resolve all outstanding claims. Shortly thereafter, this court terminated respondent\u2019s interim suspension, approximately 31 months after it was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 23} Although neither the panel nor the board determined that respondent\u2019s conduct violated a Disciplinary Rule, relator claims that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 1-102(A)(5) and 1 \u2014 102(A)(6). To support this argument, relator cites several cases in which we determined that attorneys had violated Disciplinary Rules for failure to pay outstanding child-support awards. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Redfield, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 262, 2007-Ohio-6039, 878 N.E.2d 10, \u00b6 13; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Curry, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 130, 2006-Ohio-6517, 858 N.E.2d 392, \u00b6 20-23 (suspending respondent without credit for his interim suspension for being in default of a child-support order); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Geer, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 124, 2006-Ohio-6516, 858 N.E.2d 388, \u00b6 14-15 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 24} We agree with relator. The above cases show that we have suspended attorneys for nonpayment of child support under DR 1-102(A)(5) and (6). While respondent was entitled to challenge the child-support determination through the appeals process, the contempt orders and the findings of the trial court demonstrate that respondent needlessly prolonged the child-support litigation and made a concerted effort to avoid paying court-ordered support while the process was ongoing (including creating a deceptively named law firm). These events, taken together, support finding violations of DR 1-102(A)(5) and (6), despite respondent\u2019s settlement of his child-support obligations prior to the exhaustion of all appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">{\u00b6 25} We therefore reject the recommendation of the panel and board and reinstate Count Two of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\"><em>C. Count Three </em>\u2014 Misleading <em>law firm name</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">{\u00b6 26} Under this count, relator claims that respondent improperly held himself out as a member of entities named \u201cMcCord, Pryor &amp; Associates,\u201d \u201cMcCord, Pryor &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A.,\u201d and \u201cMcCord <em>&amp; </em>Associates.\u201d Respondent\u2019s actions related to these purported entities raise three questions: (1) Was respondent ever a law partner with David E. Pryor? (2) Did respondent act inappropriately in forming an entity named \u201cMcCord, Pryor &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A.\u201d? and (3) Did respondent have any associates that would justify using the term \u201cand associates\u201d in firm names?</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">{\u00b6 27} Pryor was admitted to the practice of law in 1982. In 2002, Pryor and his wife were killed in a plane crash. At the time of Pryor\u2019s death, he and respondent co-owned a building in Columbus where the two men maintained their law practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Although respondent claims that he and Pryor held themselves out as a firm under the name \u201cMcCord, Pryor <em>&amp; </em>Associates\u201d for numerous years, they did not operate under any recognizable legal structure. They had separate clients, separate IOLTA accounts, separate fee income, and separate law-related business expenses during Pryor\u2019s life. Moreover, they did not have an agreement to share profits and losses; respondent readily admits that they shared attorney fees only on cases they worked on together, never on their separate cases. Given these facts, it was improper for respondent to hold himself out as \u201cMcCord, Pryor &amp; Associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 29} In 2005, respondent filed articles of incorporation with the Ohio secretary of state to form a professional corporation named \u201cMcCord, Pryor <em>&amp; </em>Associates Co., L.P.A.\u201d At the time he formed this organization, respondent\u2019s license was suspended under the interim child-support suspension discussed in Count Two, and Pryor had been dead for approximately two and a half years. Respondent admits that he formed this organization solely to thwart his ex-wife\u2019s attempts to garnish his bank accounts to pay for his outstanding child-support order. Respondent\u2019s actions in this regard were plainly improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 30} Finally, respondent claimed that the \u201cfirms\u201d employed two individuals, Trent Turner and Jackie Lewis-Greer, as associates. However, the evidence does not support this assertion. Turner was paid a salary from a bank account containing funds related to the building respondent owned and his W-2 bore only respondent\u2019s name, not any of the purported firm names, as his employer. At respondent\u2019s request, Lewis-Greer assumed the workers\u2019 compensation matters that Pryor was managing before his death, but she considered herself an independent contractor, received a 1099 tax form for her taxable income arising from this work (which is indicative of an independent-contractor relationship) instead of a W-2, and received only contingent fees, which were paid from respondent\u2019s IOLTA account, not from a payroll account. Thus, it is clear that neither Turner nor Lewis-Greer was an associate of respondent. Respondent acknowledges as much in his briefing before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 31} The panel and the board determined that respondent violated numerous Disciplinary Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 2-102(B) (a lawyer in private practice shall not practice under a misleading firm name), and 2-102(C) (\u201cA lawyer shall not hold himself or herself out as having a partnership with one or more other lawyers or professional corporations unless they are in fact partners\u201d), and Prof.Cond.R. 7.5(a) (a lawyer in private practice shall not use a misleading firm name), 7.5(d) (\u201cLawyers may state or imply that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is the fact\u201d), 8.4(b) (a lawyer shall not \u201ccommit an illegal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness\u201d), 8.4(c) (a lawyer shall not \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\u201d), 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d), and 8.4(h) (a lawyer shall not \u201cengage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">{\u00b6 32} Respondent argues that he never intended to deceive or mislead the public. However, the only relevant consideration is whether respondent performed the unethical acts; his subjective intent in doing so does not change the analysis. See <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Bell </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 118, 120, 15 OBR 269, 472 N.E.2d 1069. Thus, even if we believed that respondent did not intend to deceive the public, it is clear that he performed deceptive acts that violated the aforementioned Disciplinary Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct. We therefore adopt the board\u2019s findings of misconduct under this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\"><em>D. Count Four </em>\u2014 Misconduct <em>involving legal fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">{\u00b6 33} In the final count of the complaint, relator alleges that respondent engaged in misconduct in three distinct ways: (1) he paid himself attorney fees while he was suspended from the practice of law, (2) he shared fees with Lewis-Greer without an appropriate fee-sharing agreement, and (3) he made misrepresentations in discussing these matters with relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">{\u00b6 34} Respondent maintained an IOLTA account under the name \u201cMcCord &amp; Associates\u201d over the course of the interim child-support suspension imposed by this court. Over that 31-month period, respondent received and deposited client funds into this IOLTA account approximately 90 times. Most of those deposits were payments to claimants from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation or workers\u2019 compensation payments to persons from self-insured employers. Respondent generally received these funds because the claimants had listed \u201cMcCord Pryor <em>&amp; </em>Associates\u201d as their designated representative on the relevant workers\u2019 compensation forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">{\u00b6 35} Respondent would deposit these payments in the IOLTA account and then write three checks from the account: one to the relevant client for two-thirds of the amount deposited, one to Lewis-Greer (who worked on the workers\u2019 compensation cases) for one-sixth of the amount deposited, and one to himself for the remaining one-sixth of the amount deposited. The record reveals that, through this process, respondent paid himself $69,350.76 in 2005, $47,564.56 in 2006, and $2,587.95 in 2007, all while he was suspended from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">{\u00b6 36} We agree with the panel and the board that this evidence demonstrates that respondent accepted legal fees while he was suspended from the practice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>law. Further, we agree that respondent improperly shared legal fees with Lewis-Greer, given the fact that they did not have a fee-sharing agreement for these matters and Lewis-Greer was not respondent\u2019s associate or employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">{\u00b6 37} In response to a letter from relator regarding these transactions, respondent sent a letter with the following explanation of his actions:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cI still maintain an IOLTA in my name because I have a law firm. The firm has a lot of workers compensation clients. The clients are represented [by] an associate counsel in the firm. She has been representing these workers compensation clients since the death of my law partner in December 2002. The client\u2019s workers compensation checks come in the name of the client and the firm. Those checks are deposited into the IOLTA account and checks are written to the clients out of that account. At this point, no one [else] has access to that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMy only involvement with that account is purely CLERICAL. I do not counsel, advise, or prepare legal instruments for any client. In fact, because I mail the check or the client picks up the check when I am not in the office, I hardly ever see the client.\u201d (Capitalization sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">{\u00b6 40} We agree with the panel and board that these statements were false and misleading. Respondent never properly formed a law firm, and Lewis-Greer never operated as his associate. In addition, respondent did much more than perform a simple clerical function; he was paying himself legal fees and was the only person managing the trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">{\u00b6 41} In objecting to the board\u2019s decision, respondent offers only that he was unsure of what rights he had to use his IOLTA account under this court\u2019s interim suspension order. However, ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for misconduct. Respondent could have easily sought clarification if he was confused; because he did not, he must accept the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">{\u00b6 42} Although relator alleged that respondent violated numerous ethical rules under this count, the panel and the board determined that respondent violated only DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), 2-102(B), 2-106(A) (\u201cA lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee\u201d), and 2-107(A) (lawyers that are not in the same firm may divide fees only in certain specific circumstances), and Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(e) (same), 7.5(a) and (d), and 8.4(h). We adopt these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">{\u00b6 43} To determine an appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, we consider the duties violated, respondent\u2019s mental state, the injury caused, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and applicable precedent. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Evans </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 497, 501, 733 N.E.2d 609. We address each factor in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\n<em>A. Duties violated and injury caused</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">{\u00b6 44} As set forth above, respondent violated numerous Disciplinary Rules and Rules of Professional Conduct relating to honesty and trustworthiness, performed actions that reflect adversely on his fitness to practice law, failed to pay a valid debt related to a deposition, abused the legal process in the course of his child-support proceedings, failed to pay child support as required by court orders, acted deceptively to the public, committed improprieties in dealing with attorney fees at a time when he was suspended from the practice of law, and hindered the disciplinary process by providing relator with false information. These actions harmed the public, respondent\u2019s ex-wife and children, and the expert witness that respondent refused to pay, and hindered the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>B. Mental state</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">{\u00b6 45} There has been no evidence presented regarding respondent\u2019s mental state, and thus we presume that he was healthy and unhindered in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">\n<em>C. Aggravating and mitigating circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">{\u00b6 46} We adopt the findings of numerous aggravating circumstances that the board made: (1) respondent has been disciplined previously, see <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. McCord, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 21, 2002-Ohio-2587, 770 N.E.2d 571 (six-month stayed suspension for failure to pay a fee arbitration award), (2) respondent acted selfishly and dishonestly when he formed McCord, Pryor &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., in 2005 to evade his ex-wife\u2019s attempts to garnish his assets pursuant to the outstanding child-support order, (3) respondent acted selfishly, deceptively, and dishonestly in paying himself attorney fees from his IOLTA account while he was suspended from the practice of law, (4) respondent engaged in a pattern of misconduct that took place over years, (5) respondent was not completely honest during the disciplinary process and at one point provided materially false information to relator, and (6) respondent failed to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) through (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">{\u00b6 47} The only mitigating circumstance that the board recognized was the fact that respondent was suspended from the practice of law for 31 months under the interim child-support suspension. The board considered this suspension to be a quasi-mitigating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f), which allows the board to consider the imposition of other penalties or sanctions in mitigation. The board noted that it did not afford this previous suspension much weight in view of the fact that respondent continued to receive fees from the practice of law while suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">{\u00b6 48} We do not afford this factor any weight. Respondent does not appear to have learned from his previous sanction; in fact, he essentially ignored it by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>continuing to collect attorney fees on a regular basis during the suspension. Whatever mitigating weight this suspension may have offered is far outweighed by his willful disregard of this court\u2019s orders during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">{\u00b6 49} Respondent has not offered any evidence to support other mitigating factors beyond his own self-serving statements that he did not intend to violate the Disciplinary Rules or deceive the public. These statements are not supported by his actions, and we afford them no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>D. Applicable precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">{\u00b6 50} Because respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), he will be subject to an actual suspension from the practice of law. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Stollings, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 155, 2006-Ohio-5345, 855 N.E.2d 479, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">{\u00b6 51} Although there are no cases that present violations identical to those respondent committed, we recognize a few cases that present similar violations. In <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Watson, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-7088, 781 N.E.2d 212, Watson violated several of the same Disciplinary Rules as the respondent here, including DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(4), 2-102(B), and 2-102(C), by using a false firm name when he was actually a solo practitioner and by committing misconduct in the disciplinary process. Id. at \u00b6 5, 9. We imposed a two-year suspension with one year stayed on conditions for his misconduct. Id. at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">{\u00b6 52} In <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Rogers, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 99, 2007-Ohio-5544, 876 N.E.2d 923, we suspended Rogers for two years for billing clients for work that he did not do and for stretching the truth in his billing practices. Id. at \u00b6 18-19. These actions are similar to respondent\u2019s misconduct, in that respondent continued to pay himself legal fees while he was suspended from the practice of law based on workers\u2019 compensation work that he did not perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">{\u00b6 53} In <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Finneran </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 428, 687 N.E.2d 405, we indefinitely suspended Finneran for, among other things, various dilatory practices in legal matters and the failure to cooperate with the legal process, as was the case with respondent. Id. at 432, 687 N.E.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">{\u00b6 54} Finally, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Zingarelli </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 210, 729 N.E.2d 1167, we indefinitely suspended Zingarelli for, among other things, failing to properly comply with the requirements for fee-sharing under DR 2-107(A) and violating DR 2-106(A), as respondent did here. Id. at 219-220, 222, 729 N.E.2d 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">\n<em>E. Deteimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">{\u00b6 55} Respondent committed a series of acts of misconduct, and he cannot demonstrate a single mitigating factor to counterbalance the extensive aggravating evidence against him. In view of all these factors, we do not adopt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>board\u2019s recommended sanction and instead indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law. Before he may be readmitted, respondent must first fulfill all the requirements in Gov.Bar R. V(10), including demonstrating that he \u201cpossesses all the mental, educational, and moral qualifications that were required of an applicant for admission to the practice of law in Ohio at the time of his * * * original admission and that he * * * is now a proper person to be readmitted to the practice of law in Ohio, notwithstanding the previous disciplinary action.\u201d Gov.Bar R. V(10)(C)(5). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABK\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Lori J.
