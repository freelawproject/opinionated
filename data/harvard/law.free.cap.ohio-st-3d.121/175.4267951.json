The parcels are 60 in number and are improved with single-family homes that were built in 2002. The 60 parcels were developed, pursuant to the federal low-income housing tax credit (\u201cLIHTC\u201d) enacted in 1986 and codified at Section 42, Title 26 of the United States Code (\u201cI.R.C. 42\u201d). The auditor utilized a cost-based valuation for tax year 2004 with respect to each of the 60 individual parcels. The true value computations equaled approximately $80,000 per parcel and aggregated to approximately $4,854,970 for all 60 parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">{\u00b6 2} On March 30, 2005, Ivy Glen filed its complaint against the auditor\u2019s valuation with respect to all 60 parcels, alleging a total true value of $2,400,000. At the board of revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) and at the BTA, Ivy Glen sought to value the 60 parcels as an economic unit based on rent-income analysis and comparable sales of rental properties, but both those tribunals rejected that approach. In evaluating the appraisal that Ivy Glen prepared for the BTA hearing, the BTA disregarded the effect of use restrictions imposed under the federal tax-credit program and found that Ivy Glen\u2019s appraisal report was deficient and not probative in certain crucial respects. This finding led the BTA to adopt the county\u2019s cost-based valuation.' The BTA regarded the fact that the houses on the lots were only two years old as supporting the cost-based valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal to this court, Ivy Glen makes two main contentions. First, Ivy Glen asserts that our case law precludes the adoption of a cost-based valuation because the federal tax subsidy induced the investment in the development, and under pure market conditions, the developer would not have expended such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>amounts. Second, Ivy Glen asserts that the BTA erred by rejecting its appraiser\u2019s highest-and-best-use determination, which viewed the development as a single economic unit consisting of 60 individual parcels available for rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 4} In response, the county argues that the court should defer to the BTA\u2019s rejection of Ivy Glen\u2019s appraisal. The county asserts that reverting to the auditor\u2019s cost-based valuation is justified by three circumstances: (1) Ivy Glen\u2019s failure to offer probative evidence that satisfied its burden of persuasion, (2) the doctrine that the BTA should ignore any restrictions on the transfer and use of the property that were imposed in connection with the federal tax subsidy, and (3) the recency of the construction of the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 5} We hold that under our case law, the BTA erred by failing to consider the federally mandated use restrictions imposed in connection with the LIHTC. That erroneous exclusion led the BTA to reject the appraiser\u2019s highest-and-best-use determination, and as a result, the BTA reverted to the county\u2019s cost-based valuation. Because it rests on an erroneous legal premise, the BTA\u2019s decision must be vacated and the case remanded for additional proceedings as described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 6} The Ivy Glen development is located in the northwestern portion of Washington Court House in Fayette County near State Route 41. The tract at issue was acquired as two separate parcels, which were then subdivided into 60 individual parcels in connection with the construction and leasing of single-family residences. Ivy Glen includes 59 rental units \u2014 modest single-family residential homes with two, three, or four bedrooms \u2014 and a manager\u2019s unit with an adjoining community building/office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">{\u00b6 7} At the BTA, Ivy Glen presented the appraisal report and testimony of David E. McConahy. McConahy\u2019s report determined that the highest and best use of the property as though vacant is \u201cfor residential utilization if special funding is made available,\u201d but if such funding were lacking, \u201cthen general residential, institutional or secondary commercial utilizations are maximally productive.\u201d With the improvements, the highest and best use of the parcels is \u201c[the present] affordable rental housing development, laid out like a detached single-family subdivision.\u201d That is so because an \u201cLIHTC or low-income housing tax credit development is predicated on the rents that are affordable to low income residents and the income available is constrained by affordable standards,\u201d a fact that \u201cresults in a project [that] offers limited direct economic return to the partners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">{\u00b6 8} The BTA questioned McConahy\u2019s economic-unit valuation in light of the principle that property should be valued in its \u201c \u2018unrestricted form of title.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Woda Ivy Glen Ltd. Partnership v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Jan. 11, 2008), BTA No. 2005-A-749, at 4, quoting <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 23, 523 N.E.2d 826. The BTA found it significant that in discussing the lack of market-rate rental-unit comparables, the appraiser stated not only \u201clack of demand\u201d but \u201cthe presence of \u2018affordable ownership alternatives.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 7. The BTA also noted the admitted availability of sales comparisons if the appraiser had viewed the development as individual single-family units rather than as a single economic unit. Id. at 8. In effect, the BTA regarded Ivy Glen as comparable to a development containing single-family owner-occupied housing and believed that the value of Ivy Glen could be properly determined in that manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">{\u00b6 9} Closely related to the economic-unit issue is the propriety of the BTA\u2019s reverting to a cost-based valuation. The appraiser opined that the cost approach was not tenable in the present case because \u201cthis use is not actually feasible or productive as a market rent property and would not be undertaken by a developer.\u201d The BTA stated, \u201c[W]e see no reason why a cost approach could not have been completed for the subject units.\u201d <em>Woda Ivy Glen, </em>BTA No. 2005-A-749, at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 10} The BTA also faulted McConahy\u2019s income approach. In particular, the BTA concluded that the vacancy and rent-loss elements of the income approach \u201ctreat[ed] the subject as subsidized housing, not in its unrestricted form of title\u201d inasmuch as McConahy \u201cexpresses concern over the smaller number of eligible individuals based upon income levels.\u201d <em>Woda Ivy Glen, </em>BTA No. 2005-A-749, at 10. In other words, the BTA faulted the income approach for taking into account the use restrictions on the property imposed in connection with the tax subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 11} Based on its disagreements with the appraisal and the income studies that Ivy Glen presented to the BOR, the BTA affirmed the county\u2019s cost-based valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>1. The BTA\u2019s decision is premised on ignoring LIHTC use restrictions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 12} In rejecting Ivy Glen\u2019s economic-unit analysis and affirming the auditor\u2019s cost-based valuation, the BTA relied on the proposition that when valuing subsidized housing, \u201c \u2018it is the fair market value of the property in its unrestricted form of title which is to be valued.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woda Ivy Glen, </em>BTA No. 2005-A-749, at 4, quoting <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 23, 523 N.E.2d 826. See also <em>Delhi Estates, Ltd. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 192, 194, 625 N.E.2d 594. Yet by reverting to the cost-based valuation, the BTA arguably contravened the principles of the same cases that it purported to apply. See <em>Colonial Village Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 493, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>2007-Ohio-4641, 873 N.E.2d 298, \u00b6 20 (\u201cFor subsidized housing, we generally disfavor appraisals based on the cost approach\u201d), citing <em>Canton Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 4, 7, 3 OBR 302, 444 N.E.2d 1027; <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. </em>at 22, 523 N.E.2d 826; <em>Sunset Square, Ltd. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 552 N.E.2d 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 13} Ivy Glen relies heavily on the disfavor of the cost approach in the case law. Beyond that, its appraiser echoes the proposition that \u201c[f]or purpose [sic] of real estate tax assessment, as set forth in <em>Oberlin Manor [Ltd.] vs. Lorain County Board of Revision </em>Supreme Court Case (1989) [45 Ohio St.3d 56, 543 N.E.2d 768], the effect of a property\u2019s involvement in a low-income housing program cannot be considered.\u201d (Boldface sic). Yet in spite of such pronouncements, it strongly appears that the appraiser\u2019s valuation of the 60 parcels at issue as an economic unit derives from the use and rent restrictions imposed as a result of the tax credit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Without those restrictions, the 60 parcels\u2019 highest and best use as improved would, as the BTA found, entail viewing the 60 parcels separately as potential single-family owner-occupied houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 14} Thus, the central legal issue in the present case lies in determining whether the appraisal of the 60 parcels should take into account the use restrictions imposed in connection with the federal tax credit. In making that determination, we first examine the nature of the LIHTC program. Thereafter, we discuss how the holdings of our prior cases apply to a case involving an LIHTC project.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>2. I.R.C. 42 conditions the federal tax credit on encumbering the property.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 15} Although the record is sparse in this regard, it does establish that Ivy Glen is an LIHTC development. In particular, the appraiser McConahy recited that as fact in several parts of his report, and we have held that an appraiser\u2019s certification permits a fact-finder to rely on facts asserted in an appraisal report \u2014 particularly when, as in this case, those facts are undisputed. <em>AP Hotels of Illinois, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 343, 2008-Ohio-2565, 889 N.E.2d 115, \u00b6 16. Although the BTA did not make an explicit finding that Ivy Glen is an LIHTC development, the BTA implicitly accepted the tax subsidy as a premise for its analysis. Indeed, that premise constitutes the reason that the BTA found it necessary to consult the case law addressing subsidized housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 16} I.R.C. 42 provides federal tax credits tied to amounts invested in qualifying low-income housing projects. The credit is typically enjoyed by one or more entities that become passive investors in a low-income housing development after the developer has formed a limited partnership or limited-liability company. See Joseph Rosenblum, Assessing the Value of Affordability: <em>Ad Valorem </em>Taxation of Properties Participating in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (2006), 2 J. Marshall Law School Fair &amp; Affordable Housing Commentary 32, 33 (developers \u201csyndicate\u201d the right to the tax credit to passive investors through limited-liability entities). Each state receives an allocation of tax credits based on its population, and in each state, a particular agency administers the grant of entitlement to the credit. I.R.C. 42(h). By statute, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency is responsible for allocating the federal tax credits to projects in this state. R.C. 175.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 17} As a trade-off for the valuable tax credits, I.R.C. 42 imposes severe rent restrictions. Owners must elect to assure either that 20 percent or more of the units are occupied by individuals whose income is 50 percent or less of median gross income in the area, or that 40 percent or more of the units are occupied by individuals whose income is 60 percent or less of the median. I.R.C. 42(g)(1)(A) and (B). Rent is restricted to 30 percent of an imputed income figure based on size of household as prescribed by the statute. The restrictions apply through a \u201ccompliance period\u201d of 15 years from the first year the credit is available, and then through an additional \u201cextended low-income housing commitment\u201d period prescribed by the agreement with the state, which must be at least 15 years. I.R.C. 42(h)(6)(D). See Rosenblum at 34 (\u201cLIHTC projects are also subject to agreements with state housing agencies to restrict rents for a period of at least 15 years in excess of the 15-year federal restrictions\u201d). The commitments under the LIHTC program are specifically made binding on successors to the owner and must be recorded in the chain of title to the property. I.R.C. 42(h)(6)(B)(vi); Rosenblum at 34 (to receive the tax credits, the \u201cowner must enter into a recorded regulatory agreement restricting the use of the property\u201d). Violations of the restrictions lead to recapture of the tax credits previously enjoyed, the repayment of taxes previously offset by credits, plus penalties and interest. I.R.C. 42(j); Rosenblum at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 18} The result is that \u201cLIHTC properties are operating under limited gross potential income because of the restrictions imposed both by the [IRS] and state agencies associated with LIHTC regulations.\u201d Rosenblum at 36; see also George Jordan, Appraising the Assets of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Properties (1999), 67 Appraisal Journal 41, 46 (the \u201cLIHTC stipulations adversely affect the value of the fee simple conditional interest in the <em>tangible </em>asset and do not simply divide the benefits or value between the leasehold and leased fee estates.\u201d (Emphasis sic)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>S. </em>As <em>governmental use restrictions that are imposed for the general welfare, the LIHTC restrictions should be taken into account when valuing an LIHTC property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-0hio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, we confronted the argument that the sale price of a parcel did not directly reflect true value because in purchasing the property, the new owner had agreed to a real covenant that restricted one type of use of the property. The argument against utilizing the sale price relied heavily on the pronouncement that \u201c \u2018the fee simple estate is to be valued as if it were unencumbered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cummins, </em>\u00b6 14, 19, quoting <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, paragraph one of the syllabus. We rejected that argument, and we held that the sale price was indicative of true value in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 20} Although <em>Cummins </em>differed because it addressed a situation in which there was a recent, arm\u2019s-length sale, the case does articulate a principle that furnishes the polestar in applying our earlier cases to the situation presented in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c[T]he uniform rule [in real property taxation] is that property should be valued in accordance with an actual sale price where the criteria of the recency and the arm\u2019s-length character of the sale are satisfied. Where there is no such sale, the uniform rule envisions that an appraisal will be prepared, and constitutional uniformity does not prohibit the differential treatment of encumbrances when property is being appraised in materially different contexts.\u201d <em>Cummins, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 22} As discussed, the BTA in this case predicated its decision on the premise that LIHTC restrictions should not be taken into account, and the BTA derived that premise from <em>Alliance Towers. Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, paragraph one of the syllabus (\u201cFor real property tax purposes, the fee simple estate is to be valued as if it were unencumbered\u201d). Because <em>Cummins </em>held that the imposition of a use restriction did not prevent a sale price from constituting the value of the property, it raises a serious question whether the pronouncement that \u201cthe fee simple estate is to be valued as if it were unencumbered\u201d should be applied in a case like the present one. Indeed, apart from <em>Alliance Towers </em>and its progeny, our cases have broadly acknowledged that \u201call facts and circumstances which may affect the value of property must be taken into consideration.\u201d <em>Porter v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 307, 311, 4 O.O.3d 460, 364 N.E.2d 261. Moreover, whether to use economic rent or contract rent in valuing an apartment building has typically constituted part of the BTA\u2019s fact-finding to which the court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>deferred. <em>Wynwood Apts., Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 34, 37, 13 O.O.3d 19, 391 N.E.2d 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, we need not address the general applicability of the <em>Alliance Towers </em>syllabus, because considering the effect of the use restrictions imposed under I.R.C. 42 on the value of the parcels fully comports with the principle set forth there. That is so because the standards for appraising property call for a valuation of the \u201cfee simple estate\u201d to be performed as if that estate were free from <em>private </em>encumbrances, but they nonetheless require an appraiser to consider \u201cpolice power\u201d limitations on use. Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Real Estate (12th Ed.2001) 71. Even after <em>Alliance Towers, </em>we have acknowledged that governmental restrictions must be taken into account. Cf. <em>Muirfield Assn., Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 710, 711, 654 N.E.2d 110 (rule that fee simple should be valued as if unencumbered is \u201csubject only to the limitations caused by involuntary, governmental actions, such as eminent domain, escheat, police power, and taxation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 24} As for \u201cpolice power,\u201d that term refers to the \u201cright of government through which property is regulated to protect public safety, health, morals, and general welfare.\u201d The Appraisal of Real Estate at 69. Do the use restrictions that accompany LIHTCs qualify as \u201cpolice power\u201d restrictions? Careful analysis reveals that they do. It is true that the federal government exercises no general police power. <em>United States v. Lopez </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 549, 566, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (U.S. Constitution \u201cwithhold[s] from Congress a plenary police power that would authorize the enactment of every type of legislation\u201d). But it is also true that Congress exercises the power to tax and spend pursuant to the first clause of Section 8, Article 1 of the United States Constitution, and does so in order to provide, among other things, for the \u201cgeneral Welfare\u201d of the nation. The use restrictions mandated by I.R.C. 42 in connection with the federal tax credits plainly constitute such legislation, and the fact that such restrictions are triggered by the developer\u2019s decision to seek the benefit of the tax credits does not reduce them to the status of contract obligations. See <em>Westside Mothers v. Haveman </em>(C.A.6, 2002), 289 F.3d 852 (rejecting the district court\u2019s holding that Medicaid constituted a mere contract between state and federal governments on the grounds that \u201c \u2018[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant programs originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of Congress concerning desirable public policy,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Edn. </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 656, 669, 105 S.Ct. 1544, 84 L.Ed.2d 590).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, we note that viewing LIHTC use restrictions as governmental limitations imposed for the general welfare broadly accords with the decisions of our sister courts in other states. See, e.g., <em>Bayridge Assocs. Ltd. Partnership v. Dept. of Revenue </em>(1995), 321 Or. 21, 27, 892 P.2d 1002; <em>Town Square Ltd. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Partnership v. Clay Cty. Bd. of Equalization, </em>2005 SD 99, 704 N.W.2d 896, \u00b6 1 (court holds that both the tax credits and the restrictions ought to be considered because both constituted the owner\u2019s manner of realizing value from the realty).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 26} Our conclusion that the tax assessor must consider the effect the LIHTC use restrictions exercise on the value of the property does not disturb the specific holding of <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, and its progeny. First, we note that our decision in <em>Alliance Towers </em>actually addressed several BTA cases. In each, the BTA had adopted a valuation somewhere between the values that had been determined by competing appraisals. Id. at 22, 523 N.E.2d 826. Each of the BTA decisions involved the value of apartment complexes constructed under the federal Section 8 programs that (1) furnished affirmative assistance in the financing of the residential facilities and (2) supplemented the rent paid by low-income tenants whose payments (as in the LIHTC program) were limited to a percentage of their income. In addition, developers received a strong tax incentive through the accelerated depreciation made available in relation to the program. Id. at 20, 523 N.E.2d 826, fn. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 27} The court discerned a common thread connecting the BTA decisions: the BTA had relied on appraisals that took into account the affirmative benefit of the federal subsidies as part of the value of the respective properties \u2014 an approach that increased the value assigned to the properties. Although broadly stating the generalization that \u201c[i]t is the fair market value of the property in its unrestricted form of title which is to be valued,\u201d <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 23, 523 N.E.2d 826, the court\u2019s objections to BTA\u2019s valuations consisted of three much more concrete points. First, the court stated that \u201ctax shelter advantages\u201d constituted \u201cintangible items\u201d that \u201c[did] not make the real estate more valuable.\u201d Id. Second, the court questioned using a putative assumption of the mortgage balance as a basis for determining the property\u2019s value. Because \u201cthe government is willing to provide the subsidy to pay the debt service,\u201d mortgage and expense payments became manageable, and \u201cthe terms of the assumption of the mortgage would not seem to have any effect upon the value of the property.\u201d Id. Third, the \u201ccontract rents\u201d in subsidized housing \u201care a combination of the amount paid by the tenant and the amount paid by the government,\u201d and as such, they \u201care artificially derived without any relation to the market.\u201d Id. at 23-24, 523 N.E.2d 826. Indeed, the court observed that pursuant to federal regulation, the \u201cowner does not keep this total rent as profit; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>he receives only a limited distribution and after-tax benefits.\u201d Id. at 24, 523 N.E.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 28} All of these considerations led the court to conclude that the BTA should value Section 8 properties in accordance with methods that disregarded the affirmative value of the subsidies conferred by the federal government. <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d at 24, 523 N.E.2d 826. All our subsidized housing cases that have followed <em>Alliance Towers </em>apply that reasoning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 29} Thus, in spite of the sweeping language of <em>Alliance Towers, </em>the plain import of the decision lies in preventing the <em>affirmative benefit of government subsidies </em>from inflating the value of the property for tax purposes. In the present case, that precept would call into question any attempt to regard the value of the tax credits to the limited partners as part of the value of the real estate. But that does not prevent the tax assessor from considering the effect of concomitant use restrictions imposed under I.R.C. 42 \u2014 restrictions that the statute requires to be recorded in the chain of title.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>{\u00b6 30} In light of the foregoing discussion, we hold that in the context of appraising real property for tax purposes, the use restrictions imposed under I.R.C. 42 constitute governmental restrictions for the general welfare that must be taken into account when determining the value of LIHTC property. The BTA erred by holding that the effect of such restrictions must be disregarded and by reverting to a cost-based valuation that improperly reflects the affirmative benefit of the tax credits, which constitute a separable intangible asset. Accordingly, we must vacate the BTA\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">A <em>On remand, the BTA shall consider the effect of the use restrictions on the vahee of the parcels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 31} Reading our prior cases, the BTA and the parties misconstrued the pronouncements of <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., </em>37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826. The BTA\u2019s evaluation of Ivy Glen\u2019s appraisal and, in particular, its finding on the issue whether the parcels constitute an \u201ceconomic unit\u201d reflect its misapplication of <em>Alliance Towers. </em>But the misreading of <em>Alliance Towers </em>not only informed the BTA\u2019s review of Ivy Glen\u2019s appraisal, it also appears to have induced Ivy Glen to offer an incomplete analysis of the value of the property. In particular, Ivy Glen did not offer specific evidence concerning the use restrictions imposed under I.R.C. 42 and its agreement with the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 32} When this court clarifies the legal standards that apply in a particular case and then remands the case to the BTA, the board typically has discretion to hear additional evidence or to decline to do so, as the board deems appropriate. <em>Lakeside Truck Rental, Inc. v. Bowers </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 405, 407, 23 O.O.2d 47, 189 N.E.2d 723 (on remand, BTA \u201ccould very well have opened up the case and heard additional evidence\u201d in light of earlier decision of the court); <em>Cincinnati v. Budget Comm. of Hamilton Cty. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 254, 256, 520 N.E.2d 216 (\u201cit is not always necessary for the BTA to open the record on remand and hear additional evidence\u201d); accord <em>United Tel. Co. of Ohio v. Tracy </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 506, 511, 705 N.E.2d 679 (five justices agreed that hearing additional evidence on remand was not barred under circumstances of the case).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have determined that we must vacate the BTA\u2019s decision so that the BTA can determine the effect that the I.R.C. 42 use restrictions have on the value of the parcels at issue. In doing so, the BTA may find the current record insufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>particularly with respect to the scope of the restrictions and related matters. Accordingly, the BTA may find it necessary to receive additional evidence.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Agu\">Karen H. Bauernschmidt and Sam A.

As for the tax credits themselves, we discern ample reason to disregard them as constituting a part of the value of the realty to the extent that tax benefits are transferred apart from any transfer of the underlying fee interest in the property. As discussed, the method of pursuing an LIHTC development involves \u201csyndicating\u201d the credit by selling passive investment (in this case limited-partner) interests to entities that can benefit from the tax credit. This means that (1) the proportionate interest in the tax credits themselves is transferred apart from any transfer of the entire legal fee interest in the property, and (2) the value that the purchaser places on the credit is driven primarily by the purchaser\u2019s particular tax considerations rather than any future value anticipated from the real property itself. As a result, the tax credits qualify as intangible interests separable from the real property. Cf. <em>St. Bernard Self-Storage, L.L.C. v. Hamilton Cty.
