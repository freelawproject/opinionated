The issue presented concerns which time period applies for a type B day-care home provider to request administrative review of a county\u2019s order revoking the provider\u2019s certificate. According to the trial court, a 10-day period applies pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40, while the court of appeals held that a 30-day period applies pursuant to R.C. 119.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">{\u00b6 2} After review, we conclude that R.C. 119.07, which establishes a 30-day time period in which to request a hearing on an agency determination, applies only to state agencies. Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40, which sets forth a 10-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>period in which to request a hearing on a county\u2019s action concerning the certification of a type B family day-care home, applies to county agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2006, Crawford-Cole and LCDJFS entered into a contract authorizing Crawford-Cole to operate a type B family day-care in her home. Shortly after the effective date of the contract, on July 20, 2006, LCDJFS conducted an unannounced inspection of Crawford-Cole\u2019s home, and the investigator found ten violations of state day-care regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">{\u00b6 4} On July 24, 2006, LCDJFS sent Crawford-Cole a letter by certified mail notifying her that the agency had decided to revoke her certificate as of August 3, 2006, based on the violations. The letter also informed Crawford-Cole that she could request a hearing on the decision pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40, which requires the request to be filed within 10 days of the date of the revocation letter. Someone in Crawford-Cole\u2019s household signed for the certified mail receipt, although the date of receipt is not clear from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">{\u00b6 5} Crawford-Cole did not, however, file a timely request pursuant to the Administrative Code. Rather, she wrote LCDJFS a letter dated August 10, 2006, claiming that she had not received notice until August 9, 2006. She also called the agency, which advised her that she had missed the deadline and that her request for a hearing would not be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">{\u00b6 6} In September 2006, Crawford-Cole filed an administrative appeal in the Lucas County Common Pleas Court. LCDJFS moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that Crawford-Cole had not exhausted her administrative remedies, because she had failed to request a hearing within 10 days as required by Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">{\u00b6 7} Crawford-Cole appealed to the Sixth District Court of Appeals, arguing that the administrative rule is invalid because it conflicts with R.C. 119.07, that LCDJFS did not follow the administrative rule, and that the administrative rule violates due process. The court of appeals held that the 10-day filing period set forth in the Administrative Code is invalid because it conflicts with R.C. 119.07, which sets forth a 30-day period in which to appeal a decision by an agency. <em>Crawford-Cole v. Lucas Cty. Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>174 Ohio App.3d 617, 2008-Ohio-359, 883 N.E.2d 1118, \u00b6 24. Thus, the appellate court reversed and remanded to the agency for further proceedings. The court of appeals did not review her remaining assignments of error, finding that its decision rendered them moot. Id. at \u00b6 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">{\u00b6 8} In its memorandum in support of jurisdiction filed in this court, LCDJFS presented one proposition of law: \u201cThe Appellate Court erred in applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>R.C. 119.07 thirty-day period to appeal a Certificate revocation by [LCDJFS] instead of the ten-day period under OAC 5101:2-14-40 because although the rule may have been adopted in accordance with R.C. Chapter 119, R.C. Section 5101.09 specifically exempts the rule from the requirements of R.C. Sections 119.06 to 119.13, which include the 30-day limit.\u201d In its merit brief, LCDJFS presents two additional propositions that essentially raise the same issue: whether a 10-day filing period applies to Crawford-Cole\u2019s hearing request pursuant to the Administrative Code, or whether a 30-day filing period applies pursuant to the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 9} LCDJFS concedes that R.C. 119.07 sets forth a 30-day period in which to request a hearing from an agency\u2019s administrative decision, but it asserts that R.C. 5101.09 specifically exempts county agencies from this requirement. The state of Ohio has filed an amicus brief in support of LCDJFS in which it argues that R.C. Chapter 119 applies only to state agencies. Crawford-Cole, on the other hand, claims that R.C. 119.07 applies in this instance and that she should have been provided 30 days in which to request a hearing from the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Type B Family Day-Care Homes</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">{\u00b6 10} This case concerns the procedure for seeking a hearing on the decision of a county department of job and family services to revoke the certification for a type B family day-care home. R.C. 5104.01(SS) defines \u201cType B family day-care home\u201d as \u201ca permanent residence of the provider in which child care is provided for one to six children at one time and in which no more than three children are under two years of age at one time.\u201d Furthermore, R.C. 5104.01(F) defines a \u201ccertified type B family day-care home\u201d as \u201ca type B family day-care home that is certified by the director of the county department of job and family services pursuant to section 5104.11 of the Revised Code to receive public funds for providing child care pursuant to this chapter and any rules adopted under it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 5104.11 sets forth the specific requirements for type B homes and authorizes the county departments of job and family services to conduct inspections and to issue and revoke certifications. For example, R.C. 5104.11(A)(1) states that \u201c[e]very person desiring to receive certification for a type B family day-care home to provide publicly funded child care shall apply for certification to the county director of job and family services * * R.C. 5104.11(B) then states, \u201cIf the county director of job and family services determines that the type B family day-care home complies with this chapter and any rules adopted under it, the county director shall issue to the provider a certificate to provide publicly funded child care, which certificate is valid for twelve months, unless revoked earlier. The county director may revoke the certificate after determining that revocation is necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>{\u00b6 12} A critical distinction exists between type B homes and all other day-care facilities, such as type A homes, in that a type B home receives certification from a <em>county </em>department of job and family services, while all other facilities receive licensure from the <em>state </em>department of job and family services. R.C. 5401.11(B) (county director of job and family services is responsible for issuing certificate to type B facilities, i.e., facilities for one to six children); R.C. 5401.02(A) (director of state department of job and family services is responsible for licensing facilities for more than six children, including type A homes).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 13} The General Assembly has authorized the director of job and family services to \u201cadopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Revised Code governing the certification of type B family day-care homes.\u201d R.C. 5104.011(G). According to R.C. 5104.011(G)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe rules * * * shall include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(g) Procedures for issuing, renewing, denying, refusing to renew, or revoking certificates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">{\u00b6 17} Pursuant to this statutory mandate, the Ohio Department of Job &amp; Family Services promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(A) An applicant, certified professional type B or limited home provider, and professional or limited certified in-home aide shall be informed in writing of the right to request a county appeal review when questioning the actions of the county department of job and family services (CDJFS) with respect to their certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(B) The following actions of the CDJFS are subject to appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(3) The CDJFS has notified the provider that his or her certificate has been or will be revoked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">{\u00b6 22} Former Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40(C) then stated, \u201cThe request for a county appeal review shall be submitted in writing to the CDJFS no later than ten calendar days after the mailing date of the CDJFS notification that there will be an adverse action taken on his/her application for certification or his/her certification.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-15\">{\u00b6 23} Thus, as it existed in 2006, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40(0) required a type B family day-care provider to request a review hearing from the county department of job and family services within 10 days of the mailing date of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>department\u2019s notification. In this case, Crawford-Cole did not file a request within this period, and the trial court concluded that she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. On appeal, however, the Sixth District held that the 10-day period set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40 is invalid because it conflicts with the 30-day appeals period in R.C. 119.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Whether Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40 conflicts with R..C. 119.07</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 24} The appellate court based its decision on the fact that R.C. 5104.011(G) obligates the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to \u201cadopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Revised Code governing the certification of type B family day-care homes.\u201d According to the court of appeals, this requirement demonstrates that the legislature intended the rules promulgated under R.C. 5104.011(G)(2)(g) to comply with the notice and hearing requirements for agency decisions set forth in R.C. Chapter 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 25} R.C. 119.07 states, \u201cNotice [of the agency\u2019s action] shall be given by registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall include the charges or other reasons for the proposed action, the law or rule directly involved, and a statement informing the party that <em>the party is entitled to a hearing if the party requests it within thirty days of the time of mailing the notice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 26} Thus, because R.C. 119.07 sets forth a 30-day period in which to request a hearing, the court of appeals held that Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40 cannot provide a shorter period in which to request a hearing on the county\u2019s decision to revoke Crawford-Cole\u2019s type B certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 27} The appellate court, however, overlooked two important aspects of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 28} First, R.C. Chapter 119 focuses on two distinct sets of procedures: one, the procedures governing administrative rulemaking, and two, the procedures governing administrative decisions by agencies. The first part of the chapter, R.C. 119.02 to 119.04, deals with rulemaking and requires agencies to give public notice of proposed rules, R.C. 119.03(A), to submit proposed rules to the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review, R.C. 119.03(H), and to submit rules to the Legislative Service Commission for publication in the Ohio Register, R.C. 119.03(B). These statutes establish procedures for the adoption, amendment, and rescission of administrative rules. See <em>Condee v. Lindley </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 90, 93, 12 OBR 79, 465 N.E.2d 450 (\u201cThe rulemaking requirements set forth in R.C. Chapter 119 are designed to permit a full and fair analysis of the impact and validity of a proposed rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">{\u00b6 29} It is the second part of the chapter, R.C. 119.06 to 119.13, that concerns agency adjudications and the procedures for notice, hearing, and appeal of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Here, the mandate in R.C. 5104.011(G) for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to \u201cadopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Revised Code governing the certification of type B family day-care homes\u201d clearly refers to the part of R.C. Chapter 119 that concerns the rulemaking process, not to the part that concerns notice, hearing, and appeal of decisions by an agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 31} Had the General Assembly intended for the notice and hearing requirements set forth in R.C. 119.06 to 119.13 to apply to the revocation of a type B day-care certificate, it could have specified that in the statute, just as it did with respect to type A and other day-care facilities. For example, R.C. 5104.011(F) requires the director of job and family services to \u201cadopt rules pursuant to Chapter 119 of the Revised Code governing the operation of type A family daycare homes,\u201d but it further states:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe rules shall include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(9) Procedures for issuing, renewing, denying, and revoking a license <em>that are not otherwise provided for in Chapter 119 of the Revised Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 35} In contrast to R.C. 5104.011(F)(9), R.C. 5104.011(G)(2)(g), the section at issue in this case, requires the rules to include \u201c[procedures for issuing, renewing, denying, refusing to renew, or revoking certificates\u201d without any reference to R.C. Chapter 119. Reading these statutes in pari materia, we conclude that the General Assembly\u2019s reference to R.C. Chapter 119 in R.C. 5104.011(G)(2) relates to the statutes governing agency <em>rule </em>making, R.C. 119.02 to 119.04, not to the statutes governing agency <em>decision </em>making, R.C. 119.06 to 119.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 36} Additional evidence <em>for </em>this legislative intent is found in R.C. 5101.09(B), which states: \u201cExcept as otherwise required by the Revised Code, the adoption of a rule in accordance with Chapter 119 of the Revised Code does not make the department of job and family services, <em>a county family services agency, </em>or a workforce development agency subject to the notice, hearing, or other requirements of sections 119.06 to 119.13 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) And pursuant to R.C. 307.981(A)(l)(a)(ii), a \u201ccounty family services agency\u201d includes \u201c[a] county department of job and family services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">{\u00b6 37} Thus, the 30-day period set forth in R.C. 119.07 does not apply to the county\u2019s decision to revoke Crawford-Cole\u2019s type B certificate and does not conflict with the 10-day period set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2-14-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">{\u00b6 38} Secondly, R.C. Chapter 119 applies only to <em>state </em>agencies. R.C. 119.01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cAs used in sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>{\u00b6 40} \u201c(A)(1) \u2018Agency\u2019 means, except as limited by this division, any official, board, or commission having authority to promulgate rules or make adjudications in the civil service commission, the division of liquor control, the department of taxation, the industrial commission, the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation, the functions of any administrative or executive officer, department, division, bureau, board, or commission of the government of the state specifically made subject to sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, and the licensing functions of any administrative or executive officer, department, division, bureau, board, or commission of the government of the state having the authority or responsibility of issuing, suspending, revoking, or canceling licenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">{\u00b6 41} All of the entities enumerated in R.C. 119.01(A)(1) are arms of \u201cthe government of the state,\u201d and the words \u201ccounty,\u201d \u201cmunicipality,\u201d or \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d do not appear anywhere in the statute. Furthermore, we reviewed R.C. 119.01(A)(1) in <em>Karrick v. Findlay School Dist Bd. of Edn. </em>(1963), 174 Ohio St. 467, 469, 23 O.O.2d 114, 190 N.E.2d 256, and stated that \u201c[a] careful reading of the above-quoted statutory language [in R.C. 119.01(A) ] clearly indicates that <em>only agencies at the state level of government are covered by </em>[i\u00fc.C. <em>Chapter 119].\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 468-169, 23 O.O.2d 114, 190 N.E.2d 256. We explained that the Administrative Procedure Act \u201cwas originally enacted in 1943 following a study by the Administrative Law Commission of state departments, commissions, boards and bureaus. Such commission made no attempt to examine the procedures and processes of local government boards, commissions, or departments.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 42} In other contexts, the General Assembly has manifested its intent to include both state agencies and counties in the scope of a statute; for example, R.C. 4117.01(B) defines a \u201cpublic employer\u201d as including both a \u201ccounty\u201d and a \u201cstate agency.\u201d Here, the legislature could have expressly included county agencies in the definition of \u201cagency\u201d under R.C. 119.01(A)(1), but it did not. And as this court stated in <em>Myers v. Toledo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 218, 2006-Ohio-4353, 852 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 24, \u201c[t]he canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius tells us that the express inclusion of one thing implies the exclusion of the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 43} Moreover, a separate statute in the Revised Code expressly governs appeals from final decisions by political subdivisions such as counties. R.C. 2506.01(A) states that \u201cevery final order, adjudication, or decision of any officer, tribunal, authority, board, bureau, commission, department, or other division <em>of any political subdivision of the state </em>may be reviewed by the court of common pleas of the county in which the principal office of the political subdivision is located as provided in Chapter 2505 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 44} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the 30-day period set forth by R.C. 119.07 does not apply to a request for a hearing on the decision of a county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>agency or conflict with the 10-day period set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5101:2 \u2014 14\u2014 40. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the court of appeals for consideration of the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A7L\">Terry J.
