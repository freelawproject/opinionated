Dohme, filed a complaint against appellant, his former employer, Eurand America, Inc., alleging wrongful retaliation, discharge in violation of public policy and violations of R.C. 4111.01.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the trial court granted summary judgment to Eurand America on the discharge-in-violation-of-public-policy claim, Dohme appealed, and the court of appeals reversed. <em>Dohme v. Eurand Am., Inc., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 593, 2007-Ohio-865, 868 N.E.2d 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">{\u00b6 2} We accepted Dohme\u2019s appeal on Proposition of Law Nos. II and III under our discretionary authority. <em>Dohme v. Eurand Am., Inc., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 1424, 2007-Ohio-2904, 868 N.E.2d 679. Following oral argument, we also accepted jurisdiction and ordered briefing on Proposition of Law No. I. <em>Eurand Am., Inc. v. Dohme, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1471, 2008-Ohio-4911, 894 N.E.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">{\u00b6 3} We recently considered in <em>Pattison v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 142, 2008-Ohio-5276, 897 N.E.2d 126, the question of whether a plaintiff that had asserted multiple claims against a single defendant, when some of those claims had been ruled upon but not converted into a final order under Civ.R. 54(B), could create a final, appealable order by voluntarily dismissing pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A) the remaining claims asserted against the defendant. We held that a plaintiff may <em>not </em>create a final, appealable order by voluntarily dismissing pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A) the remaining claims against the defendant. <em>Pattison </em>at \u00b61.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">{\u00b6 4} During the preparation of the opinion in this case, a thorough review of the record revealed that following the trial court\u2019s order dated November 21, 2005, which granted Eurand America\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Dohme\u2019s discharge-in-violation-of-public-policy claim, Dohme voluntarily dismissed his remaining claim (violations of R.C. 4111.01) without prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A). The trial court\u2019s order entered on March 7, 2006, specifically noted that the November 21, 2005 order was <em>not </em>a final, appealable order. The March 7, 2006 order also noted that Dohme \u201cretains all legal rights to re-file such claim as is provided under Civil Rule 41(A) and other Ohio law.\u201d Thus, Dohme dismissed his remaining claim without prejudice pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A) in order to create a final, appealable order.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AzyO\">Duwel &amp; Associates, David M. Duwel, and Todd T. Duwel; and Gittes &amp; Schulte and Frederick Martin Gittes, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"An-\">Scheuer, Mackin &amp; Breslin, L.L.C., and Todd D. Penney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A-B\">Tate &amp; Renner and Richard R. Renner, urging affirmance for amicus curiae, Ohio Employment Lawyers Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 5} Notwithstanding that the parties have not raised the issue of whether the order appealed from in this case was a final,' appealable order, our jurisprudence requires that we consider whether our decision in <em>Pattison </em>applies in this case. Because this case is indistinguishable from <em>Pattison, </em>for the reasons stated in <em>Pattison, </em>the order appealed from was not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 6} Accordingly, the judgment and opinion of the court of appeals are vacated on the authority of <em>Pattison v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 142, 2008-Ohio-5276, 897 N.E.2d 126. The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b412-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-15\">.

W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 142, 2008-Ohio-5276, 897 N.E.2d 126, \u00b6 23-32.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
