Moran is receiving temporary total disability compensation. All the medical evidence before us indicates that her allowed conditions have not reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d), which would disqualify her from temporary total disability compensation. But her attending physician has also stated that she can never return to her former position of employment. Moran\u2019s employer, DaimlerChrysler Corporation (now Chrysler L.L.C.), appellant, claims that this declaration justifies termination of Moran\u2019s temporary total disability compensation. Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio rejected that argument, as did the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. That issue is now before us on Chrysler\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 4123.56(A) bars temporary total disability compensation when \u201cany employee has returned to work, when an employee\u2019s treating physician has made a written statement that the employee is capable of returning to the employee\u2019s former position of employment, when work within the physical capabilities of the employee is made available by the employer or another employer, or when the employee has reached the maximum medical improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 3} Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l), in turn, defines \u201cmaximum medical improvement\u201d as \u201ca treatment plateau (static or well-stabilized) at which no fundamental functional or physiological change can be expected within reasonable medical probability in spite of continuing medical or rehabilitative procedures.\u201d Chrysler admits that Moran has not attained MMI and that none of the other disqualifying events listed in R.C. 4123.56(A) has occurred. It urges termination nevertheless because, according to her doctor, Moran is permanently unable to return to her former position of employment. In arguing that this, too, forecloses temporary total disability compensation, Chrysler relies on language from <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 632, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, quoting the Court of Appeals for Franklin County:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c \u2018An employee is entitled to be paid temporary total disability when injured and unable to work until one of the following three things occur[s]: (1) he has returned to work, (2) his treating physician has made a written statement that he is capable of returning to his former position of employment, or (3) the temporary disability has become permanent.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 5} Chrysler proposes that a temporary disability has \u201cbecome permanent\u201d when a claimant is permanently unable to return to the former position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>employment. Its position presumably rests on <em>Ramirez\u2019s </em>reference to \u201cdisability\u201d and the long-standing definition of that term as \u201c \u2018the effect that the medical impairment has on the claimant\u2019s ability to work.\u2019 \u201d <em>Meeks v. Ohio Brass Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 147, 148, 10 OBR 482, 462 N.E.2d 389, quoting the Industrial Commission\u2019s Medical Examination Manual. Chrysler thus concludes that MMI and <em>\u201cRamirez </em>permanency\u201d are distinct concepts, meaning that the permanency of either the underlying medical condition or the inability to return to the former position of employment warrants termination of temporary total disability compensation. Appellees and their amici collectively offer four counterarguments. Ultimately, analysis favors appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellees initially accuse Chrysler of ignoring the history and meaning of R.C. 4123.56(A). The statute was amended four years after <em>Ramirez </em>was decided but did not incorporate the <em>Ramirez </em>language cited by Chrysler. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 766. Instead, the General Assembly elected to address the temporariness component of temporary total disability compensation in terms of MMI. Moreover, in defining MMI in the Ohio Administrative Code, the Industrial Commission did not adopt <em>Ramirez\u2019s </em>language and instead crafted a definition that referred specifically to the underlying medical condition. According to appellees, these choices reflect a legislative and administrative desire to view permanency from a medical, not employment, perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 7} Appellees next assert that Chrysler has misread <em>Ramirez </em>by focusing on language without regard to context. Appellees emphasize that in <em>Ramirez, </em>no one ever alleged that the claimant\u2019s condition was no longer temporary, so permanency was never at issue. Instead, we were asked to decide whether a claimant who could not return to his former position of employment should be deemed to have a partial disability or a total one. We found the latter and, in so doing, created the definition of totality still used today. Appellees believe that because permanency was not at issue, there was no need for the decision to define the term. They are not convinced, therefore, that in referring to permanency in terms of a \u201cdisability,\u201d this court was definitively stating that permanency referred to the status of the claimant\u2019s inability to work and not to the underlying medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 8} This argument ties into a second point. Before 1987, the terms \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d were often used interchangeably. This practice was, in fact, so prevalent that we felt compelled in 1987 to correct it. <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 171, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, stressed that employing the terms interchangeably was inappropriate because they were not synonymous. \u201cImpairment\u201d was a medical term that referred to \u201c \u2018the amount of the claimant\u2019s anatomical and/or mental loss of function\u2019 \u201d attributable to the industrial injury. <em>Ohio Brass, </em>10 Ohio St.3d at 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>10 OBR 482, 462 N.E.2d 389, quoting the Industrial Commission\u2019s Medical Examination Manual. \u201cDisability\u201d was a legal designation of the effect of the medical impairment on the ability to work. Id. at 149, 10 OBR 482, 462 N.E.2d 389. Because <em>Ramirez </em>was written during this time frame, appellees again question the deliberateness with which the term \u201cdisability\u201d was selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees next assert that a large body of case law both before and after <em>Ramirez </em>contradicts the interpretation that Chrysler espouses. As early as 1944, this court articulated a definition of permanency that foreshadowed the definition of MMI now in the Administrative Code. <em>Logsdon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 508, 28 O.O. 429, 57 N.E.2d 75, held at paragraph two of the syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe term \u2018permanent\u2019 as applied to disability under the workmen\u2019s compensation law does not mean that such disability must necessarily continue for the life of a claimant, but that it will, with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">{\u00b6 11} Common to both <em>Logsdon </em>and Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(l) is a probable lack of improvement, which, in the context of the Administrative Code definition, clearly refers to the underlying medical condition. <em>Logsdon </em>does, of course, refer to \u201cdisability,\u201d but it also preceded <em>Stephenson, </em>so it is not clear whether the term was employed purposefully or in a more generic sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">{\u00b6 12} <em>Logsdon </em>was not cited in <em>Ramirez. </em>It was, however, cited four years after <em>Ramirez </em>in a case that squarely addressed the concept of permanency. In <em>Vulcan Materials Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 494 N.E.2d 1125, we held:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[I]n the consideration of the permanency of a disability, the commission need not determine whether the claimant could return to his former position of employment. The commission\u2019s designation of a disability as permanent relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 14} <em>Vulcan </em>was followed by <em>State ex rel. Gen. Am. Transp. Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 25, 548 N.E.2d 928. <em>General American </em>reaffirmed <em>Vulcan\u2019s </em>definition, explaining that \u201c[a] claimant\u2019s permanent inability to return to his former position of employment does not mean the claimant\u2019s medical condition will not improve.\u201d Id. at 26, 548 N.E.2d 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 15} At approximately the same time, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County decided <em>State ex rel. Matlack, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 648, 655, 598 N.E.2d 121, which ruled:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201c[T]emporary total benefits will be paid during the healing and treatment period for the condition until the claimant has reached some certain level of stabilization. When this stabilization has been reached and no further improvement is probable, then the condition is permanent * * (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>State ex rel. Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Kohler </em>(1990), 55 Ohio St.3d 109, 110, 564 N.E.2d 76, we stated that \u201c[pjermanency relates to the perceived longevity of the condition\u201d and treated \u201cpermanency\u201d and \u201cMMI\u201d as synonymous. <em>State ex rel. Eberhardt v. Flxible Corp. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 649, 653, 640 N.E.2d 815, added that \u201cso long as the claimant\u2019s condition has not stabilized, and further medical improvement can be expected, TTD benefits are payable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 18} In contrast to these cases, Chrysler points to <em>State ex rel. Advantage Tank Lines v. Indus. Comm., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 16, 2005-Ohio-5829, 836 N.E.2d 550. At issue was the claimant\u2019s ability to concurrently receive permanent partial and temporary total compensation for the same condition. The employer argued that it was incongruous to simultaneously pay compensation for both permanent and a temporary disability for the same condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 19} We affirmed the ability to receive dual payment under the right circumstances. We explained that the two forms of compensation focused on completely different things: while temporary total disability compensation centered on the claimant\u2019s ability to return to the former position of employment, permanent partial disability compensation was unconcerned with a claimant\u2019s ability to work. We also noted that \u201cpermanency\u201d had a different meaning as applied to each form of compensation. In describing permanency in the context of temporary total disability, we wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTTC awards are based exclusively on a claimant\u2019s ability to return to his or her former position of employment. In this context, a determination that a disability is permanent means that the condition will never improve to the point where the claimant can resume his or her former job. Thus, when this determination is made, the disability is no longer considered <em>temporary, </em>so TTC is terminated.\u201d (Emphasis sic; citations omitted.) <em>Advantage Tank Lines, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 16, 2005-Ohio-5829, 836 N.E.2d 550, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 21} Chrysler cites this passage as proof that \u201cpermanency\u201d and \u201cMMI\u201d remain distinct and that temporary total disability compensation must cease if either of those conditions is met. The court of appeals rejected that contention:</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cAlthough <em>Advantage </em>does contain dicta that seems to support relator\u2019s argument, <em>Advantage </em>did not directly address the issue presented here. We agree with the magistrate that the issue before us was directly addressed in <em>Vulcan </em>wherein the court expressly held that \u2018[t]he commission\u2019s designation of a disability as permanent relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s ability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment.\u2019 <em>Vulcan </em>[25 Ohio St.3d] at 33 [25 OBR 26, 494 N.E.2d 1125]. Although <em>Advantage </em>was decided after <em>Vulcan, </em>the court in <em>Advantage </em>did not discuss, let alone overrule, <em>Vulcan. </em>Moreover, as previously noted, the language relator relies on in <em>Advantage </em>is dicta. The holding in <em>Vulcan </em>is controlling.\u201d Franklin App. No. 06AP-968, 2007-Ohio-4799, 2007 WL 2702890, at \u00b6 4.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ADK\">Eastman &amp; Smith, Ltd., Thomas J.

Sant, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 23} The court of appeals\u2019 observations are compelling. It is perhaps telling that the only case on temporary total disability compensation cited in the entire <em>Advantage </em>opinion is <em>Ramirez. </em>There is no mention of <em>Logsdon, Vulcan, Matlock, </em>or any of the cases previously discussed that both expressly defined permanency and called into question the significance of Ramirez\u2019s reference to that concept. Given the amount of case law that has addressed permanency in terms of the underlying medical condition, the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning has substantial merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 24} Ultimately, appellees and their amici offer a stronger argument than Chrysler does. For the reasons set forth above, we continue to declare MMI to be the only standard by which temporary total disability compensation can be terminated on a basis of permanency.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 25} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b480-10\">Lanzinger, J., not participating.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"APm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Stewart Jaffy &amp; Associates Co., L.P.A., Stewart R.
