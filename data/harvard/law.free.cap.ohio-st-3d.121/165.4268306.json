Because the court of appeals erred in holding that appellant\u2019s mandamus claim was moot and in determining that appellant was therefore not entitled to an award of attorney fees, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Arrest and Municipal Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">{\u00b6 2} Michel Veillette was arrested in January 2008 and was accused of murdering his wife and their four children in their Mason, Ohio home. Veillette appeared in the Mason Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing that was open to the public. At the hearing, the state introduced several exhibits, including Veillette\u2019s taped statement, crime-scene photographs, and a crime-scene diagram. Mason Municipal Court Judge Andrew Batsche sealed the search warrant and related records in connection with the criminal investigation and subsequently sealed the records related to the criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">Common Pleas Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">{\u00b6 3} On January 28, 2008, appellee Warren County Common Pleas Court Judge Neal Bronson granted the state\u2019s motion and sealed the records in Veillette\u2019s criminal case \u201cbound over from Mason Municipal Court.\u201d Appellant, the Cincinnati Enquirer, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., requested that Judge Batsche and Judge James Heath of the Warren County Common Pleas Court vacate Judge Batsche\u2019s sealing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>{\u00b6 4} A few months after the sealing orders, Judge Heath conducted a hearing at which the state argued that Veillette \u201cwould be deprived of a fair trial by disclosure of the information that was presented at the preliminary hearing.\u201d Veillette joined in the state\u2019s motion. Judge Heath decided that the materials should remain sealed in accordance with Judge Bronson\u2019s and Judge Batsche\u2019s orders:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIn light of the interests of the Defendant, those being primary at this point in time, the fact that this information potentially could taint the jury pool, in order to protect his due process rights, I think it is appropriate that the information remain sealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 6} A few days later, the Enquirer filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Warren County for a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Heath, Judge Bronson, and Judge Batsche to vacate their orders sealing the records relating to Veillette\u2019s criminal case and to provide the records for inspection and copying. The Enquirer also requested an award of attorney fees. The Enquirer later voluntarily dismissed Judge Batsche from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 7} On April 15, 2008, Veillette committed suicide in his Warren County jail cell. Judge Heath then ordered that the previous order sealing the records from the preliminary hearing be lifted because of Veillette\u2019s death. Judge Heath and Judge Bronson filed a motion to dismiss the Enquirer\u2019s complaint based on mootness. The court of appeals granted the motion and dismissed the cause. The court of appeals also denied the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">{\u00b6 8} This cause is now before the court upon the Enquirer\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">Mandamus Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals held that the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim was moot because the Enquirer had been provided the requested records after Veillette\u2019s suicide, which was less than a month after Judge Heath\u2019s hearing on the state\u2019s motion to seal the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[I]n general, providing the requested records to the relator in a public-records mandamus case renders the mandamus claim moot.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Seneca Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 372, 2008-Ohio-6253, 899 N.E.2d 961, \u00b6 43; <em>State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, 894 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">{\u00b6 11} But a claim \u201cis not moot if it is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Geer, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643, 873 N.E.2d 314, \u00b6 10. This exception \u201capplies only in exceptional circumstances in which the following two factors are both present: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>challenged action is too short in its duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>State ex rel Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">{\u00b6 12} We have recognized that \u201c[cjourtroom closure cases often evade review, since a closure order usually expires before an appellate court can consider it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Donaldson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 586 N.E.2d 101. To be sure, the orders sealing the records from the preliminary hearing, including a transcript of the hearing, may not be representative of classic orders closing proceedings by excluding members of the public from a hearing. In fact, the preliminary hearing before Judge Batsche and the hearing on the state\u2019s motion to seal the record before Judge Heath were not closed to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 13} Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has held that similar orders refusing the release of a transcript of a preliminary hearing in a criminal case are not rendered moot by the subsequent release of the transcript, because \u201c[i]t can reasonably be assumed that [members of the news media] will be subjected to a similar closure order and, because criminal proceedings are typically of short duration, such an order will likely evade review.\u201d <em>Press-Ent. Co. v. Superior Court of California for Riverside Cty. </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 1, 6, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1; see also <em>Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 368, 377, 99 S.Ct. 2898, 61 L.Ed.2d 608 (newspaper owner\u2019s subsequent access to transcript of suppression hearing that was previously closed did not render action challenging order moot, because \u201cto the extent the order has the effect of denying access to the transcript, termination of the underlying criminal proceeding * * * nearly always will lead to a lifting of the order before appellate review is completed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 14} Therefore, based on this precedent, the mere fact that Veillette\u2019s suicide led to Judge Heath\u2019s lifting of the sealing order did not render the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim moot. The court of appeals erred in holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals denied the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees based on the judges\u2019 provision of the requested records:</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe motion to dismiss indicates that respondent Heath lifted the order sealing records from the preliminary hearing immediately upon Veillette\u2019s death. The issue of whether the records sought by relator were being legally and/or properly withheld by respondents has never been litigated in this case due to the death of Mr. Veillette. Accordingly, the request for attorney fees is DENIED.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A_b\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., and John C. Greiner, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A0m\">Rachel A. Hutzel, Warren County Prosecuting Attorney, and Keith W. Anderson and Mary K. Martin, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">{\u00b6 17} The court of appeals erred in so holding because, as previously discussed, the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim was not rendered moot by the provision of the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 18} In addition, even if the Enquirer\u2019s mandamus claim were properly dismissed as moot, a claim for attorney fees in a public-records mandamus action is not rendered moot by the provision of the requested records after the case has been filed. See <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Dupuis, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002-Ohio-7041, 781 N.E.2d 163, \u00b6 9; see also <em>State ex rel. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Mentor </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 440, 448, 732 N.E.2d 969 (mootness of public-records mandamus claims does not preclude an award of attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 19} Based on the foregoing, we reverse the court of appeals\u2019 judgment dismissing the Enquirer\u2019s complaint for a writ of mandamus and denying the Enquirer\u2019s request for attorney fees. Because the court of appeals did not address the merits of these claims, a remand for the introduction of additional evidence and argument is appropriate. See <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. McGee Brown </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 408, 411, 686 N.E.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b302-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
