Trials by the Court\u2014Ora Conflicting Evidence.\u2014A judge trying a case without a jury sees the witnesses when they testify, his opportunities for discovering the truth are superior to those possessed by a court of appeal, and as a rule his finding should not be disturbed.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-6\" pgmap=\"474\">Transcript, from a justice of the peace.

Where the evidence is conflicting, as in this case, the finding will be sustained unless it is manifestly against the weight of the evidence, and certainly not where the evidence is conflicting and nearly balanced. The finding will not be set aside as unwarranted if the evidence of the prevailing party is by itself sufficient, if believed, to support it. This has been uniformly held to be the law by our Supreme and Appellate Courts in almost every volume of the reports. Bush v. Kindred, 20 Ill. 93; Tolmas v. Race, 36 Ill. 472; Forlouf v.

So believing, the judgment was right.</p> <p id=\"b475-10\" pgmap=\"475\">Appellee was contradicted by appellant upon all the material points in issue, and upon some of them by appellant\u2019s daughter. But all the witnesses were seen by the court when they testified. His opportunities for discovering the truth were superior to ours.</p> <p id=\"b475-11\" pgmap=\"475\">The case does not justify a review in detail of the conflicting points of contention in the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b475-12\" pgmap=\"475\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
