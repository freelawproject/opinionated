Before the track of the railroad was raised, over it from his lot he could receive the wholesome east wind from Lake Michigan, and view the beauties of Jackson Park. The track has been raised twenty feet and filled to that height, and the street in front of his lot cut down four feet; all to the injury of his lot in value, and obstruction of access to it.</p> <p id=\"b287-6\" pgmap=\"287\">Eor these misdeeds, committed jointly by them, he sued the city and the railroad, and they demurred.</p> <p id=\"b287-7\" pgmap=\"287\">The court sustained the demurrer, and final judgment was entered for the appellees.</p> <p id=\"b287-8\" pgmap=\"287(19) 288(13)\">Raising and filling the railroad track upon the railroad\u2019s own ground, gives the appellant no right of action against anybody.
