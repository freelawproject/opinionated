Evidence\u2014Declarations of Payee of a Note as Against an Indorsee.\u2014A claimed to have been in partnership with B in the saloon business, and after B\u2019s death filed a bill against his wife, seeking to establish such claim and to obtain a share of the proceeds of a sale of the saloon made by B during his last illness. The evidence showed that notes for which the saloon was sold were given to the wife, and that she claimed as an indorsee and not as an heir or purchaser. Held, that B\u2019s declarations as to the ownership of the saloon were admissible against her.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b295-4\" pgmap=\"295\">2.

Rowen v. Bowles, 21 Ill. 17. He must stand or fall by the case made in his bill. Gage v. Curtis, 122 Ill. 520. He can not allege one case and recover by proof of another. Trunkey v. Hedstrom, 131 Ill. 209.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\" pgmap=\"295\">It is also the rule that all facts must be clearly and positively averred in (pleading Primmer v. Patten, 32 Ill. 531), and not by way of recital, and the right, title and interest of the complainant should be stated with accuracy, clearness and precision, and the proof must correspond with the allegations.

Smith, 130 Ill. 304.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-10\" pgmap=\"295\">The rule that proofs without corresponding allegations are, in equity, as unavailing as allegations without proofs, is familiar to every lawyer.

Crone died in Chicago, leaving as his only heirs, appellant, his widow, appellee, his father, and Mrs. Knapp, his sister.</p> <p id=\"b296-7\" pgmap=\"296\">Walter Crone had been a saloon keeper. Appellee claimed to have furnished most of the capital therefor, and to have been a partner therein.</p> <p id=\"b296-8\" pgmap=\"296\">A bill was filed by appellee to establish such claim and obtain a share of the proceeds for which the saloon was by Walter sold during his last illness.</p> <p id=\"b296-9\" pgmap=\"296\">The declarations of Walter as to the ownership of the saloon were properly received.</p> <p id=\"b296-10\" pgmap=\"296\">Appellant was not a purchaser.

Cowen and Hill\u2019s Motes to Phillips on Evidence, Yol. 1, pages 256-267.</p> <p id=\"b296-13\" pgmap=\"296\">The objections to the following questions asked of appellant by her counsel: \u201c Why was this $1,000 to be paid to complainant,\u201d \u201c and why complainant\u2019s name was over the door of the saloon,\u201d were properly sustained. Each called for the conclusion of the witness.</p> <p id=\"b296-14\" pgmap=\"296\">While the rule is that the allegations and proofs in proceedings in chancery must correspond, relief will not be denied because of mere variance, unless the case stated and the case found are so materially variant as to prevent a deeree in favor of the complainant. Lowenstein v. Rapp, 67 Ill. App. 678; Barton\u2019s Chancery Practice, 260.</p> <p id=\"b296-15\" pgmap=\"296\">We find in this case no variance so material as to require the setting aside of the decree rendered.</p> <p id=\"b296-16\" pgmap=\"296\">The evidence abundantly sustains the decree, and it is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
