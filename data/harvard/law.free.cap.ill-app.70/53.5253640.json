The argument of a cause is as much part of the trial as the hearing of the evidence. A party to a civil suit has a right to be heard either by himself or by counsel, not only in the testimony bub also in the argument of his case. No matter how weak or inconclusive the case may be, if it is enough to present a disputed question of fact the counsel of the party has a right to present his client\u2019s case to the jury.
