The answer as to his employment was, that he managed a restaurant, etc. The keeping of a restaurant is so commonly connected with the selling of liquors and the keeping of a bar, that the statement \u201c managing a restaurant, etc.,\u201d would, to the ordinary mind, convey the idea that applicant, among other things, sold liquors or \u201ctended\u201d bar.</p> <p id=\"b143-3\" pgmap=\"143\">The phrase et c\u00e6tera, for which etc. is an abbreviation, imports other purposes of a like character to those which have been named.
