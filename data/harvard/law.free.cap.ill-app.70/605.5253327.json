May, a policeman, and Alexander Ensminger, a private watchman, arrested three men who were found in a box car at Taylorville, Christian county, Illinois, and con. fined them in the city prison. On the following morning on going to the prison, Warren R. Eltzroth, the chief of police, found that said prisoners had in their possession a full set of burglars\u2019 tools.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\" pgmap=\"607\">Finding the burglars\u2019 tools in possession of the men a notice was sent to Chicago and St Louis daily papers. On May 18th the cashier read an account of the arrest and description of the men in the Chicago Tribune and mailed one of the postal cards to the chief of police of Taylorville. Eltzroth wired back that he had the men and to send parties to identify them. On the 16th of May, the sheriff of Henry county, with Horn and Murphy, arrived in Taylor-ville, and Horn and Murphy identified the prisoners as the men who had boarded their train at Orion on the morning of the 4th of May.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\" pgmap=\"607\">Eltzroth, Ensminger and May, during the time intervening between the arrest of the prisoners and the arrival of Quinn, had sworn out warrants against the prisoners for having burglars\u2019 tools in their possession in order to detain them, and had had their photographs taken.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\" pgmap=\"607\">Eltzroth took with him the kit of burglars\u2019 tools and the photographs and returned with Quinn and accompanied him and the state\u2019s attorney of Henry county to Orion, and upon fitting them to the vault door of the bank they found that the tools were the same as those with which the job was done at Orion.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-8\" pgmap=\"607(38) 608(68)\">At the June term, A. D. 1895, of Henry County Circuit Court, the parties arrested at Taylorville, were indicted under the names of Lawrence J. Sullivan, William J. Lawrence and William Monroe and tried, convicted and sentenced for the robbery of said bank. January 27,1896, the bill of interpleader was filed to have determined who had earned and was entitled to said reward, and at the October term, A. D. 1896, the court decreed that after the payment of the costs the balance remaining should be equally divided between said Eltzroth, Horn and Murphy, from which decree Eltzroth, Ensminger and May prosecute this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-5\" pgmap=\"608\">Hand &amp; Hand, attorneys for appellants; Ricks &amp; Creighton, of counsel.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-6\" pgmap=\"608\">FT.

It is a ivell settled doctrine that there can be no claim for services when they are rendered in ignorance of the reward. The reason of the doctrine is founded upon the principle that to the existence of every contract there must be mutual assent. There can be no assent to that of v/hich the party has never heard.</p> <p id=\"b609-4\" pgmap=\"609\">The arrests made by them were in discharge of their duties as a police officer and a watchman. After the identification of the robbers there was nothing done by them toward securing their conviction other than what could have been required of them as witnesses.</p> <p id=\"b609-5\" pgmap=\"609\">\u25a0 Although Horn and Murphy did not know of the robbery and the reward when a description of the three suspicious looking men who boarded the train was furnished, and would not, therefore, be entitled to the reward for that service, yet their going voluntarily to Tavlorville to identify the prisoners and the further assistance they gave Eltzroth in fastening the crime upon them were all with the view on their part of sharing in the reward. They co-operated with Eltzroth and were certainly as much entitled to the reward as he was. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
