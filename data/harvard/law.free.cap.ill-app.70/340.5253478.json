That during the months immediately following, and until the month of January, 1895, the payments of said money, to wit, thirty dollars ($30), were sent by the defendant to the complainant. That defendant knowingly and falsely misled complainant by causing and procuring a decree to be entered in said cause; that said defendant and said counsel, pretending to represent this complainant, falsely induced complainant to sign the so-called fraudulent agreement, with the intention of deliberately setting the same up as a defense, and that the allegations of the complainant contained in the bill filed therein were true.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-13\" pgmap=\"342\">Appellant appeared in this cause and moved to strike the bill from the files and to dismiss the suit.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-14\" pgmap=\"342\">On December 18, 1896, an order was entered as follows:</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-3\" pgmap=\"343\">\u201c First. That motion filed on behalf of defendants to strike the bill filed herein from the files be overruled and disallowed.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-4\" pgmap=\"343\">Second. That motion for solicitor\u2019s fees and alimony jpend.ente lite be allowed. The court decrees that said defendant McKenna pay to complainant, within thirty days from this date, the sum of $350 as and for temporary alimony on behalf of the complainant, and expenses heretofore incurred; that said defendant pay the additional sum of $30 per month to complainant as additional alimony j^ndente lite, said payments beginning on the 1st day of December, 1896. And it was further ordered and decreed that said defendant pay to the solicitor for the complainant as and for complainant\u2019s solicitor\u2019s fees, the sum of $300.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-5\" pgmap=\"343\">January 21, 1897, appellant filed his verified answer, denying that appellee is or ever was his ivife; also setting forth that appellee brought suit against him upon the agreement set up in her bill, and obtained before a justice of the peace a judgment against him for $90. Appellant also, on January llth, moved that the order for alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees entered in the present suit be set aside, and in support of such motion filed an affidavit setting forth that said order was entered without his knowledge and wholly without his consent and approval; that he was not served with notice of an application for alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees; that said order was irregularly entered, without opportunityfor affiant to be heard, his counsel having entered a special and not a general appearance, as hereinbefore stated, which motion of appellant was overruled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">Strong, Struokmann, Ehle &amp; Milsted, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-7\" pgmap=\"343\">W. A. Doyle and J. D. Andrews, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b343-8\" pgmap=\"343\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"AB_\" pgmap=\"343\">delivered the opinion oe the Court.</p> <p id=\"b343-9\" pgmap=\"343(31) 344(15)\">An order to pay temporary alimony or solicitor\u2019s fees must be based upon a finding that the party so commanded to pay is the husband of the complainant. If such condition be admitted or not denied, it may, for the purpose of the order, be assumed.</p> <p id=\"b344-4\" pgmap=\"344\">In the view of the writer of this opinion, when the existence of. the .alleged' marriage is denied, no such order can properly be made until a hearing has been had and the court upon it finds and adjudges that the relation of wife and husband exists.</p> <p id=\"b344-5\" pgmap=\"344\">If, before hearing and without regard to the denials of the defendant, an order to pay temporary alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees can be made upon the mere filing of a bill alleging marriage of the complainant to the defendant, cause for divorce or separate maintenance, and ability of the defendant to pay, then an easy method for procuring the temporary support of unmarried women and good fees for the bar has been found.</p> <p id=\"b344-6\" pgmap=\"344\">Upon disputed questions of fact to compel one to pay without a hearing, is to deprive him of property without due process of law, for due process of law involves a hearing upon the allegations and denials of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b344-7\" pgmap=\"344\">If the defendant merely deny the alleged cause for separation, ordinarily, an order for alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees may be made, for the fact of marriage entitles the suing wife to such- order, whether she has cause or not for bring- ' ing suit; while if there be no marriage there can not be obligation to support or to furnish funds to enable the complainant to prosecute lawsuits. Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, Vol. 2, Sec. 924; Vreeland v. Vreeland, 3 N. J. Eq. 43.</p> <p id=\"b344-8\" pgmap=\"344\">In the case of Schonwald v. Schonwald, 1 Phillips\u2019 Eq. 219, which is based upon the statute of Uorth Carolina, there is a dictum to the effect that temporary alimony may be allowed, notwithstanding a denial of the marriage by the defendant, the court saying :</p> <p id=\"b344-9\" pgmap=\"344(68) 345(58)\">\u201c Our statute is general * * * and puts the right to be allowed alimony pendente lite upon the sufficiency of the matter set forth in the petition; proceeding upon the idea that it is better when a woman makes oath, under the penalty affixed to perjury, to the fact of marriage, to take it to be true for the purpose of allowing alimony pendente lite, even, although it may turn out to be false, and the man may have but little chance to get back what he ought not to have been compelled to pay, rather than subject a wife t\u00f3 the danger of starvation, if a brutal husband makes oath denying the fact of marriage, which may turn out to be false.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b345-4\" pgmap=\"345\">The logical conclusion from such premise is, and the more accurate statement would be, that it is better to compel any man to pay temporary alimony and expenses of suit to any woman who may see fit to make oath that he is her husband, however strongly he may deny the accusation, rather than allow her to be in want of money which he has.</p> <p id=\"b345-5\" pgmap=\"345\">In the present case it appears from the bill filed by appellee. two years before bringing the present suit, she, under her hand and seal, declared that she was notand'never had been the wife of appellant, and had no claim upon him, and that she consented that her suit for separate maintenance be dismissed for want of equity; .and that such decree was thereupon entered.</p> <p id=\"b345-6\" pgmap=\"345\">The bill in the present case alleges that such decree was procured by fraud of appellant, and appellee, asks that it be set aside, but she does not allege that since the entry of the same there has been any marriage or act indicating a marriage relation.</p> <p id=\"b345-7\" pgmap=\"345\">In the face of such statement and decree, the court should not, without some proof, have awarded to the complainant temporary alimony and solicitor\u2019s fees.</p> <p id=\"b345-8\" pgmap=\"345\">The order of the Circuit Court is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b345-9\" pgmap=\"345\">In Ho. 202 of the present term, McKenna v. McKenna, the record being the same as that in which the foregoing opinion is given, the order of the Circuit Court is reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
