Eviction\u2014W/iaf is Not.\u2014The fact that a landlord re-enters upon leased premises and repairs a building damaged by fire without objection on the part of the lessee, and requests such lessee to remove his effects from such building, does not amount to an eviction.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-8\" pgmap=\"349\">3. Landlord and Tenant\u2014W/ien. the Landlord May Relet for the Benefit of the Tenant.\u2014Where the lessee of a building damaged by fire permits the landlord to repair th\u00e9 same; but vacates the premises, insists that the lease is terminated and refuses to pay rent, the landlord may relet the same for the benefit of such tenant lessee, and his liability for rent will be diminished to the amount of rent from such reletting.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b349-9\" pgmap=\"349\">\u20184.

Same\u2014Re-entry for Making Repairs Not an Eviction.\u2014Taking possession of premises damaged by fire, by a landlord, with the apparent consent of a tenant, for the purpose of making necessary repairs, is not an eviction, nor is a tenant who has abandoned the premises and refused to pay rent relieved from liability by the action of the landlord in renting the premises to another party, save to the extent of the rent received by the landlord on account of such renting.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-11\" pgmap=\"349\">Debt, for rent.

The act of appellee in rebuilding was therefore in the highest degree beneficial to appellant. So far from the rebuilding being a thing of which appellant may justly complain, it was for its interest and benefit, and went on without its protest.</p> <p id=\"b353-7\" pgmap=\"353\">There was, by appellee, no interference with appellant\u2019s possession, save such as was. necessary in order to rebuild, and none to which appellant objected.</p> <p id=\"b353-8\" pgmap=\"353\">Appellant was by the fire driven out of the building; only a small quantity of its goods remained in the premises. Doubtless it could have insisted upon its right to full possession of all it had rented, and thus prevented a rebuilding by appellee, or it might itself have rebuilt, but it evinced no disposition to do either. \u2022 . \u2022</p> <p id=\"b353-9\" pgmap=\"353\">Meither the rebuilding by appellee nor the request to appellant to remove its barrels, etc., was an eviction.
