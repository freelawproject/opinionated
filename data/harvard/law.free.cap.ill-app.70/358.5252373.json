Wharton v. Anderson, 28 Minn. 301.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\" pgmap=\"360\">\u2022 There is some confusion in the books as to the precise effect of a stated account upon the rights of the parties, but we are inclined to the opinion that it is only prima facie evidence of the correctness of the balance, and not conclusive upon it, unless in arriving at the agreed balance there has been some concession made upon items disputed between the parties, so that the balance is. the result of a compromise, or some act has been done or forborne in consequence of the accounting, and relying upon it, which would put the party claiming the benefit of it in a worse position than as though it had not been had, so as to bring the case within the principles of an estoppel in pais. A stated account, not affected by such new consideration or estoppel, may be impeached for mistake or error in law or in fact, with respect to the items included in it, or for omission of items.

It is as follows:</p> <p id=\"b361-6\" pgmap=\"361\">\u201c Albert Pick, Pres.

In this appellee was corroborated by a Mr. Loser.</p> <p id=\"b362-5\" pgmap=\"362\">Appellant denied that the \u201cstatement\u201d was anything more than a transcript from the ledger, and insisted that appellee should be charged with certain goods sold by him which had not been paid for, and also with certain goods charged to him upon the order of a third party.</p> <p id=\"b362-6\" pgmap=\"362\">Appellant sought to introduce evidence concerning what was said when appellee was hired as to uncollectible accounts for goods he might sell.</p> <p id=\"b362-7\" pgmap=\"362\">Upon the trial appellant desired to show the conversation bad with appellee when the statement was made, that appellant had claims against appellee growing out of his contract of employment by it; also, what the terms of the contract under which appellee was hired were.</p> <p id=\"b362-8\" pgmap=\"362\">The president of appellant corporation testified that it had claims against appellee for goods sold and delivered, and also what such claims are. That these claims arose subsequent to the making of the statement did not appear; and appellant also wished to introduce evidence showing the terms under which appellee entered its service.</p> <p id=\"b362-9\" pgmap=\"362\">Such evidence was properly rejected. \u2018</p> <p id=\"b362-10\" pgmap=\"362\">Appellee\u2019s suit ivas upon an account stated, and upon nothing else. If there were no stating of an account, then appellee had no case.</p> <p id=\"b362-11\" pgmap=\"362\">What the terms of the hiring of appellee were, and what claims appellant had against him when the alleged statement was made, was immaterial.</p> <p id=\"b362-12\" pgmap=\"362\">If there were a statement and if appellee had produced it in evidence, it could be attacked only for fraud or mistake.</p> <p id=\"b362-13\" pgmap=\"362\">There was no attempt to show either fraud or mistake in the making of the alleged stated account.</p> <p id=\"b362-14\" pgmap=\"362\">An account stated is not conclusive upon the parties; it does afford a prima faoie case. Gruby v. Smith, 13 Ill. App. 43; McKinster v. Hitchcock, 19 Neb. 100; St. Louis Co. v. Bank, 8 Colo. 70; Vandemeer v. Statesir, 39 N. J. Law, 593; Clarke v. Marbourg, 33 Kansas, 471.</p> <p id=\"b363-3\" pgmap=\"363\">The court held all the propositions of law submitted by appellant, except the following;</p> <p id=\"b363-4\" pgmap=\"363\">That the declarations and statements alleged to have been rendered by various officers of the corporation to the plaintiff in this case would not constitute an account stated as between the plaintiff and the defendant corporation.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b363-5\" pgmap=\"363\">In refusing to hold this there was no error; it was not a proposition of law, but of fact.</p> <p id=\"b363-6\" pgmap=\"363\">The court found the issues for the plaintiff, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at the sum of eight hundred and thirty-six dollars and twenty-five cents.</p> <p id=\"b363-7\" pgmap=\"363\">The court thus, upon conflicting testimony, found that there was an account stated, as testified by appellee.</p> <p id=\"b363-8\" pgmap=\"363\">That when the account was stated the hiring and service of appellee had come to an end is undisputed. The case is, therefore, not like that of Phelps v. Hubbard, 59 Ill. 79, in which there had been only a partial performance.</p> <p id=\"b363-9\" pgmap=\"363\">The president and secretary of appellant are presumed to have had authority to make and render the statement in question.</p> <p id=\"b363-10\" pgmap=\"363\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
