Sec. 5, Ch. 95, Mortgages; Sec. 36, Ch. 30, Conveyances.</p> <p id=\"b170-12\" pgmap=\"170(22) 171(92)\">Appellant offered to prove that he had \u201c made a demand \u201d upon the appellee\u2014of or for what was not stated\u2014and he excepted to the refusal of the court to permit the questions to the appellee, whether he had handed to his counsel, or his counsel had in his possession, any paper executed by Reitz to the appellee subsequent to the mortgage under which the appellee claimed. We need not consider those questions further than to say that vague and general as they were, accompanied by no offer to prove any specific thing, but being merely fishing, no error was committed by the court in the rulings. Gaffield v. Scott, 33 Ill. App. 317.</p> <p id=\"b171-4\" pgmap=\"171\">The appellant had an easy method open to him to prove that later mortgage\u2014if one there was\u2014by complying with the statutes hereinbefore referred to; not adopting it, there is no question of such mortgage in the case, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> <author id=\"b171-5\" pgmap=\"171\">Mr. Justice Waterman.</author> <p id=\"b171-6\" pgmap=\"171\">I am of the opinion that the court should not have sustained the objection made to certain questions asked by appellant; but had the witness been permitted to answer, and if by competent evidence it had appeared that a subsequent mortgage was in existence, such proof only would not have invalidated the first mortgage or raised a presumption that it had been satisfied.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
