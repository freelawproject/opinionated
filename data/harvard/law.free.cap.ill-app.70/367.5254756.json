Driver, which note was duo December 1, 1895. After a plea of the general issue, with affidavit of meritorious defense, October 19, 1896, both parties appeared; by agreement the case was passed, jury waived, and cause set for trial on November 2, 1896, upon the short cause calendar. No replication was ever filed. Rule 18 of the Circuit Court provides that, \u201cno cause shall be noticed for trial until the same is at issue.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-6\" pgmap=\"368\">The counsel of defendant who had filed pleas, being ill, other counsel were substituted, who moved to strike the cause from the short cause calendar, because the suit was not at issue when placed on such calendar. This being denied, counsel asked for a few hours time in which to prepare a special plea; this was denied, and upon trial judgment for the plaintiff for the amount of the note was rendered.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-7\" pgmap=\"368\">David J.

Wheatley, Buck &amp; Co. v. Chicago Trust &amp; Savings Bank, 64 Ill. App. 612.</p> <p id=\"b368-11\" pgmap=\"368(59) 369(12)\">The cause was originally set for trial on November 2d. Upon that day there was no court. November 9th the case was continued to November 16th on account of the illness of defendant\u2019s attorney. November 16th there was no trial of cases on the short cause calendar. November 23d, defendant, after his motion to strike from the calendar had been overruled, asked for time in which to file a special plea.</p> <p id=\"b369-4\" pgmap=\"369\">We can not say that the court in refusing to give time for the filing of a special plea, abused its discretion. The filing of such plea might have necessitated a further continuance of the cause. No sufficient reason for not having before presented such plea was shown.</p> <p id=\"b369-5\" pgmap=\"369\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
