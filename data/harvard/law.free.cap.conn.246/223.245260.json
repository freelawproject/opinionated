The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether a defendant in a negligence action may cite in a criminal assailant as an apportionment defendant. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s apportionment complaint against the assailant because it concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the compar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ative negligence statute, permits apportionment only between parties alleged to have been negligent. In this appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant argues that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the apportionment complaint because: (1) this court previously has recognized the viability of such a complaint in <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>236 Conn. 670, 674 A.2d 839 (1996); (2) as a matter of statutory interpretation, the apportionment complaint falls within \u00a7 52-572h; and (3) even if we were to conclude that the text of \u00a7 52-572h does not permit apportionment between negligent and intentional tortfeasors, we should nevertheless recognize such an action as a matter of common law. We agree with the defendant\u2019s third claim and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u201cIn an appeal from a judgment granting a motion to strike, we operate in accordance with well established principles.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Skuzinski </em>v. <em>Bouchard Fuels, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 694, 696, 694 A.2d 788 (1997). \u201c[W]e must take as true the facts alleged in the plaintiffs complaint and must construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency. ... If facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peter-Michael, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sea Shell Associates, </em>244 Conn. 269, 270-71, 709 A.2d 558 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">We assume as true the following facts as alleged in the plaintiffs complaint. The defendant was the owner of a Sunoco gasoline service station and convenience store (station) located at 336 Main Street in Norwalk. Nand\u00fa C. Patel and Sumitra N. Patel leased the station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>from the defendant and operated it pursuant to a franchise agreement (agreement) with the defendant. The defendant was responsible for the supervision of the franchisees, their agents and their employees. In addition, the defendant installed and supervised all security measures located at the station. Pursuant to the agreement, the station was to be operated twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The station had experienced a history of criminal incidents, including prior thefts and an aimed robbery, of which the defendant was aware. The decedent was employed at the station and on April 13, 1995, he worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sometime during that time period, an armed assailant entered the premises and shot the decedent several times in the head and chest. The assailant took several hundred dollars from the cash register and fled. The decedent was discovered by a delivery man early on the morning of April 14, and subsequently died of his injuries. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against the defendant, alleging, inter alia, that it had been aware of prior criminal activity at the station, but had negligently failed to provide adequate security, and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the decedent\u2019s death. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-572h and 52-102b,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>quently filed a two count apportionment complaint against Raul Garcia, Jr., the decedent\u2019s alleged assail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ant,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking apportionment of liability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In both counts of the complaint, the defendant alleged that Garcia intentionally shot the decedent and was responsible for his death. The defendant alleged in the first count that Garcia acted recklessly, and in the second count that Garcia acted wilfully and wantonly. The plaintiff filed a motion to strike the defendant\u2019s apportionment complaint for failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted asserting that, as a matter of law, apportionment of liability pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h applies only to parties whose conduct was negligent. The trial court agreed and granted the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We first consider the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Bohan </em>is authority for the proposition that a defendant in a negligence action may cite in reckless and intentional tortfeasors for apportionment of liability. The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bohan </em>is misplaced because, unlike the present case, the allegations in the apportionment complaint in <em>Bohan </em>involved claims of negligence. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 674. The plaintiff in <em>Bohan </em>brought a wrongful death action against a bar, which was alleged to have served alcohol to a minor who later was involved in a motor vehicle accident that led to the death of a passenger in the car the minor was operating. Id., 672. The defendant thereafter sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to cite in as additional defendants bar patrons who allegedly had furnished alcoholic beverages to the minor. Id., 673. This court reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling granting the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendant\u2019s third party complaint, which sounded in negligence, concluding that the complaint was cognizable if it alleged that the patrons knew or had reason to know that the individual was a minor. Id., 681. Our decision in <em>Bohan, </em>therefore, provides no assistance to the defendant in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We next address the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 52-572h does not permit the apportionment of liability between negligent and intentional tortfeasors. Specifically, the defendant contends that although its apportionment complaint against Garcia alleges reckless, wilful and wanton conduct, such apportionment is permissible under the statute because the underlying action between the plaintiff and defendant remains one of negligence, which is within the scope of the statute. In opposition, the plaintiff argues that the plain language of \u00a7 52-572h provides that only negligent persons may be cited in by the defendant for apportionment for liability purposes. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). \u201cWe also note the rule of statutory construction that statutes in derogation of common law \u2018should receive a strict construction and [should not] be extended, modified, repealed or enlarged in its scope by the mechanics of construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 581, 657 A.2d 212 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We begin our analysis by examining the text of the statute. Section 52-572h (c) provides in relevant part that \u201cif the damages are determined to be proximately caused by the negligence of more than one party, each party against whom recovery is allowed shall be liable to the claimant only for his proportionate share of the . . . damages . . . .\u201d Section 52-102b (a), which provides the procedural vehicle by which a defendant in a negligence action may cite in a party for apportionment of liability purposes, provides that \u201c[a] defendant in any civil action to which section 52-572h applies may serve a writ, summons and complaint upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be <em>liable pursuant to said section </em>for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages in which case the demand for relief shall seek an apportionment of liability. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u201cBy its own terms, the comparative negligence statute [\u00a7 52-572h] applies only to \u2018causes of action based on negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Durniak </em>v. <em>August Winter &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>222 Conn. 775, 782, 610 A.2d 1277 (1992). \u201cThe language of \u00a7 52-572h is unambiguous; it provides that comparative negligence principles apply: \u2018In causes of action <em>based on negligence </em>....\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Lukas </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 205, 212, 439 A.2d 949 (1981). Although the defendant correctly asserts that the underlying action is one of negligence, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>concluded, and we agree, that in order for a defendant to add a person to such an action for purposes of apportionment of liability, the person sought to be added must also be one who is or may be liable pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h. See id. (\u201c\u00a7 52-572h does not apply to actions for personal injuries based on General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149 [the highway defect statute because liability] . . . under \u00a7 13a-149 is purely for breach of a statutory duty and does not arise from negligence\u201d). Because the apportionment complaint alleges that Garcia\u2019s conduct was reckless, wilful and wanton, he is not liable pursuant to \u00a7 52-572h and cannot be added for purposes for apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The defendant argues nonetheless that the term \u201cnegligence\u201d as used in \u00a7 52-572h must be construed to encompass its allegations of reckless, wilful and wanton conduct against Garcia in order to effectuate the legislative intent to have parties responsible only for their proportionate share of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">A review of the legislative history of \u00a7 52-572h belies the defendant\u2019s claim that the legislature considered conduct other than negligence in drafting the comparative negligence statute. Prior to the statutory scheme for the apportionment of damages, the common law was of joint and several liability whereby \u201ceven a defendant whose degree of fault was comparatively small could be held responsible for the entire amount of damages, as long as his negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>234 Conn. 660, 667, 662 A.2d 1269 (1995). There was no contribution among joint tortfeasors. Id., 666. The legislature sought to remedy the growing concerns regarding the cost and availability of liability insurance by abrogating the doctrine of joint and several liability for negligent tortfeasors and thus imposing limitations on a negligent defendant\u2019s obligation to pay damages. Id., 667. \u201cThe Tort Reform Act was drafted in response to rapidly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>rising insurance rates, which, some believed, would be curtailed if tort liability could be limited and systematized. As finally enacted, the act represents a complex web of interdependent concessions and bargains struck by hostile interest groups and individuals of opposing philosophical positions.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 185, 592 A.2d 912 (1991); see G. Royster, \u201cJoint and Several Liability and Collateral Sources Under the 1987 Tort Reform Act,\u201d 62 Conn. B.J. 257 (1988) (\u201c[t]he rationale for [tort reform] was that insurance was becoming too expensive and it was basically unfair to require one co-defendant to pay an entire judgment at the option of the claimant\u201d); 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 16, 1986 Sess., p. 5980, remarks of Representative Irving J. Stolberg (\u201cthe entire concept of tort reform is ... a result of rising insurance rates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">An important element of the Tort Reform Act of 1986 (Tort Reform I); Public Acts 1986, No. 86-338; was \u00a7 3, which \u201cprovided that each defendant would initially be liable for only that percentage of his negligence that proximately caused the injury, in relation to one hundred percent, that is attributable to each person whose negligent actions were a proximate cause of the damages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 667. The Tort Reform Act of 1987 (Tort Reform II); Public Acts 1987, No. 87-227; revised, inter alia, \u201cthe class of individuals to whom the jury could look in determining whose negligence had been a proximate cause of a plaintiffs injuries\u201d from \u201cperson\u201d to \u201cparty.\u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 668; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (c). It also included a provision that permitted defendants \u201cto implead persons who might have been negligent, but who had not been pursued by the plaintiff. \u201d <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 669. Because the legislature in enacting Tort Reform I and Tort Reform II was responding to a perceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>insurance crisis; see <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 185; the legislature accordingly was focused on the protection of insurable interests, which ordinarily do not encompass intentional conduct. See 1 G. Richards, Insurance (6th Ed. Freedman 1990) \u00a7 1:13, pp. 47-48 (\u201c[i]t is universally recognized that an implied exception to coverage under any form of insurance is an intentional or expected injury, damage or loss\u201d); R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law (1988) \u00a7 5.4 (d), p. 518 (\u201c[t]he principle that insurance should only be employed to transfer risks associated with fortuitous occurrences means that generally no coverage will exist for a loss that is caused intentionally\u201d). Upon review of the text and legislative history of \u00a7 52-572h, we are not persuaded that the legislature intended the term negligence in \u00a7 52-572h to include conduct other than negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Our conclusion that the text of \u00a7 52-572h does not support the interpretation urged upon us by the defendant, however, does not end our inquiry. The defendant also argues that as a matter of common law, we should extend the policy of apportionment to permit a defendant in a negligence action to cite in as an apportionment defendant a party whose conduct is alleged to be reckless, wilful and wanton. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201c[I]n interpreting statutes we have on occasion read specific statutory references to indicate a legislative intent to exclude, by implication, other related potential referents. . . . [I]f in this case either the explicit language or the legislative history of [\u00a7 52-572h] had indicated such a legislative intent, we would be required to respect that implication, and we would be precluded from reaching a result by way of common law adjudication that was contrary to that intent. . . . Plainly, every statute has some boundaries, and the question then arises whether, and when, it is appropriate to apply the statute as a matter of common law, beyond its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>designated boundaries. . . . [W]e have previously used statutes as a useful source of policy for common law adjudication, particularly if there was a close relationship between the statutory and common law subject matters.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant </em>Co., supra, 232 Conn. 584-85. \u201cOn numerous occasions, we have reexamined and readjusted our common law principles to assure a proper and harmonious accommodation between judge made law and statutory law.\u201d <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">As an initial matter, our review of the statutory text and the pertinent legislative history does not evince an intent by the legislature to preclude the recognition of apportionment in a negligence action between negligent and intentional tortfeasors. With respect to public policy considerations, the plaintiff argues that such considerations militate against extending the principle of apportionment underlying \u00a7 52-572h to permit apportionment between a negligent and an intentional tortfeasor. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the policy factors identified by the Louisiana Supreme Court in <em>Veazey </em>v. <em>Elmwood Plantation Associates, Ltd., </em>650 So.2d 712, 719-20 (La. 1994), denying apportionment in a negligence action between a negligent and an intentional tortfeasor compel a similar conclusion by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">In <em>Veazey, </em>the plaintiff was a resident in the defendant\u2019s apartment complex and was sexually assaulted in her apartment. Id., 713. The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, alleging, inter alia, that it had provided inadequate security. Id. At the close of trial, the defendant requested that the trial court submit a special interrogatory to permit the allocation of fault to the nonparty assailant. Id., 714. The Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that its comparative fault statute, which provides that a jury may allocate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>degree of \u201cfault\u201d to any another person, was sufficiently broad to encompass the comparison of negligent and intentional torts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 718. The court further concluded that a case-by-case analysis should be utilized to determine whether comparative fault principles should be applied in such cases, bearing in mind certain public policy concerns. Id., 719. The court stated that \u201cpublic policy considerations inherent in the question of whether such a comparison <em>should </em>be made\u201d; (emphasis in original) id.; compelled it to conclude that a comparison was not appropriate in that particular case because: (1) the scope of the defendant\u2019s duty to the plaintiff encompassed the exact risk of the occurrence that injured the plaintiff; (2) apportionment under these circumstances \u201cwould operate to reduce the incentive of the [defendant] to protect against the same type of situation occurring again\u201d; id.; and (3) negligent and intentional conduct preclude comparison by a jury because they are different in kind. Id. The plaintiff argues that these same considerations weigh against permitting apportionment in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Citing <em>Veazey </em>as support, the plaintiff argues that apportionment should not be permitted because it is not appropriate to permit a negligent defendant to relieve itself of liability when the very basis of that liability is premised on the occurrence of a criminal act that the plaintiff alleges the defendant should have foreseen and taken reasonable steps to prevent. The plaintiff offers \u00a7 449 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as support for its claim that the defendant should not be able to \u201cavoid\u201d liability based on the occurrence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of an intentional act that it should have prevented. In a related argument, the plaintiff contends that apportionment would reduce any incentive for a defendant to protect against such harm and that permitting apportionment in the present case would have the practical effect of obviating the cause of action for negligent failure to protect against a foreseeable harm inflicted by a third party. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We previously have recognized that a defendant might be liable for injuries to a plaintiff as a result of a criminal assault by a third party if the type of harm caused is within the scope of the risk created by the defendant\u2019s negligent conduct. See <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 597, 607-608, 662 A.2d 753 (1995);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 442B (1965).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have never intimated, however, that a negligent party should be <em>solely </em>responsible for a plaintiffs resulting injuries inflicted by a criminal actor. In addition, we do not construe \u00a7 449 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts to compel such a result. Section 449 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts provides: \u201cIf the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>likelihood that a third person may act in a particular manner is the hazard or one of the hazards which makes the actor negligent, such an act whether innocent, negligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not prevent the actor from being liable for harm caused thereby.\u201d We interpret \u00a7 449 as authority that a negligent actor is not shielded from liability by the occurrence of the very event that made the conduct negligent, not that the actor should bear complete responsibility for the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Furthermore, precluding the defendant from allocating fault is inconsistent with the principle of comparative negligence that a defendant should be liable only for that proportion of the damages for which he or she was responsible. <em>Donner </em>v. <em>Kearse, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 668-69; <em>Baxter v. Cardiology Associates of New Haven, P.C., </em>46 Conn. App. 377, 381, 699 A.2d 271, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 933, 702 A.2d 640 (1997) (\u201ca primary purpose of enacting [\u00a7 52-572h] was to change the common law of joint and several liability such that a defendant would be liable only for that proportion of the damages for which he was responsible\u201d); <em>Weidenfeller </em>v. <em>Star &amp; Garter, </em>1 Cal. App. 4th 1, 6, 2 Cal. Rptr. 2d 14 (1991) (\u201cthe purpose of [the comparative fault statute] is to prevent the unfairness of requiring a tortfeasor who is only minimally culpable <em>as compared to the other parties </em>to bear all the damages\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Blazovic </em>v. <em>Andrich, </em>124 N.J. 90, 99, 590 A.2d 222 (1991) (\u201cthe labels attached by the law to various types of conduct should not thwart the principle that it is the <em>overall fault </em>of the parties which is to be measured\u201d [emphasis added]). The plaintiffs construction would have the incongruous effect of rendering a negligent party solely responsible for the conduct of an intentional actor, whose deviation from the standard of reasonable care is clearly greater.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>defendant would be able to avoid apportionment of fault by demonstrating that his conduct was intentional as opposed to negligent. See <em>Weidenfeller </em>v. <em>Star &amp; </em>Garter, supra, 6 (\u201c[T]he statute has the limited effect of benefitting a negligent tortfeasor only where there are other equally culpable defendants, but eliminating that benefit where the other tortfeasors act intentionally. Stating the proposition reflects its absurdity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We are also unpersuaded by the plaintiffs claim that apportionment would permit a defendant to avoid liability or diminish a defendant\u2019s incentive to exercise a standard of reasonable care in providing security for his premises. Apportionment does not affect the determination of whether the defendant is liable under a theory of negligence but, rather, affects the determination of his <em>degree </em>of fault once a trier of fact has determined that his breach of a reasonable standard of care was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs injuries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cOnce it is determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct has been a cause of some damage suffered by the plaintiff, a further question may arise as to the portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of the total damages which may properly be assigned to the defendant, as distinguished from other causes.\u201d W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts (5th Ed. 1984) \u00a7 52, p. 345; see <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>243 Conn. 168, 184, 700 A.2d 38 (1997) (\u201c[c]omparative responsibility does not come into play . . . unless the defendant is found to have proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries\u201d). It is undisputed that a defendant seeks apportionment to reduce his percentage of the damages. Although joint liability concededly poses a more significant deterrent than comparative fault because a defendant is potentially liable for the entirety of the plaintiffs damages, apportionment does not allow a defendant to escape responsibility for the defendant\u2019s own negligent conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because a defendant would still be liable for his proportionate share of damages, he would continue to have a decided interest in exercising reasonable care.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that joint liability is necessary to encourage a defendant\u2019s exercise of reasonable care. <em>Bohan </em>v. <em>Last, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 677 (permitting bar to implead patrons who purveyed alcohol to minor). Furthermore, permitting apportionment in the present case best comports with the principle of equitable apportionment of losses among responsible parties.

I agree with the majority that General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h does not contemplate apportionment of liability between a negligent defendant and a person whose conduct was either reckless or intentional. I disagree with the majority, however, that this is an appropriate case for employment of the jurisprudential technique of using the statute as a source of common-law adjudication. I therefore disagree that the criminal assailant, Raul Garcia, Jr., may be cited in as an apportionment defendant, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">For all of the reasons so persuasively marshaled by the majority, it is clear that the apportionment provision of \u00a7 52-572h applies only to those persons who were negligent, and not to those who were recklessly or intentionally tortious. By the same reasoning, however, in my view, it is also clear that the specific legislative allowance of allocation with respect to negligent persons precludes allocation, as a matter of common law, with respect to reckless or intentional tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u201c[I]n interpreting statutes we have on occasion read specific statutory references to indicate a legislative intent to exclude, by implication, other related potential referents. . . . [Where] the explicit language or the legislative history of [the statute indicates] such a legislative intent, we [are] required to respect that implication, and we [are] precluded from reaching a result by way of common law adjudication that [is] contrary to that intent.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>Ford, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant </em>Co., 232 Conn. 559, 584, 657 A.2d 212 (1995). As the majority makes clear, when the legislature provided for impleading persons who might have been negligent but who had not been pursued by the plaintiff, it \u201cfocused on the protection of insurable interests, which ordinarily do not encompass intentional conduct.\u201d Contrary to the majority, I conclude that in light of the legislative history and purpose of \u00a7 52-572h, it would be inappropriate to extend the policy of the statute to cover what are ordinarily uninsurable interests, namely, perpetrators of recklessly or intentionally tortious conduct. To do so would be inconsistent with the legislative policy of the statute by affording more protection to the allegedly negligent named defendant than the statutory scheme was designed to afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The purpose of this aspect of tort reform, as the majority explains, was to ameliorate the common-law rule of joint and several liability, pursuant to which one insured party was liable for the entire judgment at the option of the claimant. Thus, under the apportionment provision of the statute, the defendant who is sued can implead another potentially negligent defendant so as to permit an equitable sharing of liability between them. Furthermore, as the majority explains, this apportionment scheme was aimed at protecting what are ordinarily insurable interests, on the theory that, in the main, negligence claims are protected by insurance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Thus, under this scheme \u2014 again, in the main \u2014 defendants would be liable to pay only their fair share of the judgments, and injured plaintiffs ordinarily would not be impacted by the allocation of a portion of the damages to uninsured defendants. This theoretical construct underlies the majority\u2019s conclusion that the statute cannot be read plausibly to include reckless or intentional conduct as impleadable interests, because they are ordinarily uninsured interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">It also compels the conclusion, in my view, that the court should not in this instance extend the statute beyond its boundary. \u201c[E]very statute has some boundaries, and the question then arises whether, and when, it is appropriate to apply the statute, as a matter of common law, beyond its designated boundaries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 585. By applying the statute\u2019s apportionment policy beyond its boundary of negligence, the majority permits the defendant to do more than share its liability with another tortfeasor. In effect, it permits the defendant to shift most, if not virtually all, of its liability to that tortfeasor. Any jury that takes the court\u2019s instructions and its own duty seriously will inevitably conclude that the fault for the death of the plaintiffs decedent lies mostly, if not virtually completely, with the intentional tortfeasor, Garcia. Moreover, in most future cases in which an intentional \u2014 and uninsured \u2014 tortfeasor is cited in as an apportionment defendant, the likely outcome will be similar: the negligent and insured defendant will end up with responsibility for only a veiy small percentage of the judgment. This is not what the legislature intended when it enacted the apportionment provision of \u00a7 52-572h. It is contrary to that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">I acknowledge that my reasoning would result in what could be considered an anomaly in the law. Under my interpretation of the legislative policy, a party cited in who the defendant alleges was negligent could escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>apportionment by persuading the jury that his conduct was not negligent but worse \u2014 it was either reckless or intentional. I think, however, that is the necessary result of the ultimate legislative choice among the competing interests that yielded this particular part of tort reform.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s engrafting onto its common-law adjudication the reallocation provision of the statute. See footnote 12 of the majority opinion. That is a statutory provision that concerns only the question of the collectibility of the ultimate judgment. In fashioning rules of liability under our common-law powers, courts do not ordinarily fashion mechanisms for the collectibility of the ultimate judgments. Such matters \u2014 which include hens, attachments and the like \u2014 are ordinarily matters for the legislature. Courts go too far in what can be a useful adjudicative technique of using a statute as a source of common-law adjudication when they start legislating. I believe that is what the majority has done in footnote 12 of its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">I would, therefore, leave the defendant\u2019s liability to the ordinary common-law rules, without the benefit of apportionment with the criminal assailant in the present case. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b260-8\">BERDON, J., with whom CALLAHAN, C.

I disagree that the court should, as a matter of common law, include other tortfeasors in the apportionment scheme of \u00a7 52-572h.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">With the adoption of \u00a7 52-572h specifically limiting apportionment between negligent tortfeasors, the legislature has occupied the field. As a result, this court should be reluctant to enter this field and formulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>public policy. \u201cIn areas where the legislature has spoken, however, the primary responsibility for formulating public policy must remain with the legislature. . . .

In essence, \u00a7 52-572h (g) (2) provides that \u201cnoneconomic damages be reallocated among the other defendants according to their percentages of negligence, provided that the court shall not reallocate to any such defendant an amount greater than that defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence multiplied by such uncollectible amount.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>This has the effect of not fully compensating a plaintiff for his or her noneconomic damages when there is an insolvent defendant. With respect to economic damages, the entire amount attributable to the insolvent defendant is allocated among the solvent defendants. In light of this statutory scheme, any further extension of \u00a7 52-572h must be left to the legislature and not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Furthermore, apportionment of damages between negligent and intentional tortfeasors is not appropriate when the intentional acts that harm the victim are within the scope of the risk created by the negligent tortfeasor. In other words, in cases like the present case, where the intentional acts of Raul Garcia, Jr., that caused the death of the plaintiffs decedent were within the scope of the risk created by the alleged negligence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the defendant, Sun Company, Inc., the defendant should be responsible for the plaintiffs damages without apportionment.

To deny recovery because the other\u2019s exposure to the very risk from which it was the purpose of the duty to protect him resulted in harm to him, would be to deprive the other of all protection and to make the duty a nullity.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) 2 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 449, comment (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-572h (g) provides: \u201c(1) Upon motion by the claimant to open the judgment filed, after good faith efforts by the claimant to collect from a liable defendant, not later than one year after judgment becomes final through lapse of time or through exhaustion of appeal, whichever occurs later, the court shall determine whether all or part of a defendant\u2019s proportionate share of the recoverable economic damages and recoverable noneconomic damages is uncollectible from that party, and shall reallocate such uncollectible amount among the other defendants in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. (2) The court shall order that the portion of such uncollectible amount which represents recoverable noneconomic damages be reallocated among the other defendants according to their percentages of negligence, provided that the court shall not reallocate to any such defendant an amount greater than that defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence multiplied by such uncollectible amount. (3) The court shall order that the portion of such uncollectible amount which represents recoverable economic damages be reallocated among the other defendants. The court shall reallocate to any such other defendant an amount equal to such uncollectible amount of recoverable economic damages multiplied by a fraction in which the numerator is such defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence and the denominator is the total of the percentages of negligence of all defendants, excluding any defendant whose liability is being reallocated. (4) The defendant whose liability is reallocated is nonetheless subject to contribution pursuant to subsection (h) of this section and to any continuing liability to the claimant on the judgment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> Specifically, the plaintiff, the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, alleged in the complaint that the defendant was negligent for failing \u201cto fix, for an extended period of time, a faulty \u2018cash drawer\u2019 [at the gas station where the decedent was employed] necessitating that the door to the station remain unlocked at all times, including during mandated night time operation, in order to sell \u2018snacks,\u2019 \u201d and for failing \u201cto install adequate security measures when it became obvious that the franchisee and its employees faced a threat to their physical weE being during mandated night time operation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-11\"> This is clearly demonstrated by the following scenario. A security alarm company negligently installs a security system in a residence and, as a result, a third party is able to gain access to the premises and causes harm to the property owner. The alarm company should not be allowed to reduce its liability for the full damages caused to the property owner by seeking to implead the third party intruder for the purposes of apportioning damages when the harm caused by the third party was within the very risk that the alarm company had a duty to prevent. As \u00a7 449, comment [b], of the Restatement (Second) of Torts explains, that would make the duty owed by the alarm company to the property owner a nullity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
