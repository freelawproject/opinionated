We affirm the judgment of the trial court with regard to the defendant\u2019s first and fourth claims, we do not reach the defendant\u2019s second claim, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court on the defendant\u2019s third claim. Because we conclude that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the presumption set forth in \u00a7 29-36, we remand the case for a new trial on the charge of altering or removing an identification mark on a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On December 20, 1993, the defendant, along with Casey Wilcox, Andre Shirley and Corey Rosemond, were selling crack cocaine in the area of Wilcox\u2019s residence at 88 Atwood Street in Hartford. The victim, Moses Barber, Jr., a regular customer, purchased drugs from the defendant. After making his purchase, he walked away. The victim later returned to Wilcox\u2019s porch and engaged in an argument with the defendant concerning the drug sale. The victim and the defendant left the porch and the defendant proceeded up a dark driveway between two buildings directly across the street from Wilcox\u2019s residence. The victim remained near the street. As they continued to argue, the defendant approached the victim and shot him. The victim died later that night as a result of a gunshot wound to his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">On December 21, 1993, Wilcox asked the defendant for his guns for the purpose of threatening an individual who had accused Wilcox of shooting the victim. The defendant went into the basement of a house on Atwood Street,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and emerged with a handgun and rifle, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>he gave to Wilcox. Wilcox, in turn, gave the weapons to Rosemond and instructed Rosemond to put the weapons in the trunk of a vehicle<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> parked behind Wilcox\u2019s residence. The next morning, Hartford police officers, armed with a search warrant, seized the weapons from the trunk of the vehicle and, thereafter, learned that the defendant did not have a permit to carry a pistol or revolver. Moreover, the police officers found that the serial number on the pistol had been ground off.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Thereafter, Wilcox, Shirley and Rosemond gave statements implicating the defendant in the murder, and a warrant was issued on December 23, 1993, for the defendant\u2019s arrest. The defendant was arrested in New York in June, 1995. Additional facts will be discussed in the context of the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly limited his cross-examination of Wilcox, Shirley and Rosemond regarding the alleged gang membership of Wilcox and Rosemond, thus limiting the defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense, and to confront and cross-examine these witnesses in violation of his due process rights and his right to confrontation as guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>argues that he sought to introduce evidence of Wilcox\u2019s and Rosemond\u2019s gang membership for two purposes: (1) to establish that they were lying; and (2) to establish that they falsely had accused the defendant of murder as a result of a territorial dispute regarding who could sell drugs in the area of Wilcox\u2019s residence. The state argues that the defendant had failed to establish a foundation for the admission of this evidence. In response, the defendant claims that a foundation is not necessary to introduce this evidence in order to establish that Wilcox and Rosemond were lying regarding their gang membership because evidence of untruthfulness is always admissible.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He claims further that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>evidence of bias against the defendant requires some foundation, that foundation had been established. We conclude that this issue is not reviewable because the trial court did not make a ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this issue. During the probable cause hearing, Rosemond and Wilcox testified that they were not members of a gang known as \u201c20 Love.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, Shirley testified that Rosemond and Wilcox not only were members of the gang, but that Wilcox was actually the president.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> During the trial, prior to the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>of these witnesses, the state made an oral motion in limine to prevent any cross-examination by the defendant of these witnesses regarding their membership in 20 Love on the ground that such testimony would not be relevant to any issue in the case and would exceed the scope of direct examination since the state did not intend to elicit this information on direct examination. The defendant, in opposition, sought to introduce such testimony for two distinct purposes: (1) to impeach the credibility of Rosemond and Wilcox, either by introducing Shirley\u2019s testimony that they were gang members if they denied it, or by introducing their probable cause hearing testimony in which they had denied gang membership if they now admitted it; and (2) to establish the defense that members of 20 Love falsely had accused him of murdering the victim in retaliation for the defendant\u2019s selling drugs in their territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The trial court deferred ruling on the state\u2019s motion stating: \u201cI can\u2019t resolve this at this point. I want to hear the direct [examination of Rosemond], and then you\u2019ll have the opportunity before you cross-examine. I may want to hear this out of the presence of the jury to see where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Following the state\u2019s direct examination of Rosemond, the defendant, out of the presence of the jury, summarized his offer of proof relating to his proposed questioning regarding Rosemond\u2019s gang membership. The defendant argued that this evidence was necessary to establish the credibility of Rosemond. The defendant expected Rosemond to testify that he was not a member of 20 Love. The defendant then would introduce Shirley\u2019s prior testimony from the probable cause hearing that Rosemond was a gang member to impeach Rosemond\u2019s credibility. This evidence would also establish that bad blood existed between Rosemond and the defendant as a result of the defendant\u2019s encroachment onto 20 Love\u2019s drug selling territory. The state responded that this evidence would be collateral, prejudicial and irrelevant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court, in a preliminary ruling stated, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to get some connection between [Rosemond\u2019s] membership in the gang and some relevant issue.\u201d In response, the defendant conceded that a connection had not yet been made between gang membership and any relevant issue because no evidence had yet been introduced establishing that either the defendant or anyone else had been selling drugs that evening. Therefore, there was no foundation for the defendant\u2019s theory that he falsely had been implicated in this murder as a result of the witnesses\u2019 bias against the defendant stemming from a drug \u201cturf war.\u201d The defendant conceded, \u201cI won\u2019t press that, Your Honor. <em>I\u2019ll </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>wait until my next witness, and then we can proceed there.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The court and the state agreed, however, that the defendant could cross-examine Rosemond regarding drug selling activity that evening. Upon doing so, Rosemond denied that either Wilcox or the defendant were selling drugs that evening.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">After the state\u2019s direct examination of the next witness, Shirley, the defendant did not make an offer of proof regarding the issue of gang membership. Instead, at the end of his cross-examination of Shirley, the defendant asked Shirley whether he, Wilcox, Rosemond and the defendant were \u201cin competition with one another [in the sale of drugs] right on the comer, and there\u2019s no organization.\u201d Shirley responded, \u201c[n]o organization, what [do] you mean organization?\u201d The defendant clarified the question by asking \u201care you aware of an organization called 20 Love?\u201d At that point, the state objected, arguing that questions regarding gang membership exceeded the scope of the direct examination. After the jury was excused, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019ve not heard anything yet that [the defendant] . . . sold anything that evening in that area . . . ,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> What has it got to do with 20 Love until some predicate, some basis for that has been laid out?\u201d The defendant argued that the line of questioning regarding gang membership would become relevant after Wilcox had testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The court ruled that \u201con the basis of what has been offered so far . . . with this witness I\u2019m going to sustain the objection of the state, and [the defendant\u2019s attorney] will have the right to test that question again after the testimony of . . . Wilcox.\u201d The court clarified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>that questioning regarding the gang membership of these witnesses might become relevant following Wilcox\u2019s testimony if Wilcox were able to establish a connection between the defendant and the drug selling activity at Wilcox\u2019s residence on the day of the victim\u2019s death. The state objected to the court\u2019s ruling, arguing that the defendant should be precluded from asking any questions at any time regarding gang membership or 20 Love. The state clarified that \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with asking questions generally speaking about drug trafficking going on that day or in general. I do have a problem with the mentioning of 20 Love. . . . [A]s long as . . . mention of a gang or the entity known as 20 Love is kept out ... I would not have a problem with territoriality being explored. I just don\u2019t think that it\u2019s necessary to get the word gang or the name 20 Love [in]----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The defendant accepted the state\u2019s argument, stating: \u201cYour Honor . . . taking up what [the state\u2019s attorney] has been saying, his offer that I certainly am permitted to talk about the control of territories, etcetera . . . so long as I do not mention gang or 20 Love or any specific gang, I may explore that then, and hopefully I won\u2019t mention any name. . . . I\u2019m taking up the offer. I probably will do that, and I\u2019m sure it will be all negative, and there will only be a few questions I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The defendant continued his cross-examination of Shirley, questioning him regarding drug selling territory. Shirley explained that he sold drugs at Wilcox\u2019s residence but others could not do so \u201cif they wasn\u2019t from the neighborhood.\u201d He further explained that in order to sell drugs at Wilcox\u2019s residence, Wilcox\u2019s permission was needed: \u201cYou had to be a friend of [Wilcox\u2019s] to be there.\u201d Moreover, he explained that, in addition to himself, Wilcox and Rosemond, the only other person who could sell drugs at Wilcox\u2019s residence at that time was the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>In his cross-examination of Wilcox, the last eyewitness to testify, the defendant did not ask any questions regarding Wilcox\u2019s membership in a gang. The defendant did, however, question Wilcox regarding the issues of territory and the control of drug sales at his residence, to which Wilcox explained that only his friends could sell in that area. He acknowledged that \u201cif some stranger, somebody [he] didn\u2019t like came into the area, [he\u2019d] say no, you can\u2019t sell them here; this is my place.\u201d He also testified that he, along with Rosemond, Shirley and the defendant, were selling drugs that evening. Moreover, he testified that he saw the victim purchase drugs from the defendant. After the defendant completed his cross-examination of Wilcox, he did not attempt to reexamine either Rosemond or Shirley on the issue of gang membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court violated his due process rights and his right to confrontation by ruling against him in his numerous attempts to question the witnesses regarding gang membership. The state argues that the defendant\u2019s claims are not appealable because the court did not make a ruling on the matter. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u201cIt is elementary that to appeal from the ruling of a trial court there must first be a ruling. . . . [T]his court cannot review a nonexistent ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kindrick, </em>30 Conn. App. 56, 60, 619 A.2d 1 (1993); see <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 52, 57, 597 A.2d 839, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 902, 600 A.2d 1029 (1991) (court will not consider claimed errors that have not been raised and decided); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 (right to appeal is from final judgment); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The trial court had three opportunities to make a final ruling on the admissibility of evidence regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>gang membership of Wilcox and Rosemond: (1) following the state\u2019s oral motion in limine; (2) following the state\u2019s direct examination of Rosemond; and (3) following the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Shirley. Yet, the court refrained from doing so. At each point, the court allowed the defendant future opportunities to present additional evidence in order to establish the relevancy of questions relating to gang membership. Following the state\u2019s motion in limine, the court stated: \u201cI can\u2019t resolve this at this point. I want to hear the direct, and then you\u2019ll have the opportunity before you cross-examine.\u201d Following the state\u2019s direct examination of Rosemond, the court instructed the defendant that he had to establish \u201csome connection between [Rosemond\u2019s] membership in the gang and some relevant issue\u201d in order to cross-examine Rosemond about his involvement in 20 Love. Lastly, following the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Shirley, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection to the defendant\u2019s questions regarding 20 Love, but gave the defendant the right to ask such questions again <em>after </em>Wilcox\u2019s testimony, in response to the defendant\u2019s explanation that the relevancy of gang membership would be apparent at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As in <em>State </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>238 Conn. 313, 332, 680 A.2d 1284 (1996), the trial court in the present case \u201cconcluded only that the defendant had not <em>as yet </em>laid the proper foundation for such cross-examination; at no time did the court indicate that the defendant was prohibited from renewing that line of questioning at an appropriate time. . . . [T]he ruling of the trial court was a preliminary one, subject to reconsideration if and when the defendant established the relevance of the testimony that he sought to adduce . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Significantly, the defendant never sought follow-up questioning of <em>any </em>of these witnesses and, presumably, chose to abandon this line of inquiry. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>id. Accordingly, because the trial court had ruled only preliminarily and allowed the defendant the opportunity to renew this line of questioning once its relevancy had been established, we conclude that this issue is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the presumption contained within \u00a7 29-36. Section 29-36 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe possession of any pistol . . . upon which any identifying mark, number or name has been altered, removed or obliterated shall be prima facie evidence that the person owning or in possession of such pistol . . . has altered, removed or obliterated the same.\u201d The defendant argues that the court\u2019s instructions created an unconstitutional mandatory presumption relieving the state of its burden of establishing the elements of this offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant also argues that even if the court\u2019s instructions created only a permissive inference, such permissive inference was unconstitutionally applied because the altered pistol was found in the possession of a third party, Wilcox, and not in the defendant\u2019s possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on \u00a7 29-36 provided in relevant part: \u201cThe state charges [the defendant] with the crime of altering or removing an identification mark in violation of our law. It further alleges that on an unknown date prior to December 20, 1993, at a time before 7:07 p.m. [the defendant] altered, removed or obliterated the maker\u2019s number or other mark of identification on a pistol in violation of our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>defendant altered, removed or obliterated the maker\u2019s number or other mark of identification on the pistol</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining whether the state has proven this essential element beyond a reasonable doubt, the possession of a pistol upon which any identifying mark or number has been altered, removed or obliterated, it shall be prima facie evidence that the person owning or in possession of the pistol has altered, removed or obliterated the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\u201cThe phrase prima facie evidence means evidence which if credited is sufficient to establish the fact or facts which it is adduced to prove. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u201cThere are two elements then to prove this charge of altering or removing an identification mark, and each must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the defendant was either the owner or possessor of the pistol . . . and two, prior to December 20, 1993, during such ownership or possession of the pistol that the pistol was found to have its maker\u2019s number or other mark of identification removed, obliterated or altered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The state concedes that, although the defendant failed to raise this claim at trial, it is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>237 Conn. 348, 355-56, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>677 A.2d 937 (1996). Moreover, the state concedes that this instruction misled the jury because it interpreted the inference in \u00a7 29-36 to be mandatory and, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">This court previously has reasoned that \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged. . . . This bedrock, axiomatic and elementary [constitutional] principle . . . prohibits the State from using evidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that have the effect of relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of a crime. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">\u201cA mandatory presumption instructs the jury that it <em>must </em>infer the presumed fact if the State proves certain predicate facts. A permissive inference suggests to the jury that a possible conclusion <em>may </em>be drawn if the State proves predicate facts, but does not require the jury to draw that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cMandatory presumptions . . . violate the Due Process Clause if they relieve the State of the burden of persuasion on an element of an offense. . . . A permissive inference does not relieve the State of its burden of persuasion because it still requires the State to convince the jury that the suggested conclusion should be inferred based on the predicate facts proved.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 356-57. This court previously has stated that presumptions will be construed as permissive inferences in order to preserve them in a constitutional manner. See id., 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">We agree that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the offense of altering or removing a pistol\u2019s identification mark, viewed in their entirety, presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the statutory inference as mandatory, thereby misleading the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. Hines, 243 Conn. 796, 818-19, 709 A.2d 522 (1998) (\u201c \u2018a jury instruction is to be examined in its entirety, and . . . the test to be applied is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will be done\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 667, 588 A.2d 127 (1991) (challenge to jury instruction requires review to determine whether it is reasonably possible that jury was misled). The trial court, in essence, mandated that the juiy find the defendant guilty if it found that the defendant either owned or possessed the pistol and that during such ownership or possession the pistol\u2019s identification mark was removed, obliterated or altered. The court did not give the jury the option to reach a different conclusion if these predicate facts were proven. Consequently, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this issue with instructions that this inference is permissive and not mandatory.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The defendant also claims that even if we were to construe the inference in \u00a7 29-36 as permissive, it is nonetheless unconstitutional because the altered pistol was not found in his possession. We disagree. When reviewing the constitutionality of a permissive inference, we consider whether \u201cunder the facts of the case, there is no rational way the trier could make the connection permitted by the inference . . . [f]or only in that situation is there any risk that an explanation of the permissible inference to a jury, or its use by a jury, has caused the presumptively rational factfinder to make an erroneous factual determination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerardi, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 358. In the present case, a jury rationally and reasonably could connect the defendant\u2019s possession of the pistol with its alteration.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the intent element of murder in violation of his fundamental due process rights under the federal and state constitutions to have the state prove each element of an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>charged against him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the trial court erroneously stated that intent could be established by proof that the defendant had the intent to shoot the victim instead of the intent to kill the victim. The defendant contends that a portion of the definition of intent improperly permitted the jury to find him guilty of murder if it found that he had the intent to engage in the conduct of firing his weapon.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>This claim, which the defendant raises under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or alternatively, pursuant to the plain error doctrine,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 321-22, 664 A.2d 743 (1995), wherein we concluded that an instruction, almost identical to that at issue here, did not warrant reversal. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 322, the trial court instructed the jury on the entire statutory definition of intent, referring to both intent to cause a result, death, and intent to engage in proscribed conduct, shooting. Yet, we concluded that the instruction, viewed in its entirety, was not misleading because the trial court \u201crepeatedly instructed the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, it first had to find that he had intended to cause the death of the victim.\u201d Id. The present case is indistinguishable because, although the trial court provided the entire statutory definition of intent in its instruction, it also repeatedly instructed that in order to find the defendant guilty of murder, the jury had to conclude that the defendant had intended to cause the death of the victim.

If they denied membership, he could then introduce Shirley\u2019s testimony that they were members. If they admitted membership, he could introduce their probable cause hearing testimony to contradict their testimony. Either way, he argues, he should have been permitted to introduce evidence to contradict their sworn testimony and thereby impeach their credibility. This claim is based on an erroneous understanding of the rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u201cAs a general rule, extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement may not be admitted to impeach the testimony of a witness on a collateral matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 247, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). Thus, on cross-examination, a witness\u2019 answer regarding a collateral matter is conclusive and cannot be contradicted later by extrinsic evidence. Id., 248; C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.24.4, p. 211; 1 C. McCormick, Evidence (4th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 49, pp. 182-83. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement may be admitted, however, to impeach a witness\u2019 testimony on a <em>noncoUateral </em>matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>supra, 247; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>173 Conn. 317, 327, 377 A.2d 1082 (1977); 1 C. McCormick, supra, \u00a7 36, p. 118 and \u00a7 49, p. 183. A matter is not collateral if it is relevant to a material issue in the case apart from its tendency to contradict the witness. . . .

In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\"> We, therefore, also agree with the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe jury should not have been told that it could rely exclusively on [the presumption in \u00a7 29-36] to convict [the defendant]\u201d and that the court\u2019s instruction that possession was \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of alteration was misleading and improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">To the extent that <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>42 Conn.

In light of our interpretation of the presumption in \u00a7 29-36 as permissive and not mandatory, we conclude that the jury reached its verdict based on an improper instruction concerning the force and weight of this presumption. \u201cConsequently, although the standard governing our review of sufficiency of the evidence is to evaluate the evidence construing it in the light most favorable to sustaining the facts expressly and impliedly found by the jury ... we cannot presume the sufficiency of the evidence on which the jury based its verdict in light of the improper instruction.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. We cannot presume that the jury would have reached the same conclusion had it been properly instructed on the law. Accordingly, we need not reach the defendant\u2019s sufficiency claim. See id.

The defendant argues that the presumption does not apply if the altered pistol is found in the possession of a third party. We disagree. Circumstantial evidence is as probative of guilt as direct evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 420-21, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 660, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989); and it is the function of the jury to weigh this evidence. Moreover, \u00a7 29-36 does not, by its language, limit application of the inference to situations in which the accused is in actual possession of a pistol. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, 3 </em>Conn. App. 225, 226-27, 486 A.2d 1136 (1985) (defendant convicted under \u00a7 29-36 where altered gun found in cinder block windowsill of second floor of building).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\"> See footnote 8 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> The trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury provided in relevant part: \u201cIn the first count [the defendant] is charged with murder. The state alleges that on or about December 20, 1993, at about 7:07 p.m. at or near 87-89 Atwood Street, Hartford, Connecticut, [the defendant] with intent to cause the death of [the victim] did cause the death of [the victim] by shooting him with a handgun in violation of our statute involving murder, [\u00a7] 53a-54a.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u201cInsofar as it applies in this case the statute reads as follows: A person is guilty of murder when with intent to cause the death of another person he causes the death of such person. There are two elements, each of which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to sustain a conviction in this case. First, that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of another person, that is, [the victim]; secondly, that acting with that intent he caused the death of that person. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u201cThe first element is that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of [the victim]. Our statute provides that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by the statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or to engage in such conduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\u201c[A] person\u2019s intention may be inferred from his conduct. You may infer from the fact that the accused engaged in conduct that he intended to engage in that conduct. This inference is not a necessary one, that is, you are not required to infer intent from the accused\u2019s conduct, but it is an inference that you may draw if you find it is a reasonable and logical inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\u201cSo, intent then is a mental process which ordinarily can be proved only by circumstantial evidence. An intent to cause death may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as the type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of ammunition used, the type of wound inflicted, the distance between the parties at the time of the shooting and the events leading up to and immediately following the death of the victim. I remind you that the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill [the victim],</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">\u201cThe second element is that the defendant acting with the intent to cause the death of [the victim] caused his death. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">\u201cTo summarize then, in order for you to convict the defendant of the crime of murder, the first count in this information, the state must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>proved beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: One, that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of another person, that being [the victim], and two, acting with that intent he caused the death of [the victim].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> See footnote 15 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court may reverse or modify the decision of the trial court if it determines that the factual findings are clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record, or that the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.
