J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8u\">The dispositive issue in this interlocutory appeal is whether the defendant, the board of education of the town of Thomaston, acted lawfully when it expelled the named plaintiff, Kyle P. Packer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from Thomaston High School for possession of marijuana off the school grounds after school hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">The following facts and procedural history are uncontroverted. The plaintiff is a senior at Thomaston High School. On September 24, 1997, a Connecticut state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>trooper stopped the plaintiffs car as the plaintiff, who was not wearing a seat belt, drove through the town of Morris. At the stop, the trooper observed a marijuana cigarette in the ashtray of the plaintiffs car. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed drug paraphernalia and approximately two ounces of marijuana hidden in the trunk of the car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-233h,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiffs arrest was reported to the superintendent of the Thomaston school system. School administrators investigated the circumstances of the arrest and, after meeting with the plaintiff and his parents, recommended to the defendant that the plaintiff be expelled<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from school for the remainder of the then current semester and that he be excluded from extracurricular activities for the remainder of the school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">On October 8,1997, after providing the plaintiff with appropriate notice, the defendant held a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-233d (a) (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>attended the hearing and was represented by counsel. At the hearing, Robin Willink, the principal of Thomaston High School, testified that the incident had disrupted the educational process in the following ways: (1) the plaintiffs younger brother, also a student at Thomaston High School, was present when the plaintiff was arrested, causing students in the brother\u2019s class at the school to become aware of the incident; (2) a former student at Thomaston High School, who was known to have been involved in the past with distributing drugs, also was present when the plaintiff was arrested; and (3) teachers had approached Willink expressing concern over the plaintiffs arrest and asking what action would be taken in response to the incident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Willink also stated that, at the beginning of the school year, the school administration had informed the student body that students would be held accountable for out-of-school conduct that \u201chas some impact on what happens [in school],\u201d and that \u201cthe whole tone [the school] set. . . [would be] made a sham of\u2019 if the school did not: hold the plaintiff accountable for violation of the administration policy against illegal drug use. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>was no other evidence that the day-to-day operation of the school had been affected by the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">At the close of testimony, the defendant made the following findings of fact: (1) the plaintiff was a senior at Thomaston High School; (2) the plaintiff was seventeen years old; (3) the plaintiff had possessed marijuana off the school grounds; (4) the plaintiff had possessed two ounces of marijuana off the school grounds; (5) the defendant had a policy against possession of illegal drugs; (6) the plaintiffs conduct off the school grounds had violated the defendant\u2019s policy against possession of illegal drugs; and (7) the plaintiffs conduct off the school grounds seriously had disrupted the educational process at Thomaston High School. On the basis of those findings of fact, the defendant voted, pursuant to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (l),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to expel the plaintiff from school for the remainder of the first semester of the school year and to prohibit him from participating in extracurricular activities, except for graduation, for the remainder of the school year.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The plaintiff subsequently brought this action<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> against the defendant in the Superior Court, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>orders restraining and enjoining the defendant from expelling him and seeking damages. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that: (1) the defendant lacked authority to expel the plaintiff and to prohibit his participation in extracurricular activities because \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutionally vague; (2) the defendant\u2019s actions in expelling the plaintiff violated the plaintiffs rights, under the United States and Connecticut constitutions, to due process and equal protection; and (3) the defendant lacked authority to expel the plaintiff because the defendant did not have a publicized policy against the use of illegal drugs off school grounds, as required by \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The trial court initially entered an ex parte order temporarily restraining the defendant from expelling the plaintiff, and subsequently, after a hearing, the court concluded that the defendant lacked authority to expel the plaintiff because \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutionally vague. The trial court also concluded that the plaintiffs expulsion violated his rights, under the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>States and Connecticut constitutions, to procedural due process because the plaintiff had been denied his right, at the expulsion hearing pursuant to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (3), to meaningful cross-examination of the witnesses. The trial court further concluded that the plaintiffs expulsion was unlawful because there was no evidence in the record to support the defendant\u2019s determination that the incident seriously had disrupted the educational process as required by \u00a7 10-233d (a) (l).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court consequently issued an order temporarily enjoining the defendant from enforcing the plaintiffs expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for clarification as to whether the trial court\u2019s order enjoining the defendant from expelling him also enjoined the defendant from excluding him from extracurricular activities for the remainder of the school year. After a hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for clarification and issued a memorandum stating that its order granting the plaintiffs application for a temporary injunction required the defendant to restore full rights and privileges, including participation in extracurricular activities, to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Despite the absence of a final judgment; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-263 and 51-197a (a); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4000, now \u00a7 61-1; the defendant sought a direct appeal to the Supreme Court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 4180, now \u00a7 83-4, from the trial court\u2019s order granting the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>application for a temporary injunction. \u201cSection 52-265a allows the chief justice to certify a direct appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory order of the Superior Court on an issue of law that involves a matter of substantial public interest and in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. </em>Co., 241 Conn. 282, 298, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). Justice Borden, acting in place of the Chief Justice, who was unavailable, granted certification to appeal. Thereafter, the defendant appealed from the order of the trial court granting the plaintiffs application for a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims, inter alia, that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendant lacked authority to expel the plaintiff for the incident because the statute pursuant to which the defendant acted is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant maintains that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is not unconstitutionally vague, either as applied to the facts of this case or on its face.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>statute is facially infirm, but agree that it is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We begin by noting that we ordinarily \u201ceschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 663, 674 A.2d 821 (1996); <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187, 195, 635 A.2d 1220 (1994); <em>McConnell v. Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 692, 706, 553 A.2d 596 (1989); and that we generally have declined to engage in constitutional analysis when we have been able to decide a case either on the basis of an established common-law principle or in reliance on a statutory provision. <em>Binette </em>v. <em>Sabo, </em>244 Conn. 23, 51, 710 A.2d 688 (1998). In this case, however, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the school expulsion statute is incapable of having any constitutionally valid application has raised \u201ca matter of substantial public interest ... in which delay may work a substantial injustice.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a. Consequently, we consider it appropriate to confront the constitutional issue raised in this appeal. We, therefore, address the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutionally vague without first considering whether there exists an alternate common-law or statutory basis for resolving the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Our analysis begins with a brief overview of constitutional vagueness jurisprudence. The void for vagueness doctrine is a procedural due process concept that originally was derived from the guarantees of due process contained in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Conn. 337, 342, 441 A.2d 604 (1982); see <em>Giaccio </em>v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399, 402-403, 86 S. Ct. 518, 15 L. Ed. 2d 447 (1966); <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 458, 59 S. Ct. 618, 83 L. Ed. 88 (1939); <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926); <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 590, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). The Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> also requires that statutes with penal consequences provide sufficient notice to citizens to apprise them of what conduct is prohibited. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>96 Conn. 190, 195-98, 113 A. 385 (1921). We have equated vagueness analysis under our state constitution with the corresponding federal constitutional analysis. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 533, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 443, 668 A.2d 348 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 345, 376-77, 655 A.2d 737 (1995); <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>206 Conn. 608, 611, 539 A.2d 108 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 414 n.l, 528 A.2d 811 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Proto, </em>203 Conn. 682, 696, 526 A.2d 1297 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 45 n.9, 470 A.2d 688 (1984), overruled in part, <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>203 Conn. 484, 525 A.2d 1315 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The vagueness doctrine is based upon two distinct but interrelated principles. First, the doctrine requires \u201cwhat Justice Holmes spoke of as fair warning ... in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997); see <em>McBoyle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S. Ct. 340, 75 L. Ed. 816 (1931); <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 777, 695 A.2d 525 (1997); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 802, 640 A.2d 986 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 59-60, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). \u201c[L]aws [must] give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972); see <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 629, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984); <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>234 Conn. 455, 483, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 802. A law forbidding or requiring conduct in terms so vague that men of common intelligence necessarily must guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates due process of law. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>supra, 266; <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 367, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964); <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>supra, 269 U.S. 391; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 443; <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 354; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Second, the vagueness doctrine requires that statutes establish minimum guidelines to govern their enforcement. Kolender <em>v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357-58, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 574, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 802; <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 591. \u201c[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters . . . for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.\u201d <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 108-109; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 803. \u201c[Vjague laws defeat the intrinsic promise of, and frustrate the essence of, a constitutional regime. We remain a government of laws, and not of men, <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch.) 137, 163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>[1803], only so long as our laws remain clear.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mesquite </em>v. <em>Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 290 n.12, 102 S. Ct. 1070, 71 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u201cBecause perfect precision is neither possible nor required, however, the [vagueness] doctrine does not mandate the invalidation of all imprecisely drafted statutes. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 49, 96 S. Ct. 243, 46 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1975); <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>[supra, 408 U.S. 110] (\u2018condemned to the use of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our language\u2019); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>[supra, 192 Conn. 47].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211, 220, 700 A.2d 1 (1997). A statute is not unconstitutional merely because a person must inquire further as to the precise reach of its prohibitions, nor is it necessary that a statute list the exact conduct prohibited. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 443; <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 415. The constitution requires no more than a reasonable degree of certainty. <em>Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>342 U.S. 337, 340, 72 S. Ct. 329, 96 L. Ed. 367 (1952); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 443-44. \u201cWhile some ambiguous statutes are the result of poor draftsmanship, it is apparent that in many instances the uncertainty is merely attributable to a desire not to nullify the purpose of the legislation by the use of specific terms which would afford loopholes through which many could escape.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>supra, 220; see W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 11, pp. 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Mindful not only of the above relevant principles, but also of the fact that \u201clegislative enactments carry with them a strong presumption of constitutionality, and that a party challenging the constitutionality of a validly enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 217-18; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>225 Conn. 528, 543-44, 626 A.2d 244 (1993); <em>Beccia </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>192 Conn. 127, 133, 470 A.2d 1202 (1984); we turn to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that the plaintiffs vagueness challenge to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) may succeed only if the plaintiff has a property interest in not being deprived, by expulsion, of continued participation in the regular educational program at Thomaston High School. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 538-41, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 599, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L.

If the plaintiff has such a property interest, then the defendant constitutionally cannot expel him without affording him due process. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>supra, 538; <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 578; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Krause, </em>supra, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Property interests are more than abstract needs, desires or unilateral expectations of benefits or privileges. <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 408 U.S. 577; <em>Harkless </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>232 Conn. 599, 618, 657 A.2d 562 (1995); <em>Double I Ltd.

We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff had a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued participation in the regular educational program at Thomaston High School.

The general rule is that the constitutionality of a statutoiy provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue.

Thus, outside the context of the first amendment, in order to challenge successfully the facial validity of a statute, a party is required to demonstrate as a threshold matter that the statute may not be applied constitutionally to the facts of his case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 218 (conclusion that statute may be applied constitutionally to facts of case defeats facial vagueness claim); <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 484 (same). The plaintiff has not raised a first amendment challenge to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1). Accordingly, we turn our attention first to the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) cannot be applied constitutionally to the facts of the plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In order to challenge successfully, on due process grounds, the vagueness of the statute as applied to particular facts, a party must prove that the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>advanced by the void for vagueness doctrine were violated in his case. Specifically, a party must show that: (1) the statute does not provide fair warning that it applies to the conduct at issue, or (2) that he was the victim of arbitrary enforcement practices. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 591.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The plaintiff maintains that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) cannot be applied constitutionally to the facts of his case because the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d does not provide any meaningful indication; see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 145, 363 A.2d 68 (1975); that having marijuana in the trunk of a car off school grounds after school hours subjects a student to expulsion. In determining whether a statute provides constitutionally adequate warning, \u201cwe read the statute narrowly in order to save its constitutionality, rather than broadly in order to destroy it, [and we] indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 426; <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 44, 699 A.2d 101 (1997); <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 486; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 805. In doing so, we refer not only to the language of the statute, but also to prior interpretations that this court and the Appellate Court have placed on the statute. See <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>supra, 423 U.S. 51-52; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 444; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 805; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 63. We also may use as a guide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>judicial opinions that refer to a statute that uses similar language. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>supra, 444; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 805-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">With the above relevant principles in mind, we turn our attention to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) and the facts of the present case. Because \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) has not been construed previously by this court or the Appellate Court, our analysis is guided by the language of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d and by prior judicial interpretations of statutes containing language similar to that of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1). Our fundamental inquiry is whether, upon being apprised of the language of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) and those prior inteipretations, a person of ordinary intelligence could determine, with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether the plaintiffs conduct, i.e., having marijuana in the trunk of a car in the town of Morris after school hours, would subject him to expulsion. Put another way, our task is to ascertain whether such persons necessarily would differ as to whether that conduct was \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d at Thomaston High School. <em>See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, </em>supra, 468 U.S. 629; <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>supra, 269 U.S. 391; <em>Benjamin </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 483; <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>232 Conn. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">We begin with the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d Section 10-233d (a) (1) does not define the terms \u201cseriously disruptive\u201d or \u201ceducational process.\u201d If a statute does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate for clarification to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> see also <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>243 Conn. 657, 662, 707 A.2d 281 (1998); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 223-24; <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 771; <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 358; <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 809.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cseriously\u201d as: to a serious extent; severely. The meanings given for \u201csevere\u201d include: marked; of a great degree. Id. \u201cDisruptive\u201d is defined as \u201ccausing or tending to cause disruption.\u201d Id. The meanings given for \u201cdisrupt\u201d include \u201cto throw into disorder or turmoil ... to interrupt to the extent of stopping, preventing normal continuance of, or destroying .... Id. \u201cEducational\u201d is defined as: relating to or concerned with education. Id. The meanings given for \u201cprocess\u201d include \u201cprogressively continuing operation that consists of a series of controlled actions or movements systematically directed toward a particular result or end\u201d and \u201csomething (as in a series of actions, happenings or experiences) going on or carried on . . . .\u201d Id. Thus, the common usage of the terms contained in the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d indicates that the \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) was intended to apply to conduct that markedly interrupts or severely impedes the operation of a school. Moreover, we previously have interpreted, for vagueness purposes, the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d in accord with its common usage. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Linares, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 358 (disrupt means \u201cto upset the order of,\u201d or \u201cthrow into confusion or disorder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We conclude, therefore, that a person of ordinary intelligence, upon being apprised of the language of \u00a7 10-233d(a) (1) and our prior interpretation in <em>Linares </em>of similar language, would know, with a reasonable degree of certainty, that conduct off school grounds that markedly interrupts or severely impedes the operation of a school is \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d and therefore subjects a student to expulsion. We further conclude, however, that a person of ordinary intelligence, apprised only of the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) and our prior inteipretation in <em>Linares </em>of similar language, could not be reasonably certain whether possession of marijuana in the trunk of a car, off the school grounds after school hours, is, <em>by itself and without some tangible nexus to school operation, </em>\u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d as required by \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) in order to subject a student to expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The defendant nevertheless argues that the plaintiff received constitutionally adequate notice that possession of marijuana off school grounds would subject him to expulsion. Specifically, the defendant maintains that the defendant\u2019s written policy regarding misconduct off school grounds and the school administration\u2019s announcement, at the beginning of the school year, that the administration intended to hold students accountable for conduct in violation of school policy even if such conduct occurred off school grounds provided such notice. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The defendant\u2019s written policy regarding misconduct off school grounds, which is set forth in the Thomaston High School 1997-1998 Student Handbook, provides in relevant part that \u201c[sjtudents are subject to discipline, up to and including suspension and expulsion for misconduct which is <em>seriously disruptive of the educational process and </em>is a violation of a publicized board policy, even if such conduct occurs off-school property and during non-school time. Examples of off-school conduct that may result in such discipline include . . . [u]se, possession or distribution of illegal drugs. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the defendant\u2019s policy regarding out-of-school misconduct simply furnished students with actual notice that possession of illegal drugs <em>under circumstances seriously disruptive of the educational process </em>would subject them to expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The defendant also maintains that the plaintiff was provided with constitutionally adequate warning by virtue of the school administration\u2019s announcement, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>beginning of the school year, that the administration intended to hold students accountable for conduct violative of school policy even if such conduct occurred off school grounds. In effect, the defendant argues that adoption of a written policy vests school officials with <em>complete discretion </em>to characterize as \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d any conduct violative of such policy. In the defendant\u2019s view, therefore, a school board\u2019s discretion with respect to expulsions for conduct that takes place off school grounds is constrained only by the procedural statutory requirement that such conduct must be violative of a publicized board policy, but not by the substantive statutory requirement that the conduct also must be seriously disruptive of the educational process. See General Statutes \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument, therefore, renders superfluous the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d in \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1). \u201cWe presume [however] that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 196, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998); Hall v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

In order to subject a student to expulsion, conduct off school grounds must not only violate school policy, it must also be \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d for reasons other than the fact that it violated school policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Because \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) does not authorize school boards to define, by way of adoption of a policy, the meaning of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process,\u201d the defendant\u2019s announcement that it intended to expel students whose conduct off school grounds violated school policy served only to provide students with actual notice of the defendant\u2019s opinion that such conduct is \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d The defendant\u2019s opinion of the meaning of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process,\u201d however, is irrelevant not only to the meaning that the legislature intended that phrase to have, but also to the question of whether \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) provided the plaintiff with constitutionally adequate notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>that the incident would subject him to expulsion. Such notice must come from the language of the statute and from relevant judicial interpretations, not from opinions expressed by persons not authorized to construe the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff was not provided constitutionally adequate notice that the incident would subject him to expulsion from school.

Because we have concluded, however, that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) cannot be applied constitutionally to the plaintiffs conduct, it is necessary to look beyond the facts of this case in order to resolve the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutionally vague on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201cThe strong presumptive validity that attaches to [a statute] has led [the United States Supreme Court] to hold many times that statutes are not automatically invalidated as [facially] vague simply because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses fall within their language.\u201d Parker v. <em>Levy, </em>417 U.S. 733, 757, 94 S.

Subsequent to this court\u2019s declaration in 1975 that General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a710-234, the then current school expulsion statute, was void for vagueness; see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 140; the legislature repealed \u00a7 10-234 and enacted \u00a7 10-233d in its stead. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>See General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 10-233d; Public Acts 1975, No. 75-609, \u00a7 4. As originally enacted, Public Act 75-609, \u00a7 4, which was codified as \u00a7 10-233d (a), provided in relevant part that \u201c[t]he board of education . . . may expel any pupil whose conduct endangers persons or property or is <em>seriously disruptive of the educational process, </em>or is violative of a publicized policy of such board. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The legislative history of House Bill No. 5550 of the 1975 legislative session, which eventually was enacted as Public Act 75-609, and ultimately was codified as \u00a7 10-233d, does not explicitly address the meaning of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d The legislative history of the bill does contain, however, the following statement of purpose: \u201cTo remove the permissive and vague provisions of the present statutes concerning suspension and exclusion of pupils and replace them with a clearly defined statutory scheme which affords due process to all persons involved . . . and <em>to guarantee a continued and uninterrupted education for those students in our school system who wish to learn. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Committee Bill No. 5550, 1975 Sess., Connecticut General Assembly. The statement of purpose of a bill may be considered in determining its intent. <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 405; <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>supra, 186 Conn. 345; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>166 Conn. 189, 194, 348 A.2d 584 (1974). Consequently, the statement of purpose contained in House Bill No. 5550 supports the conclusion that the language of \u00a7 10-233d indicates that the legislature intended that the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>educational process\u201d apply to conduct that markedly interrupts or severely impedes the day-to-day operation of a school. That conclusion is similarly buttressed by remarks made by Jeannette Hotchkiss, president of the Connecticut Education Association, during the committee hearing on the bill that ultimately became Public Act 75-609. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Education, 1975 Sess., Pt. 2, p. 699 (legislature\u2019s task is to balance \u201cstudents\u2019 [due process] rights and the rights of a class which may be disrupted [as well as the rights of an] individual who is assaulted or harassed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Furthermore, we see nothing in the legislative history of the two subsequent relevant amendments to \u00a7 10-233d (a) to suggest that those amendments were enacted in an effort to depart from the initial legislative intent regarding the meaning of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d Public Acts 1995, No. 95-304, \u00a7 5, amended \u00a7 10-233d to provide in relevant part that \u201c[a] board of education . . . may expel . . . any pupil whose conduct endangers persons or property or whose conduct <em>on or off school grounds </em>is seriously disruptive of the educational process, or is violative of a publicized policy of such board . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The one direct reference found in the legislative history of House Bill No. 6898 of the 1995 legislative session, which eventually was enacted as Public Act 95-304, to the addition of the language \u201con or off school grounds\u201d to \u00a7 10-233d (a), however, merely provides: \u201c[The bill] specifies that a school board may expel a student whose conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, even if it occurred off school grounds.\u201d Substitute House Bill No. 6898, 1995 Sess., Connecticut General Assembly (File No. 901). Although Public Acts 1996, No. 96-244, \u00a7 19, further amended \u00a7 10-233d to provide in relevant part that \u201c[a] board of education . . . may expel . . . any pupil . . . whose conduct off school grounds <em>is violative of [ a publicized </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number><em>policy] and </em>is seriously disruptive of the educational process,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the legislative history of House Bill No. 5342 of the 1996 legislative session, which eventually was enacted as Public Act 96-244, makes no mention of the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the legislature intended the language of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) \u2014 \u201cconduct . . . seriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d\u2014 to mean conduct that markedly interrupts or severely impedes the day-to-day operation of a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Thus, the phrase \u201cconduct . . . seriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d is not completely devoid of a core meaning. Although a reasonable person may have difficulty ascertaining whether the nexus between certain conduct off school grounds and the day-to-day operation of the school is sufficient to bring that particular conduct within the purview of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1), a student who wished to avoid expulsion could identify prohibited conduct. For example, a student who called the school from home and falsely stated that a bomb had been planted in the school reasonably could not complain that a person of ordinary intelligence could not be reasonably certain that the bomb threat would result in its likely goal \u2014 a marked interruption of the operation of the school. Similarly, a student who threatened, off school grounds, to bring a knife to school and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>kill another student or a teacher reasonably could not maintain that a person of ordinary intelligence could not be reasonably confident that such a threat would markedly impede the normal school activities of the intended victim and school officials. This is a case, then, of the type adverted to in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 415 U.S. 578, in which the statute \u201cby [its] terms . . . applfies] without question to certain activities, but whose application to other behavior is uncertain.\u201d Id. ; see also <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>supra, 417 U.S. 755-56. We conclude therefore that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) has a core meaning of sufficient clarity to permit the statute to withstand a facial vagueness attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">To summarize, we conclude that: (1) \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) cannot be applied constitutionally to the facts of the present case because the statute, as drafted, did not provide the plaintiff with constitutionally adequate notice that possession of two ounces of marijuana in the trunk of his car off the school grounds in the town of Morris, after school hours, without any tangible nexus to the operation of Thomaston High School, would subject him to expulsion; (2) the legislature intended the phrase \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d in \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) to mean conduct that markedly interrupts or severely impedes the day-to-day operation of a school; and (3) \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) possesses a core meaning of sufficient clarity to allow the statute to surmount a facial vagueness attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We do not mean to pin any medals on the plaintiff or condone his destructive conduct in any way.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Moreover, we recognize that he probably is a thorn in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>side <em>of the </em>administration and that his conduct poses an all too familiar, and difficult, problem for school administrators. The school expulsion statute, as applied to this set of facts, however, is simply too vague to be constitutionally enforceable.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The order of the trial court granting the plaintiff\u2019s application for a temporary injunction is affirmed insofar as the order enjoins the defendant from expelling the plaintiff from school and excluding him from extracurricular activities; the order is reversed insofar as it concludes that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is facially unconstitutional and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In this opinion NORCOTT, KATZ and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\"> Kyle P.

On June 4, 1998, the legislature enacted No. 98-139, \u00a7 2, of the 1998 Public Acts (P.A. 98-139), which amended \u00a7 10-233d, in an effort to clarify when conduct is to be considered \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d P.A. 98-139, \u00a7 2, which was effective upon passage, added the following language to \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1): \u201cIn making a determination as to whether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process, the board of education or impartial hearing board may consider, but such consideration shall not be limited to: (a) whether the incident occurred within close proximity of a school; (b) whether other students from the school were involved or whether there was any gang involvement; (c) whether the conduct involved violence, threats of violence or the unlawful use of a weapon, as defined in section 29-38, and whether any injuries occurred; and (d) whether the conduct involved the use of alcohol.\u201d This court previously has held that \u201c[w]hen . . . events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, [an issue] has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loisel </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>233 Conn. 370, 378, 660 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>323 (1995). \u201cMootness implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of this court.\u201d <em>Sadlowski </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>206 Conn. 579, 583, 538 A.2d 1052 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Second, by reaching the constitutional issues in this case we fail to follow our long-standing \u201cpolicy of self-restraint and the basic judicial duty to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>180 Conn. 153, 166, 429 A.2d 841 (1980). Notwithstanding its constitutional excursion, the trial court concluded that even if \u00a7 10-233d was constitutional, the named plaintiffs possession of marijuana off school grounds was not seriously disruptive of the educational process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Third, at the time of the expulsion, the named plaintiff was a senior in high school. The defendant specifically provided in its order of expulsion that the expulsion be expunged from the named plaintiffs record at the time of graduation pursuant to \u00a7 10-233d (f). In addition, the trial court enjoined the defendant from enforcing the expulsion order as well as the other disciplinary actions pertaining to school activities. I take judicial notice that the school year has now ended. Because, in all probability, the named plaintiff has graduated from high school and the record of expulsion has been expunged, there is nothing left before the trial court to be adjudicated except the possibility of money damages. At best, the majority opinion with respect to the constitutional issue is an advisory opinion and, therefore, beyond the jurisdiction of this court. \u201cWe have consistently held that we do not render advisory opinions. . . . Justiciability requires . . . that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute .... [WJhere the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Domestic Violence Services of Greater New Haven, Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>240 Conn. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>6-7, 688 A.2d 314 (1997). \u201c[U]nder the law of this state the courts may not be used as a vehicle to obtain judicial opinions on points of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Finally, there exists an additional good reason why this court should not reach the constitutional issues, facial or as applied, in this case. In the wake of the trial court\u2019s opinion in this case, the legislature adopted P.A. 98-139. Although that enactment authorizes the defendant to take into account certain specific considerations when determining \u201cwhether conduct is seriously disruptive of the educational process,\u201d including \u201cwhether the conduct involved the use of alcohol,\u201d P.A. 98-139 does not specify the possession of marijuana as a factor to be considered. \u201cIf an amendment is enacted soon after controversies arise regarding the interpretation of the prior act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Turner </em>v. Turner, 219 Conn. 703, 717, 595 A.2d 297 (1991). In this case, the legislature\u2019s interpretation of its prior enactment emphasizes certain conduct that presumably has the greatest potential to seriously threaten the educational process. Notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s omission of the possession of marijuana from P.A. 98-139 \u2014 the conduct that sparked the controversy and prompted the amendment of \u00a7 10-233d in the first instance \u2014 the majority gratuitously posits that it does not mean to suggest that the possession of marijuana off school grounds could not be the basis of discipline. Although the list of criteria added by P.A. 98-139 is not exclusive, I would leave this issue to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b137-8\">NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">concurring. I agree with the majority opinion that General Statutes \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is constitutional on its face. With less fervor than that opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>however, I also agree with the conclusion that the statute as applied to the named plaintiff (plaintiff) does not support his expulsion from Thomaston High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">First, I completely agree with the defendant board of education when it argues that the plaintiff was fully aware that his arrest for possession of marijuana, under the circumstances of this case, could possibly subject him to expulsion. Certainly the Thomaston High School student handbook left little doubt as to this.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Further, the plaintiffs testimony 'at his expulsion hearing evinced the fact that foremost on his mind at the time of his arrest was dismissal from the soccer team and expulsion from school, not necessarily in that order. As the majority aptly notes, the test is whether a person of ordinary intelligence could determine with a reasonable degree of certainty whether the plaintiffs conduct would subject him to expulsion. The student handbook provided the plaintiff with notice that his conduct, under circumstances seriously disruptive of the educational process, would subject him to expulsion. Although the plaintiff was apprised that his conduct violated school policy, what the plaintiff was not apprised of was whether the resulting reaction of the high school would result in a serious disruption of the educational process.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Second, it seems to me that although the record alludes to several instances<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the defendant perhaps could have supported the conclusion that the plaintiffs off school grounds criminal conduct involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>a narcotic substance was \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1), for whatever reasons, the defendant and other relevant school officials did not establish the necessary nexus between the plaintiffs conduct and the disruption of the operations of the high school. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that this vacuum renders the statute unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Daily administration of public education is the responsibility of state and local school officials, and with that responsibility, school officials possess inherent discretion to proscribe and control student conduct. I write separately specifically to acknowledge the discretion that necessarily must repose in the school board to effectuate an environment conducive to learning. The majority relegates to a footnote the assertion that its opinion does not \u201csuggest that there is no set of circumstances under which possession of illegal drugs off school grounds would markedly interrupt or severely impede the day-to-day operation of a school and, therefore, constitute behavior that is \u2018seriously disruptive of the educational process\u2019 as required by \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1).\u201d See footnote 25 of the majority opinion. This significant statement merits greater emphasis, lest this case be construed as limiting the discretion of school officials to impose disciplinary action when off campus conduct disrupts the educational process. Had the defendant here \u201cmade its case\u201d more substantively with regard to the aforementioned nexus, I would have much more serious disagreement with the majority opinion because of the deference I conclude should be accorded to school authorities, and the restraint I believe this court should exercise in substituting its assessment of what constitutes \u201cseriously disruptive conduct\u201d in today\u2019s academic environment for that of the defendant. Because of the unique facts of the present case, it should not be understood as an invitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>for every student to challenge disciplinary action imposed for off-campus conduct as a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">It is a well established principle that courts should exercise caution in interfering with school discipline. See <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines Independent Community School District, </em>393 U.S. 503, 507, 89 S. Ct. 733, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1969) (\u201c[t]he Court has repeatedly emphasized the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials ... to prescribe and control conduct in the schools\u201d); <em>Epperson </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>393 U.S. 97, 104, 89 S.

The federal courts, ill-suited as they are to second guess decisions of school authorities, should interfere only in the most stringent circumstances.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">We have neither the expertise nor the inclination to assume the micromanagement of student discipline. Schools face student conduct that simply defies a standard response and the statute provides the school board the flexibility to demonstrate that certain conduct meets the criteria for student expulsion. I am loathe to see the judicial system intervene in such a dynamic environment in which it has little expertise. In times that are marked daily with tales of violence and danger in our public schools, we do society no favor by toying with the few tools of discipline left to school authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Nonetheless, for the reasons set forth previously, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> The Thomaston High School student handbook (1997-98) provides in relevant part: \u201cStudents are subject to discipline, up to and including suspension and expulsion for misconduct which is seriously disruptive of the educational process and is a violation of a publicized board policy, even if such conduct occurs off school property and during non-school time.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u201cExamples of off-school conduct that may result in such discipline include . . .

Although I agree with the majority that General Statutes \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is constitutional on its face, I am unable to join that portion of the majority opinion that addresses the question of whether \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutional as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>to the facts of this case because, in my view, it simply is not necessary to reach that constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">It is fundamental that, \u201cwherever possible, it is incumbent upon a court to consider statutory issues before reaching constitutional questions.\u201d <em>DeBeradinis </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>228 Conn. 187, 195, 635 A.2d 1220 (1994). Having acknowledged this \u201crecognized policy of self-restraint and the basic . . . duty to eschew unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions\u201d; id.; the majority nevertheless reaches out to decide whether \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutional as applied to this case <em>without first addressing the </em>plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>predicate statutory claim, </em>namely, that his conduct did not violate \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1). Although the plaintiffs illegal possession of marijuana off the school grounds was deplorable, and although school officials must be afforded substantial leeway to regulate and deter student misconduct, I am constrained to agree with the trial court that the defendant board of education (board) failed to prove that the plaintiffs drug possession was such as to \u201cmarkedly [interrupt] or severely [impede] the day-to-day operation of [the] school,\u201d the standard that must be met to justify emulsion for off-campus conduct under the \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process\u201d requirement of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (l).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the board did not prove a violation of \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1), there is no reason to reach the question of whether that statutory provision passes constitutional muster under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">I do agree with the majority, however, that there is a compelling reason to decide whether \u00a7 10-233d (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(1) is capable of having <em>any </em>constitutionally valid application. The judgment of the trial court declaring \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) to <em>be facially </em>unconstitutional presents \u201ca matter of substantial public interest\u201d because the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is unconstitutional on its face has cast doubt on the validity of that statutory provision, with implications statewide. Accordingly, it is appropriate to address <em>that </em>constitutional issue. Moreover, for the reasons articulated in the majority opinion, I agree that the trial court improperly concluded that \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">By contrast, however, I see no reason to decide whether \u00a7 10-233d (a) (1) is constitutional as applied to the facts of this case <em>absent a predicate showing that the plaintiff violated that statutory provision. </em>To do so violates our well established policy against deciding constitutional issues unless it is necessary to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-8\"> All references in this concurring opinion to the plaintiff <em>axe to </em>the named plaintiff, Kyle P.

I disagree, however, that the application of the statute to the named plaintiff (plaintiff) does not support his expulsion from Thomaston High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The defendant board of education found that the plaintiff possessed two ounces of marijuana. The plaintiffs younger brother, also a Thomaston High School student, was with the plaintiff when he was arrested. The Thomaston High School student handbook explicitly provides that the possession of illegal drugs, such as marijuana, is grounds for expulsion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>clearly was warned of the possible consequences of his drug possession. Furthermore, the plaintiff testified at his expulsion hearing that he knew he could be expelled for possession of marijuana. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The majority finds that possession of marijuana might not be recognized by students as conduct \u201cseriously disruptive of the educational process.\u201d To the contrary, it can be said that illegal drugs are disrupting America. See Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-20, 111 Stat. 224 (1997) (to be codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1521 et seq.);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marijuana Use in America: Hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Before the Subcommittee on Crime of the Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. (1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was, therefore, reasonable for the school board to find that the plaintiffs conduct seriously disrupted the educational process. It would also be reasonable to conclude that a student of reasonable intelligence would know, as the plaintiff admits in this case, that he or she might be expelled from school for this type of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The majority reasons that mere possession of marijuana does not constitute conduct \u201cseriously disruptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of the educational process.\u201d In doing so, it fails to recognize the effect of drug use upon a student\u2019s educational life. Conduct closing down the school should not be required. The majority substitutes its judgment for that of the elected school board. We should be mindful that we were not appointed to be \u201csocial engineers\u201d and we should leave policy to those elected by the people in a government of and by the people. See <em>Claremont School District </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>142 N.H. 462, 477-78, 703 A.2d 1353 (1997) (Horton, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The majority concludes that the plaintiff should not be decorated for his conduct and that \u201che probably is a thorn in the side of the [school] administration . . . .\u201d What the majority fails to recognize, however, is the need for school administrators to set a rule of zero drug tolerance for students on or off campus in order to educate each student.
