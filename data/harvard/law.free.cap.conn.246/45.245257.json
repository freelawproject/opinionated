J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the plaintiff, Angela Comelio, has a right to immediate possession of pathology slides obtained and analyzed in the course of her medical care by the defendant, Stamford Hospital. We conclude that she does not have such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. A Papanicolaou test, or Pap smear, is a test commonly used to screen for cancer of the cervix and endometrium. Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary (28th Ed. 1994) p. 1681. In brief, a specimen that contains cervical cells is removed from a patient and fixed on a laboratory slide. Id. After the Papanicolaou stain, which enhances the visibility of cell characteristics, has been applied to the slide, the specimen is examined under a microscope for cellular abnormalities. Id.; see also G. Papanicolaou, Atlas of Exfoliative Cytology (1963) pp. 3-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Pap smear specimens were taken from the plaintiff by her physician, Frances Ginsburg, on August 2, 1993, August 22, 1994, January 9, 1995, February 9, 1995, and November 2, 1995. The plaintiff voluntarily consented to having a specimen taken prior to undergoing each of those procedures. The record, however, does not include a consent form documenting the parameters of the plaintiffs consent to any of the five Pap smear tests. Ginsburg sent each of the Pap smear specimens taken from the plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s pathology department for interpretation. The defendant analyzed those specimens and prepared written reports of its findings, dated August 21, 1993, August 25, 1994, January 13, 1995, February 14, 1995, and November 8, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The plaintiff alleges that on November 22, 1995, she was diagnosed with Stage IB endocervical adenocarcinoma, and that she subsequently underwent a radical hysterectomy at Yale-New Haven Hospital. In February, 1996, at the plaintiffs request, the defendant sent the pathology slides that contain the Pap smear specimens taken from the plaintiff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Yale-New Haven Hospital for review. The Yale-New Haven Hospital pathology department analyzed the slides and prepared a report of its findings. That report provides that the slides contain \u201chighly atypical endocervical cells.\u201d The slides were then returned to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In August, 1996, the plaintiff requested that the defendant release the slides directly to her. The defendant informed the plaintiff that it would not do so because the slides contained cells that could not be duplicated. The defendant agreed, however, to allow experts retained by the plaintiff to examine the slides at the defendant\u2019s pathology department.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The plaintiff subsequently brought an action against the defendant in the Superior Court, by way of a bill of discovery, seeking an order compelling the defendant to release the slides to her. Specifically, the plaintiff maintained that their release was necessary in order for her to fulfill her obligation under General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to ascertain, prior to bringing a malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>claim against the defendant, a good faith basis for such a claim. The trial court concluded that the plaintiff did not need to obtain possession of the slides in order to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 52-190a. Consequently, the court denied the plaintiffs request for an order compelling the defendant to release the slides directly to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action for replevin against the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-515<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking possession of the slides and damages. The defendant moved for summary judgment, maintaining that the plaintiff lacked both a property interest in the slides and a right to their immediate possession. The plaintiff thereafter also moved for summary judgment, claiming a property interest in the slides and a right to their immediate possession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>court concluded that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff lacked a property interest in the slides and that, consequently, the plaintiff was not entitled either to replevin of the slides or to damages. The trial court, therefore, granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4024, now \u00a7 65-2, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In Connecticut, replevin proceedings are governed by statute rather than by the rules that apply to common-law actions of replevin. <em>Staub </em>v. Anderson, 152 Conn. 694, 695, 211 A.2d 691 (1965); <em>M. Itzkowitz &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Santorelli, </em>128 Conn. 195, 198, 21 A.2d 376 (1941); <em>Belknap Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>66 Conn. 542, 547, 34 A. 495 (1895). Section 52-515 provides that \u201c[t]he action of replevin may be maintained to recover any goods or chattels in which the plaintiff has a general or special property interest with a right to immediate possession and which are wrongfully detained from him in any manner, together with the damages for such wrongful detention.\u201d Thus, in order to replevin the slides, the plaintiff must establish that: (1) the slides are \u201cgoods or chattels\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-515; (2) she has a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the slides; (3) she has a right to immediate possession of the slides; and (4) the defendant has wrongfully detained the slides. See <em>D'Addario </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>128 Conn. 506, 507-508, 24 A.2d 245 (1941); <em>M. Itzkowitz &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Santorelli, </em>supra, 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court\u2019s rendering of summary judgment in favor of the defendant was improper because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiff had a property interest and a right to immediate possession of the specimens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>removed from her body during the procedures she had undergone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that: (1) a person\u2019s body is \u201cproperty\u201d; (2) consequently, prior to removal from the plaintiffs body, the Pap smear specimens contained on the slides were her \u201cproperty\u201d and, therefore, her \u201cchattel\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-515; (3) the plaintiff intended to retain her \u201cproperty interest\u201d in and her right to control of the specimens; and (4) as a result, \u00a7 52-515 provides the plaintiff a right to replevin of the slides that contain those specimens.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The defendant argues, conversely, that the plaintiffs claimed intent to retain ownership and a right to control of the Pap smear specimens contained on the slides does not raise an issue of material fact. The defendant contends that it was entitled to summary judgment because, as a matter of law, the plaintiff lacks both a property interest in and a right to immediate possession of the slides as required by \u00a7 52-515.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Assuming, without deciding, that the specimens are \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201cchattel\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-515,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and further assuming, without deciding, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>plaintiff has retained a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the specimens, we, nevertheless, agree with the defendant that the plaintiff, as a matter of statutory law, lacks a right to immediate personal possession of the slides that contain those specimens. Consequently, the defendant was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">An overview of the statutory scheme pertaining to patient access to hospital records is necessary to a resolution of this appeal. Historically, only General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-104 and 4-105<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> addressed such access. Section 4-104 provides that private hospitals receiving state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>aid \u201cshall, upon the demand of any patient . . . permit such patient or his physician or authorized attorney to examine the hospital record . . . and permit copies of such history, bedside notes and charts to be made . . . .\u201d Thus, \u00a7 4-104 provides a patient who has been discharged from a private hospital that receives state aid a statutory right to examine and to obtain copies of his hospital records. In 1978, concluding that the term \u201cstate aid\u201d in \u00a7 4-104 refers only to appropriations by the General Assembly and not to property tax exemptions, payments made to a hospital pursuant to contractual relations with the state, or to reimbursement for services rendered to indigent patients; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 64-65, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>this court further concluded that a private hospital that did not receive state aid had <em>no </em>legal obligation to allow patients to examine or obtain copies of their hospital records.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 65 (\u201c[i]t is not for this court to impose obligations not intended by the legislature\u201d). Thus, patients\u2019 rights regarding access to their private hospital records historically were limited to a <em>statutory </em>right to examine or copy the records of those private hospitals that received state aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In 1992, however, the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 19a-490b,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which provides patients of all hospitals licensed by the state a right to examine and obtain copies of their hospital records. The circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 19a-490b are instructive. In 1983, the legislature enacted the access to patients\u2019 medical records act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 20-7b through 20-7e;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to provide patients with access to health records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>prepared by individual health care providers such as physicians and dentists. See Public Acts 1983, No. 83-413 (P.A. 83-413). The <em>initial </em>version of House Bill No. 5908, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 83-413, and codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 20-7b through 20-7e, required licensed physicians to release \u201ca patient\u2019s medical records upon receipt of proper authorization by the patient or his duly authorized agent.\u201d Proposed House Bill No. 5908. The version of House Bill No. 5908 actually enacted, however, provided that \u201c[ujpon a patient\u2019s written request, a provider . . . shall furnish to a patient at a reasonable cost to such patient a <em>copy </em>of the patient\u2019s health record, including but not limited to, x-rays and copies of laboratory reports, prescriptions and other technical information used in assessing the patient\u2019s health condition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) P.A. 83-413, \u00a7 2 (b); see General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 20-7c (b). \u201cProvider\u201d was defined in relevant part as \u201cany <em>person </em>who furnishes health care services and is licensed to furnish such services pursuant to chapters 370 to 373, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> inclusive, 375 to 380,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> inclusive, and 382<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the general statutes.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>(Emphasis added.) P.A. 83-413, \u00a7 1 (b); see General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 20-7b (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The legislative history of P.A. 83-413 confirms that the act was intended, principally but not exclusively, to provide patients a right to examine and to obtain copies of their health records prior to the initiation of malpractice litigation. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public Health, Pt. 1,1983 Sess., p. 170, remarks of Jackie Coleman, assistant executive director of the Connecticut Psychiatric Society; id., pp. 198-99, remarks of Brett Flamm. The legislative history of P.A. 83-413, also reveals that Proposed House Bill No. 5908 was amended to require providers to furnish a copy of a patient\u2019s health record, rather than the original health record itself, specifically, but not exclusively, to ensure that the original health record is available to the provider in the event that the patient brings a malpractice action. See 26 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1983 Sess., p. 3078, remarks of Senator Reginald J. Smith (\u201cbecause of possible malpractice suits, [providers] should be allowed to keep the original file and . . . turn over a copy to the patient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In 1986, \u00a7 20-7c (b) was amended to delete the reference to \u201creasonable cost,\u201d and to provide instead that \u201c[n]o provider shall charge a patient more than twenty-five cents per page and the cost of first class postage, if applicable, for furnishing a health record pursuant to this subsection.\u201d Public Acts 1986, No. 86-43, \u00a7 2; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 20-7c (b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> During the discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives of House Bill No. 5217, which was the bill that eventually was enacted as Public Act 86-43, Representative Adele L. Kusnitz remarked, while addressing the cost of duplication of nonpaper portions of a patient\u2019s health record, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that \u201cthe [health] record <em>would include slides, microscopic slides that were prepared for the pathologist . . </em>. x-rays, laboratory reports, <em>slides, </em>it could be any number of things that are used in making the diagnosis and are part of the permanent record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1986 Sess, pp. 636, 638-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In 1991, \u00a7 20-7c was amended to prohibit providers from charging a fee for furnishing health records to patients who request the records in order to apply for benefits under the Social Security Act. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-137, \u00a7 2; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 20-7c. In addition, in order to \u201celiminate any charges for hospital . . . records for individuals filing social security appeals\u201d; 35 H.R. Proc, Pt. 9, 1992 Sess, p. 2941, remarks of Representative Joseph Courtney; the definition of provider in \u00a7 20-7b (b) was amended to include institutions, such as hospitals, that are licensed to furnish health care services pursuant to chapter 368v of the General Statutes. Public Acts 1991, No. 91-137, \u00a7 1; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 20-7b (b), as amended by Public Act 91-137, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The 1991 amendment to the definition of provider in \u00a7 20-7b (b), however, had the unintended consequence of also making hospitals subject to the per page maximum copy fee set forth in \u00a7 20-7c (b). See 35 H.R. Proc, supra, p. 2941, remarks of Representative Courtney; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Human Services, Pt. 1, 1992 Sess, pp. 56 and 109, remarks of Michael Eisner, counsel for the Connecticut Hospital Association. In 1992, the legislature, therefore, deleted from the definition of provider in \u00a7 20-7b (b) the reference to institutions licensed to provide health care services pursuant to chapter 368v, and added to chapter 368v of the General Statutes a separate section addressing patient access to hospital records. General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 19a-490b.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Public Acts 1992, No. 92-78; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 20-7b (b) and 19a-490b. As originally enacted, \u00a7 19a-490b (a), like General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 20-7c (b), as amended by Public Act 91-137, \u00a7 1, provided in relevant part that \u201c [u]pon a patient\u2019s written request, [licensed providers] shall furnish to a patient a copy of the patient\u2019s health record, including but not limited to, copies of laboratory reports, prescriptions and other technical information used in assessing the patient\u2019s health condition. . . .\u201d Section 19a-490b (a), however, did not incorporate the twenty-five cent maximum per page copy fee provided in \u00a7 20-7c (b) but instead imposed a maximum per page copy fee of sixty-five cents. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 19a-490b (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Thus the language, legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7\u00a7 20-7b through 20-7e and \u00a7 19a-490b manifest the legislature\u2019s intention that: (1) pathology slides constitute part of a patient\u2019s health record; (2) patients be given the right to examine and obtain copies of their hospital health records without first initiating a malpractice action; and (3) hospitals be permitted to retain possession of original health records to ensure, inter alia,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that such records are available to the hospital in the event of a malpractice action. This statutory history raises two separate questions: (1) are pathology slides part of a patient\u2019s health record; and (2) do pathology slides that cannot be duplicated fall within a hospital\u2019s right to retain original health records? We conclude that both of these questions should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The first question is relatively easy to resolve. The legislature\u2019s intent to preserve reasonable access for a patient to that patient\u2019s health records counsels against a narrow construction of \u201chealth record.\u201d We can conceive of no rational argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The second question is more difficult. We must reconcile the statutes\u2019 express recognition of a patient\u2019s right of access to health records with the statutes\u2019 failure to address specifically the problem presented if, as in this case, some components of a health record, such as the slides that contain the Pap smear specimens taken from the plaintiff, cannot be duplicated. Because, in our view, the legislature attempted to create a comprehensive network of patient rights, we can discern no basis for extending these rights beyond that which the legislature contemplated. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>supra, 175 Conn. 65. We are persuaded, therefore, that patients\u2019 rights of access to their health records are limited to those specified by statute. Furthermore, the legislature has manifested an intention that hospitals be permitted to retain possession of original health records in order to ensure, inter alia, that such records are available to the hospital in the event of a malpractice action. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 19a-490b does not afford patients a right to possession of those components of their hospital records that cannot be duplicated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Our conclusion finds additional support in the fact that \u00a7 19a-490b is not the only statute that governs the obligations of health care providers regarding pathology slides. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-36, formerly \u00a7 19-13, the commissioner of public health has adopted \u00a7 19-13-D32 (b) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which provides that \u201c[n]o specimen of excised tissue shall be subjected to pathological examination except by a <em>physician licensed </em>to practice in Connecticut who is certified in pathologic anatomy by the American Board of Pathology. No specimen of exfoliated tissue or cells shall be examined except under the supervision and review of a <em>physician licensed </em>to practice in Connecticut who either is so certified or has special qualifications acceptable to the commissioner of health for making such examinations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, pursuant to the authority of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-14, \u00a7\u00a7 19a-14-41 through 19a-14-43 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies address the obligations of licensed physicians with respect to patients\u2019 medical records. Licensed physicians are required to \u201cmaintain appropriate medical records of the assessment, diagnosis, and course of treatment provided each patient, and such medical records [must] be kept for the period prescribed . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-41. In addition, the regulations provide that \u201c[u]nless specified otherwise herein, all parts of a medical record shall be retained for a period of seven (7) years from the last date of treatment, or, upon the death of the patient, for three (3) years. . . . <em>Pathology Slides </em>. . . <em>must ... be kept for seven (7) </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>years. . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-42 (a). Finally, \u201c[i]f a claim of malpractice, unprofessional conduct, or negligence with respect to a particular patient has been made, or if litigation has been commenced, then <em>all records for that patient must be retained until the matter is resolved.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-14-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Thus, the statutory and regulatory scheme that governs the obligations of health care providers with respect to health records recognizes that a hospital has public duties as well as private interests with respect to proper retention of slides for seven years and, if a patient has raised a malpractice claim or malpractice litigation has commenced, until the claim or litigation has been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">We conclude, therefore, that a patient who seeks possession and control of nonduplicable pathology slides contained in the patient\u2019s hospital record for litigation related purposes does not have a right to possession of such slides. Because the plaintiff lacks a right to immediate possession of the pathology slides that contain the Pap smear specimens, she is not entitled to replevin of those slides.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT, KATZ, PALMER and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> In this opinion, we refer to the pathology slides that contain the Pap smear specimens taken from the plaintiff as the slides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a provides in relevant part: \u201c,(a) No civil action shall be filed to recover damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death occurring on or after October 1, 1987, whether in tort or in contract, in which it is alleged that such injury or death resulted from the negligence of a health care provider, unless the attorney or party filing the action has made a reasonable inquiry as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant. The complaint or initial pleading shall contain a certificate, on a form prescribed by the rules of the superior court, of the attorney or party filing the action that such reasonable inquiry gave rise to a good faith belief that grounds exist for an action against each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>named defendant. For purposes of this section, such good faith may be shown to exist if the claimant or his attorney has received a written opinion, which shall not be subject to discovery by any party except for questioning the validity of the certificate, of a similar health care provider as defined in section 52-184c, which similar health care provider shall be selected pursuant to the provisions of said section, that there appears to be evidence of medical negligence. In addition to such written opinion, the court may consider other factors with regard to the existence of good faith. If the court determines after the completion of discovery, that such certificate was not made in good faith and that no justiciable issue was presented against a health care provider that fully cooperated in providing informal discovery, the court upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed such certificate, a represented party or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.

Public Act 98-144, however, does not take effect until October 1, 1998. Moreover, Public Act 98-144, does not provide that a hospital must furnish original tissue slides directly to a patient, and the legislative history of Public Act 98-144 manifests the legislature\u2019s intention that patients not have a right to possession of Pap smear slides. See 41 H.R. Proc., Pt. 11,1998 Sess., p. 3587, remarks of Representative Carl J. Dickman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(\u201cthe provisions of this bill include . . .

One principle that formerly appeared deeply ingrained in our society and in our law is that one controls one\u2019s body. See, e.g., <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 869, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992). In this case, the patient sought to regain control of cells taken from her for medical treatment. This decision now severely restricts the patient\u2019s control over her own cells at a time when the advance of genetic science should raise very wide privacy implications. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because she sought these cells for litigation-related purposes, the majority now holds that the patient has no right to immediate possession to parts of her own body. The majority implies, in footnote 19, without deciding, that she may have such a right for purposes reasonably related to her medical care. The majority also intimates that the patient may be required to direct her cells to another medical provider to safeguard them.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In good part, the majority relies on legislation concerning medical records to ascertain a legislative intent to restrict a patient\u2019s right to her tissue samples. The majority, however, fails to consider legislation explicitly covering this case. The legislature recently enacted Public Acts 1998, No. 98-144, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Patient Access to Tissue Slides in Health Records.\u201d The act provides that institutions are required to send a patient\u2019s tissue slides to the institution, laboratory or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>physician that the patient designates without restrictions as to the patient\u2019s purpose. I, therefore, disagree that the patient may not direct that her tissue slides be sent to her designated physician for litigation-related purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Furthermore, the issue as to whom she may wish to direct the tissue slides was not settled in the papers before the trial judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In these circumstances, summary judgment was improper. See <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>241 Conn. 476, 481, 697 A.2d 680 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would remand this case for a trial on those issues vital to privacy and health.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-10\"> See, e.g., \u201cScientist Reports First Cloning Ever of Adult Mammal,\u201d New York Times, February 23, 1997, p. Al.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\"> The plaintiff submitted an unrefuted affidavit that she assumed that the Pap smear slides would be forwarded at her request to any new physician whom she selected and that she had ultimate authority over the disposition of the slides. She further stated that she requested that the slides be sent to her new physician for review, which was done, but when her attorneys requested the slides for review of a potential malpractice action, the slides could not be retrieved.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
