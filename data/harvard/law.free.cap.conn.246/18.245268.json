J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3\">The sole issue raised in this administrative appeal is the proper interpretation of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-43, \u00a7 1 (c), now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 16-19b (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorizes the department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>of public utility control to approve an energy adjustment clause for an electric company to be superimposed on the company\u2019s base rate schedule. The named defendant, the department of public utility control (department), approved an energy adjustment clause for the defendant Connecticut Light and Power Company (power company), in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 16-19b (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, the office of consumer counsel, a full participant in the hearings that led to the approval of the power company\u2019s energy adjustment clause, appealed from the decision of the department to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 and 16-35.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserted that the department failed to protect ratepayer interests to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>required by statute, and that approval of the power company\u2019s energy adjustment clause was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable. The trial court concluded that the department\u2019s factual and legal conclusions were legally and logically supportable and affirmed the department\u2019s decision. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The following facts are relevant to the determination of this appeal. The department is a state agency authorized pursuant to title 16 of the General Statutes to regulate and supervise the operation of public service companies. The power company is a public service electric company as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 16-1 (4) and (8). It is, therefore, subject to regulation by the department. The plaintiff is \u201cthe statutory advocate for consumer interests in all matters which may affect Connecticut consumers with respect to public service companies . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-2a (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Pursuant to its rate setting authority, the department, in a general rate proceeding, establishes the rate that an electric company must charge consumers. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-19 (a) and 16-19e.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This rate is commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>referred to as the \u201cbase rate.\u201d Because the base rate reflects a prospective anticipation of what rate will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>necessary adequately to compensate an electric company, it is necessary for the department to make several reasoned assumptions regarding future events in setting the base rate. The assumptions relevant to this appeal are those regarding the anticipated fuel related costs that the company will incur in the future. Among other things, the department must make a reasonable assumption regarding an electric company\u2019s generation mix, that is, the anticipated ratio of nuclear power that will be available to the company from which to generate electricity to the amount of fossil fuel<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the company will require in order to generate an adequate supply of electricity. The power company has been given an anticipated nuclear generation capacity factor of 72 percent by the department in its most recent rate proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If that forecast proves to be incorrect, the power company must obtain either more or less fossil fuel than predicted to make up for the variation in the anticipated availability of nuclear power. The costs associated with obtaining fuel will vary depending on the amount, type and price of the fuel needed. The department must make certain reasonable assumptions pertaining to the cost of obtaining these fuels. If the assumptions with respect to the generation mix or the costs prove inaccurate, the base rate will not accurately reflect an electric company\u2019s actual costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the company actually incurs lower costs than expected, receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>of the base rate will overcompensate the company to the detriment of ratepayers. If the company\u2019s actual costs exceed those that are expected, collection of only the base rate will result in undercompensation to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">In response to this potential inequity, the legislature authorized the department to adopt certain formulae for each electric company that would permit interim rate adjustments for fuel related cost variations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 16-19b (a) and (g).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These formulae were to be integrated with the base rate formula when appropriate and a new rate, either higher or lower, would be determined to reflect the actual costs incurred by the company. A fossil fuel adjustment clause allowed adjustments when costs varied because of unanticipated changes in the price of fossil fuels. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 16-19b (a). A generation utilization adjustment clause worked with the fossil fuel adjustment clause and allowed rate adjustments when costs varied as a result of an unanticipated change in the generation mix. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 16-19b (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Although accurate reflection of an electric company\u2019s actual costs was the intended purpose of these formulae, it had become apparent in recent years that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause were not effective in adjusting the base rate downward to reduce rates when the electric company was able to operate below its anticipated costs. Thus, electric companies, but not necessarily ratepayers, were benefiting by the operation of the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. In 1995, the legislature enacted \u00a7 16-19b (c) authorizing the department to approve a new energy adjustment clause to replace the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause then existing for each electric company. Public Acts 1995, No. 95-43, \u00a7 1 (c). The purpose of the law was to create a single formula that would operate more consistently in protecting both ratepayers and electric companies by fully tracking all fuel related costs and permitting adjustments that accurately would reflect actual costs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See 38 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1995 Sess., pp. 1756-58, remarks of Senator Stephen R. Somma; 38 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1995 Sess., p. 1252, remarks of Representative John W. Fonfara. Pursuant to \u00a7 16-19b (c), the department, after a hearing and a determination that the standards set forth in the statute would be met by an energy adjustment clause, approved an energy adjustment clause for the power company to replace its existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The plaintiff presents two arguments in support of its claim that the department\u2019s approval of the power company\u2019s energy adjustment clause was invalid. Both arguments relate to the proper interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 16-19b (c), in which the standard for approval of an energy adjustment clause by the department is set forth. Section 16-19b (c) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f the department, after notice and hearing, determines that the adoption of an energy adjustment clause <em>would protect the interests of ratepayers </em>of an electric company, ensure economy and efficiency in energy production and purchase by the electric company and achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (a) of section 16-19 and in section 16-19e <em>better than would the continued operation of a fuel adjustment clause and a generation utilization adjustment clause, </em>the department shall approve an energy adjustment clause . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Both of the plaintiffs arguments rest exclusively on the proper statutory construction of the first clause of that sentence in which the ratepayer protection standard is set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The plaintiff first asserts that the ratepayer protection standard set forth in \u00a7 16-19b (c) is an \u201cintrinsic\u201d standard that permits the department to approve only those energy adjustment clauses that protect the interests of ratepayers absolutely. The defendants argue, and the trial court agreed, that the standard is a \u201crelative\u201d one, requiring only that ratepayer interests need only receive greater protection under the energy adjustment clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>than they received under the former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to the plaintiffs interpretation, \u00a7 16-19b (c) requires some undefined quantum of ratepayer protection that must be achieved in the abstract without any reference to the ratepayer protection available under the former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">The plaintiff would interpret the energy adjustment clause approval standard set forth in \u00a7 16-19b (c) as if it read that the department shall grant approval of an energy adjustment clause for an electric company only if the energy adjustment clause would: (1) protect the interests of ratepayers absolutely; (2) ensure economy and efficiency absolutely; and (3) achieve the objectives set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 16-19 (a) and 16-19e better than the continued operation of the electric company\u2019s then existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under the plaintiffs interpretation, therefore, the \u00a7 16-19b (c) modifying phrase \u201cbetter than would the continued operation of a [fossil] fuel adjustment clause and a generation utilization adjustment clause\u201d would modify only the last clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>sentence relating to achieving the specified statutory objectives. According to the defendants and the trial court, that phrase must be read to modify all three of the standards set forth in the first sentence of \u00a7 16-19b (c), so that approval of an energy adjustment clause is required if the department finds, inter alia, that the energy adjustment clause would protect ratepayer interests better than would the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In resolving this dispute, we rely on well established mies of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory constmction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . We . . . must effectuate the expressed [legislative] intent. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . Ordinarily, if the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Charles </em>v. Charles, 243 Conn. 255, 258-59, 701 A.2d 650 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The plain language of \u00a7 16-19b (c) suggests that the phrase \u201cbetter than [the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause]\u201d was intended to modify each of the three preceding clauses. Had the legislature intended that it modify only the last clause, it would have indicated in some fashion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that the first and second clauses were independent of the third clause and the \u201cbetter than\u201d modifier. It could have accomplished this separation of the clauses by enumeration or by placing a semicolon after each of the first two clauses to indicate that they are clearly distinct from the third clause and its purportedly exclusive modifier. In any event, for the plaintiffs interpretation to be viable, it would be necessary for the final clause to be set off in some fashion to incorporate the modifier exclusively into that final clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Moreover, the legislative purpose and history confirm that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cbetter than [the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause]\u201d to modify the first clause relating to the protection of ratepayer interests. In explaining the bill, Somma stated: \u201cThis bill. . . essentially eliminates the fuel adjustment clause, as well as the [generation] utilization adjustment clause, and allows the Department to establish a broader adjustment clause to authorize an electric company to modify its rates to reflect changes in those rates, and costs in those rates. Before the new clause could be adopted . . . the Department must find that it actually <em>would better protect the ratepayers\u2019 interests.\u2019\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 1756. When asked how the bill would ensure that an electric company would not receive an excessive rate of return, Somma responded that \u201cthe new energy adjustment clause . . . has to be found to be <em>in the </em>interests, <em>better interests of </em>the ratepayers before it\u2019s actually adopted. . . . [T]he [department] must find that it\u2019s first in the, in the ratepayers\u2019 interest and would <em>better protect </em>them before this new clause could be adopted. . . . [T]his would <em>better pro tect </em>the ratepayers\u2019 interests . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Id., pp. 1757-58. In the three brief pages of legislative history in the Senate, Somma refers to <em>better </em>protecting the interests of ratepayers no less than four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>times. There can be little doubt in the face of this legislative history that the legislature intended the phrase \u201cbetter than [the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause]\u201d to modify the first clause relating to protecting ratepayer interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">In addition, the legislative purpose in adopting \u00a7 16-19b (c) lends support to our conclusion that the legislature intended that ratepayer protection under the energy adjustment clause formula be better relative to the then existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause formulae. The legislature\u2019s primary reason for adopting this legislation was dissatisfaction with the performance of the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause and the inability of those formulae to protect ratepayers by reducing the base rate when the electric company operated below its anticipated costs. See 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 1756. Because the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause were intended to protect ratepayer interests, it is reasonable to interpret \u00a7 16-19b (c) as requiring that the energy adjustment clause provide better protection than the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">We conclude that the department\u2019s approval of an energy adjustment clause is appropriate if the department finds that the energy adjustment clause will, inter alia, protect ratepayer interests better than would the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. The department properly interpreted \u00a7 16-19b (c) as creating a \u201crelative\u201d rather than an \u201cintrinsic\u201d standard with respect to the protection of ratepayer interests. The trial court\u2019s affirmance of the department\u2019s interpretation of the ratepayer protection standard in that respect was, therefore, correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">By way of an alternative argument, the plaintiff contends that the department has exceeded the scope of its statutory authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-19b (c) by approving an energy adjustment clause that \u201cimposed risks of generation plant management on [the power company\u2019s] ratepayers . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By the phrase \u201crisks of generation plant management,\u201d the plaintiff refers to those variations in anticipated costs that occur as a result of management decisions, as opposed to variations that occur as a result of some independent action such as an act of God or market forces. Specifically at issue, according to the plaintiff, is the possibility that the energy adjustment clause might permit the power company to pass through to its ratepayers those management risks associated with the operation of its nuclear generation facilities.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plaintiff rests its argument on its interpretation of the ratepayer protection standard in \u00a7 16-19b (c). In the plaintiff\u2019s view, the imposition of management risks is antithetical to the concept of ratepayer protection, even if that requirement is interpreted as relative rather than intrinsic.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The plaintiffs argument with respect to the impermissibility of shifting economic risk is essentially twofold. The first argument focuses on the department\u2019s factual determination. The plaintiff asserts that because the energy adjustment clause shifts more costs associated with management risks to ratepayers, the department could not conclude that the energy adjustment clause protects ratepayer interests better than do the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. In its second argument, the plaintiff maintains that the ratepayer protection standard in \u00a7 16-19b (c) must be interpreted as an absolute prohibition on the imposition on ratepayers of any generation plant management risks associated with its nuclear operations. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the record demonstrates that the energy adjustment clause approved for the power company improperly passes along economic risks to ratepayers. Its means of reaching this conclusion is somewhat circuitous. First, it asserts that the energy adjustment clause <em>proposed </em>by the power company would impose more risk on ratepayers than would its former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. It further asserts that the energy adjustment clause <em>actually approved </em>by the department is \u201csubstantially identical\u201d to that which was proposed by the power company. It argues, therefore, that the energy adjustment clause actually approved passes along more economic risks than did the former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause and, thus, does not provide better ratepayer protection. By way of proof of its assertion that the proposed energy adjustment clause imposes more economic risks than the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause, the plaintiff points to a single piece of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>in the record. It notes that one expert testified that adopting the energy adjustment clause proposed by the power company would be beneficial for the power company because the power company would be perceived as a less risky enterprise in the financial community with the energy adjustment clause in place, with the result that it would be able to attract more capital at lower costs. In the plaintiffs view, this demonstrates that the energy adjustment clause proposed by the power company would provide less ratepayer protection than did the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause because if the power company is perceived as being in a better economic position, then clearly the ratepayers are in a worse position. Because the energy adjustment clause that was proposed by the power company is similar to the actual energy adjustment clause approved by the department, the plaintiff maintains that the actual energy adjustment clause must pass along more risks and provide less ratepayer protection than the power company\u2019s fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">While the proposed and actual energy adjustment clauses may be similar in a variety of respects, the department expressly refused to adopt the power company\u2019s proposal because it concluded that the proposal would not protect ratepayer interests sufficiently.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The department specifically concluded that the then existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>utilization adjustment clause also did not protect ratepayer interests sufficiently because \u201cthe [fossil fuel adjustment clause] does not adjust for differences in cost that result from changes in the mix of generation. The [generation utilization adjustment clause] was implemented to complement the [fossil fuel adjustment clause] by adjusting for changes in said costs. It no longer does so. . . . The [department concludes that the continued use of [the power company\u2019s fossil fuel adjustment clause] and [generation utilization adjustment clause] do not protect the interests of [the power company\u2019s] ratepayers . . . .\u201d The department thereafter crafted its own energy adjustment clause for the power company, drawing on some aspects of the power company\u2019s proposals, and approved an energy adjustment clause that it found would protect ratepayers\u2019 interests better than the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We begin our analysis by noting that our review of an agency\u2019s factual determination is constrained by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (act). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (5) mandates that a court \u201cshall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court shall affirm the decision of the agency unless the court finds that substantial rights of the person appealing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are . . . clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record . . . We have interpreted the standard of review set forth in the act as limiting our review such that \u201c[w]ith regard to questions of fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 57, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991); see <em>DiBlasi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 823, 829-30, 624 A.2d 372 (1993). An agency\u2019s factual determination must be sustained if it is reasonably supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole. <em>Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>225 Conn. 731, 744, 626 A.2d 705 (1993); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. v. Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 57. Substantial evidence exists if \u201cthe administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 601, 590 A.2d 447 (1991); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>supra, 57. This \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard is highly deferential and permits less judicial scrutiny than a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d standard of review. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>216 Conn. 627, 640, 583 A.2d 906 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The plaintiff has failed to point to anything in the record from which we can conclude that the energy adjustment clause actually approved by the department does not protect ratepayer interests better than the former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause, let alone meet its heavy burden of demonstrating that the department\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>conclusion lacks substantial support on the whole record. Even if we assume that the plaintiff is correct and the expert testimony regarding the benefit to the power company from its proposed energy adjustment clause would carry over and be applicable to the energy adjustment clause actually adopted, we cannot conclude from that single scrap of testimony that, on the whole, the energy adjustment clause would not protect ratepayer interests <em>better </em>than the existing fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. The plaintiffs zero-sums analysis of the relationship between ratepayers and the electric company, that is, that a gain for one side necessarily entails a loss for the other, is insupportable. The ability of an electric company to attract capital at lower rates inures directly to the benefit, not the detriment, of its ratepayers. The company\u2019s capital costs are passed through to the consumer pursuant to \u00a7 16-19e (a) (4), and if capital costs are lower, the rates charged to consumers will be lower. The department is directed by \u00a7 16-19b (c), in reference to \u00a7 16-19e (a) (4), to consider the electric company\u2019s need \u201cto attract needed capital and to maintain [its] financial integrity . . . .\u2019\u2019Although some risks may be passed through to ratepayers, the department reasonably could have concluded that the reduced capital costs sufficiently counterbalance that detriment to make the energy adjustment clause better for ratepayers than the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause. We conclude that the plaintiff has failed to meet its burden of proving that the record is devoid of substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s factual determination that the power company\u2019s approved energy adjustment clause will provide more ratepayer protection than its former fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The thrust of the plaintiffs second argument is that it is never permissible for interim cost variations, namely, costs that vary from those that were anticipated in setting the base rate at the regular rate hearing, to be passed through to ratepayers if those cost variations are attributable to management risks. It maintains that this is true regardless of whether the costs were prudently or imprudently incurred and regardless of whether the variation will inure to the benefit of ratepayers as a rate decrease or to the company as a rate increase. The plaintiff does not deny that management risks may be passed through, but asserts that it may be done only in the regular rate proceeding through the establishment of the base rate. The sole basis for the plaintiffs argument is its interpretation of the ratepayer protection standard as prohibiting these interim cost adjustments because imposing management risks on ratepayers is antithetical to the concept of ratepayer protection.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We find no support for the plaintiffs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>stmction of \u00a7 16-19b (c) in its text, its legislative history or in the purpose underlying its adoption.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">First and foremost, it must be noted that the duty to protect ratepayer interests inures in every rate setting decision. As the plaintiff concedes, prudently incurred costs, even those attributable to management risks of nuclear facility operations, are necessary considerations in determining the base rate. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-19e. It is entirely unreasonable to conclude, therefore, that the imposition of management risks on ratepayers is contrary to the concept of ratepayer protection. Rather, it is a balancing of the interests of ratepayers and the needs of an electric company that establishes the appropriate standard for rate setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Moreover, the text of \u00a7 16-19b (c) belies the plaintiffs interpretation. Section 16~19b (c) provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he department shall design any such energy adjustment clause to reflect cost-efficient energy resource procurement and to recover the costs of energy that are proper for rate-making purposes and for which the department has not authorized recovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>through base rates. <em>These costs, reflecting prudent and efficient management and operations, </em>may include, but are not limited to, the costs of oil, gas, coal, <em>nuclear fuel, </em>wood or other fuels, and energy transactions with other utilities .... <em>The department shall design the energy adjustment clause to provide for recovery of energy costs prudently incurred by an electric company in accordance with section 16-19e. . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nowhere in \u00a7 16-19b (c) does the language prohibit the recovery of fuel related costs that are attributable to management risks. We will not adopt an \u201cinterpretation [that] imports ambiguity where none is apparent, [or that] engrafts language onto the statute that appears nowhere in the text.\u201d <em>Connecticut Assn. of Not-for-Profit Providers for the Aging </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>244 Conn. 378, 395, 709 A.2d 1116 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Contrary to the plaintiffs assertion, \u00a7 16-19b (c) requires the department to design an energy adjustment clause that will enable the electric company to recover those costs not accounted for in the base rate, that is, interim cost variations, <em>\u201creflecting prudent and efficient management and </em>operations\u201d including the costs related to nuclear fuel. (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 16-19b (c). Additionally, the statute mandates the adoption of an energy adjustment clause that affords recovery of \u201cenergy costs prudently incurred ... in accordance with section 16-19e.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-19b (c). Section 16-19e establishes the general rate setting guidelines, which, as the plaintiff concedes, permit the department to set rates that will enable the company to recover in the base rate prudently incurred costs attributable to management decisions. Section 16-19e (a) (5) provides that \u201cthe level and structure of rates charged customers shall reflect prudent and efficient management of the franchise operation . . . .\u2019\u2019The language of \u00a7 16-19b (c) permitting recovery of interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>costs in accordance with \u00a7 16-19e clearly demonstrates that the department is obligated to consider the same factors in adopting interim rates as are relevant in establishing the base rate. Consequently, we find no merit in the plaintiffs assertion that management risks may be passed through in the base rate but not by interim adjustments under the energy adjustment clause. To the extent that \u00a7 16-19e permits consideration of the risks of generation plant management in establishing the base rate, so too may it be considered in establishing interim rate adjustments in adopting an energy adjustment clause pursuant to \u00a7 16-19b (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">This textual interpretation is supported by the legislative purpose and history of the statute. The primary impetus for this legislation was concern that electric companies were incurring lower costs than were reflected in their base rate and were overcharging ratepayers. See 38 S. Proc., supra, p. 1756, remarks of Senator Somma. The legislature intended that the ratepayers should be credited with a reduction in their rate if the electric company was incurring lower costs than anticipated. It is absurd, therefore, for the plaintiff to argue that the legislature intended that no cost variations attributable to management decisions could be passed through to ratepayers when there is a decrease in the company\u2019s costs that would inure to the benefit of ratepayers. If the company\u2019s management has increased its efficiency and thus reduced its costs below that which was anticipated in establishing the base rate, this is precisely the type of benefit that the legislature expected to be passed through to the ratepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Furthermore, the legislature was concerned that the rates collected should <em>accurately </em>reflect the electric company\u2019s <em>actual costs. </em>Id. Its puipose was not solely to benefit ratepayers, but to provide an adjustment clause that would reflect all of the actual costs and ensure proper compensation that could not be obtained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>absence of interim adjustments. The entire concept of interim rate adjustment clauses undermines the plaintiffs theory. The only purpose for permitting interim adjustments is to enable rates more accurately to reflect actual costs with less frequent regular rate hearings. The base rate, by its very nature as an anticipatory figure, is often an inaccurate reflection of actual costs. The only reason that adjustment clauses exist is to permit ratepayers to enjoy the benefit of lower actual costs and to protect the electric company from the burden of potential financial instability when the base rate would be inadequate compensation. If a prudently incurred fuel related cost attributable to a management risk stands to put the financial health of an electric company in jeopardy, the failure to permit an interim rate adjustment would undermine the whole purpose of adopting such clauses in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Consequently, it would be equally absurd to conclude that the legislature intended the statute to decrease the base rate when a nuclear facility was efficiently operated but that the company was not entitled to the same protection of an increase in rates when its costs exceeded the anticipated costs, strictly as a result of prudent management decisions. \u201c [Compelling principles of statutory construction . . . require us to construe a statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results. . . . We must avoid a construction that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 319-20, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). The legislature left the determination of what costs were recoverable to the sound discretion of the department within the general standards set forth in \u00a7 16-19b (c). None of the limitations imposed include a prohibition on the recovery of a fuel related cost merely because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>attributable to a management risk.

It has failed to identify anything in the record that would indicate an abuse of discretion by the department or the absence of substantial evidence to support the department\u2019s factual conclusions. Furthermore, the plaintiff has not postulated a rational interpretation of \u00a7 16-19b (c) that would place the department\u2019s action beyond the scope of its statutory authority. Consequently, we conclude that the department correctly interpreted the statutory requirements of \u00a7 16-19b (c) in approving the energy adjustment clause for the power company.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In this opinion KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-19b (c) provides: \u201cIf the department, after notice and hearing, determines that the adoption of an energy adjustment clause would protect the interests of ratepayers of an electric company, ensure economy and efficiency in energy production and purchase by the electric company and achieve the objectives set forth in subsection (a) of section 16-19 and in section 16-19e better than would the continued operation of a fuel adjustment clause and a generation utilization adjustment clause, the department shall approve an energy adjustment clause to be superimposed upon the existing rate schedule of the electric company.

The power company was directed to reopen its most recent rate proceeding for the purpose of finalizing and implementing an energy adjustment clause. Thereafter, the department approved an energy adjustment clause for the power company on December 30,1996. The plaintiff appealed from the October 8, 1996 decision. Although the power company asserts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>a footnote that, arguably, the plaintitX appealed from the wrong decision, the issues raised by the plaintiff in this appeal stem from the legal and factual conclusions reached by the department in its October 8, 1996 decision.

We, therefore, will limit our analysis accordingly. \u201c \u2018Where an issue is merely mentioned, but not briefed beyond a bare assertion of the claim, it is deemed to have been waived.\u2019 <em>Bridgeport Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>232 Conn. 91, 115, 653 A.2d 782 (1995).\u201d <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; McLean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 344 n.11, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b48-5\"> To demonstrate that the proposed and actual energy adjustment clauses are similar, the plaintiff notes that the department used the proposed energy adjustment clause as a starting point. Additionally, it indicates that the energy adjustment clause actually approved provides several technical features of the proposed energy adjustment clause and adopts incentives and nuclear performance aspects similar to those proposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\"> The department found, as a fact, that the proposed energy adjustment clause would not protect ratepayers, and that the energy adjustment clause it approved would protect ratepayer interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b49-5\"> The plaintiff also argues that it was inappropriate for the department to use the power company\u2019s proposal as a starting point because it is essentially the same as a proposal that was first adopted by the power-company twenty years ago. According to the plaintiff, the power company\u2019s proposal cannot possibly meet the requirements of \u00a7 16-19b (c), adopted in 1995; Public Acts 1995, No. 95-43, \u00a7 1 (c); except by pure accident. We fail to see the efficacy of this argument. The mere fact of the age of the proposal does not prove that it could not, with necessary adjustments, meet the recently adopted statutory criteria. It may have done so by accident or by legislative design. The fact that the power company\u2019s proposal has been in existence for several years may mean no more than that the legislature has caught up with the industry\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b51-4\"> The plaintiff also summarily asserts that the energy adjustment clause as approved would not protect ratepayers from the burden of short-term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>fuel cost fluctuations in their monthly electric bills. The plaintiff cites no support for this assertion, and our review of the record indicates that it is incorrect. Under the fossil fuel adjustment clause and generation utilization adjustment clause, the power company was permitted to malte monthly rate adjustments to account for fuel related variable costs. Under the energy adjustment clause, adjustments are made every six months, and the department is obligated to review the operation of the energy adjustment clause every six months to ensure that it is functioning as intended. It would appear that this will give greater stability to ratepayers by keeping rates constant for at least six months rather than subjecting them to monthly fluctuations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b52-6\"> The plaintiff seeks to support its argument that permitting nuclear fuel costs adjustments is improper by reference to the energy adjustment clause approved in favor of United Illuminating, which does not include such a provision. First, we note that we are presented only with claims relating to the defendant power company, not United Illuminating. The energy adjustment clause adopted for United Illuminating is of no significance to the analysis of whether the defendant power company\u2019s energy adjustment clause protects ratepayer interest better than its former clauses. Moreover, the absence of a nuclear cost recovery provision from one company\u2019s energy adjustment clause has no bearing on its presence in that of another. Not only has United IUuminating not sought such a provision, but the proportion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>of nuclear fuel in its generation mix is substantially less than that of the defendant power company. As found by the department, this fact provides ample incentive for United Illuminating not to seek such a provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\"> The defendants argue that the energy adjustment clause adopted for the power company would not impose generation management risks on ratepayers. The plaintiff does not claim, nor could we conclude, that any imprudently incurred costs are passed through to ratepayers. For the sake of analyzing the plaintiffs argument, we assume without deciding that interim rate adjustments under the energy adjustment clause approved on behalf of the power company might allow some prudently incurred fuel related costs attributable to management decision-making processes to be passed on to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">We are somewhat confused, however, by the dissent\u2019s assertion, unsupported by either law or fact, that the energy adjustment, clause does not protect ratepayer interests because it imposes the costs of the power company\u2019s mismanagement of its nuclear facilities on ratepayers. All parties, including the plaintiff, agree that costs attributable to <em>mismanagement </em>are not passed through by operation of the energy adjustment clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\"> We are mindful that our role as an appellate court is to interpret the law, not to make it. Even if we were inclinded to agree with the dissent\u2019s apparent belief that <em>no </em>costs associated with nuclear fuel should be passed 1 hrough to ratepayers, whether to do so or not is a legislative policy decision that we are not empowered to override on the basis of our own feelings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b57-7\">MCDONALD, J., with whom BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">joins, dissenting. The question in this case is whether the department of public utility control (DPUC) honored its obligation to protect ratepayer interests. The DPUC was required by statute, while considering other factors, to adjust rates to protect the interests of the ratepayers, better than had been done under the previous rate-making provisions. Those former provisions had heavily favored the electric utilities over ratepayers for twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">A reading of the DPUC order makes plain that the entire focus of the agency was upon the benefits to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P). The only factor claimed to benefit the ratepayers is that of the resulting increased borrowing power of CL&amp;P from the increased power bills paid by the ratepayers. This might, it is argued, create savings to be, perhaps, passed back to ratepayers as the ratepayers pay the costs of restoring CL&amp;P\u2019s nuclear power facilities, all closed as a result of CL&amp;P\u2019s highly efficient neglect. Simply put, the majority states what is good for CL&amp;P is good for the ratepayers, even if the ratepayers pay for it. I cannot agree that this formula protects ratepayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">If other evidence was needed to show that the DPUC failed in its duty, it is found in the DPUC\u2019s disparate treatment of CL&amp;P and the United Illuminating Company (United Illuminating). In one order concerning rate adjustments due to energy costs, the DPUC approved such an adjustment of nuclear costs for CL&amp; P but not for United Illuminating. The DPUC was frank to admit that CL&amp;P requested such an adjustment and United Illuminating did not. Given CL&amp;P\u2019s record of maintenance and operation of nuclear facilities, it should come as no surprise that CL&amp;P would wish to pass along to its ratepayers the costs arising from the shutdown of every one of its nuclear facilities. United Illuminating, on the other hand, had nuclear energy suppliers without such a dismal record and opted not to seek such an adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">I agree that strong public energy companies are needed in our state, but this requires more than ratepayers taking up the slack caused by mismanagement. In these circumstances, twenty years of monopoly with a favored base rate should have been ended by the DPUC as the legislature intended. It was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
