We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant, Miguel M. Beltran, a fifty-five year old married man, had been involved romantically with one of the victims, thirty-three year old Lucy Torres (Torres), for approximately three years. Prior to September 29,1995, Torres had ended her relationship with the defendant, and at that time she was dating the other victim, Wilfredo M. Reyes. The defendant repeatedly had attempted but failed to resume his relationship with Torres. Within the two week period between their break-up and September 29, 1995, the defendant called Gloria Rivera, Torres\u2019 friend, several times each day asking Rivera to help him mend his relationship with Torres. The defendant told Rivera that he would kill Torres if she did not resume their relationship in two weeks. Early in the evening of September 29, 1995, the defendant told Jose Torres, the victim\u2019s brother, that he had given her two weeks, and the two weeks were up. On that same day, the defendant telephoned Torres several times, but she declined to speak with him. Instead, Adaliz Cintron, who was living with Torres at the time, spoke with the defendant, and he told Cintron that he had written a letter explaining why he would kill Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Later that night, Torres, Jose Torres, Cintron, Rivera and Reyes were gathered at the Spanish-American Family Center, a social club located in Bridgeport. Between 10:15 and 10:45 p.m., the defendant arrived at the club. He had not been to the club for approximately one year. While at the club, the defendant told Gilberto Garcia, the proprietor of the club, that he had decided to do what he had vowed to do and he pointed at Torres. On his way out, the defendant passed by the victims\u2019 table, which was located near the club\u2019s exit, and told Reyes that he wanted to see him outside. Reyes, accompanied by Torres, followed the defendant outside. Approximately twenty seconds later, four closely-spaced gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>shots were heard. Jose Torres, Rivera and Cintron went outside, where they saw the defendant standing behind his car taking the bullet casings out of a gun that he was holding and putting them into his pocket. All three individuals saw the defendant get in his car and drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Jose Torres, Rivera and Cintron then saw Reyes and Torres lying on the ground motionless and bleeding. The defendant had shot Torres twice. One bullet had entered the palm of Torres\u2019 right hand and exited from its back. The other bullet initially had penetrated her left rib cage, pierced her left lung, abraded her heart, fractured a thoracic vertebrae, and passed through the lowerpart of her right lung before exiting her body three inches above its point of entry. This bullet killed Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The defendant also had shot Reyes twice. One bullet had grazed Reyes\u2019 right arm, and the other, the fatal bullet, had entered his right buttock, passed through his pelvic bone and the pelvic area damaging an artery, traveled through the bladder, penetrated the opposite side of the pelvic bone, injured another artery, and finally exited his body from the groin area. Reyes bled to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Both victims had been shot by a high-powered weapon at close range. Although the police did not find a weapon or any empty bullet casings at the scene of the crime, they did find an empty case for a .44 caliber handgun and .44 caliber ammunition at the defendant\u2019s house. Forensic tests performed on the defendant\u2019s hands and clothing indicated that he recently had fired a gun, while tests on Reyes\u2019 hands conclusively indicated that he had not fired a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, he claimed self-defense,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and offered the jury the following evidence to support his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reyes and the defendant had exchanged words while the defendant was leaving the club. Reyes and Torres followed the defendant outside, where Reyes verbally threatened and insulted the defendant while keeping his hand behind his back as if Reyes was concealing a weapon. While maintaining this posture, Reyes approached the defendant and slapped him. The defendant reacted by grabbing Reyes\u2019 right hand, in which Reyes was holding a gun, and a struggle over the gun ensued. While Torres was attempting to separate the two by positioning herself between them, the gun accidentally discharged four shots. According to the defendant, he left the gun at the scene and drove away only because he thought Torres\u2019 friends and family might attempt to kill him. The defendant speculated that no gun was found at the scene because it had been picked up by one of the bystanders before the arrival of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The trial court instructed the jury on the defense of self-defense. The jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of murder and one count of capital felony as charged in the information. The trial court merged the two murder counts with the capital felony count, and rendered a judgment of conviction accordingly. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The defendant raises two challenges to the trial court\u2019s instructions on self-defense, namely, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on: (1) mistake of fact as requested by the defendant; and (2) the initial aggressor doctrine. We reject both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly omitted instructions on the defense of mistake of fact from its charge to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reject this claim because the evidence in this case did not require a specific mistake of fact instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The defense of mistake of fact is available under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-6 (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cA person shall not be relieved of criminal liability for conduct because he engages in such conduct under a mistaken belief of fact, unless: (1) Such factual mistake negates the mental state required for the commission of an offense ... or (3) such factual mistake is of a kind that supports a defense of justification.\u201d A mistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>of fact exists \u201cwhen one makes an erroneous perception of the facts as they actually exist. . . . The defense arises only where the defendant misperceives an objective state of existing fact . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 460-61, 503 A.2d 599 (1986). An instruction on mistake of fact is required \u201conly when evidence supporting [this] . . . defense is placed before the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 462; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>199 Conn. 273, 278, 506 A.2d 556 (1986). \u201cThe court . . . has a duty not to submit to the jury, in its charge, any issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Diggs, </em>219 Conn. 295, 299, 592 A.2d 949 (1991). No mistake of fact instruction was required in the present case because there was no evidence showing that the defendant acted under any mistaken belief of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In this case, the state argued to the jury that the defendant, acting out of jealousy and rage, executed his plan to shoot and kill Reyes and Torres. On the other hand, the defendant contended that he had been threatened by Reyes, forcing the defendant to defend himself. According to the defendant, Reyes not only had assumed a posture of attack by threatening and insulting the defendant while aggressively advancing toward the defendant with his hand behind his back, but Reyes actually drew a gun to attack the defendant. The defendant maintained throughout the trial that because of Reyes\u2019 attack, which resulted in a struggle over the gun, the victims were accidentally shot. He did not testify nor was there any other evidence showing that he later found his perception of these events to be incorrect. Hence, there was no evidence tending to show a factual mistake on the part of the defendant\u2019s comprehension of the circumstances to be tested by the jury. Therefore, an instruction regarding a mistake of fact was unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The defendant\u2019s second challenge to the self-defense instruction is that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the initial aggressor doctrine. This claim, which the defendant raises under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), is unavailing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Under <em>Golding, </em>the defendant may prevail if: (1) the record is adequate for reviewing the alleged error; (2) the alleged error is of a constitutional dimension; (3) the defendant\u2019s alleged constitutional claim clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial; and (4) the error was not harmless. Id., 239-40. The first two steps in the <em>Golding </em>analysis address the reviewability of the claim, while the last two steps involve the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">We agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for a determination of whether the instruction, as given by the court, comported with the law. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>agree that an instruction that omits an element of a defense is constitutionally inadequate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cor</em>chado, 188 Conn. 653, 660, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails because the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the initial aggressor doctrine was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (c), which embodies the initial aggressor doctrine, provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, a person is not justified in using physical force when ... (2) he is the initial aggressor . . . .\u201d Subsection (a) of \u00a7 53a-19 provides the legal standard under which a defendant may establish self-defense. Subsection (a), however, is subject to subsection (c), because it provides: <em>\u201cExcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this </em>section, a person is justified in using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Both subsection (a) and (c) of \u00a7 53a-19 (a), therefore, demonstrate that one is <em>not </em>entitled to the defense of self-defense if subdivision (2) of subsection (c) is proven. Put another way, the defendant is not entitled to avail himself of the defense of self-defense if he is the initial aggressor. Essentially, therefore, the concept of initial aggressor is a limitation on what would otherwise be a valid defense of the justified use of force in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In the present case, the state did not claim that the defendant was the initial aggressor. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim was not exposed to the possibility of being undermined by \u00a7 53a-19 (c) (2). Because there had been no attempt by the state to defeat the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim by using the initial aggressor doctrine, there was no occasion for the trial court to instruct the jury on that doctrine. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fail to see, therefore, how the defendant can complain about the omission of an instruction on a doctrine that only would have harmed him had it been given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The question for the jury in this case was whether the defendant shot and killed Reyes and Torres in cold blood out of rage and jealousy, or whether the defendant, in the course of a hand-to-hand struggle with Reyes over the gun, accidentally shot and killed the victims. Whether the defendant was the initial aggressor simply was not an issue in this case. Thus, an instruction on \u00a7 53a-19 (c) (2) could only have confused the jury and ultimately harmed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court violated his federal and state constitutional<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rights to the equal protection of the laws in concluding that the state\u2019s race-neutral explanation for exercising a peremptory challenge was satisfactory. The defendant bases his claims on the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">During the jury selection, the state used a peremptory challenge to remove a young Hispanic woman, Estella Rodriguez, from the venire panel. The defendant objected to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge, and the trial court asked the state to provide its reasons for the peremptory challenge. The assistant state\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cShe\u2019s nineteen years old; she just graduated from high school. She\u2019s unmarried. Particularly her age but ... if you look at everybody who has been selected so far in this case they all are on some sort of a career track. Almost everybody is married, has children, etc. I don\u2019t believe that this person has had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>enough exposure to society to, in my opinion, sit on a murder case.\u201d The trial court found that these reasons were race-neutral. The defendant did not respond in any way, and the venireperson was excused.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s explanations for using its peremptory challenge were pretexts to camouflage what was in reality a racially biased challenge in violation of the equal protection clause under <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), and <em>State v. Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">In <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court set forth the guidelines for assessing a defendant\u2019s claim of purposeful, race-based peremptory challenges by the state. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 96-98. Procedurally, the facts necessary to prove the state\u2019s racially discriminatory purpose under the <em>Batson </em>test are propounded by the parties through a three step process. First, the defendant must establish a prima facie case of purposeful racial discrimination by the state. Id., 96-97. The burden then shifts to the state to propound a race-neutral- purpose for seeking the removal of the venireperson. Id., 97-98. Last, the defendant may then demonstrate that the state\u2019s reasons are pretextual or insufficient. Id. \u201cThe defendant carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted by purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 395, 538 A.2d 210 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">In <em>Holloway, </em>we held that in order to establish a prima facie case of purposeful, racially motivated jury selection by the state, it is only necessary for the defendant to show that he or she is \u201ca member of a cognizable racial group and [that] the prosecutor exercise [d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>peremptory challenges to remove members of [the] defendant\u2019s race from the venire.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 646 n.4. Because the record establishes that both the defendant and the venireperson were Hispanic, a cognizable racial group; see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>97 F.3d 648, 654 (2d Cir. 1996); we conclude that the first step of the <em>Batson-Holloway </em>test was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">After a prima facie case of a purposeful, racially biased peremptory challenge is established, the state must \u201carticulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried\u201d for attempting to remove the venireperson. <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98. The state, in the present case, provided its reasons, and the trial court found that the state had provided a valid, race-neutral explanation for using its peremptory challenge to remove Rodriguez from the venire panel. The record supports the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">To satisfy the second part of the <em>Batson-Holloway </em>test, the nature of the state\u2019s reason must be race-neutral, meaning that it must not be motivated by a racially biased assumption; id., 97-98; and the state\u2019s reasons must be related to the case. Id., 98. A plurality of the United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201c [a] neutral explanation in [this] context . . . means an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. At this step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.\u201d <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 360, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991) (Rehnquist, C. J., and Kennedy, White and Souter, Js.). Generally, an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror is neutral in this context. Id., 374 (O\u2019Connor and Scalia, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Js., concurring). Because age, level of education, profession or marital status are not intrinsically racial characteristics, the trial court was justified in finding the state\u2019s explanation to be facially race-neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In addition, the state\u2019s reasons bore a rational relation to the case. This connection is established as long as the record \u201cadequately substantiate [s]\u201d legitimate reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 405. In the present case, the state\u2019s general contention was that Rodriguez had not \u201chad enough exposure to society to . . . sit on a murder case.\u201d The venireperson in this case was an unmarried, nineteen year old, recent high school graduate. These facts reasonably supported the state\u2019s expressed concerns regarding her competence to serve as a juror in a double murder case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Once the state met its burden of producing a race-neutral explanation, it was incumbent upon the defendant to persuade the trial court that the state\u2019s reasons were insufficient or pretextual. To have done so, the defendant could have advanced reasons \u201cthat are salient to a showing of pretext.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399. The defendant, however, made no effort to carry his burden under the third step of the <em>Batson-Holloway </em>test. Therefore, the only inference that the trial court could have drawn was that the defendant accepted the state\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>On appeal, however, the defendant argues that the trial court, after having requested and received a valid race-neutral explanation from the state, and after the defendant made no effort to challenge that explanation, had a sua sponte duty to do something more before excusing the venireperson. The defendant offers no authority or reason for such an unorthodox application of the <em>Batson-Holloway </em>test, and we decline to fashion one in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\"> The defendant appealed directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court . . . (3) an appeal in any criminal action involving a conviction for a capital felony . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of a capital felony who is convicted of . . . (8) murder of two or more persons at the same time or in the course of a single transaction . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The defendant also had been charged with two counts of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), which provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b285-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (a) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a person is justified in using reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force, and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose; except that deadly physical force may not be used unless the actor reasonably believes that such other person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\"> The defendant also claimed severe emotional distress as an affirmative defense to the crime of murder pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>See footnote 2 of this opinion. He does not raise on appeal, however, any claim regarding that affirmative defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> The defendant filed a written request to charge on mistake of fact, which included the following: \u201cThe language of our self-defense statute presents a question of fact about what the defendant himself reasonably believed about his exposure to jeopardy under the circumstances. It focuses on the person claiming self-defense. The jury must view the circumstances which the defendant claims justified the use of force from the perspective of the defendant and then determine whether his belief was reasonable. In determining the reasonableness of his beliefs as to the necessity for the use of force and the degree of force necessary, the jury should consider his perceptions concerning both the physical circumstances requiring the use of force and his familiarity of the deceased and the deceased\u2019s earlier violent behavior against him. Even <em>if the defendant was mistaken in his belief </em>regarding the necessity of using force, if his belief was reasonable, then his actions were justified.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">In all respects, the trial court\u2019s instructions were substantially the same as what was requested by the defendant, except that the trial court omitted that portion of the request referring to the defendant\u2019s mistaken belief. In light of the defendant\u2019s written request, the defendant\u2019s claim was properly preserved for review under Practice Book \u00a7 42-16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\"> The defendant did not preserve this claim for review. The defendant\u2019s written request to charge included the following: <em>\u201c(If instructions on [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-19 [c] [2] are given) </em>The use of words which cause a confrontation does not make someone the initial aggressor and thereby render self-defense unavailable. In other words, it is not necessary for the defendant to have been totally without fault or blame in this incident to avail himself of the doctrine of self-defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">Section 53a-19 (c) (2), which was referred to by the defendant in his request, embodies the initial aggressor doctrine and its legal effect on a self-defense claim. The defendant\u2019s request demonstrates that an instruction defining who is <em>no t </em>an initial aggressor would have been necessary only <em>if </em>an instruction on who <em>is </em>an initial aggressor were to be given by the court. Because the court did not instruct the jury on the initial aggressor doctrine, the court was free not to consider the defendant\u2019s request. By making a conditional request, the defendant effectively failed to make an affirmative written request to have the jury charged on the scope of the initial aggressor doctrine. Indeed, if anything', the defendant\u2019s request to charge would have indicated to the trial court that the defendant did not consider an instruction on the initial aggressor doctrine necessary to the case. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claimed error was not properly preserved at trial, and the defendant may prevail, if at all, only under the rule of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\"> \u201cBecause the defendant has failed to provide any independent analysis under the state constitution, we limit our review to the federal constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 133 n.77, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S.
