Erickson, appeals<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>in favor of the defendant, Dorothy Erickson,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the executrix of the estate of the decedent, dismissing the plaintiffs appeal from the decree of the Probate Court for the district of Madison. The Probate Court had admitted the will of the decedent to probate. The trial court ruled that the decedent\u2019s will, which had been executed shortly before his marriage to the defendant, provided for the contingency of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The plaintiff claims on her appeal that the trial court improperly concluded that the decedent\u2019s will provided for the contingency of marriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant claims on her cross appeal that the trial court improperly excluded certain extrinsic evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s intent. We conclude that the trial court should have permitted the defendant to introduce extrinsic evidence of the decedent\u2019s intent. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Certain facts in this appeal are undisputed. On September 1, 1988, the decedent executed a will. At that time, he had three daughters and was unmarried. Two days later, on September 3, 1988, he married the defendant. He died on February 22, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The six articles of the will provide as follows.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The first article provides for the payment of funeral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>expenses and debts by the estate. The second article states that the residue of the estate will pass to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>defendant. The third article provides that if the defendant predeceases the decedent, one half of the residuary estate will pass in equal parts to the decedent\u2019s three daughters, Laura Erickson Kusy, Ellen Erickson Cates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and Alicia Erickson, and one half of the residuary estate will pass in equal parts to Thomas Mehring, Christopher Mehring, Maureen Mehring and Kathleen Mehring, the children of the defendant. The fourth article appoints the defendant as the executrix of the will, with Attorney Robert O\u2019Brien as the contingent executor in the event that the defendant is unable to or refuses to serve as executrix. The fifth article gives the executrix or executor the power to dispose of property of the estate as necessary. The sixth article appoints the defendant as the guardian of any of the decedent\u2019s children who have not reached the age of eighteen at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The Probate Court admitted the decedent\u2019s will to probate. The plaintiff appealed from the Probate Court\u2019s judgment. Prior to trial, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine to exclude extrinsic evidence of the decedent\u2019s intent. The plaintiff argued that \u201c[\u00a7] 45a-257 makes the Court\u2019s inquiry very simple: to determine whether the will was revoked, the Court need examine only [the decedent\u2019s] will, his marriage certificate to [the defendant], and his death certificate. Extrinsic evidence regarding [the decedent\u2019s] intentions is inadmissible because the language of [the decedent\u2019s] will is unambiguous, and therefore under ...[\u00a7] 45a-257 the operation of the marriage to revoke the will is automatic and mandatory.\u201d The defendant, in opposition to the plaintiffs motion, made a detailed offer of proof to show the contrary intent of the decedent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The admission of certain evidence was undisputed, namely, the will, the marriage certificate of the decedent and the defendant, and the decedent\u2019s death certificate. The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion in limine with respect to the evidence that Thomas Mehring, Christopher Mehring, Maureen Mehring and Kathleen Mehring, who were named beneficiaries in the will, are the children of the defendant. The court granted the motion in limine, however, with respect to any other evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>With respect to the other issue at trial, namely, whether the decedent\u2019s will provided for the contingency of his marriage to the defendant, the trial court, in a de novo proceeding, concluded that the Probate Court properly had admitted the will to probate because the will provided for the contingency of marriage. The trial court reasoned that \u201c[the decedent\u2019s] will bequeathed all of his estate to the woman he was licensed to marry and did marry two days later. In his will, he named her executrix and designated her the guardian of his daughters, whose mother had previously died. The nature of these provisions, coupled with the extreme closeness in time of the marriage constitutes clear and convincing evidence of provision for the contingency of marriage. It would be preposterous to assume that [the decedent] was instead executing a will to make provisions that were to be revoked two days later.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment affirming the Probate Court\u2019s judgment admitting the will, and denied the plaintiffs appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The plaintiff claims that because the will did not expressly provide for the contingency of marriage, the trial court improperly concluded that the decedent\u2019s will provided for the contingency of marriage and, therefore, that his subsequent marriage did not automatically revoke his will under \u00a7 45a-257 (a). The plaintiff argues that in determining whether a will provides for contingency of a subsequent marriage, the court may consider only the language of the will, and that the will in question in this case does not include any language referring to the contingency of marriage, such as \u201cthe words \u2018if I marry,\u2019 \u2018when I marry,\u2019 \u2018my future wife\u2019 or even \u2018my fiancee.\u2019 In fact the words \u2018wife,\u2019 \u2018spouse\u2019 and \u2018marry\u2019 do not appear within the four corners of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In contrast, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded extrinsic evidence of the decedent\u2019s intent establishing that his subsequent marriage to her would not result in the revocation of his will.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the alternative, the defendant argues that there is sufficient language within the will itself, without resort to extrinsic evidence, to indicate that the decedent did not intend for his will to be revoked upon his marriage to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We conclude that the will, in and of itself, did not provide for the contingency of the subsequent marriage of the decedent and, therefore, under existing case law, properly would have been revoked by that marriage pursuant to \u00a7 45a-257 (a). We also conclude, however, that under the circumstances of this case, the trial court improperly excluded evidence of a mistake by the scrivener that, if believed, would permit a finding that the will provided for the contingency of marriage. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and order a new trial in which such evidence may be considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">On the basis of existing case law, the question of whether a will provides for the contingency of a subsequent marriage must be determined: (1) from the language of the will itself; and (2) without resort to extrinsic evidence of the testator\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Fulton Trust </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. Trowbridge, 126 Conn. 369, 372, 11 A.2d 393 (1940) (execution of will followed by adoption of child; no language in will providing for such contingency); <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>106 Conn. 76, 79-80, 137 A. 17 (1927) (execution of will followed by birth of child; no language in will providing for such contingency); cf. <em>Czepiel </em>v. <em>Czepiel, </em>146 Conn. 439, 442, 151 A.2d 878 (1959) (language in will provided for possible subsequent marriage); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>95 Conn. 194, 196-97, 110 A. 833 (1920) (language in will provided for subsequent birth of child). Applying this standard, we conclude that the trial court should not have admitted the will because, notwithstanding the inferences that the trial court drew from the dates of the marriage license and the will, and from the identity of certain of the named beneficiaries in the will, there was <em>no language in the will </em>providing for the contingency of the subsequent marriage of the decedent. Thus, this will fell on that side of the dividing line encompassing those wills that do not, in and of themselves, provide for such a contingency; <em>see Fulton Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>supra, 372; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>supra, 80; and beyond that side of the line encompassing those wills that do provide for such a contingency. See <em>Czepiel </em>v. <em>Czepiel, </em>supra, 440; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>supra, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">This conclusion does not, however, end our inquiry in this case. In <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>v. <em>Sharon Hospital, </em>188 Conn. 1, 2, 448 A.2d 190 (1982), this court considered the issue of \u201cwhether extrinsic evidence of a mistake by a scrivener of a testamentary instrument is admissible in a proceeding to determine the validity of the testamentary instrument.\u201d In a three to two decision, this court held that such evidence is not admissible. Id., 9. Upon further consideration, we now conclude that the reasons given by the dissent in that case are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>persuasive and apply to the facts of the present case. We, therefore, overrule <em>Connecticut Junior Republic, </em>and hold that if a scrivener\u2019s error has misled the testator into executing a will on the belief that it will be valid notwithstanding the testator\u2019s subsequent marriage, extrinsic evidence of that error is admissible to establish the intent of the testator that his or her will be valid notwithstanding the subsequent marriage. Furthermore, if those two facts, namely, the scrivener\u2019s error and its effect on the testator\u2019s intent, are established by clear and convincing evidence, they will be sufficient to establish that \u201cprovision has been made in such will for such contingency,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 45a-257 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>v. <em>Sharon Hospital, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 9, this court reasserted the familiar rule that, although extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove an intention not expressed in the will itself or to prove a devise or bequest not contained in the will, such evidence is admissible to identify a named devisee or legatee, to identify property described in the will, to clarify ambiguous language in the will, and to prove fraud, incapacity or undue influence. In rejecting the claim that extrinsic evidence should also be admissible to prove a scrivener\u2019s error, the majority relied principally on our existing case law and on the risk of subverting the policy of the statute of wills. Id., 23 <em>(Peters, J., </em>dissenting). The majority acknowledged, however, that, as with any rule of law, time and experience could persuade to the contrary. \u201c[Pjrinciples of law which serve one generation well may, by reason of changing conditions, disserve a later one. . . . Experience can and often does demonstrate that a rule, once believed sound, needs modification to serve justice better.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 17-18. We are now persuaded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>The dissent in that case by Justice Peters and joined by Justice Shea, concluded that it \u201cwould permit extrinsic evidence of a scrivener\u2019s error to be introduced in litigation concerned with the admissibility of a disputed will to probate.\u201d Id., 22. The dissent gave three principal reasons for its conclusion, each of which we consider to be persuasive and each of which applies to this case. See id., 22-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">First, given that extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove that a will was executed by the testator \u201cin reliance on erroneous beliefs induced by fraud, duress, or undue influence\u201d; id., 22; there is no discernible policy difference between that case and a case in which \u201ca will is executed in reliance on erroneous beliefs induced by the innocent error, by the innocent misrepresentation, of the scrivener of a will.\u201d Id., 23. In each instance, \u201cthe testamentary process is distorted by the interference of a third person who misleads the testator into making a testamentary disposition that would not otherwise have occurred.\u201d Id., 22-23. \u201cIn each instance, extrinsic evidence is required to demonstrate that a will, despite its formally proper execution, substantially misrepresents the true intent of the testator.\u201d Id., 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Similarly, in the present case, there is no discernible policy difference between extrinsic evidence offered to show fraud, duress or undue influence, and extrinsic evidence offered to show that a scrivener\u2019s error induced the decedent to execute a will that he believed would survive his subsequent marriage. In both instances, the testamentary process was distorted by the interference of a third person who misled the testator into executing a will that would not otherwise have been executed \u2014 in the present case, a will that would be revoked upon his marriage because it did not contain language providing for the contingency of marriage. Thus, as in the case of fraud, duress or undue influence, extrinsic evidence is required to demonstrate that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>will that the testator executed did not substantially state his true intention.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Second, the dissent recognized that, based on the policy of the statute of wills, the \u201crisk of subversion of the intent of a testator, who cannot personally defend his testamentary bequest, is without doubt a serious concern.\u201d Id., 24. The dissent, however, persuasively underscored the counterbalancing \u201crisk of blindly enforcing a testamentary disposition that substantially misstates the testator\u2019s true intent.\u201d Id. Again drawing on the analogy to the case of fraud, duress or undue influence, the dissent stated that \u201c[h]ad the decedent\u2019s lawyer deliberately and fraudulently altered the second codicil, the relevant extrinsic evidence would unquestionably have been admitted.\u201d Id., 25. The dissent contended that \u201cinnocent misrepresentation is treated as generally equivalent to fraud in terms of its legal consequences.\u201d Id. Therefore, the dissent asserted, the \u201c[statute of [w]ills does not compel enforcement of testamentary dispositions that a testator never intended to make.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Similarly, in the present case, had the decedent\u2019s attorney deliberately and fraudulently, rather than innocently but mistakenly, misrepresented to the decedent that his will would be valid despite his subsequent marriage, it is at least arguable that the beneficiaries of that fraudulent conduct, namely, the heirs-at-law of the decedent who would inherit in the event of his intestacy, would not be permitted to take advantage of that fraud, and that a court of equity could impress a constructive trust on their inheritance. We conclude that, analogously, in this case, the extrinsic evidence should be admissible to establish the decedent\u2019s true intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Third, the dissent examined and rejected the two main objections to the admission of extrinsic evidence of a scrivener\u2019s error. One objection was \u201cthat whatever error the scrivener may have made was validated and ratified by the testator\u2019s act in signing his will.\u201d Id., 26. The dissent responded, correctly in our view, that, although \u201csigning [a] will creates a strong presumption that the will accurately represents the intentions of the testator, that presumption is a rebuttable one.\u201d Id. Similarly, in the present case, although the fact that the decedent signed the will may create a rebuttable presumption that he did not intend it to survive his subsequent marriage, that presumption should be rebut-table by persuasive extrinsic evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The other objection was \u201cthat allowing extrinsic evidence of mistake will give rise to a proliferation of groundless will contests.\u201d Id. The dissent presented a two part response, with which we also agree. First, it noted that, \u201c[i]n the law of contracts, where the parol evidence rule has undergone considerable erosion, this risk has not been found to have been unmanageable. In the law of wills, the risk is limited by the narrowness of the exception that this case would warrant . . . [namely, to] permit the opponent of a will to introduce extrinsic evidence of the error of a scrivener, and [to] require proof of such an extrinsic error to be established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 26-27</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Similarly, in the present case, the admissibility of such extrinsic evidence, in our view, will not prove to be any less manageable than in cases of parol evidence in contract disputes. Furthermore, we would impose the same elevated burden of proof on the proponent of the will in a case such as this. The proponent would have to establish the scrivener\u2019s error by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>We recognize that the dissent\u2019s position in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>would have resulted in the consideration of extrinsic evidence of a scrivener\u2019s error offered for the purpose of <em>preventing </em>admission of a testamentary document to probate, rather than for the purpose <em>o\u00ed procuring </em>such admission, as in the present case. Regardless of that distinction, however, the mistake doctrine advocated by the dissent in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>applies equally to the present case. The dissent in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>phrased the issue in that case as follows: \u201cMust the true intent of the testator be thwarted when, because of the mistake of a scrivener, he has formally subscribed to a written bequest that substantially misstates his testamentary intention?\u201d Id., 22. That is precisely the issue in the present case. The dissent in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>answered that question in the negative, recognizing that evidence of a scrivener\u2019s mistake should be admissible where offered to establish that a written bequest <em>should not be admitted </em>to probate because its execution was the product of a mistake of the scrivener and, therefore, did not embody the disposition intended by the testator. Id., 22-23. Likewise, in the present case, evidence of a scrivener\u2019s mistake should be admissible to establish that a written bequest <em>should be admitted </em>to probate because the disposition provided by the bequest would have obtained, in accordance with the decedent\u2019s intent, but for the scrivener\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Finally, we address one other consideration that was not present in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic, </em>which might be perceived to be present in this case. That is the potential for past reliance by testators on our prior case law. We do not believe that this is a persuasive consideration. It is very unlikely that, in reliance on such case law, any testators executed wills and deliberately omitted language providing for the contingency of marriage in order to be sure that their wills would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>revoked by a subsequent marriage. Moreover, it is very unlikely that any testators, having married after executing such wills, deliberately did not make new testamentary dispositions in reliance on the proposition that their prior wills had been revoked by that subsequent marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, we conclude that the extrinsic evidence offered, if believed, could prove clearly and convincingly that there was a scrivener\u2019s error that induced the decedent to execute a will that he intended to be valid despite his subsequent marriage. The offer of proof indicates that the evidence would be susceptible to an inference by the fact finder that there had been an implied assertion by the scrivener that the will would be valid despite the decedent\u2019s subsequent marriage. This inference could have been bolstered, moreover, by the evidence of the conversations between the decedent and the scrivener shortly before the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">In this opinion KATZ, PALMER and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-257 (a) provides: \u201cIf, after the making of a will, the testator marries or is divorced or his marriage is annulled or dissolved or a child is bom to the testator or a minor child is legally adopted by him, or a child is born as a result of A.I.D. as defined in section 45a-771, to which the testator has consented in accordance with subsection (a) of section 45a-772, and no provision has been made in such will for such contingency, such marriage, divorce, annulment, dissolution, birth or adoption of a minor child shall operate as a revocation of such will, provided such divorce, annulment or dissolution shall not operate as a revocation of such will if the spouse of the testator was not a beneficiary under such will. The revocation of such will by divorce, annulment or dissolution of marriage shall be effective only as to wills executed on and after October 1, 1967.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Section 45a-257 (a) was repealed by 1996 Public Acts, No. 96-95, and, to the extent that \u00a7 45a-257 (a) dealt with the effect of marriage on a will, it has been replaced by General Statutes \u00a7 45a-257a, which provides: \u201cFailure of testator to provide for surviving spouse who married testator after execution of will. Determination of share of estate, (a) If a testator fails to provide by will for the testator\u2019s surviving spouse who married the testator after the execution of the will, the surviving spouse shall receive the same share of the estate the surviving spouse would have received if the decedent left no will unless: (1) It appears from the will that the omission was intentional; or (2) the testator provided for the spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator\u2019s statements, or is reasonably inferred from the amount, of the transfer or other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">\u201c(b) In satisfying a share provided in subsection (a) of this section, devises and legacies made by the will abate in accordance with section 45a-426.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The effective date of \u00a7 45a-257a was January 1, 1997. Therefore, that, statute does not apply to this case because the will in question was executed in 1988. At that time, the applicable statute was General Statutes \u00a7 45-162, which was transferred to \u00a7 45a-257 in 1991. Because that statute remained unchanged until Public Act 96-95, hereafter references to \u00a7 45a-257 are to the 1995 revision of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> The decedent\u2019s other two daughters, Laura Erickson Kusy and Ellen Erickson Gates, did not appeal from the judgment of the trial court.

[O\u2019Brien] would testily that he is an attorney before the Hartford [bar], that he was lor many years prior to the marriage in 1988 the attorney for [the decedent].</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\u201cIn addition to being his attorney on a variety of business and personal matters, he was also a close friend of [the decedent]. He was aware that [the decedent] was courting [the defendant] who became [his wife] and he was invited to their wedding which was scheduled for September 3, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">\u201cAbout one week prior to that time he received a call from [the decedent] saying he and [the defendant] immediately after the wedding were going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>go to New York and then take a Concorde flight to Ireland and they wanted to arrange, as many of us do prior to events like that, for their wills to be drafted prior to the marriage ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cHe gave him instructions that the wills would be identical, that is, that all of his estate was to go to [the defendant]. If [the defendant] should predecease him it should go to, half should go to his children, half to [the defendant\u2019s] children. That [the defendant] should be the administratrix of the will, the executrix, excuse me, the executrix of the will and that she would be appointed guardian of his children, and that [her] will be exactly the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u201cOn Thursday, September 1, two days before the wedding, the two of them went to Hartford and executed the wills. I would offer [the defendant\u2019s] will as a piece of evidence. And I represent to the court that it is a mirror image of [the decedent\u2019s] will that you have admitted as an exhibit. She, like [the decedent], leaves everything to him. If he should predecease her half of her estate goes to his children, half to her children. He appoints her guardian of his children and appoints [her] executor of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">\u201cDuring the course of the execution of the wills there was no conversation whatsoever about the fact that the Saturday marriage would revoke the will that had been drafted on Thursday. The wedding to take place two days later would revoke the will that had been drafted on Thursday, although there was considerable discussion about the marriage itself and the festivities and the guests and things like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">\u201c[O\u2019Brien] would testify that the reason that he did not place in the will any specific mention of the marriage or talk about it at all with [the defendant] or [the decedent] was because in his view when a man executes a will two days before his marriage in which he leaves everything to the woman that he\u2019s about to marry, makes her guardian of his children, makes her administrator of the, executor, executrix of the estate, and if she should predecease him, leaves half of his estate to her kids.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\u201cClearly makes provision in the will for not just a contingency, but the imminent [inevitability] of the marriage that\u2019s going to take place two days later. So he didn\u2019t think there was any necessity] that he had to put in words when it was so clear that it was making\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">\u201cHe would further testily that in June of \u2014 he then became friends, close friends with [the defendant] as well as with [the decedent]. They lived together, he would testify they lived together up until 1995. Then in June of 1995 he received word that [the decedent] was seriously sick. . . . [T]wo or three days after [his] operation [O\u2019Brien] visited him in the hospital. He learned from [the decedent] that [he] was dying and had a terminal disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">\u201c[The decedent] said that he wanted to make sure, he wanted to look at his estate situation and make sure that everything was going to be, was going to go to his wife, [the defendant]. The attorney then returned to his office, checked the will out, made sure that the will said it was going to [the defendant] and so informed [the decedent],</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">\u201cBy Thanksgiving [the decedent\u2019s] condition had deteriorated to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>that he was no longer able to continue functioning in everyday life and he was staying at home being cared for by [the defendant].</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u201cOn February 8, 1996, [O\u2019Brien] would testify he again visited his dying friend and his client. [The defendant] was present throughout the course of this conversation which lasted more than two hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u201cNow much of this conversation was the kind of conversation that Your Honor would expect of one who is visiting a dying friend. They reminisced. They talked about politics. They talked about everything other than the disease for a while.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u201cThen they got onto the topic of his estate. The will itself was taken out of the place where it was kept. They reviewed it. The attorney once again assured the dying man that all of his estate was going to [the defendant],</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">\u201cHe then told the attorney that he wanted to make a separate provision for his children. He wanted the attorney to set up a corporation that would be called Sovereign Electric Company. He gave him a specific description of how the shares should be distributed. Thirteen percent of the shares were to go to each daughter. The attorney did set up that corporation. The shares were distributed to the daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\u201cAnd [the defendant] will testify that she has purchased the shares from the daughters for one hundred thousand dollars each daughter. That is, three hundred thousand dollars for the 39 percent that they received as a result of that. He then would, as Your Honor knows, that was on February 8. On February 22, [the decedent] died.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">\u201c[The defendant], may it please the court, would testify as follows. She is, in 1987 she was a widow. She had four children, T. Kevin, Kathleen, Maureen and Christopher. [The decedent], who would become her husband, had three children, Laura, Ellen and Alicia. They met in the fall of 1987. They courted and they became engaged on February 14, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">\u201cThey obtained a marriage license at the Town Clerk\u2019s Office on August 22, 1988. That actually is a piece of evidence that\u2019s before Your Honor in the form of the Marriage License.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">\u201cThey married in a church ceremony. She would testify that this ceremony was planned many, many months in advance. It was quite elaborate. There were about one hundred and fifty guests. She and [the decedent] acted together in planning all of the events of the wedding.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">\u201cAs the attorney has testified, their plan was to get married on . . . Saturday afternoon and evening after the reception to go to New York, stay in a hotel that night and then fly on the Concorde to Ireland the next day which is exactly what they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">\u201cThe invitations for the wedding and all the plans for the wedding were made for September 3, Saturday, September 3. In talking to [the decedent] they decided that before they flew off to Europe they should get their affairs in order. He made arrangements with his old friend, [O\u2019Brien] in order to get wills drafted. The wills were as I\u2019ve described to Your Honor, mirror wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-16\">\u201cOn two days before the marriage, September 1, Thursday, they went up to [O\u2019Brien\u2019s] office. They conversed about the upcoming wedding. Everyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>was aware that the wedding was going to take place, [O \u2019Brien], [the decedent] and his spouse and they executed the wills. During the course of the execution of the wills not only were, there was never a word concerning the fact that a marriage on Saturday might act to revoke a will that was executed on Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u201cThey did marry on September 3. [O\u2019Brien] was a guest at their wedding. They did fly to Ireland the next day for their honeymoon. They lived happily until June of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cOn June 23, 1995, [the decedent] underwent an operation. Following the operation he was told that he had terminal cancer and was going to die. He was fully aware of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u201cShe was not present during (he first meeting of [O\u2019Brien] with [the decedent] at the hotel. I\u2019m sorry, at the hospital. She was present during the second meeting on February 8, 1996. She, like, [O\u2019Brien] would testify that much of (he conversation that day was the kind of conversation one would expect between a friend and his friend who was dying, but they also made arrangements with respect, made more practical arrangements with respect to [the decedent\u2019s] upcoming death. The will was retrieved. It was reviewed. [O\u2019Brien] assured [the decedent] that his entire estate would pass to his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">\u201cHe then requested, she would testify as [O\u2019Brien] did, that he then requested him to set up a corporation in which the stock would be owned, 13 percent of the stock would be owned by each of his daughters. [O\u2019Brien] did that and distributed the stock to them and as a result, obviously, a corporation in which this kind of proceeding that we\u2019re involved in now is in the background, is not going to be successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\u201cAnd so [the defendant] then paid each of the children, each of [the decedent\u2019s] daughters one hundred thousand dollars apiece for their stock. [She] would testify that because of certain concerns that [the decedent] had about his daughters that he wanted to set up the corporation in the particular way that he set it up and that this was his specific intention with respect to taking care of his daughters after his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">\u201cIf I could have one more minute. And with that offer of proof, may it please the court, I rest my rebuttal of the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\"> The defendant presents her claim as part of a cross appeal. Technically, however, her claim is not properly part of a cross appeal because the defendant was not aggrieved by the judgment of the trial court. Rather, it is a claim concerning an adverse ruling of the trial court that \u201cshould be considered on appeal in the event the appellant is awarded a new trial . . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 63-4 (a) (1) (B). Because we conclude that, on the basis of existing case law, the plaintiff would have been entitled to reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment, and because we conclude that, on the basis of the new case law that we articulate herein, a new trial must be granted, we consider the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> One exception to this rule of evidentiary exclusion is that extrinsic evidence may be admitted to prove a testator\u2019s intent where the language of the will is ambiguous. See, e.g., <em>Fulton Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Conn. 369, 372, 11 A.2d 393 (1940). The defendant does not claim, however, that the language of the will in the present case was ambiguous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> We acknowledge thatpermitting extrinsic evidence of ascrivener\u2019s error will lead to the introduction of extrinsic evidence of intent, which, as we noted previously, is not permitted. For the reasons discussed herein, this common-law exception is no different, however, from the extrinsic evidence of intent permitted in cases alleging fraud, undue influence and duress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b391-9\">BERDON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AI6\">concurring. Although I have some reservation with identifying the error on the part of the attorney as a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error\u201d in this case, I concur in the result reached by the majority. More specifically, I agree that <em>Connecticut Junior Republic </em>v. <em>Sharon Hospital, </em>188 Conn. 1, 448 A.2d 190 (1982), should be overruled. Justice Peters\u2019 dissent in <em>Connecticut Junior Republic, </em>as joined by Justice Shea, points out that the opponent of a will should be allowed \u201cto introduce extrinsic evidence of the error of a scrivener, and [that] . . . proof of such an extrinsic error [must] be established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 26-27. Although \u201cantiquity does not automatically disqualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>common law precedents\u201d; id., 23 (Peters, <em>J., </em>dissenting); our law should serve modem needs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
