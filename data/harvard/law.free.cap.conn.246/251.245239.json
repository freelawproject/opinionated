After this court published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>a written decision resolving that issue; see <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>243 Conn. 485, 705 A.2d 195 (1998); the defendants filed a joint motion to reconsider and to correct the rescript. That motion was granted and, at the same time, this court, sua sponte, expanded the order granting certification to include the issue of whether the Appellate Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 5.1.2 of the Redding zoning regulations was directory rather than mandatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court also ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs on the issue of whether \u00a7 5.1.2 is directory or mandatoiy and to appear for oral argument on that issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The following procedural history is relevant to the issues raised. The named plaintiff,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Richard D. Lauer, took an appeal from a decision by the named defendant, the zoning commission of the town of Redding (commission), granting a special permit to the defendant property owners, Luciano and Debra Angeloni. The trial court issued an order sustaining the appeal 119 days after the trial on the matter had been completed. Thereafter, 143 days after the completion of the trial, the trial court issued an eighteen page memorandum of decision explaining the factual and legal bases for its previous order, namely, that the court had sustained the appeal because the commission had failed to comply with the notice provisions of \u00a7 5.1.2, which the trial court concluded were mandatory rather than directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from that decision claiming that: (1) the judgment of the trial court had been rendered beyond the 120 day period set by statute and, therefore, should be vacated; and (2) the trial court improperly had construed as mandatory \u00a7 5.1.2 of the Redding zoning regulations, which instructed the commission to submit the special permit application to certain town agencies. The Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court concluding that, for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b, judgment is not rendered until a written memorandum setting forth the legal and factual bases for its ultimate conclusion is issued in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 334A,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 6-1, and, therefore, judgment in this case was rendered beyond the 120 day time limitation of \u00a7 51-183b. <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>44 Conn. App. 542, 545, 690 A.2d 893 (1997). Because it would arise on retrial, the Appellate Court also addressed the issue of whether the zoning regulation was mandatory rather than directory and concluded that it was directory. Id., 546-47. We now consider both of those issues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The facts and procedural history relevant to the timeliness issue are set forth in the decision of the Appellate Court. \u201cThe Angelonis obtained a special permit in 1989 to operate a riding academy in a residential zone in Redding. The 1989 permit allowed the owners to board a maximum of twenty-five horses at the academy. On October 23,1991, the owners applied to the commission to amend the special permit, seeking, inter alia, to increase the number of horses from twenty-five to forty. The commission granted the special permit on January 22, 1992. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the granting of the special permit. On April 3, 1995, 119 days after the trial was completed, the trial court issued the following order: \u2018The administrative appeal is sustained. A memorandum will follow.\u2019 On April 10, 1995, the owners moved to set aside the order and for a mistrial, asserting that no judgment was rendered within the 120 day period set forth in ... \u00a7 51-183b. The trial court did not rule on the motion, but, instead, issued its memorandum of decision 143 days after the completion of the trial.\u201d <em>Lauer v. Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\u201cIn past cases interpreting \u00a7 51-183b and its predecessors, we have held that the defect in a late judgment is that it implicates the trial court\u2019s power to continue to exercise jurisdiction over the parties before it.\u201d <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>United Caribbean, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 688, 692, 577 A.2d 1047 (1990); <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Cannon Mills Co., </em>132 Conn. 434, 438, 45 A.2d 120 (1945); <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Douglas &amp; Bro., Inc., </em>121 Conn. 377, 380, 185 A. 70 (1936). \u201cA delay in decision beyond that authorized by the statute makes the decision voidable and, absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>waiver, requires a new trial.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>192 Conn. 601, 603, 472 A.2d 1281 (1984). In the present case, however, an order was issued within the mandatory 120 day period. Therefore, we must decide whether the order of the trial court satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The ultimate issue is one of statutory construction. We must determine whether the order of the trial court constituted a \u201cjudgment\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 51-183b, or whether, as the Appellate Court concluded, a judgment is not rendered for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b unless and until the trial court explains the reasons for its ruling in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 334A.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Our analysis is guided by well established principles of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22, 670 A.2d 851 (1996). We commence our analysis with settled principles of statutory construction designed to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. \u201c \u2018[W]e look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, [and] to the legislative policy it was designed to implement ....\u2019\u201d <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">We begin with the language of the statute. Section 51-183b provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny judge of the Superior Court. . . shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the completion date of the trial . . . .\u201d The language of the statute does not give any specific direction as to what the court must do to \u201crender judgment.\u201d Because the term \u201crender judgment\u201d is undefined and the language of the statute does not illuminate our inquiry, it is necessary to look to other sources for its definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>\u201c \u2018If a statute . . . does not sufficiently define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). A \u201crendition of judgment\u201d is \u201ceffected when [the] trial court in open court declares the decision of the law upon the matters at issue . . . .\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Furthermore, a \u201cjudgment\u201d is the \u201cfinal decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties. . . .\u201d Id. The plaintiff argues that the order of the trial court meets these requirements because the decree resolved the dispute and determined the appeal in his favor. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Our conclusion is further supported by the legislative purpose of \u00a7 51-183b. Section 51-183b was amended \u201cin order to reduce delay and its attendant costs, [and] imposes time limits on the power of a trial judge to render judgment in a civil case. The origin of the section may be traced to chapter 3 of the Public Acts of 1879. <em>Spelke </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>117 Conn. 639, 643, 169 A. 787 (1933).\u201d <em>Waterman </em>v. <em>United Caribbean, Inc., </em>supra, 215 Conn. 691. The 1981 amendment to \u00a7 51-183b shortened the time period allowed forjudges to render judgment from eight months to 120 days from the completion of the trial. See Public Acts 1981, No. 81-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The general purpose of \u00a7 51-183b, therefore, is to reduce delay in the trial courts. This purpose would be frustrated by the requirement that a memorandum of decision be issued within 120 days after completion of trial, a requirement beyond those enumerated by the rules of practice. Moreover, it would appear to be unnecessary. First, a memorandum of decision is most helpful when a case is appealed, and many cases are never appealed. Second, the demand for a memorandum of decision in all cases where judgment is rendered, beyond what is required by the rules of practice, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>further tax the already overburdened trial courts. A trial judge would feel compelled to deliver a memorandum of decision in all cases, even those cases in which an elaborate explanation is not warranted because of the simplicity of the issues, or for other reasons, which could delay other memoranda that truly need to be written. Third, the threat of overloading the docket with new trials because the trial court had lost jurisdiction over the parties when a judgment had been rendered, but when a memorandum of decision had not been issued, would also frustrate the utility of the statute. The purpose of the statute, therefore, would be hampered by the Appellate Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Although we recognize the concern of the Appellate Court, that appellate rights might be compromised, we note that there are provisions in the appellate procedure section of the rules of practice that ameliorate this concern. For example, an appellant may file a motion for an extension of time to appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4040,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 66-1, a motion for articulation or for rectification pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 66-5, or a motion to compel the trial court to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>memorandum of decision pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4059,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 64-1. Therefore, we believe there are sufficient safeguards to protect the rights of potential appellants if this situation should reoccur.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Notwithstanding, the defendants assert that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the term \u201cjudgment\u201d as used in \u00a7 51-183b is informed by Practice Book \u00a7 334A. We decline to read \u00a7 334A into the statute to define the term \u201crender judgment,\u201d because the purpose, text and history behind \u00a7 334A demonstrate that it performs a different function than that performed by \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The overall purpose of Practice Book \u00a7 334A is to instruct the trial court to issue a memorandum of decision to aid the appellate process in those cases in which the judgment is likely to be appealed. This is evidenced by a nearly identical provision in Practice Book \u00a7 4059. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>A memorandum of decision becomes imperative when an appeal is taken because it provides the litigants and the appellate court with the basis of the trial court\u2019s underlying reasoning for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Furthermore, Practice Book \u00a7 334A (a) makes a textual distinction between judgments and decisions; it refers separately to judgments in subdivision (1), and to decisions in subdivisions (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6). See footnote 6 of this opinion. The trial court\u2019s judgment is that reflected in the judgment file, and does not usually include all of the details incorporated into a memorandum of decision. Therefore, the judgment is not necessarily always the same document as the court\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 334A, although adopted only in 1994, is a consequence of Practice Book \u00a7 4059, its appellate counteipart. Section 4059 was adopted in 1979, when the memorandum of decision replaced the required finding. Prior to 1979, the memorandum of decision was relatively unimportant, and instead an elaborate and complicated system of findings was used to provide a mechanism for appellate review. W. Horton, \u201cThe Connecticut Supreme Court \u2014 On Becoming Supreme Again,\u201d 52 Conn. B.J. 45, 51 (1978). The process for findings of facts included requests for findings, proposed draft findings, counterfindings, findings, motions to correct the findings, and the bill of exceptions. Id. This system had been in effect since 1830. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rios, </em>30 Conn. App. 712, 716, 622 A.2d 618 (1993) <em>(O\u2019Connell, J., </em>concurring); M. Tyler, \u201cThe Findings of Facts in Connecticut,\u201d 4 Conn. B.J. 265, 265-67 (1930). This system often caused the trial judge to pore over the transcripts months or years after the trial, causing lengthy delays in taking an appeal. W. Horton, supra, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">In 1979, with the adoption of Practice Book \u00a7 3060B, which became \u00a7 4059, the trial judge, if an appeal was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>taken, was required to state the basis for its decision orally or in a written memorandum of decision. The memorandum of decision, which incorporated all of the factual and legal predicates for the trial court\u2019s decision, supplanted the finding system, expediting appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Today, the rules of practice still contain separate rules directing the preparation of a judgment file, which evidences the fact that the memorandum of decision is not necessarily the same as the judgment of the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 335 through 338, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 6-2 through 6-4. Furthermore, prior to 1979, the judgment provisions were substantially similar to those of today, but the rules on findings were considerably more detailed and no mention was made of the requirement of a memorandum of decision. See Practice Book, 1963, \u00a7\u00a7 260 through 266. Accordingly, it is clear that Practice Book \u00a7 334A performs a different function and purpose than that of \u00a7 51-183b and should not be read into the statute to define the term \u201crender judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Although we encourage trial courts to issue memoranda of decision at the time of rendering judgment, we recognize that under certain circumstances it is permissible to render a judgment and thereafter issue a memorandum of decision. We urge trial courts, however, to be mindful of \u00a7 51-183b, and to render judgments accompanied by a memorandum of decision within 120 days after completion of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">We now turn to the plaintiffs claim that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that \u00a7 5.1.2 of the Redding zoning regulations was directory rather than mandatory. Section 5.1.2 provides in relevant part: \u201cOne copy of the application, including all maps, plans and reports, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>shall be referred within 10 days of receipt, by the Commission, to the following Town agencies with a request for an advisory report: Board of Selectmen, Conservation Commission, Health Department, Planning Commission. Referral shall also be made to the appropriate regional, state or federal agencies where their jurisdiction is involved, and the Commission may require the applicant to furnish additional copies of application materials to meet these requirements. . . .\u201d The plaintiff argues that the Appellate Court incorrectly reversed the trial court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 5.1.2 was mandatory and, therefore, that any action taken in the absence of timely notice to the appropriate agencies was without legal effect. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. . . . Such a statutory provision is one which prescribes what shall be done but does not invalidate action upon a failure to comply. . . . <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>220 Conn. 721, 727, 601 A.2d 507 (1992). A rehable guide in determining whether a statutory provision is directory or mandatory is whether the provision is accompanied by language that expressly invalidates any action taken after noncompliance with the provision. <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>225 Conn. 432, 440, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Section 5.1.2 of the zoning regulations, which is entitled \u201cProcedure\u201d; see <em>Arrieu </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>17 Conn. App. 320, 324, 552 A.2d 445 (1989) (placement in \u201cprocedure\u201d section relevant to mandatory/directory determination); clearly pertains to order, system and dispatch rather than any matter of substance. The essence of the thing to be accomplished by \u00a7 5.1.2 and the related zoning regulations is the ultimate determination of whether the special permit should be issued under the applicable regulations, considering relevant factors such as: traffic concerns; safety from fire, panic, flood, erosion, air pollution, water pollution and other dangers; population density; conservation of property values; the provision of adequate light, air and privacy; and the adequate provision for transportation, water, schools, parks and other public requirements. See Redding Zoning Regs., \u00a7\u00a72.1 through 2.11. The requirement of the provision in \u00a7 5.1.2 of timely notice to certain agencies is simply a matter of convenience designed to facilitate the information gathering and decision-making process, which is fully entrusted to the town zoning commission. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b). Section 5.1.2 places no obligation on the commission to wait for a report from any of the enumerated agencies before proceeding to consider the merits of a special permit application. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (requiring local zoning commission to receive report from inland wetlands agency before issuing special permit in certain circumstances). Therefore, the notice requirement of \u00a7 5.1.2 cannot be said to affect the substance of the application, but rather only its processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Furthermore, as indicated in past cases, it is important to our determination that there is no accompanying language that expressly invalidates any action taken after noncompliance with \u00a7 5.1.2. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 617; <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 440; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 727. The defendants appropriately contrast \u00a7 5.1.2 of the zoning regulations with General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (a), which provides that if a special permit application \u201cinvolves an activity regulated pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, the applicant shall submit an application to the agency responsible for administration of the inland wetlands regulations . . . .\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 8-3c (b), the \u201ccommission shall not render a decision on the application until the inland wetlands agency has submitted a report with its final decision to such commission. In making its decision the zoning commission shall give due consideration to the report of the inland wetlands agency. . . .\u2019\u2019By contrast, \u00a7 5.1.2 contains no language suggesting that any action taken without notice to, or input from, any agency will have any effect on the continuing validity of its decision on a special permit application. We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 5.1.2 is directory rather than mandatory. See <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 617; <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 440; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mansfield Training School, </em>supra, 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed as to the timeliness of the trial court\u2019s judgment, the judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed as to the directory nature of \u00a75.1.2 of the Redding zoning regulations, and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for purposes of considering the plaintiffs remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

I agree with part I of the majority opinion regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the timeliness of the trial court\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, I disagree with part II of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Section 5.1.2 of the Redding zoning regulations (regulations) provides that before the named defendant, the zoning commission of the town of Redding (commission), may establish, alter or enlarge a use subject to a special permit, \u201c[o]ne copy of the application . . . <em>shall </em>be referred within 10 days of receipt, by the Commission, to the following Town agencies with a request for an advisory report: Board of Selectmen, Conservation Commission, Health Department, Planning Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority holds that the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in this regulation is directory rather than mandatory and that, consequently, the commission in this case was not required to send a copy of the application for a special permit to the agencies specified in that section. In so concluding, the majority relies on the following principle of statutory construction: \u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words. . . . Such a statutory provision is one which prescribes what shall be done but does not invalidate action upon a failure to comply.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995). Although I agree that the foregoing is a valid legal principle of statutory construction, I do not agree that it is applicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>What makes the latter principle inapplicable to the present case is the fact that the regulations at issue contain their own express instructions as to how the words employed in the regulations are to be interpreted. It is axiomatic that, before applying a rule of statutory construction, we first must look to the legislation itself \u2014 in this case the regulation \u2014 to determine whether the drafters expressly indicated the meaning to be assigned or the effect to be given to a particular provision of a regulation. \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, we assume that the words themselves express the legislature\u2019s intent and there is no need to look further for interpretative guidance.\u201d <em>Winchester Woods Associates </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 303, 310, 592 A.2d 953 (1991); <em>Stein </em>v. <em>Hillebrand, </em>240 Conn. 35, 40, 688 A.2d 1317 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Article VIII of the regulations specifically provides that the \u201c[w]ords and phrases used in these Regulations have the conventional meanings established by standard dictionaries, except as defined in the following sections.\u201d The sections that follow do not contain a definition of the word \u201cshall.\u201d In accordance with the directive contained in the regulations, therefore, we must look to the common dictionary definition for the meaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in \u00a7 5.1.2. The common dictionary definition of \u201cshall\u201d is \u201cwill have to: must . . . used to express a command or exhortation . . . used in laws, regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The result is that \u201cshall\u201d as used in \u00a7 5.1.2 is clearly mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Furthermore, the interpretation of shall as being mandatory is consistent with the obvious purpose of \u00a7 5.1.2. The purpose of the requirement that the agencies be given notice and an opportunity to comment is to assure that the commission has all the facts available to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and that its decision be an informed one. Facilitating comment from the other agencies is of considerable importance because decisions of the commission have the potential to adversely affect our fragile environment, as the facts of this case demonstrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In this case, the special permit that was granted by the commission allows use of the property as a horse farm housing a maximum of forty horses. One of the bases on which the plaintiffs objected to the issuing of the special permit pertained to the disposal of manure and urine and the effect that disposal would have on a nearby stream and wetland system. A second concern pertained to the danger of increased contamination and pollution of surface and groundwaters relied on by the plaintiffs for domestic use. In response to the initial application for a special permit to operate a horse farm, two of the town\u2019s agencies had commented on the application and expressed concern about the environmental impact associated with granting the permit. The planning commission wrote a letter to the commission \u201cstating its opinion that a horse farm is an appropriate use of land in Redding but that a \u2018more appropriate and less sensitive site should be chosen.\u2019 \u201d The conservation commission wrote to the commission \u201cstating its opinion that use of the land for a riding academy was \u2018not consistent with the mandate of the Conservation Commission to conserve and supervise [Redding\u2019s] natural resources including water resources, nor its original purpose in recommending that [the subject property] remain as one unsubdividable parcel for the protection of the site . . . .\u2019 \u201d It is noteworthy that additional comment by these agencies as well as comment by the board of selectmen and the town health department would have been germane to the commission\u2019s decision on this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In light of the express provisions of the regulations themselves directing that all words be interpreted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>accordance with their conventional dictionary meanings, and the important purposes to be served by \u00a7 5.1.2 that support an interpretation that would make that section mandatory, I would affirm the well reasoned opinion of the trial court concluding that \u00a7 5.1.2 is mandatory rather than directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
