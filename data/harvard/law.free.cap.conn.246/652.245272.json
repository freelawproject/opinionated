The trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>rendered judgment in accordance with such an agreement. Subsequently, the trial court, <em>Alander, J., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>upon review of the judgment, and after concluding that it purported to terminate the surrogate mother\u2019s parental rights, vacated the judgment on the ground that, under the circumstances, the court that had approved the agreement lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so. Because we conclude that approval of the agreement was within the authority of the Superior Court, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The relevant facts and procedural history are undisputed. On January 25, 1994, the petitioner, Mary Doe, signed a surrogacy contract with the named respondent, John Roe, to carry a child fathered by him through artificial insemination. The petitioner further agreed to voluntarily surrender custody of the child to the named respondent and his wife, Jane Roe,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon birth, and to allow for the subsequent adoption of the child by Jane Roe. Jack Roe (child), who was conceived pursuant to this surrogacy contract,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was bom on December 13, 1994. Immediately after the child\u2019s birth, the petitioner turned him over to the respondents in accordance with the parties\u2019 surrogacy contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On April 10, 1995, when the child was almost four months old, the petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking custody of the child. On the same day, the petitioner also filed a declaratory judgment action seeking sole guardianship of the child and a determination that the surrogacy contract was void as against public policy and voidable because it was signed under duress and false pretenses. Thereafter, the respondents filed a counterclaim seeking: (1) specific performance of the surrogacy contract; (2) permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>custody of the child; and (3) an order enjoining the petitioner from attempting to form a parent-child relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">On July 8,1996, the parties reported to Judge Pittman that they had reached an agreement settling all of the outstanding issues raised by the petitioner\u2019s claims and the respondents\u2019 counterclaim. The two part agreement (agreement), which the parties filed with the court, consisted of a stipulation and an open adoption and visitation agreement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that was incorporated by reference into the stipulation. The agreement provided that the petitioner would execute the documents necessary to terminate her parental rights, thereby enabling Jane Roe to adopt the child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In return, the petitioner would receive: (1) visitation rights with the child;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2) access to information concerning the child; and (3) payment for certain legal and medical expenses. The agreement also provided for confidentiality and joint counseling, and set forth the specific terms of visitation by the petitioner. Moreover, the parties agreed to withdraw all existing legal and administrative proceedings against each other.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Judge Pittman canvassed each of the parties to ascertain \u201cthe voluntariness and the fact of everyone\u2019s under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>standing the agreement.\u201d The colloquy was interrupted when the petitioner indicated that she misunderstood the purported finality of the adoption arrangement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A discussion followed regarding whether the petitioner could seek to reopen the adoption in Probate Court if the respondents breached the agreement. Judge Pittman called a recess so the parties could clarify that the adoption of the child would become final after it was ordered by the Probate Court. Following the recess, Judge Pittman renewed her canvass of the parties regarding their understanding of all aspects of the agreement. Judge Pittman, satisfied that the parties understood the implications of the agreement, rendered judgment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in accordance with it, and confirmed the respondents\u2019 continued custody of the child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The following day, July 9, 1996, the respondents filed an application in Probate Court for stepparent adoption of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On March 4, 1997, the respondents filed a motion in Superior Court, seeking to hold the petitioner in contempt for failing to comply with certain terms of the agreement. The respondents claimed that the petitioner had violated provisions of the agreement relating to custody and visitation, and that she had attempted to revoke her consent to the termination of her parental rights, also in breach of the agreement. With respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to the termination issue, the respondents sought an order from the court directing the petitioner to affirm her consent to the termination of her parental rights and enjoining her from contesting the termination proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">On May 27, 1997, the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. She claimed that, by rendering the 1996 judgment relating to the execution of termination documents, Judge Pittman, in effect, had sought to terminate her parental rights. Relying on <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. Lucas, 182 Conn. 545, 549-50, 438 A.2d 755 (1980), the petitioner asserted that the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>lacked jurisdiction to render the 1996 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Judge Alander held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on June 9, 1997. At the hearing, the respondents withdrew that portion of their contempt motion that sought an order requiring the petitioner to consent to the termination of her parental rights. The respondents, however, pressed their motion insofar as it sought enforcement of the provisions of the agreement relating to custody and visitation. Judge Alander concluded that Judge Pittman, in rendering the 1996 judgment, had intended to finalize the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights, a matter over which the Superior Court, under the circumstances, lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Although it is undisputed that the custody and visitation issues were within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, Judge Alander also declined to enforce those provisions of the agreement on the ground that they could not be severed from the provisions dealing with the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights. The custody and visitation provisions, Judge Alander stated, were \u201cafterthought^]\u201d to an agreement concerned primarily with termination and adoption. Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Judge Alander denied the respondents\u2019 motion for contempt and vacated the 1996 judgment in its entirety.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The respondents appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, <em>Alander, J., </em>vacating the 1996 judgment. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">On appeal, the respondents and the child\u2019s attorney claim, first, that the trial court, <em>Pittman, </em>J., had jurisdiction to render a judgment incorporating an executory agreement to terminate parental rights and to undertake adoption proceedings in the Probate Court. Accordingly, they ask this court to fully reinstate the 1996 judgment. Alternatively, the respondents claim that, even if the trial court, <em>Pittman, </em>J., did not have jurisdiction to render a judgment incorporating the parties\u2019 agreement regarding the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights, the custody and visitation provisions of the agreement were severable from the termination provisions and, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the trial court, <em>Pittman, J. </em>As to those portions of the 1996 judgment, the respondents claim that General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> prevents the petitioner from opening or setting aside the 1996 judgment because more than four months have elapsed since it was rendered. Consequently, in the event that we affirm Judge Alander\u2019s decision to vacate the portions of the agreement relating to the termination of parental rights, the respondents seek reversal of Judge Alander\u2019s decision with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to the those portions of the agreement dealing with custody and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The petitioner counters that Judge Alander properly vacated the 1996 judgment. Specifically, she asserts, and the respondents do not contest, that there are two, and only two, statutorily authorized vehicles for terminating parental rights, namely: (1) a petition to the Probate Court pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 45a-715, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-349, \u00a7 4;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) a direct petition to the Superior Court on behalf of a child in the custody of the commissioner of children and families pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-112, as amended by Public Acts 1995, No. 95-238, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>182 Conn. 550.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She argues, further, that because an integral part of the 1996 judgment purported to effectuate a termination of parental rights, and because that termination was not effectuated pursuant to either one of the two statutorily authorized vehicles, the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>lacked subject matter jurisdiction to effect such a termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">We conclude that the 1996 judgment incorporating the parties\u2019 agreement did not terminate the petitioner\u2019s parental rights and, accordingly, the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to render the 1996 judgment. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court, <em>Alander, J., </em>vacating the 1996 judgment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">A determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. \u201cWhen . . . the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rich-Taubman Associates </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>236 Conn. 613, 618, 674 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>805 (1996); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> formerly Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . Jurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. ... A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Demar v. Open Space &amp; Conservation Commission, </em>211 Conn. 416, 423-24, 559 A.2d 1103 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">There is no dispute that the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>had subject matter jurisdiction over the generic procedural vehicles that gave rise to the 1996 judgment. The causes of action before that court were presented in a writ of habeas corpus action and a declaratory judgment action. Both of these actions are within the statutorily defined jurisdiction of the Superior Court. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-l (8)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and 52-29 (a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The petitioner claims, nevertheless, that the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>lacked jurisdiction to approve an agreement that requires a surrogate mother to accede to termination of her parental rights in Probate Court, citing <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 545, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>in support of her position. The petitioner\u2019s claim is predicated on her underlying contention that Judge Pittman, in rendering the 1996judgment, effectuated the termination of her parental rights. Because we disagree with the petitioner\u2019s underlying contention, we reject her jurisdictional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\"><em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 545, is the leading case on the limits of Superior Court jurisdiction over the termination of parental rights. The <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>controversy arose out of a unique factual scenario that we observed was likely to occur \u201cperhaps once in a generation\u201d: the separation of children from their parents during a war. Id., 546. The plaintiff, a Vietnamese mother, gave up two of her children for adoption immediately before the northern Vietnamese army invaded Saigon, presumably in an effort to save them. Id., 547-48. She signed a document relinquishing her parental rights to a private adoption agency, which arranged for the defendant, an American, to adopt the two children. Id., 548. When the plaintiff eventually arrived in the United States, she began efforts to regain custody of her children. Id., 549. The plaintiff sought to abrogate the purported relinquishment document in the Connecticut courts. See id. The trial court found that the plaintiffs relinquishment of her parental rights in Vietnam was voluntary and irrevocable. Id. \u201cThe court then applied the [statutorily mandated] \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 test . . . and ruled that the children should remain with [the defendant].\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">On appeal to this court, we determined that \u201c[t]he relinquishment document signed by the plaintiff did not terminate the plaintiffs parental rights under Connecticut law. Even if the relinquishment were irrevocable under Vietnamese law, we would not accord comity to it.\u201d Id., 550. We concluded, however, that the trial court\u2019s ruling itself, that is, its finding that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>relinquishment was irrevocable, terminated her parental rights. Id. We noted that, in Connecticut, the sole vehicles for terminating parental rights were by decree of the Probate Court or by order of the juvenile division of the Superior Court in a proceeding brought by the commissioner of children and youth services, now the commissioner of children and families. Id. Because neither procedure was followed in the <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>case, we concluded that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the plaintiffs parental rights. Id., 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">By contrast, in this case, the 1996 judgment Judge Pittman rendered did not, by itself, alter the petitioner\u2019s parental status. Although the petitioner had placed the issue of the validity of the surrogacy contract before the court in her declaratory judgment action filed on April 10, 1995, that issue, together with all the other pending issues, was subsumed in the agreement submitted to Judge Pittman by the parties. In the agreement, the petitioner promised to <em>consent to </em>the termination of her parental rights. The transcript of the July 8, 1996 hearing before Judge Pittman reveals the parties\u2019 awareness of the fact that the actual termination of parental rights, a necessary precursor to adoption, was <em>not </em>effectuated immediately by the 1996 judgment, but, instead, would happen, if at all, sometime in the future.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In canvassing the parties at the 1996 hearing, Judge Pittman confirmed only that the parties <em>understood </em>the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Judge Pittman did not purport to make a final determination regarding the termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights and the adoption. Both of these matters remained to be resolved by the Probate Court. Accordingly, Judge Pittman did not make a finding regarding the best interests of the child because that determination was to be made by the Probate Court in connection with its resolution of the petition for the termination of parental rights. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (f) (l).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although, under the terms of the 1996 judgment, the petitioner has agreed to consent to the termination of her parental rights in Probate Court, that court must make an independent determination whether termination is in the best interests of the child. Furthermore, the child\u2019s attorney will have an opportunity to express his or her view regarding whether termination is in the best interests of the child. Consequently, we know of no reason why the parties were precluded from agreeing to settle their claims in the maimer in which they did, nor are we aware of any reason why the court lacked authority to accept the parties\u2019 agreement in settlement of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the 1996 judgment did not effect a termination of the petitioner\u2019s parental rights. It merely approved an executory agreement between the parties.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The fact that the agreement included a promise to consent to the termination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>parental rights in the Probate Court did not deprive the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>had subject matter jurisdiction to render the 1996 judgment in accordance with the agreement. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the trial court, <em>Alander, J., </em>vacating the 1996 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> Jane Roe also is a respondent in this action.
