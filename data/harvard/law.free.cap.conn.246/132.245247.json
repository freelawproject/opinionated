App. 616, 700 A.2d 79 (1997). The defendant claims that, by classifying larceny from the person as a class C felony, the penal statutes violate his equal protection rights because the allegedly more serious offense of simple robbery is classified as only a class D felony. The state argues that this classification scheme is rational, and therefore constitutional. We agree with the state and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>The Appellate Court stated the facts that the jury reasonably could have found, as follows. \u201cOn February 19, 1995, the victim, Angel Rivera, was walking on Capitol Avenue in Hartford when he was approached by the defendant. When the defendant asked Rivera if he was a gang member, Rivera responded that he was not. The defendant then demanded that Rivera remove his coat and give it to him. Rivera complied and the defendant ran away with the coat. Thereafter, Rivera returned home and told his mother, Hilda Cordero, that the defendant had taken his coat. Cordero called the police and reported the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u201cThe next day, Rivera and Cordero were on their way to the Greater Hartford Community Center when they observed the defendant on the comer of Albany Avenue in Hartford. The defendant was wearing the coat that he had taken from Rivera the previous day. Subsequently, Rivera and Cordero drove to the community center, telephoned the police and reported that they had seen the defendant wearing Rivera\u2019s coat. Officer Dennis O\u2019Connor of the Hartford police department, who responded to the call, went to the community center, interviewed Rivera and then proceeded to the comer of Albany Avenue where he saw the defendant. O\u2019Connor placed the defendant in his cruiser and drove him back to the community center. Rivera then identified the defendant as the man who had taken his coat, and O\u2019Connor seized the coat the defendant was wearing as evidence and placed him under arrest.\u201d Id., 617-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The state charged the defendant with one count of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and one count of larceny from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the person, in violation of \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3). The jury found the defendant not guilty of robbery in the first degree, but guilty of larceny from the person. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, and sentenced the defendant to an eight year term of imprisonment, with execution suspended after five years, and five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court. The defendant claimed \u201cthat [larceny from the person] is a crime of a less serious nature than [simple robbery] because [larceny from the person] does not involve the element of the use or the threat of immediate use of physical force, and that, because the penal statutes assign a greater penalty to larceny [from the person], a class C felony, than they do to [simple robbery], a class D felony, they violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 618-19.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Appellate Court rejected this claim, stating: \u201cBy classifying [larceny from the person] as a class C felony, the legislature has recognized its serious nature and has classified it accordingly. . . . [W]e conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the legislature\u2019s classification of [larceny from the person] as a class C felony is irrational or unreasonable.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 619-20. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The defendant reiterates the claim that he made before the Appellate Court, namely, that the classification in \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3) of larceny from the person as a class C felony, punishable by a maximum of ten years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>imprisonment; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> violates his equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. That classification violates his equal protection rights, he claims, because the assertedly more serious offense of simple robbery is classified in \u00a7 53a-136 as a class D felony, punishable by only five years imprisonment. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He claims that simple robbery is a more serious offense than larceny from the person because the former necessarily involves the use or threat of immediate use of physical force, whereas the latter, in certain circumstances, may not involve the use or threat of immediate use of force. The defendant claims that \u201cthe highest constitutional standard of strict scrutiny\u201d should apply to review of this classification scheme because it affects the length <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of his imprisonment and, therefore, directly impinges on his fundamental right of liberty. Alternatively, he argues that if rational basis scrutiny applies to his claim, the classification cannot be supported on any rational basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The state claims that rational basis analysis governs the defendant\u2019s equal protection challenge. Furthermore, the state argues that the classification of larceny from the person as a class C felony, while simple robbery is classified as a class D felony, passes the rational basis test because the legislature reasonably could have concluded that, under some circumstances, the former is a more serious offense than the latter. Moreover, the state contends, the legislature rationally could have concluded that larceny from the person warranted a more severe sentence on the basis of the ease with which the crime potentially can be committed. We agree with the state and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">As an initial matter, we note that the defendant, as he conceded at oral argument before this court, has offered no independent analysis of his equal protection claim under the state constitution. Therefore, \u201cwe limit our review to the relevant federal constitutional claim.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>225 Conn. 528, 543 n.20, 626 A.2d 244 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 674 n.2, 701 A.2d 1 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 133 n.77, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S.

First, in general, as in any constitutional challenge to the validity of a statutory scheme, the \u201cstatutory scheme] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>is presumed constitutional . . . and [t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.

Thus, the analytical \u201cpredicate [of consideration of an equal protection claim] is a determination of who are the persons similarly situated.\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 473, 556 A.2d 145 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">\u201cThe equal protection clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages [between such similarly situated persons] .... <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>[200 Conn. 562, 577-78, 512 A.2d 893 (1986)]. ... To determine whether a particular classification violates the guarantees of equal protection, the court must consider the character of the classification; the individual interests affected by the classification; and the governmental interests asserted in support of the classification. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972). . . . <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 595, 560 A.2d 444 (1989). Where . . . the classification at issue neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect group it will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis. <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>[169 Conn. 540, 543, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975)]; see also <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 270, 93 S.

Rational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>basis review is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification .... <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>[supra, 225 Conn. 536]. [I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 877, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">We begin by determining \u201cthe standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 756, 687 A.2d 506 (1997). We conclude that rational basis review applies to the defendant\u2019s claim because the statute neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect class.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The defendant has not claimed that the statute impinges on a suspect class, nor is there a basis for such a claim. Rather, as in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 464-65, 111 S. Ct. 1919, 114 L. Ed. 2d 524 (1991), the defendant argues \u201cthat the right to be free from deprivations of liberty as a result of arbitrary sentences is fundamental, and therefore the statutory provision at issue may be upheld only if the [government has a compelling interest in the classification in question.\u201d The Supreme Court in <em>Chapman </em>rejected that claim, however, stating: \u201c[W]e have never subjected the criminal process to this sort of truncated analysis, and we decline to do so now. Every person has a fundamental right to liberty in the sense that the [g]ovemment may not punish him unless and until it proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a criminal trial conducted in accordance with the relevant constitutional guarantees. . . . But a person who has been so convicted is eligible for, and the court may impose, whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense, so long as that penalty is not cruel and unusual . . . and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>so long as the penalty is not based on an arbitrary distinction . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 465. As an interpretation of the federal constitution by the United States Supreme Court, this holding necessarily governs the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that rational basis analysis governs the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We next undertake the analytical \u201cpredicate [of consideration of an equal protection claim, namely] . . . a determination of who are the persons similarly situated.\u201d <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 473; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 188, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993) (\u201c[w]e disagree with the defendant\u2019s claim because the two groups are not similarly situated, as is required in an equal protection claim\u201d). The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated upon a comparison between himself, as one who has committed larceny from the person, and those who have committed simple robbery. In our view, there are two difficulties with the defendant\u2019s attempt to base an equal protection claim on this comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>First, simple robbery and larceny from the person constitute two separate and distinct crimes. The defendant implicitly conceded this point at oral argument before this court when he acknowledged that a defendant who has committed acts satisfying the elements of both crimes could be convicted of and sentenced for both offenses, without violating the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, in our view, those who commit simple robbery and those who commit larceny from the person constitute two separate and distinct legal classes and, therefore, necessarily are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Second, the defendant does not even attempt to claim that the two classes are similarly situated. His claim, rather, is that those who, like him, have perpetrated larceny from the person have committed a <em>less </em>serious crime than those who have taken property through the use or threat of immediate use of force, and that, therefore, his class deserves a <em>less </em>serious penalty than the latter class. Thus, rather than challenging disparate treatment vis-a-vis some other similarly situated class, the defendant really is claiming that the penal statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>are structured arbitrarily and unfairly as between two distinct, differently situated classes, resulting in arbitrary and unfair treatment to his class.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim, thus, is ill-suited to the framework of equal protection analysis. In our view, as a matter of analytical categorization, it would have been brought more appropriately as a substantive due process claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 749 (\u201c[t]he guarantee of substantive due process requires that a law be reasonable, rather than arbitrary or capricious, and that its operation has a real and substantial relation to the object to be obtained\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 500 U.S. 465 (in choosing to address defendant\u2019s claim that prison sentence was unconstitutional as a due process issue, instead of an equal protection issue, court stated: \u201cin this context ... an argument based on equal protection essentially duplicates an argument based on due process\u201d [citation omitted]). As we often have done when confronted with ill conceived equal protection claims, however, we choose to proceed in the framework of equal protection analysis by \u201c[assuming arguendo that the two categories of defendants identified by the defendant are similarly situated with respect to the [statutory scheme] . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 763; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 740 (\u201ceven if we assume that the two categories of offender identified by the defendant . . . are similarly situated with respect to the statute, there is more than an adequate rational basis for treating them differently\u201d); <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 755 (after concluding that two classes claimant sought to compare were not similarly situated, in order to continue with equal protection analysis court stated: \u201c[nevertheless, we will assume for the purposes of this case that . . . [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>classes] are similarly situated for equal protection purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Doing so allows us to engage in a rational basis analysis that, for all material purposes, is indistinguishable from the analysis in which we would engage pursuant to a due process claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 750 (test in rational basis review under substantive due process doctrine is whether \u201cthe challenged policy [or statutory scheme] has [a] reasonable relationship to any legitimate state purpose\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 756 (under rational basis equal protection review, \u201c[i]f the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 536 (\u201c[r]ational basis [review under federal constitution\u2019s equal protection clause] is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker . . . and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s decision to classify larceny from the person as a class C felony, while classifying simple robbery as a class D felony, is supported by a rational basis. The defendant implicitly acknowledges the legitimacy of the legislature\u2019s interest \u2014 as a part of its general objective of protecting the public welfare \u2014 in establishing penalties for crimes, generally, and in assigning more severe penalties to more serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>offenses, specifically. His claim, rather, is that the classifications at issue do not rationally serve that interest. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In our view, the legislature reasonably could have concluded that, as a categorical matter, larceny from the person is a more serious offense than simple robbery, and therefore warrants a more severe penalty. As the state points out, each crime is an aggravated form of larceny. The differentiating factor is the nature of the aggravating characteristic of each offense. \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the second degree [by taking from the person] when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and ... (3) <em>the property, regardless of its nature or value, is taken from the person of another </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>174 Conn. 129, 134, 384 A.2d 340 (1977) (\u201clarceny from the person requires an actual trespass to the person of the victim\u201d). In contrast, a person is guilty of simple robbery in violation of \u00a7 53a-136 \u201cwhen, in the course of committing a larceny, <em>he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person </em>for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133. Thus, the distinguishing characteristic of larceny from the person is that the property is taken from the person of the victim; the distinguishing characteristic of simple robbery is that force or the threat of immediate force is used to facilitate the taking\u2014 whether the property is taken from the person or not. In our view, the legislature rationally could have concluded that the \u201ctrespass to the person of the victim\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowe, </em>supra, 134; that inheres in larceny from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the person potentially is a source of greater harm than the force or threat of force that characterizes a simple robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">As the state has noted, such a trespass to the person rationally could be viewed as a serious concern because: the close proximity can lead to confrontation and escalating violence; a risk of injury invariably accompanies the physical contact; and the invasion of the person, especially on the street or in some other public setting \u2014 where the legislature might reasonably have believed the crime most often occurs \u2014 is a degrading, humiliating and frightening experience. Indeed, the legislature\u2019s evident belief that the invasion of the person is a serious potential source of harm finds support in the decisions of the appellate tribunals of this state. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. Crowe, supra, 174 Conn. 134 (\u201c[bjecause of the trespass to the person, [larceny from the person] is a serious crime in itself so that the value of the property stolen does not enter into the magnitude of the crime\u201d); <em>State </em>v. Arena, 33 Conn. App. 468, 486, 636 A.2d 398 (1994), aff'd, 235 Conn. 67, 663 A.2d 972 (1995) (\u201c[t]he stealing of property from the person has been from an early period under the English statutes treated as a much graver and more heinous offense than ordinary or common theft \u2014 partly . . . because of the greater liability of endangering the person or life of the victim\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The legislature reasonably could have concluded that these elements of harm or potential harm outweigh any concerns regarding the harm associated with the force, or threat of force, in a simple robbery. In this regard, it is essential to note that the force used or threatened in a simple robbery is typically of a relatively low level. That is because, pursuant to the statutory scheme governing robbery offenses, the degree of the offense and, correspondingly, the maximum sentence, advance as greater force is used or threatened. As noted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>state, when a robbery involves more than one perpetrator, the use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument or deadly weapon, or results in serious injury to the victim, it constitutes a first or second degree robbery, and is classified as a class B or class C felony punishable by twenty or ten years imprisonment, respectively. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134, 53a-135 and 53a-35a.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the force used or threatened in a typical simple robbery does not involve any sort of weapon, and is perpetrated by a single assailant. At its mildest, such force conceivably could involve no more than a threat of a pinch, a scratch or a slap. We believe that the legislature reasonably could have concluded that force, or the threat of force, at this level is less offensive than the trespass on the person inherent in a typical larceny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>from the person such as purse snatching or other \u201cgrab and run\u201d thefts.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In support of his claim, the defendant adduces hypothetical scenarios featuring conceivable simple robberies that are more serious than conceivable larcenies from the person. That such scenarios can be envisioned, however, does not avail the defendant. \u201c[Cjourts are compelled under rational-basis review to accept a legislature\u2019s generalizations even when there is an imperfect fit between means and ends. A classification does not fail rational-basis review because it is not made with mathematical nicety or because, in practice, it results in some inequality. . . . The problems of government are practical ones and may justify, if they do not require, rough accommodations . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 509 U.S. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Moreover, as the state points out, pursuant to its general objective of protecting the welfare of the public, the legislature also has a legitimate interest in deterring crime by setting more severe penalties for crimes that the legislature reasonably perceives as being more easily committed than other crimes, regardless of the relative seriousness of the prohibited conduct. When confronted with an equal protection challenge to a statutory scheme that assigned the same penalty to the crime of possession with intent to distribute marijuana as was assigned to possession with intent to distribute other, allegedly more dangerous drugs \u2014 namely, amphetamines and barbiturates \u2014 we stated that \u201c[i]n setting penalties, <em>[the legislature] is not limited to an assessment of harm. </em>Even if barbiturates and amphetamines pose greater health hazards than marijuana, [the legislature] is entitled to conclude that. . . such penal puiposes as <em>general deterrence </em>will be appropriately served by such a penalty.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rao, </em>171 Conn. 600, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>605, 370 A.2d 1310 (1976); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>19 F.3d 93, 97 (2d Cir. 1994) (in rejecting equal protection challenge to federal statutory scheme providing higher penalty for possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine than powder cocaine, court identified as one of rational bases upholding scheme \u201cgreater accessibility\u201d of crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lattimore, </em>974 F.2d 971, 975 (8th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1020, 113 S. Ct. 1819, 123 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1993) (\u201cthe ease with which drug dealers can carry and conceal\u201d crack cocaine constituted rational basis for more severe penalty for possession with intent to distribute it, compared to powder cocaine); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cyrus, </em>890 F.2d 1245, 1248 (D.C.

[a]nd it has experienced an explosion of popularity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Comparable concerns regarding the ease with which the crime can be committed rationally could have supported the legislature\u2019s decision to penalize larceny from the person as a class C felony, while penalizing simple robbery as only a class D felony. The legislature reasonably could have concluded that a number of typical characteristics render typical larcenies from the person, such as purse snatching, particularly easy to commit, including: the fact that a purse can be easily grasped and pulled away from its owner; the fact that the crime can be committed in an instant; the fact that the peipetrator often can make a speedy getaway because the crime is committed on the run; and the fact that no verbal interaction with the victim is required in order to complete the crime. Indeed, such a conclusion finds support in the decisions of the appellate tribunals of this state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>supra, 33 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Conn. App. 486 (\u201c[t]he stealing of property from the person has been from an early period under the English statutes treated as a much graver and more heinous offense than ordinary or common theft \u2014 partly by reason of the ease with which it could be perpetrated and the difficulty of guarding against it\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, the legislature reasonably could have concluded that a typical simple robbery lacks most of these characteristics and, therefore, is generally more difficult to commit, thereby warranting a lesser penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The defendant notes that when the current Penal Code was enacted in 1969, robbery in the third degree was a class D felony as it is today, while larceny from the person was classified as larceny in the third degree and was a class B misdemeanor punishable by a maximum penalty of six months in prison. See Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7\u00a7 126, 138. The defendant claims that \u201c[t]he subsequent evolution of the offense of [larceny from the person] into a class C felony punishable by ten years in prison is not even commented on in the legislative history\u201d of the relevant public acts \u2014 namely, \u00a7 8 of No. 73-639 of the 1973 Public Acts, which categorized larceny from the person as second degree larceny, which at the time was a class D felony; and \u00a7 2 of No. 82-271 of the 1982 Public Acts, which classified second degree larceny, including larceny from the person, as a class C felony. The defendant claims that this alleged absence of any explanation from the legislature as to its reasoning in classifying larceny from the person as a class C felony precludes this court from concluding that that classification is based upon a rational basis. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">First, contrary to the defendant\u2019s representations, the legislative history is not devoid of indications of the legislature\u2019s reasoning in classifying larceny from the person as a class C felony. Specifically, consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>our earlier analysis, the legislative history of Public Act 82-271 suggests that in raising the classification of larceny in the second degree, including larceny from the person, from a class D felony to a class C felony, the legislature strove to create the proper deterrent effect. See 25 S. Proc., Pt. 10, 1982 Sess., p. 3063, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr. (\u201c[t]his [b]ill is really, without going into great detail, what it really does is take into consideration . . . the various types of crimes that are prosecuted, making sure that those who are offending and need more strong deterrent [e]ffects, the penalties are increased, and the ones where there is not much activity decreased\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Moreover, even if there were no relevant legislative history, the defendant\u2019s argument would fail. \u201cIn making this claim, the [defendant] misconceives the appropriate standard for reviewing an equal protection challenge to legislation that does not infringe on a fundamental right or affect a suspect class. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>[505 U.S. 1, 15, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992)]. [T]he Equal Protection Clause does not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification. Id. This court\u2019s review requires only that [some puipose or rationale] may conceivably or may reasonably have been the puipose or policy of the relevant decisionmaker. Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 539-40. Because we have already identified two rationales\u2014 namely, punishing more severely a more serious offense, and establishing a level of deterrence commensurate with the ease of commission of the crime \u2014 that conceivably could have constituted a rational basis for the legislature\u2019s decision to penalize larceny from the person more severely than simple robbery, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>We also reject the defendant\u2019s argument that <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>198 Conn. 671, 504 A.2d 1053 (1986), governs the present case. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the defendant had been convicted of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (C).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As a class A felony, that crime was punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 675. In accordance with that mandatory minimum sentence, the trial court had refused to consider suspension of the defendant\u2019s sentence at any point prior to the completion of ten years of incarceration. Id., 673-74. On appeal, the defendant claimed that this mandatory minimum sentence should not apply to him because, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92a,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a person guilty of the more serious crime of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm would face only a one year minimum sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>supra, 673-74. After examining the relevant legislative history, we concluded that the discrepancy was due to a \u201clegislative error that mistakenly assignjed] a lesser penalty to a greater crime.\u201d Id., 677. We noted that a \u201cconstitutional quagmire . . . would confront <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>us\u201d; id., 680; if we attempted to apply that irrational sentencing structure. Therefore, we interpreted the relevant statutes such that the provisions in \u00a7 53a-92a that provided the lesser penalty applied to both the lesser and the greater crime, and we remanded the case for resentencing in accordance with that interpretation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\"><em>Jenkins </em>is distinguishable from the present case for two reasons. First, as the state points out, \u201cthere can be no question that kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm is a more serious crime than kidnapping in the first degree. The only difference between the two crimes is that one has an additional element of the use of a firearm. Indeed, kidnapping in the first degree is a lesser included offense of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm.\u201d Under those circumstances, we simply could not discern a rational basis for the discrepant sentencing scheme. In contrast, as we have explained previously, in the present case the defendant\u2019s claim is based on a comparison between the sentences for two separate and distinct crimes, and, thus, there is ample scope for discovery of a rational basis for the different penalties for each offense. Second, in contrast to the situation in <em>Jenkins, </em>there is no indication that the legislative scheme at issue in the present case is the product of a legislative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Similarly, <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 511 A.2d 321 (1986), does not support the defendant\u2019s claim. In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>the defendant had been found guilty of the crime of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (l),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a class A felony. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 285. The trial court imposed the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment, \u201cindicating that, in its view, the statutory scheme afforded it no discretion\u201d to suspend any portion of that sentence. Id. On appeal the defendant claimed that his sentence was unconstitutionally arbitrary and irrational because, under the rule established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1985), a trial court properly could suspend the mandatory sentence provided by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for arson murder. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 285-86. Citing <em>Jenkins, </em>we concluded that it would be arbitrary and irrational for the defendant, \u201cwho acted with the less culpable intent and who caused a less serious result than a defendant who commits arson murder [to] receive the greater penalty \u2014 a mandatory nonsuspendible ten year minimum term.\u201d Id., 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Like <em>Jenkins, O\u2019Neill </em>is distinguishable from the present case. Similar to the situation in <em>Jenkins, </em>there can be no question that arson murder is a more serious offense than first degree arson \u201cbecause arson murder involves both arson and [causing] a death\u201d in the course of the arson. Id. Therefore, it was impossible to conceive of any rational basis for assigning a more serious penalty to first degree arson than to arson murder. In contrast, in the present case, because of the entirely distinct nature of larceny from the person and simple robbery, as we have explained, rational bases for assigning a more severe penalty to the former readily can be conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Finally, we also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the classification of larceny from the person as a class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>C felony, while simple robbery is classified as only a class D felony, is arbitrary and irrational because the same conduct can, in certain situations, constitute either offense. This argument seems to be based on the erroneous assumption that an assailant who engages in conduct that satisfies the elements of both larceny from the person and simple robbery can be convicted of and sentenced for only one of those offenses. As noted, however, the defendant has acknowledged that these two crimes constitute two separate and distinct offenses, and that such an assailant legitimately could be convicted of and sentenced for both crimes. See footnote 10 of this opinion. In light of this acknowledgment, the defendant\u2019s contention amounts to the claim that whenever a single course of conduct potentially constitutes more than one offense, all of those offenses must receive the same penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">This assertion clashes with our decisions upholding, in the face of challenges based on the prohibition against double jeopardy, varying sentences pursuant to convictions of different offenses arising out of the same act or transaction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, if accepted, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>thrust upon the legislature the overwhelming burden of anticipating all instances of conceivable overlap in the offenses delineated in the penal statutory scheme, and designing the system such that the same level of penalty applied to any such potentially overlapping offenses. Although we believe that any penal system designed under such a rule would give rise to an unending stream of bizarre results, rather than attempting to enumerate such results, it suffices to say that such a burden is completely inconsistent with rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the second degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and ...
