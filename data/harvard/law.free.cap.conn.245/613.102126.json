The principal issue in this certified appeal is whether an owner-operator of a taxicab qualifies as an employee of the taxicab company with which he contracted to provide taxicab service.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">The plaintiff, Janet Hanson, the surviving spouse of Allen Hanson (decedent), filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim to recover survivor benefits for the death of the decedent while he was driving a taxicab in accordance with his written agreement with the defendants, Transportation General, Inc. doing business as Metro</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Taxi Service (Metro), and Hartford Insurance Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The compensation commissioner for the third district (commissioner) dismissed Hanson\u2019s claim as a result of his finding that, on the date of the decedent\u2019s death, he had been an independent contractor and not an employee of Metro. Hanson appealed to the compensation review board (board), which affirmed the decision of the commissioner. That decision was then affirmed by the Appellate Court. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>45 Conn. App. 441, 447, 696 A.2d 1026 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We granted Hanson\u2019s petition for certification to consider the merits of her claim for compensation, either under a proposed \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test or under the existing \u201cright to control\u201d test. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 914, 914-15, 701 A.2d 329 (1997). We also agreed to determine Hanson\u2019s ancillary evidentiary claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court outlines the basic facts. \u201c[Metro] . . . operated a fleet of taxicabs through the use of both owner-operator and lease agreements. Drivers could either lease or purchase cabs from [Metro]. The decedent, under an owner-operator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>agreement, drove a Metro [cab] from 1987 until he was murdered while operating a Metro [taxicab] on April 16, 1990. Under the terms of [Metro\u2019s] standard owner-operator agreement, [Metro] held legal title to the [taxicab] and the owner-operator maintained a beneficial ownership.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon the termination of the relationship, which could be done by either party after forty-eight hours notice, legal title [to the taxicab] would be transferred back to the owner-operator. In return for the weekly payment by the owner-operator of \u2018stand dues\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the approximate amount of $425, plus an additional $100 per week if a second driver was used, [Metro], under a certificate issued to it by the department of transportation, allowed the owner-operator the right to operate a taxicab. [Metro] required the owner-operator to be properly licensed, to use a taxicab meter and radio approved by the department of transportation and to obey its regulations and to adhere to all federal, state and local laws. The owner-operators also were required to maintain insurance in the minimum amount required by law at their own expense and to pay for the use and operation of the [taxicab] including repairs, maintenance, fines, tickets, towing and all taxes or other assessments imposed by governmental agencies. Under the agreement, the owner-operator could set the hours of operation, hire a driver for the taxicab, use the vehicle for personal use and keep all fares derived from the operation of the [taxicab]. [Metro] did not pay the owner-operator, provide benefits, request income records or collect payroll or social security taxes.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 442-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The first issue presented by Hanson\u2019s appeal is whether, in deciding whether a worker is an employee under the act, we should adopt the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test as an alternative to the \u201cright to control\u201d test. The Appellate Court declined to address this issue on its merits because it felt bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>129 Conn. 564, 29 A.2d 768 (1943). In that case, we held that \u201c[t]here is no dispute about the ultimate test. It is the right of general control of the means and methods used by the person whose status is involved.\u201d Id., 567. Although the issue of the propriety of recourse to the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test raises serious questions that warrant plenary exploration by this court; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 696-97, 699 A.2d 52 (1997); we are not persuaded that we should engraft this test onto our longstanding workers\u2019 compensation law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The issue that Hanson has raised must be decided in the context of two jurisprudential principles that limit our authority to afford her the relief that she seeks. First, because this is a workers\u2019 compensation case, it is governed by the special rules of construction that we have long held applicable in such cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Second, because this is a case in which Hanson asks us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>overrule a line of judicial precedents that the legislature has left intact for eighty years, it must be reconciled with the principles of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Connecticut first adopted a statutory scheme of workers\u2019 compensation in 1913. <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 381, 698 A.2d 859 (1997). Although some statutes have common-law roots that may enlighten their construction, the act is not such a statute. \u201c[T]he workers\u2019 compensation system in Connecticut is derived exclusively from statute. ... A commissioner may exercise jurisdiction to hear a claim only under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>242 Conn. 570, 576, 698 A.2d 873 (1997); see also <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 60, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corp., </em>159 Conn. 302, 305, 268 A.2d 660 (1970). \u201cBecause of the statutory nature of our workers\u2019 compensation system, policy determinations as to what injuries are compensable and what jurisdictional limitations apply thereto are for the legislature, not the judiciary or the board, to make.\u201d <em>Discuillo </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>supra, 577. Whatever the policy implications of this case may be, \u201cthe issue presented is, at bottom, a matter of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 241 Conn. 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">As a matter of statutory construction, to overrule our long-standing invocation of the \u201cright to control\u201d test, we would have to reconcile such a ruling with the presumption of legislative acquiescence in judicial interpretations that the legislature has not overturned. We have long acted on the hypothesis that the legislature is aware of the interpretation that the courts have placed upon one of its legislative enactments. Once an appropriate interval to permit legislative reconsideration has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>passed without corrective legislative action, the inference of legislative acquiescence limits judicial authority to reconsider the merits of its earlier decision. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 297-98, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997); see <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 Conn. 184, 196, 676 A.2d 831 (1996); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 333-34, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990); <em>Herald Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>142 Conn. 53, 63, 111 A.2d 4 (1955). In this context, only \u201cthe most cogent reasons and inescapable logic\u201d; <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 196; can justify judicial abandonment of judicial precedents dating back more than eighty years. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>90 Conn. 444, 447, 97 A. 328 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">We can perceive no such cogent reasons or inescapable logic to justify altering our long-standing judicial interpretation of one of the fundamental premises of our workers\u2019 compensation statute. This is particularly true for this statute, which has been the subject of extensive legislative amendment over its entire life, without any legislative indication of disagreement with the right to control test. Furthermore, it is fair to assume that employers and insurers have relied justifiably on that interpretation in ordering their business affairs. For us to abandon that interpretation would upset their legitimate expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Recognizing that these principles create obstacles to judicial reconsideration of our long-standing \u201cright to control\u201d test, Hanson attempts a bypass, arguing that the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test can coexist with the \u201cright to control\u201d test. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test determines the relationship between a worker and a putative employer by asking whether the worker\u2019s performance is an integral part of the regular business of the putative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>employer. 3 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1997) \u00a7 45.00, p. 8-193. The \u201cright to control\u201d test determines the same relationship by asking whether the putative employer has \u201cthe right to control the means and methods\u201d used by the worker in the performance of his or her job. <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 154, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996); <em>Silverberg </em>v. <em>Great Southwest Fire Ins. Co., </em>214 Conn. 632, 639, 573 A.2d 724 (1990); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>supra, 129 Conn. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Dual standards for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor would complicate the administration of our workers\u2019 compensation system. Although there well may be circumstances under which the results reached by application of the two tests will be identical, more often than not the results will differ. In all probability, a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner applying the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test would be required to broaden the class of \u201cemployees\u201d to include workers who currently are characterized as independent contractors. See, e.g., <em>Harger </em>v. <em>Structural Services, Inc., </em>121 N.M. 657, 916 P.2d 1324, 1329-31 (1996). Indeed, unless differing results were contemplated, there would be little to gain from adopting a new test. Hanson has proffered no criteria to define the underlying circumstances under which one or the other test would be the more appropriate. If a workers\u2019 compensation commissioner had undefined and hence unlimited authority to invoke either test, the scope of the term \u201cemployee\u201d would be left in confusion. We are persuaded, therefore, that we must evaluate Hanson\u2019s argument in favor of the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test as an outright alternative to the \u201cright to control\u201d test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">We turn now to the merits of replacing the \u201cright to control\u201d test with the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test. As advocated by Hanson, the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test would require a two part analysis, each part requiring consideration of three separate factors. With respect to the character of the work performed, the claimant would be required to show: (1) the degree of skill involved; (2) the degree to which the work is a separate calling or business; and (3) the extent to which a worker so situated reasonably can be expected to carry the burden of accident. With respect to the relationship of the work to the putative employer\u2019s business, the claimant would have to establish: (1) the extent to which the work is a regular part of the putative employer\u2019s regular business; (2) the extent to which the work is being performed continuously or intermittently; and (3) the extent to which the work is of sufficient duration to constitute continuing services rather than a particular assignment. See 3 A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, supra, \u00a7 43.51, p. 8-23, and \u00a7 45.10, p. 8-193.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Hanson advances four arguments in favor of adoption of the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test. She derives three of these arguments from the unchallenged proposition that workers\u2019 compensation is social legislation. In that light, she argues that, in preference to the \u201cright to control\u201d test, the proposed test: (1) more effectively implements the objectives of this social legislation; (2) more accurately depicts the employer-employee relationship by precluding employer reliance on contracts drafted to avoid the costs of this social legislation; (3) more directly advances the remedial purposes of social legislation. In addition, she argues that the \u201cright to control\u201d test is too vague to be applied fairly. We are not persuaded. Evaluation of Hanson\u2019s first three arguments cannot be undertaken by this forum; their resolution is grist only for the legislative mill. Hanson\u2019s final argument is unpersuasive on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In the absence of any claim of constitutional vagueness in the \u201cright to control\u201d test, Hanson must demonstrate that fact-finding under this test exceeds the discretionary authority normally afforded to any trier of fact. Undeniably, whenever the parties disagree, a determination of fact has elements of uncertainty. Hanson has not shown that, in application, the \u201cright to control\u201d test has created more uncertainty than factual disputes about, for example, contractual intent or tor-tious misbehavior. Indeed, as is illustrated by the Alaska case upon which Hanson relies, close questions of fact are also likely to arise in the application of the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test. <em>Grothe </em>v. <em>Olafson, </em>659 P.2d 602, 606 (Alaska 1983).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The second issue raised by Hanson\u2019s appeal is whether, if the \u201cright to control\u201d test applies, the trier of fact improperly determined that the decedent was not an employee at the time of his death. She claims that Metro retained enough authority over the taxicab fleet bearing its name to demonstrate a right to general control that made the decedent its employee rather than an independent contractor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is a question of fact for the commissioner.\u201d <em>Spatafore </em>v. <em>Yale Unive</em>rsity, 239 Conn. 408, 418, 684 A.2d 1155 (1996). Accordingly, we apply the same deferential standard of review that we accord to findings of fact by a trial judge or jury. Id., 419. Keeping these principles in mind, we turn to Hanson\u2019s claim that Metro retained sufficient control to render her decedent an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">For Connecticut authority, Hanson relies principally on <em>Lassen </em>v. <em>Stamford Transit Co., </em>102 Conn. 76, 128 A. 117 (1925), a case which, like this one, involved the \u201cright to control\u201d test for taxicab drivers, and which held that the drivers were employees. That case, however, is distinguishable on its facts. For example, the taxicab company in that case required drivers to turn over their fares to the company and paid the drivers 75 percent of that amount. Id., 79. Furthermore, company dispatchers designated the driver who was to transport any particular passenger. Id., 78-79. In this case, Metro took care to avoid such indicia of control, leaving it to taxicab drivers like the decedent to decide, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>exercise of their own discretion, when and where they would take the taxicabs on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As a more general matter, Hanson cites the fact that Metro required cabdrivers to conform to department of transportation regulations with respect to such matters as licenses, meters, fares, records, dispatch and safety. The argument that such state regulatory requirements automatically satisfy the right to control test would make irrelevant the contractual terms of the relationship between the parties. It is axiomatic that every taxicab company must comply with state regulations. We are not persuaded, therefore, that Metro\u2019s requirement that owner-operators comply with government regulations definitively demonstrates an employer-employee relationship. See, e.g., <em>La Grande </em>v. <em>B &amp; L Services, Inc., </em>432 So. 2d 1364, 1366 (Fla. App. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Contrary to Hanson\u2019s argument, we agree with the Appellate Court, the board and the commissioner that the totality of the evidence did not demonstrate that Metro had retained sufficient control to require a finding of an employer-employee relationship between Metro and the decedent. True, the commissioner made some subordinate factual findings that, if viewed in isolation, might have supported a different determination. For example, Metro required its drivers to: (1) report all traffic violations to Metro; and (2) obtain Metro\u2019s approval of any outside insurance. Metro also held legal title to the vehicles, and painted and marked the cars as Metro cabs. Other subordinate findings by the commissioner, however, paint a clearer picture of the contractual relationship between Metro and its drivers. In the daily use of their cabs, drivers could set their own hours, work anywhere in the Metro service area, refuse to accept dispatch calls,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and hire a second driver for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>the cab. Drivers had sole responsibility for all expenses related to operation of their cabs and had the right to regain total ownership rights to their cabs upon the termination of their relationship with Metro. Administratively, moreover, Metro did not pay any salary or fringe benefits to the drivers and did not require the drivers to report their fares to Metro. We conclude that the commissioner reasonably found that the totality of factors in this case indicates that Metro taxi drivers were not employees as that term is used under the act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In sum, the Appellate Court properly reviewed the commissioner\u2019s determination under the terms of the \u201cright to control\u201d test. We concur in the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the circumstances of this case, Hanson\u2019s decedent was not an employee, but, rather, an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The third and final issue raised by Hanson\u2019s appeal is whether the commissioner improperly refused to amend its findings to include certain requested additions of fact. We agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s resolution of this issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Once it has been decided that the appropriate test is the \u201cright to control\u201d test, \u201ceven if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the findings were corrected as requested, the ultimate conclusion would not change.\u201d <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Transportation General, Inc., </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> Because the defendants apparently present the same arguments to this court, having filed a joint brief that makes no distinctions between them in this respect, we will refer to them as one party, Metro.

The issue, rather, is what the decedent driver knew or should have known of his own status under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">It is true that the right to control test, in its present form, was embedded into the act by early cases relying on similar rules in tort cases. Nonetheless, that construction of the act has been ratified by legislative acquiescence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b640-5\"> Hanson\u2019s argument relies on four out-of-state cases that we find unpersuasive.

Earlier editions of his celebrated work demonstrate that, for almost thirty years, Professor Larson has been a staunch advocate of the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test. During this time period, however, only a few state courts have adopted this test in substitution for the \u201cright to control\u201d test. See, e.g., cases cited in footnote 6 of this opinion. Connecticut has not done so, either by way of legislation or by way of judicial opinion. See <em>DaSilva </em>v. <em>Danbury Publishing Co., </em>39 Conn.

The majority, in applying the right to control test in determining whether the deceased husband (decedent) of the plaintiff Janet Hanson was an employee within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., ignores this court\u2019s long-standing precedent for determining whether there exists such a relationship.

The majority fails to address this claim because, in focusing on whether this court should adopt the relative nature of the work test as an alternative test for the purpose of determining whether a claimant is an employee under the act, it appears to have lost sight of the proverbial forest. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Indeed, the majority, in footnote 5 of its opinion, without citing to any supporting authority, characterizes the issue in this appeal as follows: \u201c[W]hat the decedent driver knew or should have known of his own status under the act.\u201d Such a characterization is absurd because the issue in any workers\u2019 compensation case in which the employment status of the claimant is contested is whether the defendant had the right to control the claimant with respect to the performance of his services.

The act does not specifically set forth the factors to consider in determining whether a claimant was an employee. General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (9) (A) (i) defines an employee for purposes of the act to mean any person who \u201c[h]as entered into or works under any contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer . . . .\u201d When the state adopted the act in 1913, this court\u2019s determination of whether there existed an employer-employee relation was dependent on the traditional common-law right to control test. See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>90 Conn. 444, 447, 97 A. 328 (1916), citing <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Sherman\u2019s Sons Co., </em>86 Conn. 292, 297, 85 A. 514 (1912), <em>and Norwalk Gaslight Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>63 Conn. 495, 28 A. 32 (1893) (pivotal question is \u201cwho has the right to direct what shall be done and when and how it shall be done? [In other words] [w]ho has the right to the general control?\u201d). In 1933, when the American Law Institute adopted the right to control test for determining the existence of a master-servant relationship, it recognized that many factors were germane in determining whether that relationship exists. 1 Restatement, Agency \u00a7 220 (1933). Soon thereafter, this court acknowledged that it looked to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Restatement when it applied the right to control test to determine whether a claimant was an employee. <em>Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tone, </em>125 Conn. 183, 190, 4 A.2d 640 (1939) (\u201cVarious elements may enter into the determination of the question whether one who performs services for another is his servant or is exercising an independent employment. Restatement, 1 Agency, 220.\u201d); see also <em>Robert C. Buell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>127 Conn. 606, 610, 18 A.2d 697 (1941) (same).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The Restatement (Second) of Agency, \u00a7 220 (1958) (hereinafter referred to as \u00a7 220), which is substantially the same as its predecessor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defines the relationship of master and servant as follows: \u201c(1) A servant is a person employed to perform services in the affairs of another and who with respect to the physical conduct in the performance of the services is subject to the other\u2019s control or right to control. (2) In determining whether one acting for another is a servant or an independent contractor, the following matters of fact, among others, are considered; (a) the extent of control which, by the agreement, the master may exercise over the details of the work; (b) whether or not the one employed is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (c) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether, in the locality, the work is usually done under the direction of the employer or by a specialist without supervision; (d) the skill required in the particular occupation; (e) whether the employer of the workman supplies the instrumentalities, tools, and the place of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>for the person doing the work; (f) the length of time for which the person is employed; (g) the method of payment, whether by the time or by the job; (h) whether or not the work is a part of the regular business of the employer; (i) whether or not the parties believe they are creating the relation of master and servant; and (j) whether the principal is or is not in business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">When the claimant proves, pursuant to \u00a7 220 (1), that the purported employer had a right to control the person\u2019s work, the analysis stops there and the employment relationship for purposes of the act has been satisfied. The \u201crelation of master and servant is one not capable of exact definition. It cannot ... be defined in general terms with substantial accuracy.\u201d 1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 220, comment (1) (c). \u201cMany factors are ordinarily present for consideration, no one of which is, by itself, necessarily conclusive.\u201d <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>138 Conn. 317, 321, 84 A.2d 122 (1951). Indeed, the Restatement recognizes, as we have, that \u201c[although control or right to control the physical conduct of the person giving service is important and in many situations is determinative, the control or right to control needed to establish the relation of master and servant may be veiy attenuated.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 220, comment (1) (d). Therefore, when subsection (1) does not definitively establish the employer-employee relationship, triers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>fact <em>must consider all the factors </em>in \u00a7 220 (2), and then determine \u201cwhether or not there is a sufficient group of favorable factors to establish\u201d that the claimant is an employee. Id., \u00a7 220, comment (1) (c). For example, \u201c[w]hile the method of paying by the hour or day rather than by a fixed sum is characteristic of the relationship of employer and employee, it is not decisive. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Twiss, </em>supra, [90 Conn.] 448; <em>Stier </em>v. <em>Derby, </em>119 Conn. 44, 52, 174 A. 332 [1934], Nor is it decisive that the injured party uses his own tools and equipment.\u201d <em>Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Cacciapuoti, </em>supra, 321; see <em>Ceradsky </em>v. <em>Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., </em>583 S.W.2d 193, 196 (Mo. App. 1979) (\u201c[w]here the evidence lacks such a conclusiveness, however, whether the one who renders the service for the other acts as employee or independent contractor depends upon <em>all the circumstances of the work relationship </em>\u2014 so that control becomes only one indicium weighted with the several others to determine the true status\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">On the basis of the undisputed findings by the commissioner in this case, I conclude that Metro\u2019s right to control the decedent was not so attenuated as to mandate a finding, under subsection (1) of \u00a7 220, that the decedent was an independent contractor. Therefore, consideration of all the factors in subsection (2) of \u00a7 220 is required to determine the true status of the decedent at the time of his fatal injury. The majority, like the commissioner, however, limits its review of the decedent\u2019s relationship to a summary analysis of some, but not all, of the factors set forth in \u00a7 220 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">In general, the \u201cinquiry [into all the factors of subsection (2) of \u00a7 220] turns to the economic and functional relationship between the nature of the work and the operation of the business served.\u201d <em>Ceradsky </em>v. <em>Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., </em>supra, 583 S.W.2d 199. Several factors in \u00a7 220 (2) specifically focus on the relative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>nature of the claimant\u2019s work. For instance, subsection (2) (b) requires us to take into consideration whether the decedent was engaged in a distinct occupation. \u201cIt would appear that to truly be independent contractors, [Metro\u2019s] drivers are required [to have a certificate of operation issued by the state department of transportation] ... in order to present themselves as a business entity.\u201d <em>Petition of City Cab of Manchester, </em>139 N.H. 220, 222, 652 A.2d 1202 (1994). The owner-operator agreement signed by the decedent provides that he \u201cacknowledges that he has acquired no property rights in ... [the] certificate to operate . . . assigned to him by [Metro] during the term of this Agreement . . . .\u201d Moreover, Metro\u2019s drivers do not present themselves as being separate business entities. Indeed, at the time of the decedent\u2019s injury, he was operating a vehicle painted orange and white \u2014 like all other Metro taxicabs \u2014 and emblazoned with the Metro name and telephone number. Consequently, most of Metro\u2019s customers \u201cwould have no reason to suspect that a driver was a business entity distinct from [Metro].\u201d Id., 223. Under these circumstances, it cannot reasonably be said that the decedent was engaged in an occupation distinct and separate from that of a Metro taxicab operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Most importantly, the Restatement directs this court to consider whether the decedent\u2019s work was \u201ca part of the regular business of the employer.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 220 (2) (h). In this case, Metro\u2019s sole business was to supply taxi service, precisely what the decedent was doing as a result of his employment by Metro. Indeed, pursuant to Metro\u2019s owner-operator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>agreement, the decedent was hired to perform a continual service of carrying passengers to and from points in Metro\u2019s area of operations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in order to ensure fulfillment of Metro\u2019s obligations to the department of transportation to provide a quality taxicab service meeting certain standards. Although Metro argued before the commissioner that it was in the business of \u201cleasing cars to drivers,\u201d Metro was obligated to provide taxi service in accordance with its franchise with the department of transportation. In doing so, Metro received telephone calls from customers for taxi service and dispatched drivers, including the decedent, to these customers. While Metro adopted an ingenious method of fixing the decedent\u2019s compensation and permitted him to exercise much discretion over the use of his taxicab, there was, still, \u201ca continuous, essential connection between [Metro\u2019s] work and that of the [decedent] . . . making the [decedent\u2019s] labor a critical part of the regular business of [Metro].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Petition of City Cab of Manchester, </em>supra, 139 N.H. 222; <em>Aisenberg </em>v. <em>C.F. Adams Co., </em>95 Conn. 419, 422, 111 A. 591 (1920) (\u201c[t]he means and method of conducting this business, as we have in part detailed, comprise the essence of this business\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">This last factor, \u00a7 220 (2) (h), is closely related to the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test that the plaintiff urges this court to adopt and that has been embraced by other jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Stampados </em>v. <em>Colorado D. &amp; S. Enterprises, </em>833 P.2d 815, 817 (Colo. App. 1992); <em>Ceradsky </em>v. <em>Mid-America Dairymen, </em>Inc., supra, 583 S.W.2d 193; <em>Petition of City Cab of Manchester, </em>supra, 139 N.H. 221; <em>Kertesz </em>v <em>Korsh, </em>296 N.J.

App. 471, 477, 879 P.2d 1319 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It is unnecessary for this court to consider the issue of adopting the relative nature of the work test in order to decide this case because, according to our precedent, most of the factors of this test have relevance in the application of the right to control test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>in <em>Higley </em>v. <em>Woodford, </em>106 Conn. 284, 285-86, 137 A. 755 (1927), this court specifically relied on the following factor \u2014 the degree to which the claimant\u2019s work is a separate calling or business \u2014 to conclude that the claimant woodcutter was not an employee of the defendant. The court in <em>Higley </em>emphasized that because the claimant was \u201c \u2018exercising an independent employment . . . was doing his own business ... in his own way and under his own will\u2019 \u201d he was an independent contractor. Id. Most importantly, in at least two cases this court has relied on the extent to which the work is a regular part of the purported employer\u2019s regular business to determine whether a claimant was an employee or an independent contractor. See, e.g., <em>Robert C. Buell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Danaher, </em>supra, 127 Conn. 612 (claimant was employee because \u201c \u2018[o]n the whole the work which the salesmen are doing is the business of the plaintiff [and t]he advancement of that business depends very largely upon the method and manner of the doing of their work by the salesmen\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lassen </em>v. <em>Stamford Transit Co., </em>102 Conn. 76, 81, 128 A.2d 117 (1925) (negligent operator of taxicab was employee of defendant who had concession for operating taxi service, in part, because defendant had no \u201cother means of performing this service\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In my view, reversal of the commissioner\u2019s decision is also required because he failed to include in his findings material undisputed facts that clearly would have established an employer-employee relationship. It is well settled law that the \u201cfinding [of the commissioner] cannot be changed unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed.\u201d <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>Red Star Express </em>Lines, 156 Conn. 245, 248, 240 A.2d 859 (1968). Moreover, \u201c[t]he conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fair </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Savings Bank, </em>207 Conn. 535, 539, 542 A.2d 1118 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">As previously pointed out, the undisputed facts found by the commissioner provided sufficient proof of the decedent\u2019s employee status. Nevertheless, when the findings requested by the plaintiff, based upon Metro\u2019s own admission before the commissioner, are added to the commissioner\u2019s findings, the evidence is overwhelming that the decedent was an employee of Metro at the time of his fatal injury. The commissioner found that \u201c[w]hen a driver agreed to service a call through the radio dispatcher he was under the orders and direction of the dispatcher.\u201d After the commissioner released its decision, the plaintiff requested that he amend this finding to include the following facts: \u201c[The decedent] always utilized the radio dispatch service [of Metro] and at the time of his death, he was responding to a radio dispatch call [from Metro] and was under orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>and direction of the dispatcher.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The transcript of the hearing before the commissioner reflects that the defendant had conceded that the decedent utilized the services of the dispatcher \u201cmost of the time\u201d he operated the taxicab, and that he was \u201cutilizing it for at least some of the night [he was killed] because the people who killed him were a radio dispatched call.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Remarkably, the majority concludes, without specific reference or identification of the requested finding, that even if the commissioner had granted the plaintiffs request to correct this and fifteen other findings, \u201c \u2018the ultimate conclusion [that the decedent was not an employee] would not change.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Clearly, if the decedent was responding to Metro directed dispatches on the night he was murdered, he was \u201cunder the orders and direction of\u2019 Metro and for that time, at least, he was under the direct control of Metro in full satisfaction of \u00a7 220 (1). The majority seems to hold that for the decedent to qualify for workers\u2019 compensation benefits he must have worked exclusively or predominantly for Metro. This requirement is contrary to our long-standing rule of law that \u201c[a] person may be a contractor as to part of his service and a servant as to another part . . . [and that] <em>the question </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>of compensability [under the act] is determined by the particular relationship existing at the time the injury was </em>suffered.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Estate of Malley, </em>126 Conn. 379, 382, 11 A.2d 398 (1940); <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 573-75, 362 A.2d 871 (1975) (public defender is employee of state for certain purposes, and independent contractor for other purposes); <em>Scorpion </em>v. <em>American-Republican, Inc., </em>131 Conn. 42, 45, 37 A.2d 802 (1944) (issue for jury was whether newsboys were agents of defendant, or independent contractors as to removal of wires from stacks of delivered papers); <em>Markham </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>102 Conn. 571, 574, 129 A.2d 524 (1925) (town tree warden, as independent contractor, was acting as employee of town when he was injured removing limbs from tree on public property); see also 1 T.

Redfield, Negligence (6th Ed. 1913) \u00a7 165 (\u201c[o]ne who has an independent business, and generally serves only in the capacity of a contractor, may abandon that character for a time, and become a mere servant or agent, and this, too, without doing work of a different nature from that to which he is accustomed\u201d). Moreover, by Metro\u2019s own admission and the commissioner\u2019s finding, \u201cmost of the time\u201d Metro\u2019s dispatcher exercised direct control over the decedent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Furthermore, even when the decedent operated the taxicab at his own discretion, Metro retained the right to exercise control over him. \u201cIt is not the fact of actual interference with control but the right to interfere which makes the difference between an independent contractor and a servant or agent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kaliszewski </em>v. <em>Weathermaster Alsco Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>148 Conn. 624, 629, 173 A.2d 497 (1961). The conclusion that Metro had a right to control the decedent is supported by the fact that it had the right to terminate the decedent\u2019s owner-operator agreement \u2014 the agreement that was the foundation of Metro\u2019s business, and that required each owner-operator to: (1) maintain a neat and clear appearance at all times while on duty; (2) exercise courtesy and consideration and help passengers load and unload baggage; (3) use the shortest available route to the passenger\u2019s destination, or as directed by the passenger; and (4) follow all relevant department of transportation regulations. See <em>Lassen </em>v. <em>Stamford Transit </em>Co., supra, 102 Conn. 80-81 (\u201cit must be implied that the company directed and required its drivers to conform to these methods of dealing with the company\u2019s customers\u201d). Nevertheless, even if Metro never disciplined drivers who did not conform, the fact that it had the right to discipline those said drivers is \u201cone of the strong indications that the relation is one of employment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aisenberg </em>v. <em>C.F.

These can be characterized as the social bargain and social insurance purposes. The first of these is related to the immediate impetus for the adoption of this legislation. The impetus, of course, was to alleviate the plight of injured workers who often suffered without remedy under the common law. This purpose has been characterized as \u2018 . . .a socially-enforced bargain which compels an employee to give up his valuable right to sue in the courts for full recovery of damages ... in return for a certain, but limited, award. It compels the employer to give up his right to assert common-law defenses in return for assurance that the amount of recovery by the employee will be limited.\u2019 \u201d D. Samuelsen, \u201cEmployee or Independent Contractor: The Need For a Reassessment of the Standard Used Under California\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation,\u201d 10 U.S.F.L. Rev. 133,136-37 (1975); see <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985) (the act establishes, as part of on-going social compact, system that \u201ccompromise[s] an employee\u2019s right to a common law tort action for work related injuries in return for relatively quick and certain compensation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">\u201cThe second principal social policy purpose [is] the social insurance form through which workmen\u2019s compensation [is] to operate. This would be its risk distribution aspect. The fact that modem industrial life will inevitably generate work-related injuries and possibly death is one of the major premises underlying workmen\u2019s compensation.\u201d D. Samuelsen, supra, 10 U.S.F.L. Rev. 137. \u201cThe law was intended for the protection of workmen and their families; it was intended to afford machinery by which the burdens of injuries sustained by those who do the actual work of a business, and are not themselves employers with a duty of insurance under the act, may be socially distributed and borne by society in general.\u201d <em>Matter of Rheinwald </em>v. <em>Builders\u2019 Brick Supply Co., </em>168 App. Div. 425, 440, 153 N.Y.S. 598 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The plaintiffs decedent took a regular and continuous part in the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>dant\u2019s economic activity of providing taxi service to residents of and visitors to the New Haven metropolitan area. Like many of Metro\u2019s other drivers, the decedent and his family could not be expected to bear the cost of a serious traffic accident, nor was his place in the overall transportation business such that he could distribute the risk of injury on his own. In every respect then, he is the kind of worker for whose benefit the compensation act was thought necessary. <em>Shinuald </em>v. <em>Mound City Yellow Cab Co., </em>666 S.W.2d 846, 849 (Mo.
