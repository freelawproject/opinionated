Sess., May, 1994 (Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51). The plaintiff GTE Realty Corporation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of the defendant. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly: (1) concluded that the defendant had validly postponed the revaluation for purposes of the grand lists of October 1, 1993 and 1994; (2) concluded that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, is constitutional, both as enacted and as applied by the defendant to the plaintiff; and (3) declined to consider the plaintiffs challenge to the defendant\u2019s subsequent postponements of the implementation of the revaluation, with regard to the 1995 and 1996 grand hsts, which took place during the pendency of this case. Addressing the merits of those subsequent actions by the defendant, the plaintiff also claims that they were invalid. We conclude that: (1) the defendant\u2019s actions in postponing the revaluation for purposes of the 1993 and 1994 grand lists was valid; (2) there is no constitutional infirmity in Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, either as enacted or as implemented by the defendant; (3) under the circumstances of this case, the trial court should have adjudicated the plaintiffs claims regarding the 1995 and 1996 grand fists; and (4) under No. 97-254, \u00a7 1 (b) (1) of the 1997 Public Acts (P.A. 97-254), the defendant may postpone its revaluation until 1999. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in part and reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In its intervening complaint, the plaintiff challenged the defendant\u2019s action of staying the implementation of the defendant\u2019s October 1, 1993 decennial revaluation, which had the effect of retaining the real property valuations of October 1, 1983, for the grand fists of 1993 and 1994. That action had been taken in 1994, pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, later codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-62h,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>claimed was unconstitutional. The plaintiffs complaint contained two counts. In the first count, the plaintiff appealed from its tax assessment pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 12-119,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claiming that its tax assessment was illegal because of, inter alia, the unconstitutionality of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51. In the second count, the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The plaintiffs complaint puiported to be limited to a challenge to the defendant\u2019s 1994 staying of the revaluation, affecting the grand lists of 1993 and 1994, and the plaintiff did not submit an amended complaint formally expanding its claims beyond those grand lists. Nonetheless, the record discloses that the parties<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> subsequently also submitted to the trial court the question of whether the defendant acted legally in further staying the revaluation, such that it was not implemented for the grand lists of October 1, 1995, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>October 1, 1996, pursuant to No. 95-283, \u00a7 8, of the 1995 Public Acts (P.A. 95-283),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and No. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>and 3, of the 1996 Public Acts (P.A. 96-218).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The following facts are undisputed. Since 1980, the plaintiff has owned real property in Norwalk, located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>at 32 Weed Avenue, where it operates a management and development center. In 1993, the defendant conducted a decennial revaluation of all real property located in the city for purposes of establishing a new grand list as of October 1, 1993 (1993 revaluation), pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-62 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The previous revaluation had been in 1983, based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>real property values as of that time (1983 revaluation). On the basis of the 1993 revaluation, the defendant established a proposed 1993 grand list. The plaintiff was notified that, as of October 1, 1993, its assessment would be $22,750,420. The plaintiff appealed its 1993 assessment to the board of tax review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">On January 24,1994, however, the director of finance reported to the board of estimate and finance* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that, after revaluation, revenues from commercial and industrial properties would decline from 26.9 percent to 25.6 percent of the grand list, revenues from condominiums would decline from 10.3 percent to 8.9 percent of the grand list, and revenues from noncondominium residences would increase from 45.6 percent to 53.5 percent of the grand list. On March 8, 1994, at the meeting of the common council, the mayor was granted authorization to seek permission from the state to defer implementation of the revaluation for no more than three years. Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-117,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> however, the state office of policy and management may grant a municipality an extension of no more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>than two months to complete the process of hearing taxpayers\u2019 appeals regarding a revaluation. On March 16, 1994, the board of tax review and the mayor wrote to the office of policy and management seeking a one year extension. The office of policy and management, however, granted only a two month extension, until May 31, 1994, as permitted by the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On April 22,1994,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the board of estimate and taxation established a final budget and mill rate based, not on the 1993 revaluation, but on the 1983 revaluation. This had the effect on real property owners, including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>plaintiff, of carrying forward the 1992 grand list, based on the values of real property as of 1983, rather than 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Under the 1983 revaluation, the plaintiffs assessment was $24,058,826, resulting in a tax bill of $1,119,938.35. Under the defendant\u2019s proposed 1993 revaluation, which has not been implemented, the plaintiffs assessment would have been $22,750,420 and, under the defendant\u2019s proposed mill rate, the plaintiffs tax bill would have been $687,290.19. As a result of the deferment of the 1993 revaluation, therefore, the plaintiffs tax bill on the 1993 grand list was increased by $432,648.16, or 39 percent, over what it would have been had the 1993 revaluation been implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On or about June 1, 1994, while the plaintiffs appeal to the board of tax review was pending, the defendant issued tax bills, based on the 1983 revaluation, accompanied by a letter from the mayor stating that the implementation of the 1993 revaluation had been postponed. Prior to the issuance of these tax bills, the board of tax review did not hold hearings on appeals by taxpayers potentially aggrieved by the 1993 assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On June 9, 1994, Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 became effective. See Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 85. Section 51 of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in general terms, permits the legislative body of a municipality to stay the implementation of a decennial revaluation for up to two years. On June 28, 1994, the common council suspended its rules and, purporting to act pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, passed a resolution, not listed on its agenda, authorizing the stay of the implementation of the 1993 revaluation. In the discussion of this resolution, the corporation counsel described this action as a ratification of the common council\u2019s prior decision to request a stay of the 1993 revaluation. Thereafter, on December 27,1994, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the common council also voted to stay the implementation of the 1993 revaluation until July 1, 1996. In addition, during the pendency of this case, the defendant has enacted further postponements of the revaluation, which have had the effect of retaining the 1983 real property valuations for the grand lists of 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The trial court rejected the plaintiffs various statutory and constitutional challenges to the defendant\u2019s actions in staying the 1993 revaluation. The court declined to consider, however, the plaintiffs challenge to the defendant\u2019s action in further postponing the revaluation for the 1995 and 1996 grand lists, which steps the defendant purportedly had taken pursuant to P.A. 95-283, \u00a7 8, and P.A. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3. Accordingly, the court rendered judgment for the defendant with respect to the stay of the 1993 revaluation, affecting only Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, and the 1993 and 1994 grand lists. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The plaintiff first claims that the defendant did not validly postpone the revaluation for puiposes of the 1993 and 1994 grand lists. The plaintiff relies on the conclusion of the trial court that the defendant\u2019s action on June 28, 1994, purporting to ratify its prior decision to postpone the 1993 revaluation, could not be a valid ratification because, prior to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, the defendant had no such power of postponement. The plaintiff contends, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s action in postponing the 1993 revaluation was invalid. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">It is true that the trial court concluded that, prior to the enactment of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, the defendant was without any power to postpone the 1993 revaluation and that, therefore, any attempt to <em>ratify </em>what was in effect an ultra vires act was ineffective. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>follow from that conclusion, however, that the defendant\u2019s action on June 28, 1994, was also ineffective to postpone the 1993 revaluation pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">As the trial court also concluded, correctly, Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, by its terms had retrospective effect, and the defendant\u2019s June 28, 1994 resolution, which was specifically authorized by and passed pursuant to that act, validly postponed the 1993 revaluation. Thus, although the defendant\u2019s June 28,1994 resolution could not validly have had the effect of <em>ratifying </em>the defendant\u2019s action in postponing the revaluation prior to the enactment of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, once that act became effective on June 9, 1994, the same resolution, passed pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, did have the legal effect of postponing the revaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Section 51 of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4; see footnote 4 of this opinion; provided in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of title 12 of the general statutes, the local legislative body of a municipality may, at its option, stay the implementation of such municipality\u2019s revaluation in order to implement the recommendations of the Property Tax Reform Commission enacted during the 1995 session of the general assembly. The local legislative body of a municipality may stay such implementation for a period or periods not to exceed in the aggregate two years. . . . <em>Any municipality required to implement revaluation for the assessment year commencing October 1,1993, which has not as of February 15,1994, adopted mill rates for taxes due July 1,1994, may use such municipality\u2019s most recently completed grand list prior to revaluation . . </em>. <em>. Any municipality required to implement revaluation for the year commencing October 1, 1994, which has not as of February 15, 1995, adopted a mill rate for taxes due July 1, 1995, may use such municipality\u2019s most </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>recently completed grand list prior to revaluation </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Legislation is generally presumed to operate prospectively, unless the legislature makes clear its intent that it operate retrospectively. <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 483-84, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995). The text of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, itself makes clear the legislative intent that it apply retrospectively, because it makes its application conditional on events that preceded its effective date of June 9,1994, namely, whether a municipality had adopted mill rates as of the previous February 15. It is equally clear that the defendant met all of these conditions because it had not adopted a mill rate as of February 15, 1994, and further, it did not adopt a mill rate as of February 15, 1995. Therefore, when the common council, on June 28,1994, voted to stay the implementation of the revaluation with respect to the 1993 and 1994 grand lists, it acted legally pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The plaintiff next claims that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, is unconstitutional under the federal and state constitutions because: (1) it \u201cis void of standards\u201d and, therefore, involves an impermissible delegation of legislative power in violation of due process of law; (2) it is void for vagueness in violation of due process of law; and (3) it deprives the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> None of these claims is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Legislation is presumed to be constitutional, and a litigant challenging its validity has the heavy burden to establish its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211, 217-18, 700 A.2d 1 (1997). The plaintiff has not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiffs claim that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, involves an impermissible delegation of legislative power founders on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>209 Conn. 652, 553 A.2d 576 (1989). The limitation that the legislature may not delegate its power without establishing primary standards or an intelligible principle for carrying out that power emanates from the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. Id., 660. \u201cThe separation of powers doctrine, however, does not pertain to delegations from the state legislature to a municipality.\u201d Id., 664. \u201c[Tjhus, a nondelegation rule grounded in that constitutional limitation is inapposite . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The plaintiffs claim that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, is void for vagueness and, therefore, violative of due process of law, is also unpersuasive. When a legislature delegates its power to a municipality, \u201cnone of the limitations imposed on administrative or executive agencies applies. Thus, the delegation may be of the most general nature and it will not be invalid for failure to create an adequate standard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 668-69. Under the due process vagueness rubric, \u201cthe proper standard for a delegation of power from the state legislature to a municipality, based on both constitutional analysis and the reality of state and local governmental relations, is that such a delegation should be judged by whether it provides reasonable notice of what conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>may be authorized or prohibited under its provisions.\u201d Id., 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Judged by this standard, Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, passes constitutional muster. The act authorized the defendant, at the option of its common council, to stay the implementation of its decennial revaluation, in order to implement the recommendations of the property tax reform commission that the legislature expected to be enacted in the 1995 session of the General Assembly. It conditioned that authority on the determination of whether, as of February 15, 1994, the defendant had adopted a mill rate. There is nothing unconstitutionally vague about these directions to the defendant regarding what conduct was authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The plaintiffs final constitutional challenge is to the defendant\u2019s application to the plaintiff of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51. The plaintiff claims that, in staying the implementation of the revaluation pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, the defendant deprived the plaintiff of the equal protection of the laws because the defendant \u201cdeliberately and intentionally acted for the benefit of one classification of taxpayers,\u201d namely, single-family residential homeowners, \u201cto the detriment of others,\u201d namely, commercial property owners such as the plaintiff. In this regard, the plaintiff relies heavily on the trial court\u2019s finding that the common council \u201cvoted to stay its decennial revaluation of real property because of a shift in the tax burden to single-family homeowners from nonsingle-family property owners which would result.\u201d We reject the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">The parties agree, as do we, that the constitutionality of the defendant\u2019s action taken pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, must be gauged under the rational basis test. \u201cIn the context of an equal protection challenge to social and economic legislation that does not infringe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group, the classification drawn by the statute will not violate the equal protection clause if it is rationally related to a legitimate public interest. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 8, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992); <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 432, 439-41, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has recently summarized the rational basis test as applied to social and economic legislation that does not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group. <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra, [505 U.S. 11-12]. In general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1980), reh. denied, 450 U.S. 960, 101 S. Ct. 1421, 67 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1981)], the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, reh. denied, 450 U.S. 1027, 101 S. Ct. 1735, 68 L. Ed. 2d 222] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em>[supra, 473 U.S. 446], <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra, [11],</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">\u201cMoreover . . . [i]n the context of tax legislation, a party challenging a statute on equal protection grounds has an even greater burden than equal protection challenges to other social and economic statutes that do not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group. In tax matters, more so than in other fields, legislatures possess considerable liberty in classification. <em>Gallacher </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>221 Conn. 166, 181, 602 A.2d 996 (1992); see also <em>Nordlinger v. Hahn, </em>supra, [505 U.S. 11-12] (upholding California\u2019s property tax scheme under Proposition 13 against equal protection challenge); <em>Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation with Representation of Washington, </em>461 U.S. 540, 547, 103 S. Ct. 1997, 76 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1983) (denial o f tax exemption to nonprofit lobbying organizations, but with an exception for veterans groups, does not violate equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\u201cTherefore, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that the classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative <em>every conceivable basis </em>which might support it. ... <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>173 Conn. 506, 509-10, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S. Ct. 1226, 55 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>225 Conn. 528, 535-37, 626 A.2d 244 (1993). Furthermore, when a court determines whether a legislative classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against a particular class, the challenger must establish that the legislature \u201cselected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part \u2018because of,\u2019 not merely \u2018in spite of,\u2019 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\u201d <em>Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Under this well established equal protection jurisprudence, the plaintiffs challenge to the defendant\u2019s action in staying the implementation of the revaluation fails. The most obvious rational basis for the defendant\u2019s action was to implement, in an orderly manner, the changes to the existing property taxation system anticipated to be enacted in the next legislative session as a result of the recommendations of the property tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>reform commission.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>179 Conn. 627, 648, 427 A.2d 830, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 801, 101 S. Ct. 45, 66 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1980) (tax phase-in statute and local ordinance implementing it did not violate equal protection clause notwithstanding that phase-in act resulted in continued temporary inequities that mandatory periodic revaluation and uniform assessment rate were designed to ameliorate). That this \u201cpurpose may conceivably . . . have been the purpose and policy of the relevant governmental decisionmaker\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 15; is demonstrated by the fact that it was the stated purpose of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, pursuant to which the defendant acted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The plaintiffs reliance on the trial court\u2019s finding, namely, that the defendant stayed its decennial revaluation because of a shift in the tax burden from single-family homeowners to nonsingle-family homeowners that would result, is misplaced. First, the plaintiff ignores the trial court\u2019s concomitant finding that the defendant \u201cchose this course, however, not to burden commercial property owners but to alleviate the burden on single-family homeowners, that is, \u2018in spite of,\u2019 not \u2018because of the burden which would, be assumed by nonsingle-family property owners.\u201d Thus, the trial court recognized the economic reality that when a legislative body makes a taxing decision it almost inevitably will be involved in shifting tax burdens from one group to another. The defendant\u2019s motivation did not offend the equal protection clause, however, because it was made in spite of, not because of, the burden it placed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>commercial property owners. <em>Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Feeney, </em>supra, 442 U.S. 279. Put another way, the plaintiff has failed to make \u201c \u2018the most explicit demonstration that the classification [was] a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Second, and more important, the plaintiffs reliance on the political motivations of the defendant\u2019s officials in staying the decennial revaluation is simply not in accord with current United States Supreme Court rational basis analysis, which is binding on this court in applying federal constitutional principles. The Supreme Court has stated the test under equal protection principles when the challenged legislation does not involve fundamental rights or suspect categories as follows: \u201cWhere, as here, there are plausible reasons for [the legislative body\u2019s] action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>supra, 449 U.S. 179. We have consistently followed this course in applying rational basis analysis to equal protection claims. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 539;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Third, even if we were to assume that the defendant acted in order to protect single-family homeowners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>from increased taxes, that would not necessarily be unconstitutional. The government may, without violating the equal protection clause, impose different tax burdens on different classes of property. See, e.g., <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Commission of Webster County, West Virginia, </em>488 U.S. 336, 344, 109 S. Ct. 633, 102 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1989); <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 647. Furthermore, in <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 647, we specifically indicated that the goal of protecting residential property owners from a sudden increase in taxation due to revaluation was a legitimate basis for legislation that authorized delay in the implementation of a new taxation scheme, despite the fact that the delay temporarily thrust an unequal burden of taxation on other categories of real property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">We next consider the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs contentions that further postponements of the revaluation by the defendant, pursuant to P.A. 95-283, \u00a7 8, and P.A. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, were invalid. The plaintiff also argues the merits of those contentions. The defendant responds that: (1) the trial court was correct in its determination that it lacked jurisdiction; (2) if the trial court was incorrect, the plaintiffs contentions lack merit; and (3) in any event, subsequent legislation, namely, P.A. 97-254, \u00a7 1 (b), renders any challenge to the defendant\u2019s actions moot by authorizing the defendant to postpone its revaluation until 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">We conclude that the court did have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the plaintiffs claims regarding the two additional postponements, as well as the validity of P.A. 95-283, \u00a7 8, and P.A. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3. Ordinarily that conclusion would lead us to remand the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>to the trial court to adjudicate those claims in the first instance. In this case, however, we have decided to address those claims because they do not require further fact-finding, they are adequately briefed here, and both the plaintiff and the defendant need to know now what their respective tax obligations and rights are. We conclude that P.A. 97-254 lays to rest any question about the defendant\u2019s actions in postponing the revaluation beyond 1994, and that the defendant need not conduct a revaluation until 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to the remainder of our analysis. After the completion of the evidence in this case but before the trial court issued its memorandum of decision on March 10,1997, the parties, following a status conference with the trial court on October 16, 1996, in early November, 1996, entered into a written supplemental stipulation to the following facts. On December 12,1995, the common council voted, pursuant to P.A. 95-283, \u00a7 8, to postpone for an additional one year period the implementation of the defendant\u2019s revaluation for the grand list of October 1, 1995. Accordingly, the defendant adopted its annual budget for the 1996-97 fiscal year based on the October 1, 1995 grand list, using the assessment values established in 1983, and the plaintiff was presented with a tax bill for the October 1,1995 grand list of $1,122,825. The parties further stipulated that, on August 13, 1996, the common council voted, pursuant to P.A. 96-218, to postpone for an additional one year period the implementation of the revaluation for the grand list of October 1, 1996. In addition, although it was not formally part of the stipulation, it is undisputed that this action of the defendant in 1996 had the effect of continuing, for an additional, fourth fiscal year, the use of the 1983 assessment values.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Furthermore, the parties filed supplemental posttrial briefs addressing the issues of the applicability of P.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>95-283 and P.A. 96-218 to the 1995 and 1996 grand lists, as well as the issues regarding the constitutionality of those acts, and the defendant filed additional exhibits in connection with those issues. The plaintiffs claims in these supplemental proceedings mirrored its claims regarding the actions of the defendant in 1994, and the effect thereon of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4. More specifically, the plaintiff claimed that: (1) nothing in either P.A. 95-283 or P.A. 96-218 authorized the defendant to continue to postpone the revaluation; and (2) application of those acts would deprive the plaintiff of equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The trial court, however, specifically declined to address the plaintiffs claims regarding P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218 and the two grand lists in issue, for two reasons. First, the plaintiff had not amended its complaint to include the challenges to the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218. Second, the plaintiff was seeking a declaratory judgment as well as relief under \u00a7 12-119. Thus, the court reasoned, although notice had been given pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55 (4), to all interested parties, namely, all Norwalk taxpayers and the chief executive officers of the other 168 municipalities, with respect to the plaintiffs challenges to the 1994 grand list and Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, no such notice had been given with respect to its challenges to the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218. The defendant, although it did not object to the trial court\u2019s consideration of the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218, and instead argued in that court against the plaintiffs claims on their merits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>adopts on appeal the trial court\u2019s reasons for declining to address the claims at issue. We disagree with both reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">With respect to the lack of an amendment of the complaint, it is true that ordinarily a court may not grant relief on the basis of an unpleaded claim. <em>Willametz </em>v. <em>Guida-Seibert Dairy Co., </em>157 Conn. 295, 302, 254 A.2d 473 (1968) (\u201c \u2018[a] plaintiff may not allege one cause of action and recover upon another\u2019 \u201d); <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Steinberg, </em>138 Conn. 718, 721, 89 A.2d 213 (1952) (same). That does not necessarily mean, however, that the absence of a particular claim from the pleadings automatically precludes a trial court from addressing the claim, because a court may, despite pleading deficiencies, decide a case on the basis on which it was actually litigated and may, in such an instance, permit the amendment of a complaint, even after the trial, to conform to that actuality. See, e.g., <em>Saphir v. Neustadt, </em>177 Conn. 191, 206, 413 A.2d 843 (1979). Indeed, we have recognized that, even in the absence of such an amendment, where the trial court had in fact addressed a technically unpleaded claim that was actually litigated by the parties, it was improper for the Appellate Court to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment for lack of such an amendment. See, e.g., <em>Tedesco </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>215 Conn. 450, 458-63, 576 A.2d 1273 (1990), remanded, 24 Conn. App. 377, 588 A.2d 656 (1991), rev\u2019d, 222 Conn. 233, 610 A.2d 574 (1992). Whether to grant such a post-trial amendment is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 564, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984) (\u201c \u2018[t]he trial court has wide discretion in granting or denying amendments before, during, or after trial\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Godfried, </em>181 Conn. 214, 216, 435 A.2d 15 (1980) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In the present case, the only appropriate procedure for the trial court to employ would have been to decide the issues despite the lack of such an amendment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to permit the complaint to be amended posttrial so as to conform to the parties\u2019 proof. The parties, after a status conference with the court, had entered into a factual stipulation reflecting the issues raised under P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218, had entered exhibits in connection therewith, and had extensively briefed the issues presented. No one would have been surprised or prejudiced by consideration of the issues. Under these circumstances, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to decline to adjudicate those issues based on a lack of a formal amendment of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The second reason given by the trial court, namely, the lack of notice to interested parties with regard to the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218, poses different considerations. We conclude, nonetheless, that this reason was insufficient to preclude the trial court\u2019s consideration of those issues because, apart from the plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief, the plaintiffs nondeclaratory claim for relief under \u00a7 12-119 was before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The trial court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment regarding P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218 because, although notice had been given to all Norwalk taxpayers and to the chief executive officers of the other 168 Connecticut municipalities regarding the plaintiffs challenges to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 \u2014 who presumably were the \u201cinterested parties\u201d to whom notice was required to be given pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) \u2014 no such notice had been given to them regarding the subsequent challenges to P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218. This conclusion was based on the principle, under our declaratory judgment jurisprudence, that the failure to give notice to interested parties under Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) deprives the court of jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment. See, <em>e.g., Russo </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>184 Conn. 30, 33-35, 441 A.2d 56 (1981); compare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Serrani </em>v. <em>Board of Ethics, </em>225 Conn. 305, 309 n.5, 622 A.2d 1009 (1993) (initial failure to give notice only deprives court of jurisdiction to render judgment; such failure may be remedied by subsequent notice); <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Raymark Corp., </em>215 Conn. 224, 230, 575 A.2d 693 (1990) (same).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">This principle is not dispositive of the claims concerning the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218, however, because in connection with its claim for declaratory relief, the plaintiff concomitantly sought substantive relief as a taxpayer under \u00a7 12-119, through which claim for relief all of its claims regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and those acts were validly presented to the trial court. Section 12-119 applies to two types of taxpayer challenges to a town\u2019s real property assessment or revaluation. The first, not involved here, applies to \u201cthe absolute nontaxability of the property in the municipality where situated . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>224 Conn. 110, 118-19, 617 A.2d 433 (1992). The second, which the plaintiff invoked here, \u201cconsists of claims that assessments are (a) manifestly excessive and (b) . . . could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of the property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 119. Under this second category of claim, the plaintiff must establish, in addition to a manifestly excessive valuation, that the assessment is illegal. Id. The substantive claims included in the plaintiffs declaratory judgment count \u2014 the claims regarding the 1995 and 1996 grand lists, as affecting its property, and regarding the inapplicability and invalidity of P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218 with respect to those two grand lists \u2014 were therefore properly raised in the plaintiffs complaint under the \u00a7 12-119 count. The concomitant request for declaratory relief did not diminish the propriety of raising those claims in the nondeclaratory portion of its complaint. Indeed, we have made clear that \u201ca declaratory judgment action must rest on some cause of action that would be cognizable in a nondeclar-atory suit.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 116. Thus, even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the plaintiff was required by Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) to give further notice of its additional claims, any lack of proper notice under that section with respect to the declaratory judgment count did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to consider those claims in the context of the plaintiffs nondeclaratory count. Because the plaintiff was entitled to, and did, raise those claims in its complaint under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u00a7 12-119, it was improper for the court to decline to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We acknowledge that in <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 563, 552 A.2d 796 (1989), which involved a challenge to the validity of a decision of the Ridgefield planning and zoning commission and the regulation upon which the decision was based, we stated that certain general challenges to the legality of legislation in which many persons may have an interest may be brought only through a declaratory judgment action, in order to ensure that notice be provided to all interested parties. Id. (\u201c[t]he final constitutional issue, relating to the adequacy of the regulations in setting forth standards for a decision upon an application, constitutes the kind of general attack upon land use regulations that we have indicated should be the subject of a declaratory judgment action rather than an appeal from the denial of an application submitted pursuant to those regulations\u201d); see also <em>Bombero </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>218 Conn. 737, 745, 591 A.2d 390 (1991) (stating that <em>Cioffoletti </em>rule applied where \u201cthe plaintiff mounts a general attack on the legislative enactment of a regulation, primarily based on constitutional vagueness grounds, and combines therewith nonconstitutional grounds for the regulation\u2019s invalidity\u201d). If the <em>Cioffoletti </em>rule were applied in the present case, it effectively would preclude \u00a7 12-119 as a vehicle for the plaintiffs claims regarding the validity of the 1995 and 1996 grand lists and P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In our view, however, that rule, which limits the ability of parties to pursue statutory avenues of appeal in regard to municipal or agency legislation, is ill-conceived. First, it has little support in our case law. None of the three cases cited in <em>Cioffoletti </em>\u2014 National <em>Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>123 Conn. 468, 478, 196 A. 344 (1937); <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 428-30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>115 A.2d 328 (1955); and <em>Russo </em>v. Watertown, supra, 184 Conn. 33-35 \u2014 lends support to the rule and, in fact, <em>Toquet </em>directly undermines it. In <em>Toquet, </em>which involved both a declaratory judgment action and a substantive appeal challenging the validity of a municipal zoning regulation, we held that, although the declaratory judgment action could not be maintained because of a failure to provide the requisite notice to the other interested property owners, the plaintiff could pursue its claims through its substantive appeal. <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>supra, 481-86. <em>Florentine </em>merely articulated the complementary principles that: (1) a litigant may not, in the course of a statutory based appeal concerning the actions of a municipality or an agency, challenge the validity of the statute providing the basis for the appeal; but (2) an independent declaratory judgment action challenging that statute could subsequently be brought. <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>supra, 428-30. <em>Florentine </em>does not, however, suggest that <em>only </em>a declaratory judgment action may be maintained when a party to otherwise proper litigation challenges the validity of legislation that is being applied to the party. Similarly, <em>Russo </em>contained no suggestion of this requirement. Rather, in that case, the plaintiffs challenge to the municipal legislation at issue <em>was </em>a declaratory judgment action. This court\u2019s conclusion that the claim could not be maintained because of the plaintiffs failure to provide notice to all interested parties constituted nothing more than an application of the declaratory judgment notice rule. <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>supra, 33-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In addition, as we acknowledged in <em>Bombero, </em>many of our decisions have allowed plaintiffs to pursue challenges to the validity of municipal or agency regulations or other legislation through actions other than declaratory judgment actions, including through statutory appeals. <em>Bombero </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 744 (citing, as examples, <em>Carofano </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 495 A.2d 1011 [1985]; <em>New Milford v. SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 384 A.2d 337 [1977]; <em>Sonn </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>172 Conn. 156, 374 A.2d 159 [1976]; <em>Zenga </em>v. <em>Zebrowski, </em>170 Conn. 55, 364 A.2d 213 [1975]); see also <em>Rosnick </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>172 Conn. 306, 307-308, 374 A.2d 245 (1977) (after concluding that action challenging zoning regulation could not be maintained as declaratory judgment action because of failure to provide proper notice to all interested parties, court treated complaint as appeal from decision of zoning commission). As we acknowledged in <em>Bombero </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 744, these decisions are difficult to reconcile with the <em>Cioffoletti </em>rule. Especially in conjunction with our cases indicating that a declaratory judgment action is inappropriate when a plaintiff has available another speedy remedy that would be as effective, convenient, appropriate and complete as a declaratory judgment action; see Practice Book \u00a7 390 (c), now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-55 (3); see also, e.g., <em>England </em>v. <em>Coventry, </em>183 Conn. 362, 365, 439 A.2d 372 (1981); these inconsistencies have left the trial courts and potential litigants in confusion regarding the proper form of action to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Finally, in our view, the concern for third party interests in the challenged legislation, the protection of which constitutes the rationale for the <em>Cioffoletti </em>rule, is outweighed by the importance of honoring the legislature\u2019s grant of statutory avenues of appeal with regard to municipal or agency legislation. As we stated in <em>Toquet, </em>\u201c[t]here are many instances in which a party is entitled to relief at law, even though the proceedings he brings may result in the establishment of a rule which will directly affect the interests of others not parties to the action.\u201d <em>National Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>supra, 123 Conn. 481. Indeed, every decision that substantively affects the shape of the law inevitably impacts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>upon the interests of third persons. In general, however, notice to such persons is not required, not only because such a requirement would be unduly burdensome, but also because their interests are adequately represented by a defendant and by a plaintiff with proper standing. In our view, in challenges to the validity of municipal or agency legislation, the interests of the municipality or agency in upholding its legislation provide sufficient protection to the interests of third parties in that legislation and, therefore, it is not necessary to require that such challenges be brought as declaratoiy judgment actions. See id., 482 (\u201cat least in so far as relief to the plaintiff is concerned, the municipality, made a party to the action, represents the residents and property owners within its boundaries\u201d). Therefore, we abandon the <em>Cioffoletti </em>rule requiring that general attacks on the validity of legislation be brought in the form of declaratory judgment actions instead of substantive appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We turn, therefore, to the merits of the plaintiffs claims regarding the 1995 and 1996 grand lists. The plaintiff contends that the postponement of the revaluation by the defendant on those grand lists \u201cwas not statutorily permitted or constitutionally valid.\u201d The plaintiffs constitutional claims are the same as those raised with respect to the 1994 grand list, and are without merit for the same reasons we gave regarding that grand list.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">With respect to the plaintiffs statutory claims, the plaintiff first argues that if Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, \u00a7 51, was invalidly applied to it, \u201cNorwalk cannot rely on either of the subsequent statutory amendments in 1995 and 1996 to further postpone revaluation.\u201d We already have rejected, however, the plaintiffs challenges to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 and the defendant\u2019s conduct thereunder.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The plaintiff next argues that P.A. 95-283, \u00a7 8, and P.A. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, provided no valid statutory authority for the postponements of the revaluation on the 1995 and 1996 grand lists. We need not address the effect of P.A. 96-218, however, because we agree with the defendant that P.A. 97-254, \u00a7 1 (b) (1), expressly permits the defendant to postpone its revaluation until 1999, rendering moot any issues regarding P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218. In P.A. 97-254, the legislature again addressed the ongoing issue of municipal revaluations that had occupied its attention since 1994. In subsection (b) (1) of P.A. 97-254, \u00a7 1, the legislature provided that: \u201cThe assessor or board of assessors of each town shall revalue all of the real estate in their respective municipalities in accordance with the schedule provided in this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a town from effecting more frequent revaluations between the implementation of each revaluation required in accordance with the provisions of this section. . . .\u201d There then followed a three column table. The first column was titled \u201cTown/City\u201d; the second column was titled \u201cYear of Next Revaluation\u201d; and the third column was titled \u201cYear of Subsequent Revaluation.\u201d For Norwalk, the year of the next revaluation was 1999, and the year of subsequent revaluation was 2003. It is clear from the language of P.A. 97-254, \u00a7 1 (b) (1), which is consistent with its legislative histoiy; see Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Finance, Revenue and Bonding, Pt. 3, 1997 Sess., pp. 799-800, 824-25, 908-909, 978, 1020, 1025-26; 40 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1997 Sess., p. 1849; 40 S.

Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) is an example of such a rule. It may be questionable that the judges may, pursuant to their rule-making authority under subsection (b) of \u00a7 52-29, limit the subject matter jurisdiction created by subsection (a) of \u00a7 52-29.

The majority would have us believe that the law allows the defendant city of Norwalk (Norwalk), to ignore the statutes of Connecticut and the constitution of the United States in order to give a tax break to the residential property owners of the city at the expense of the industrial and commercial (industrial) property owners and the residential condominium (condominium) property owners. As a result of Norwalk\u2019s decision to retain the 1983 real property valuations for establishing the grand lists of 1993,1994,1995 and 1996, industrial and condominium property is now assessed at a rate substantially greater than residential property, and as a result, owners of these properties must pay excessive taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The majority\u2019s analysis of Norwalk\u2019s decision to stay implementation of its 1993 revaluation, based upon whether Norwalk constitutionally could impose different tax burdens on different classes of property, is irrelevant for this case. Instead, we must determine whether Norwalk\u2019s decision to pursue a policy that has systematically undervalued residential property and overvalued industrial and condominium properties, denies the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>plaintiff GTE Realty Corporation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an industrial property owner, of its right to equal protection of the laws when state law requires that all real estate \u2014 residential, industrial and condominium properties \u2014 be treated as one class and assessed at 70 percent of true and actual value.

Norwalk\u2019s last decennial revaluation was in 1983. Accordingly, a decennial revaluation for the 1993 grand list was due in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-62.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">2. Norwalk conducted and completed a physical revaluation of all property in 1993 with the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>establish a new grand list as of October, 1993, based upon the assessment of all property at 70 percent of its true and actual value. Norwalk then notified taxpayers of their new assessments, and made available to the public the revaluation assessment data and the assessors who performed the revaluation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">3. The board of tax review conducted hearings on appeals of the 1993 revaluation, and, contrary to the claim of the majority, rendered decisions thereon; thereafter, numerous appeals were taken to the Superior Court. The plaintiff appealed its new assessment to the board of tax review; that appeal was denied and the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court. That appeal is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">4. At the March 8, 1994 meeting of the Norwalk common council (common council) Mayor Frank Esposito requested and was granted authorization to seek a deferment of the implementation of the 1993 property revaluation from the state office of policy and management for a period not to exceed three years. By letter dated March 16, 1994, the board of tax review applied to the office of policy and management for a one year extension. The office of policy and management is authorized by General Statutes (1993) \u00a7 12-117<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to extend the period of time prescribed by law for the completion of the decennial revaluation for a period not exceeding two months. The office of policy and management granted Norwalk a two month extension that expired on May 31, 1994.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>5. The Norwalk charter requires the board of estimate and taxation, on the first Monday of April (here, April 4, 1994), to establish the final budget, and to adopt a mill rate based upon the grand list.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">6. On April 4,1994, the board of estimate and taxation established a final budget, and, without any authority, established a mill rate based on the October 1, 1983 valuations. This action was taken by the board of estimate and taxation, notwithstanding the fact that all the real property was reevaluated to reflect 1993 valuations, assessments were made on that basis, property owners were given official notices of their assessment and more than 1800 owners challenged those assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">7. On or about June 1,1994, while the plaintiffs appeal was pending, Norwalk issued the tax bills based upon 1983 property values.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">8. On June 9, 1994, the legislature enacted, in the May, 1994 special session, No. 94-4, \u00a7 51, of the Public Acts (Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provides that the legislative body of a municipality <em>may </em>stay implementation of a decennial revaluation for up to two years. That act, which was codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 12-62h, more specifically provides in part that \u201c[a]ny municipality required to implement revaluation for the assessment year commencing October 1, 1993, which has not as of February 15, 1994, adopted mill rates for taxes due July 1,1994, may use such municipality\u2019s most recently completed grand list prior to revaluation as updated by any additions, deletions, splits, combinations and other changes in ownership as of October 1, 1993\u201d in order to implement the recommendations of the property tax reform commission (reform commission).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>9. On June 28, 1994, the common council suspended its rules and, purporting to act pursuant to Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, adopted a motion authorizing a stay of implementation for Norwalk\u2019s 1993 decennial revaluation for a period not to exceed two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">10. On December 27, 1994, the common council narrowly passed a motion to ratify the stay of the 1993 revaluation until July 1, 1996, by a vote of seven to six.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">11. Pursuant to No. 95-283, \u00a7 8, of the 1995 Public Acts (P.A. 95-283),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and No. 96-218, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3, of the 1996 Public Acts (P.A. 96-218),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the legislature amended Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 so as to enable the legislative body of a municipalify to extend the stay of implementation of the decennial revaluation beyond that provided for in Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, and to enable municipalities to continue to use their most recently completed grand list prior to revaluation. As a result of these amendments, Norwalk, through successive votes by the common council, has stayed revaluation until October 1, 1997.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Because Norwalk effectively adopted a tax based upon the 1993 revaluation on April 4, 1994, Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 does not apply to this appeal. As of April 4, 1994, the date Norwalk was required under its charter to establish the final 1994-95 budget and to adopt a mill rate based on the 1993 revaluation, it had taken all the necessary action to implement the decennial revaluation except making the ministerial calculation of establishing the mill rate based upon the 1993 revaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>First, Norwalk conducted a physical revaluation of all real estate based upon <em>1993 values </em>and established a proposed 1993 grand list on the basis of this revaluation. Second, in the fall of 1993, Norwalk sent revaluation notices to all the property owners. Third, Norwalk\u2019s director of finance, Jack E. Miller, submitted the proposed operation budget, which was based upon the 1993 revaluation, to the board of estimate and taxation at its January 24, 1994 meeting. Fourth, the appraisers held informal review sessions with property owners in order to make voluntary adjustments. Fifth, the board of tax review conducted hearings on appeals by individual property owners, all of which were based, not upon the 1983 revaluation, but on the 1993 revaluation; some appeals were taken to the Superior Court by individual owners. Sixth, Norwalk notified property owners by mail on February 10, 1994, that the current mill rate for the 1992 grand list would not be used to determine their July, 1994 tax bills, but, rather, Norwalk would adopt a reduced mill rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Consequently, all that Norwalk had to do in order to complete implementation of the 1993 revaluation at the April 4, 1994 meeting of the board of estimate and taxation was to establish the final budget, which it did, and complete the ministerial task of calculating the mill rate based upon the 1993 revaluation. \u201cThe word \u2018ministerial\u2019 under our law refers to a duty which is to be performed by an official \u2018in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner . . . without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment [or discretion] upon the propriety of the act being done.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pluhowsky </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>151 Conn. 337, 347, 197 A.2d 645 (1964). This court made it clear, as early as 1925, that \u201cofficers whose duty it is to value and assess property may be compelled by mandamus to proceed in the discharge of their duties . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>103 Conn. 607, 615, 132 A. 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>(1925). Indeed, the Norwalk charter and the statute that existed on April 4, 1994, the date the board of estimate and taxation set the mill rate, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-62, imposed a duty on Norwalk officials to complete the revaluation process \u2014 by using the assessments derived from the 1993 revaluation \u201cfor the purpose of levying taxes\u201d \u2014 in a prescribed manner, without regard to their own judgments. <em>Chamber of Commerce of Greater Waterbury, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>179 Conn. 712, 719-20, 427 A. 2d 866 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Instead of performing this ministerial act, the board of estimate and taxation, on April 4, 1994, without authority and contrary to law, established the mill rate based upon the 1983 revaluation, and caused tax bills to be sent to the property owners with the mill rate applied to the 1983 values. Indeed, that was done without the approval of the common council, Norwalk\u2019s legislative body. It is contrary to our rule of law to allow Norwalk, after it blatantly ignored General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-62a (b) and 12-63<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by favoring one group of taxpayers at the expense of others, to take advantage of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4. Rather, as a matter of law, we must consider that Norwalk, on April 4,1994, effectively adopted its property tax based on 1993 real estate values, and, consequently, that Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Even if Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 is applicable, I conclude that Norwalk\u2019s election to implement it for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of continuing the disparity in assessed values of industrial, condominium and residential properties \u2014 properties that our legislature has mandated be assessed at a uniform rate \u2014 violates the equal protection rights of the plaintiff and other industrial and condominium property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The majority argues that the plaintiff cannot prove Norwalk\u2019s implementation of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 violates its right to equal protection of the laws unless it makes an \u201cexplicit demonstration\u201d that Norwalk\u2019s decision to postpone implementation of the 1993 revaluation \u201cis a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.\u201d The majority\u2019s conclusion, however, is contrary to clear United States Supreme Court precedent. First, the law is clear that even though Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 is valid on its face, the plaintiff may prove that Norwalk\u2019s implementation of the act violates its equal protection rights by showing that (1) the implementation results in unequal treatment for \u201cthose who are entitled to be treated alike [and (2)] there is shown to be present in [Norwalk\u2019s stay of implementation] an element of intentional or <em>purposeful </em>discrimination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Snowden </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>321 U.S. 1, 8, 64 S. Ct. 397, 88 L. Ed. 497 (1944). Second, the United States Supreme Court has held that <em>purposeful discrimination in tax cases </em>\u201cmay be evidenced ... by a systematic under-valuation of the property of some taxpayers and a systematic over-valuation of the property of others, so that the practical effect of the official breach of law is the same as though the discrimination were incorporated in and proclaimed by the statute.\u201d Id., 9; <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Commission of Webster County, West Virginia, </em>488 U.S. 336, 346, 109 S. Ct. 633, 102 L. Ed. 2d 688 (1989) (\u201c[t]he relative undervaluation of comparable property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>. . . over time therefore denies petitioners the equal protection of the law\u201d); see also <em>Long Island Lighting Co. </em>v. <em>Brookhaven, </em>889 F.2d 428, 432 (2d Cir. 1989) (\u201crequisite unlawful intent [to discriminate] follows from proof of a systematic overassessment over time of certain properties as compared to other similarly situated properties within the taxing district\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The plaintiff is <em>entitled to be treated </em>like all other property owners by Norwalk\u2019s mayor, common council and board of estimate and taxation with respect to the assessment of its real property. Without exception, the legislature has mandated as our law and public policy that the towns and municipalities tax all real estate\u2014 whether it be residential, industrial or condominium property \u2014 on the same basis. General Statutes \u00a7 12-62a (b) provides in relevant part that the city \u201cshall . . . assess all property for purposes of the local property tax at a uniform rate of seventy per cent of <em>present true and actual value </em>as determined under section 12-63.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-63 provides in relevant part that the \u201cpresent true and actual value . . . shall be deemed by all assessors and boards of assessment appeals to be <em>the fair market value </em>thereof . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Prior to the enactment of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 12-62 provided that all towns and municipalities reassess their taxable property every ten years. Although Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 authorized Nor-walk to stay implementation of the 1993 revaluation, and thus waived the requirement of \u00a7 12-62, it did not require it to do so, nor did it relieve Norwalk of the constitutional requirement of seasonably attaining \u201ca rough equality in the tax treatment of similarly situated property owners.\u201d <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Commission of Webster County, West Virginia, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 343. Finally, there is no statutory authority in Connecticut authorizing individual municipalities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>to fashion their own substantive assessment policies independently of state statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Norwalk\u2019s stay of implementation for four years resulted in <em>unequal treatment </em>of the plaintiff and other industrial and condominium property owners. Simply put, as a result of Norwalk\u2019s stay of the 1993 revaluation, industrial and condominium properties have been assessed at a substantially higher percentage of fair market value than has residential property in Norwalk. For example, if the 1993 revaluation, based upon the then current fair market values for all property in Nor-walk, had been put into effect in 1994, condominium property owners would have paid 12.25 percent less in taxes, industrial property owners would have paid 7.74 percent less, and residential property owners would have paid 15.4 percent more. Indeed, as a result of Norwalk\u2019s postponement of the implementation of the 1993 revaluation, the plaintiffs tax bill on the 1993 grand list increased by $432,648.16, or 39 percent more than what it would have been had the 1993 revaluation been implemented. During the pendency of this case, Nor-walk, acting pursuant to P.A. 95-283 and P.A. 96-218, postponed revaluation for two more years \u2014 for a total of four years from the grand list of October 1, 1993 to October 1, 1997. During that time period, the plaintiff and other similarly situated property owners have been significantly impacted by the delay in revaluation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">This lack of uniformity in tax assessments of real property has resulted, not from \u201cmere mistake or error in judgment of tax officials\u201d; <em>Charleston Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>supra, 324 U.S. 190; but from <em>Norwalk\u2019s intentional decision to systematically discriminate </em>against industrial and condominium property owners and in favor of residential property owners. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The members of Norwalk\u2019s finance committee were well informed of the obvious adverse impact on residential property owners of immediate implementation of the 1993 revaluation, and the obvious adverse impact on industrial and condominium property owners of staying implementation of the 1993 revaluation. Indeed, in a memorandum dated December 1, 1994, Miller, Nor-walk\u2019s finance director, explained to the finance committee that \u201c[t]he State requirement that municipalities must revalue all real property not less than every ten years has caught us in an economic cycle where commercial property values have lagged against residential property appreciation. Thus, if revaluation is implemented in this cycle, the unavoidable result is that residential property assessments will comprise a greater proportion of the Grand List of all assessable property and consequently bear a greater proportion of taxes. This <em>unfortunate result, </em>from the viewpoint of most residential property owners, is further aggravated because personal property owned principally by commercial businesses will also drop significantly as a component of the taxable Grand List and <em>push even more of the tax burden onto residential property </em>owners.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Furthermore, the minutes of the December 27, 1994 meeting of the common council, at which the council was asked to \u201cclarify its intent\u201d regarding its prior action staying implementation of the 1993 revaluation, indicate that Norwalk\u2019s <em>sole purpose </em>had been to favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the residential property owners at the expense of all other property owners. Council member John Lombardi, who moved that the council continue the stay of implementation until July 1,1996, argued that \u201cimmediate implementation of revaluation would be a disservice to the majority of Norwalkers . . . .\u201d Council member Douglas E. Hempstead, who opposed Lombardi\u2019s motion and offered his own motion to phase in revaluation over a three year period, argued \u201cthat it was unfair to shift the burden to 20-30% of taxpayers to avoid [paying higher taxes].\u201d Another council member, Stephen J. Orris, in concurrence with Hempstead, stated that he thought that 40 percent of Norwalk\u2019s taxpayers were carrying the burden of the new taxation for all other taxpayers. Mayor Esposito concluded discussion on Lombardi\u2019s motion by stating that \u201cthere were many . . . [persons] on fixed incomes . . . [and that] the Council had to consider the \u2018big picture\u2019 [when it considered whether to postpone implementation of the revaluation because] . . . many [persons] could not afford any increase at all.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Moreover, the historical background of Norwalk\u2019s attempt to stay implementation of the 1993 revaluation, by departing from normal procedures set out in its own charter and our statutes, demonstrates that Norwalk intended to benefit residential property owners at the expense of industrial and condominium property owners. The trial court found that \u201cnothing in the city charter or in any other statute\u201d authorized Norwalk\u2019s mayor to attempt unilaterally to stay implementation of the 1993 revaluation in March, 1994, and that \u201csuch action was manifestly inconsistent with General Statutes \u00a7 12-117 by which the legislature had conferred <em>sole </em>authority to delay implementation of a revaluation on the secretary of the office of policy and management.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(Emphasis in original.) Indeed, the board of estimate and taxation, without any statutory authorization, established the 1993 grand list and mill rate based on the 1983 revaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Finally, Norwalk conceded, in its brief and at oral argument, that the revaluation was postponed because it would have had an adverse impact on residential property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">In light of all the foregoing evidence, I have no doubt that Norwalk intentionally undervalued residential property at the expense of overvalued industrial and condominium property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The majority, relying on <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>179 Conn. 627, 427 A.2d 830, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 801, 101 S. Ct. 45, 66 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1980), suggests that even if Norwalk acted intentionally and systematically to protect residential property owners from the effects of the 1993 revaluation, that would not necessarily be unconstitutional because \u201c[t]he government may, without violating the equal protection clause, impose different tax burdens on different classes of property.\u201d I agree with the majority. \u201cA State [without violating the equal protection clause] may divide different kinds of property into classes and assign to each class a different tax burden so long as those divisions and burdens are reasonable. ... It might, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>for example, decide to tax property held by corporations, including petitioners, at a different rate than property held by individuals.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Commission of Webster County, West Virginia, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 344; see also <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 627. I disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s contention that Norwalk\u2019s decision to stay implementation of the 1993 revaluation for the benefit of residential property owners and to the detriment of industrial and condominium property owners can be justified as a legislative classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The majority relies on <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>for support of its contention that Norwalk\u2019s stay of implementation is actually a tax classification scheme. The statute in question in that case, General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 12-62a (e),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> authorized municipalities whose total real property assessments increased after revaluation by at least 30 percent over the prior year\u2019s assessment to phase in the assessment of realty with an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>increased assessment in <em>equal </em>amounts over a period not to exceed five years. <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 631-32. In the present case, the legislature did not classify properties in groups, as was the case in <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>in order to allow orderly implementation of tax revaluation. Rather, the legislature authorized, but did not mandate, municipalities to stay implementation of revaluation \u201cin order to implement the recommendations of the [reform commission] enacted during the 1995 session of the general assembly.\u201d Spec. Sess. 94-4, \u00a7 51. There is no language in Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 that, even remotely, can be construed as authorizing a legislative classification that would allow Norwalk to tax industrial and condominium properties at a higher rate than residential property. Contrary to the stated purpose of Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, and the clear mandate of \u00a7 12-62a (b), Norwalk utilized Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4 for the purpose of discriminating against industrial and condominium property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Our analysis of the present case is more properly informed by a review of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>v. <em>County Commission of Webster County, West Virginia, </em>supra, 488 U.S. 336, evaluating the constitutionality of Webster County, West Virginia\u2019s method of assessing recently acquired property on the basis of the consideration recited in the deed, while increasing the assessed values of the remaining properties at a much lower rate. In that case, the court noted that Webster County\u2019s assessment method resulted in gross disparities in the assessed value of generally comparable property, and was in violation of West Virginia\u2019s constitutional provision<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that \u201ctaxation shall be equal and uniform throughout the State, and all property, both real and personal, shall be taxed in proportion to its value . . . .\u2019\u2019(Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id., 338. The court further noted that, even though states possess broad powers to classify property for tax purposes, no state statute authorized the Webster County tax assessor to impose unequal tax burdens on property owners. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Similarly, Norwalk has followed a system of tax assessment \u2014 a stay of the statutorily mandated revaluation \u2014 that fails to account for the marked changes in market values for residential, industrial and condominium properties since the 1983 revaluation. Moreover, Norwalk\u2019s decision to postpone implementation of the 1993 revaluation for four years and to continue to undervalue residential property and overvalue industrial and condominium property, is contrary to state law, which requires all property to be assessed on the same basis. Furthermore, there is no indication that our legislature, from whom all local taxing authority is derived; <em>Burwell </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>178 Conn. 509, 517, 423 A.2d 156 (1979); sanctioned Norwalk\u2019s intentional violation of \u00a7\u00a7 12-62a and 12-63 by enacting Spec. Sess. P.A. 94-4, or any subsequent tax reform statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The relevance of <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>to this appeal is highlighted by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>505 U.S. 1, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992), upholding California\u2019s adoption of a tax assessment method,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> analogous to the method employed by the Webster County tax assessor, that resulted in great disparities in tax treatment for owners of comparable properties. The Supreme Court held that California\u2019s system of assessing newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>purchased real property at its full value, while assessing older properties at a different rate, did not violate the equal protection clause because this difference in tax treatment rationally furthered California\u2019s legitimate interest in preserving local neighborhoods and protecting existing property owners\u2019 reliance interests. Id., 13. The <em>Nordlinger </em>court distinguished the ruling in <em>Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. </em>on the basis of two factors: (1) there was no conceivable indication that the \u201cpolicies underlying an acquisition-value taxation scheme could conceivably have been the purpose for the Webster County tax assessor\u2019s unequal assessment scheme,\u201d and (2) unlike California, West Virginia\u2019s constitution and statutes did not sanction such discrimination. Id., 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Likewise, there is no conceivable indication that any purpose, other than Norwalk\u2019s desire to \u201calleviate the [tax] burden on single-family homeowners,\u201d at the expense of property owners of the same class, underlay Norwalk\u2019s decision to stay implementation of the 1993 revaluation for four years. Nor is there any statutory sanction to justify Norwalk\u2019s discriminatory policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Professor Laurence H. Tribe reminds us that the \u201cMadisonian ideal of law as the expression of a general public good stands in sharp opposition to the pluralist notion that law aspires merely to satisfy the preferences of ad hoc interest groups.\u201d L.
