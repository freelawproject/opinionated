The trial court found the defendant not guilty of nineteen counts of assault in the first degree. Those counts had charged him with either personally inflicting the injuries or not preventing the child\u2019s mother from inflicting the injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>imposed a total effective sentence of forty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the conviction for risk of injury to a child,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but reversed the assault convictions concluding that the defendant had no legal duty to act under the circumstances of this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>41 Conn. App. 333, 341, 675 A.2d 925 (1996). This court granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant could not be convicted of violating General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) because he had no legal duty to protect the victim from parental abuse?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>237 Conn. 932, 677 A.2d 1372 (1996). We conclude that, based upon the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant had established a familial relationship with the victim\u2019s mother and her two children, had assumed responsibility for the welfare of the children, and had taken care of them as though he were their father, the defendant had a legal duty to protect the victim from abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">As set forth in its memorandum of decision, the trial court found the following facts. The defendant commenced living with his girlfriend and her two children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>in an apartment in September, 1992. On January 27, 1993, the defendant was twenty-one years old, his girlfriend was sixteen, her son was two, and her daughter, the victim in this case, bom on September 21, 1992, was four months old. Although he was not the biological father of either child, the defendant took care of them and considered himself to be their stepfather. He represented himself as such to the people at Meriden Veteran\u2019s Memorial Hospital where, on January 27, 1993, the victim was taken for treatment of her injuries following a 911 call by the defendant that the child was choking on milk. Upon examination at the hospital, it was determined that the victim had multiple rib fractures that were approximately two to three weeks old, two skull fractures that were approximately seven to ten days old, a brachial plexus injury to her left arm, a rectal tear that was actively \u201coozing blood\u201d and bilateral sub-conjunctival nasal hemorrhages. On the basis of extensive medical evidence, the trial court determined that the injuries had been sustained on three or more occasions and that none of the injuries had been the result of an accident, a fall, events that took place at the time of the child\u2019s birth, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a blocked air passageway or the child choking on milk. Rather, the trial court found that the injuries, many of which created a risk of death, had been caused by great and deliberate force.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial court further found in accordance with the medical evidence that, as a result of the nature of these injuries, at the time they were sustained the victim would have screamed inconsolably, and that her injuries would have caused noticeable physical deformities, such as swelling, bruising and poor mobility, and finally, that her intake of food would have been reduced. The court also determined that anyone who saw the child would have had to notice these injuries, the consequent deformities and her reactions. Indeed, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>found that the defendant had been aware of the various bruises on her right cheek and the subconjunctival nasal hemorrhages, as well as the swelling of the child\u2019s head, that he knew she had suffered a rectal tear, as well as rib fractures posteriorly on the left and right sides, and that he was aware that there existed a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the child was exposed to conduct that created a risk of death. The trial court concluded that despite this knowledge, the defendant \u201cfailed to act to help or aid [the child] by promptly notifying authorities of her injuries, taking her for medical care, removing her from her circumstances and guarding her from future abuses. As a result of his failure to help her, the child was exposed to conduct which created a risk of death to her and the child suffered subsequent serious physical injuries . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The trial court concluded that the defendant had a legal duty to protect the health and well-being of the child based on the undisputed facts that he had established a familial relationship with the child\u2019s mother and her two children, that he had voluntarily assumed responsibility for the care and welfare of both children, and that he considered himself the victim\u2019s stepfather. On the basis of these circumstances, the trial court found the defendant guilty of one count of \u00a7 53-21 and six counts of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Before addressing the certified issue of whether the facts and circumstances of this case were sufficient to create a legal duty to protect the victim from parental abuse pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), we turn our attention to the question of whether, even if we assume such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>duty exists, <em>the failure to act </em>can create liability under that statute. In other words, by failing to act in accordance with a duty, does a defendant commit a crime, such as assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), that is not specifically defined by statute in terms of an omission to act but only in terms of cause and result?<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether a failure to discharge a legal duty to protect a child constitutes an omission punishable as an assault is a question of law subject to de novo review by this court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Solek, </em>242 Conn. 409, 419, 699 A.2d 931 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The trend of Anglo-American law has been toward enlarging the scope of criminal liability for failure to act in those situations in which the common law or statutes have imposed an affirmative responsibility for the safety and well-being of others. See generally 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 3.3; annot., 61 A.L.R.3d 1207 (1975); annot., 100 A.L.R.2d 483 (1965). Criminal liability of parents based on a failure to act in accordance with common-law affirmative duties to protect and care for their children is well recognized in many jurisdictions. See, <em>e.g. People </em>v. <em>Stanciel, </em>153 Ill. 2d 218, 606 N.E.2d 1201 (1992) (mother guilty of homicide by allowing known abuser to assume role of disciplinarian over child); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>408 N.E.2d 614 (Ind. App. 1980) (mother held criminally responsible for failing to prevent fatal beating of child by her lover); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>306 N.C. 466, 293 S.E.2d 780 (1982) (mother guilty of assault for failure to prevent beating); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williquette, </em>129 Wis. 2d 239, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>385 N.W.2d 145 (1986) (mother guilty of child abuse for allowing child to be with person known previously to have been abusive and who subsequently abused child again).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of this duty to protect and care for children, courts in these jurisdictions have concluded that, where this duty exists and injury results, the failure to protect the child from harm will be \u201cdeemed to be the cause of those injuries\u201d and the person bearing the duty may face criminal sanctions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>116 Idaho 851, 855, 780 P.2d 602 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Although our research has revealed no case by this court in which we expressly have held a parent criminally liable for failure to act to save his or her child from harm,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Appellate Court has recognized that criminal liability may attach not only to overt acts but also to an omission to act when there is a legal duty to do so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 339; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>34 Conn. App. 807, 812-13, 644 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>355, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 909, 648 A.2d 158 (1994) (defendant\u2019s failure to call ambulance or seek help for his obviously injured child indicated \u201cconscious disregard of a substantial risk of death\u201d within meaning of \u00a7 53a-59 [a] [3]). We agree that criminal conduct can arise not only through overt acts, but also by an omission to act when there is a legal duty to do so. \u201cOmissions are as capable of producing consequences as overt acts. Thus, the common law rule that there is no general duty to protect limits criminal liability where it would otherwise exist. The special relationship exception to the \u2018no duty to act\u2019 rule represents a choice to retain liability for some omissions, which are considered morally unacceptable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williquette, </em>supra, 129 Wis. 2d 253. Therefore, had the defendant been the victim\u2019s parent \u2014 someone with an undisputed affirmative legal obligation to protect and provide for his minor child<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>\u2014 we would conclude that his failure to protect the child from abuse could constitute a violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We next turn to the issue of whether the duty to protect can be imposed on the defendant, an adult member of the household unrelated to the child. Both the state and the defendant recognize that the determination of the existence of a legal duty is a question of law subject to de novo review by this court. <em>Santopietro </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>239 Conn. 207, 226, 682 A.2d 106 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The defendant argues that there is no statutory or common-law precept \u201cauthorizing the expansion of assault under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).\u201d The state argues that there is both. We conclude that, based on the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>court\u2019s findings that the defendant had established a family-like relationship with the mother and her two children, that he had voluntarily assumed responsibility for the care and welfare of both children, and that he had considered himself the victim\u2019s stepfather, there existed a common-law duty to protect the victim from her mother\u2019s abuse, the breach of which can be the basis of a conviction under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Therefore, we need not decide whether General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-38a, 17a-101 and 17a-103 create an express statutory duty as well.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>There are many statutes that expressly impose a legal duty to act and attach liability for the failure to comply with that duty. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-224 and 14-225. With other statutes, however, the duty to act can be found outside the statutoiy definition of the crime itself, either in another statute; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 12-231 (imposing liability for failure to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 12-222); or in the common law. 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 3.3 (a), p. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">We note initially that the question of whether a duty, and thus, liability for the breach of that duty, should be recognized in this state is not foreclosed by our penal code. Although this notion \u201cdoes not appear in haec verba in the penal code, that lacuna is not determinative in this case, because [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-4 of the code provides: \u2018The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed as precluding any court from recognizing other principles of criminal liability or other defenses not inconsistent with such provisions.\u2019 The official commentary to that provision states: \u2018The purpose of this savings clause is to make clear that the provisions of [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 53a-5 to 53a-23, which define the principles of criminal liability and defenses, are not necessarily exclusive. A court is not precluded by sections 53a-5 to 53a-23 from recognizing other such principles and defenses not inconsistent therewith.\u2019 Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. (West 1985) \u00a7 53a-4, p. 196.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 44-45, 630 A.2d 990 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We do not believe that the principle of imposing a common-law duty in and of itself is inconsistent with any other principle of criminal liability provided in the code. \u201cFailure to act when there is a special relationship does not, by itself, constitute a crime. The failure must expose the dependent person to some proscribed result. The definition of proscribed results constitutes the substantive crime, and it is defined in the criminal code. The rule regarding omissions, therefore, is not inconsistent with [the penal code].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williquette, </em>supra, 129 Wis. 2d 254.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor does the plain language of \u00a7 53a-59 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>(a) (3) preclude criminal liability from attaching to an omission to act when a legal duty to act exists and injury results. See footnote 8 of this opinion. The issue, therefore, is whether the principle should be recognized as a matter of policy under the circumstances of this case. We conclude that, under the facts of this case, it is appropriate to recognize an affirmative duty to act and to impose criminal liability for the failure to act pursuant to that duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u201c \u2018Duty is a legal conclusion about relationships between individuals, made after the fact .... The nature of the duty, and the specific persons to whom it is owed, are determined by the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 45, 675 A.2d 852 (1996). Although one generally has no legal duty to aid another in peril, even when the aid can be provided without danger or inconvenience to the provider, there are four widely recognized situations in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty: (1) where one stands in a certain relationship to another; (2) where a statute imposes a duty to help another; (3) where one has assumed a contractual duty; and (4) where one voluntarily has assumed the care of another. 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 3.3 (a) (l)-(4), pp. 284-87.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The state argues that this case falls within both the first and fourth situations, or some combination thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>We begin with the duty based upon the relationship between the parties. One standing in a certain personal relationship to another person has some affirmative duties of care with regard to that person. \u201cLegal rights and duties . . . may arise out of those complex relations of human society which create correlative rights and duties the performance of which is so necessary to the good order and well-being of society that the state makes their observance obligatory.\u201d Annot., supra, 100 A.L.R.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It is undisputed that parents have a duty to provide food, shelter and medical aid for their children and to protect them from harm. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9489), </em>183 Conn. 11, 15, 438 A.2d 801 (1981). \u201cThe inherent dependency of a child upon his parent to obtain medical aid, i.e., the incapacity of a child to evaluate his condition and summon aid by himself, supports imposition of such a duty upon the parent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Konz, </em>498 Pa. 639, 644, 450 A.2d 638 (1982). Additionally, \u201c \u2018[t]he commonly understood general obligations of parenthood entail these minimum attributes: (1) express love and affection for the child; (2) express personal concern over the health, education and general well-being of the child; (3) the duty to supply the necessary food, clothing, and medical care; (4) the duty to provide an adequate domicile; and (5) the duty to furnish social and religious guidance.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption of Webb, </em>14 Wash. App. 651, 653, 544 P.2d 130 (1975). Indeed, the status relationship giving rise to a duty to provide and protect that has been before the courts more often than any other relationship and, at the same time, the one relationship that courts most frequently assume to exist without expressly so stating, is the relationship existing between a parent and a minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In addition to biological and adoptive parents and legal guardians, there may be other adults who establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>familial relationships with and assume responsibility for the care of a child, thereby creating a legal duty to protect that child from harm. See, e.g., <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>State, </em>159 Fla. 687, 32 So. 2d 610 (1947) (grandmother guilty of manslaughter in death of grandchild where she had assumed care of child but became so intoxicated that she allowed child to smother to death). \u201cRecognizing the primary responsibility of a natural parent does not mean that an unrelated person may not also have some responsibilities incident to the care and custody of a child. Such duties may be regarded as derived from the primary custodian, i.e., the natural parent, or arise from the nature of the circumstances.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>171 Ill. App. 3d 316, 320, 525 N.E.2d 573 (1988); see 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 3.3 (a), p. 286 (\u201cif two people, though not closely related, live together under one roof, one may have a duty to act to aid the other who becomes helpless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Most courts deciding whether, under a particular set of facts, liability for an omission to act may be imposed under a statute that does not itself impose a duty to act, have looked to whether a duty to act exists in another statute, in the common law or in a contract. 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 3.3 (a), p. 283. Of those courts acting outside the context of a statutory or contractual duty that have held a defendant criminally liable for failing to protect a child from injury, most have relied on a combination of both the first and fourth situations described by Professors LaFave and Scott to establish a duty as the predicate for the defendant\u2019s conviction. More specifically, these courts have examined the nature of the relationship of the defendant to the victim and whether the defendant, as part of that relationship, had assumed a responsibility for the victim.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find the reliance by these courts on this combination of factors persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Salley, </em>153 App. Div. 2d 704, 544 N.Y.S.2d 680 (1989), the court examined the issue of whether the defendant, a woman who was living with a man named Taylor and Kenneth, a three year old who was the son of Taylor\u2019s estranged wife and another man, as well as five other children, was guilty of manslaughter in the second degree for failing to secure medical attention for Kenneth, who was being physically abused by Taylor. Taylor had inflicted approximately seventy bruises on Kenneth and Kenneth died from a combination of a fracture, internal bleeding and various wounds to his body. Because the defendant \u201chad assumed the parental obligations of care for Kenneth,\u201d and had been aware of and consciously disregarded the substantial and unjustifiable risk of his death in failing to get Kenneth help during the time he was being abused by Taylor, the court concluded that she properly could be convicted of manslaughter. Id., 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In State v. <em>Orosco, </em>113 N.M. 789, 833 P.2d 1155 (1991), the court examined whether the defendant, who lived with the victim and his mother and who failed to intervene when one of his friends sexually abused the victim, could be held criminally liable for the abuse. Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>supra, 306 N.C. 466, the court held that, by assuming the care and welfare of the child, the defendant stood in the position of a parent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Orosco, </em>supra, 796.</p>\n<p id=\"ADp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In <em>Leet </em>v. <em>State, </em>595 So. 2d 959 (Fla. App. 1991), the court examined whether the defendant could be held criminally responsible for abuse of a child by his mother although he was not the child\u2019s father. The statute at issue required the state to prove \u201c[w]hoever ... by culpable negligence, deprives a child of, or allows a child to be deprived of, necessary food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment, or who, knowingly or by culpable negligence, inflicts or permits the infliction of physical or mental injury to the child . . . .\u201d Id., 961. Despite the broad language of the statute imposing liability on \u201cwhoever,\u201d the court discussed at length the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship with the child victim, and his assumption of responsibility for the child\u2019s care and held that, because the defendant had \u201cassumed responsibility for [the child\u2019s] well-being when he established a family-like relationship with [the child] and his mother,\u201d he could be held responsible for permitting the child\u2019s abuse by his mother. Id., 962-63. Although the defendant had argued that he was not financially responsible for the child and could not have authorized his medical treatment, the court, nevertheless, concluded that he had the authority, and indeed, the duty to prevent the mother\u2019s conduct. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wong, </em>182 App. Div. 2d 98, 588 N.Y.S.2d 119, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 81 N.Y.2d 600, 619 N.E.2d 600, 601 N.Y.S.2d 440 (1993), the court examined whether the defendants, who had been babysitters for the child victim\u2019s parents, could be convicted of manslaughter for harming the child and for failing to provide him with necessary medical care. To support a conviction based upon their failure to provide medical attention, the prosecution relied on two theories: (1) that the defendants had contracted with the child\u2019s parents to care for the child while the parents worked; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that the defendants voluntarily had assumed care for the child. Id., 108. The court embraced both theories, recognizing that the voluntary assumption of care, as well as a contractual babysitting agreement, were sufficient to trigger a legal duty. Id. The court concluded that by assuming care for the child, the defendants created a legal duty \u201csubstantially coextensive with those which would be borne by a parent . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. Although the New York Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of the defendants due to insufficient evidence, it nevertheless endorsed the state\u2019s theory of prosecution as \u201clegally sound.\u201d <em>People </em>v. Wong, supra, 81 N.Y.2d 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As these cases demonstrate, the traditional approach in this country is to restrict the duty to save others from harm to certain very narrow categories of cases. We are not prepared now to adopt a broad general rule covering other circumstances.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude only that, in accordance with the trial court findings, when the defendant, who considered himself the victim\u2019s parent, established a familial relationship with the victim\u2019s mother and her children and assumed the role of a father, he assumed, under the common law, the same legal duty to protect the victim from the abuse as if he were, in fact, the victim\u2019s guardian. Under these circumstances, to require the defendant as a matter of law to take affirmative action to prevent harm to the victim or be criminally responsible imposes a reasonable duty.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That duty does not depend on an ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>regulate the mother\u2019s discipline of the victim or on the defendant having exclusive control of the victim when the injuries occurred. Nor is the duty contingent upon an ability by the state or the mother to look to the defendant for child support.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, whether the defendant had created a total in loco parentis relationship with the victim by January, 1993, is not dispositive of whether the defendant had assumed a responsibility for the victim. <em>Leet </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 595 So. 2d 962. \u201cIf immediate or emergency medical attention is required from a child\u2019s custodian it should not matter that such custodian is not the primary care provider or for that matter a legally designated surrogate.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Berg, </em>supra, 171 Ill. App. 3d 320 (wherein court concluded that although defendant had duty as \u201cany person\u201d under child endangerment statute based upon evidence that he lived with victim and her mother, would play with victim, feed and clothe her, discipline her and take her places, under circumstances of case there was insufficient evidence that defendant had endangered victim\u2019s health by not obtaining medical treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Nor should we reject the concept of a duty in this case because the defendant might not have been able to authorize medical treatment for the victim had he taken her to the hospital. The status required to impose the legal duty to safeguard the victim is not coextensive with the status that permits one to authorize treatment. Quite obviously, had the defendant brought the victim to the hospital at any time throughout the four month period during which she was abused by her mother, a physician would have had the ability to examine and treat her, and the costs would be paid by her parent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>guardian or the state, if necessary. \u201cAny physician examining a child with respect to whom abuse is suspected shall . . . have the right to keep such child in the custody of a hospital . . . and . . . perform diagnostic tests and procedures necessary to the detection of child abuse with or without the consent of his parents, guardian or other person having responsibility for his care .... The expenses for such temporary care and such diagnostic tests and procedures shall be paid by the parents or guardian of such child or, if they are unable to pay, by the commissioner of children and families.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 17a-101 (d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Finally, we recognize the continuing demographic trend reflecting a significant increase in nontraditional alternative family arrangements. United States Bureau of the Census, Marital Status and Living Arrangements: March 1984, Current Population Reports, Series p-20, No. 399 (1985). Consequently, more and more children will be living with or may depend upon adults who do not qualify as a natural or adoptive parent. The attachment by children to the adults who care for them does not, however, depend exclusively upon whether the caregiver is the natural or adoptive parent or another person who has assumed the caretaker role. Children become attached to people who care for them, and this attachment is \u201crooted inevitably in the infant\u2019s inability to ensure his own survival. . . .\u201d J. Goldstein, A. Freud &amp; A. Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child (1973) p. 18. To distinguish among children in deciding which ones are entitled to protection based upon whether their adult caregivers have chosen to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>have their relationships officially recognized hardly advances the public policy of protecting children from abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant acknowledges that he could not simply close his eyes to evidence of the brutality the child suffered and that his failure to protect her was punishable under \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, he contends that \u201cthe risk of injury statute implements the state\u2019s public policy of protecting the health and welfare of children and imposes a specific criminal penalty for failure to provide such protection,\u201d by punishing <em>any person </em>who causes or permits a child to be placed in such a situation that the life or limb of that child is endangered. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that although he had a duty under \u00a7 53-21, he did not have a duty under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The logic of his argument is flawed. Indeed, it is well established that this court will look to other relevant statutes governing the same or similar- subject matter because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. <em>Daly </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>225 Conn. 499, 510, 624 A.2d 876 (1993). Therefore, as to the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of duty, because \u00a7 53-21, without any explicit restriction, holds responsible <em>any person </em>who permits abuse of a child to occur, to prescribe a duty in connection with \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) to prevent such abuse furthers \u201ca harmonious and consistent body of law\u201d as opposed to antagonizing legislative intent.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendant had a duty, under the facts and circumstances of this case, to protect the victim and prevent further harm to her, and that for violating that duty to her, he can be found guilty of having violated \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for consideration of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

No. 5283); and on the legislature\u2019s failure ultimately to enact that statute to support the proposition that the assault statute, \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), does not punish the defendant\u2019s behavior. The dissent maintains that H.B. No. 5283 would not have been introduced if the legislature thought that \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) could be used to punish behavior similar to that prohibited by H.B. No. 5283. The dissent also claims that the bill was not acted upon by the judiciary committee, at least in part, because the behavior punishable by the facilitator abuse statute was already prohibited by \u00a7 53-21, the risk of injury statute. In addition to the fact that these theories are diametrically opposed, this reliance on legislative silence is misplaced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that we rely on the intent of the legislature as that intent has been <em>expressed. Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948) (\u201cwe are confined to the intention which is expressed in the words [the legislature] has used\u201d); see <em>Madison Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>174 Conn. 189, 192, 384 A.2d 361 (1978). There has been no affirmative expression of legislative intent linking the failure to enact the facilitator abuse statute to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). As the dissent acknowledges, the judiciary committee took no action on H.B. No. 5283 and the dissent points to no affirmative statement indicating the reason for this inaction. \u201cOrdinarily, we are reluctant to draw inferences regarding legislative intent from the failure of a legislative committee to report a bill to the floor, because in most cases the reasons for that lack of action remain unexpressed and thus obscured in the mist of committee inactivity.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 518 n.19, 613 A.2d 748 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Although we have relied on the failure to <em>amend </em>a statute as an indication of legislative intent regarding that statute or statutes within the same legislative scheme; see, e.g., <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Ludgin, </em>175 Conn. 545, 555, 400 A.2d 712 (1978); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>224 Conn. 593, 619-21, 620 A.2d 133 (1993) (subsequent amendments held not relevant to legislative intent at time of enactment of underlying statute); we hesitate unilaterally to assign motives to the legislature where it has failed to <em>enact </em>a statute other than the one whose interpretation is before us. Cf. <em>In re Valeri.e D., </em>supra, 223 Conn. 517-18 (noting significance of legislature\u2019s failure to pass one of two alternative provisions covering the same subject matter upon which simultaneous hearings were held). As a corollary to that principle, we likewise hesitate to derive legislative intent from the mere introduction of a bill and from committee hearings on that bill. Committee hearings provide a useful laboratory in which to explore new legislative approaches. To rely on dialogue between interested members of the public would place a high cost on the dynamic nature of the legislative process and unnecessarily chill the introduction of bills and discourse attendant thereto, finally, the fact that the state and the dissent have suggested opposing theories to explain the legislature\u2019s failure to enact II.B. No. 5283 best illustrates that one guess is as good as the other, and is the epitome of why we cannot engage in this kind of speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> The defendant has argued that he did not actually know that the child had been abused by her mother and that knowledge of her injuries should not be equated with knowledge of their cause. He also argues that there was no evidence that he had the ability to prevent any harm from occurring to the child. Those claims of insufficiency of evidence are to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>on the merits by the Appellate Court on remand. See footnote 7 of this opinion. We note that the attorney who represented the defendant before the Appellate Court was placed on inactive status in June, 1997. As a result, following the granting of certification by this court, in order to ensure that the defendant be properly represented, the trial court ordered the appellate unit of the office of the chief public defender to assign the case to new appellate counsel in order to represent the defendant in the certified appeal. Attorney Susan M. Cormier entered an appearance on behalf of the defendant and currently represents him in this appeal. Under the unique circumstances of this case, in the exercise of our supervisory authority, we order that the Appellate Court consider, on the merits, any constitutional claims of due process and double jeopardy arising as a result of this decision that appellate counsel seeks to raise. Finally, in light of the problems experienced by the defendant\u2019s initial appellate counsel, we also order that current appellate counsel be permitted to rebrief the issue of sufficiency of the evidence as it relates to the risk of injury charge. See footnote 5 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> There is, of course, a difference between the recognition of an existing duty, on the one hand, and the creation of an altogether new duty, on the other. Whether that distinction is significant for due process purposes under the specific facts of this case remains to be seen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> The importance of this issue to the defendant cannot be overstated in view of the fact that he received a cumulative sentence of thirty years imprisonment on the six counts of assault in the first degree. Because the defendant also received a consecutive ten year prison term on the one count of risk of injury to a child, his total effective sentence is forty years imprisonment. By contrast, the child\u2019s mother, who, it appears, actually caused the child\u2019s ii\\juries, received a total effective sentence of only seven years imprisonment.

I concur with the result reached by the majority. I do so because the Appellate Court, in reversing the assault convictions, simply held that the defendant, Santos Miranda, was not the biological or legal parent of the victim and, therefore, owed no legal duty to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>her. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>41 Conn. App. 333, 340-41, 675 A.2d 925 (1996). The Appellate Court should have considered the circumstances of the case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in deciding the issue of legal duty. See <em>Clohessy </em>v. <em>Bachelor, </em>237 Conn. 31, 45, 675 A.2d 852 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">If the adult defendant was having a continuous intimate relationship with the victim\u2019s mother who was raising the newborn child in their household, then the defendant would have a duty to prevent, if he could, the ongoing abuse in the household of the helpless victim of which he was aware. See 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 3.3 (a), p. 286. Although the defendant was not related to anyone in the household by marriage, biology or adoption, his cohabitation with the victim\u2019s mother created a relationship with that responsibility. Many children currently live in households founded by unmarried couples. Excusing those who do not marry from such responsibility discriminates against marriage, upon which \u201csociety may be said to be built\u201d; <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 165, 25 L. Ed. 244 (1879); and \u201cwithout which there would be neither civilization nor progress\u201d; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>125 U.S. 190, 211, 8 S. Ct. 723, 31 L. Ed. 654 (1888); and does so to the peril of our children.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">I do not agree, however, that the first degree assault statute should be applied to this case without more clarification. The existence of a duty to protect against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>serious physical injury in the household and-the application of that duty under the assault statute depends upon the circumstances of the case, the relationship of the parties, the harm the statute protects against and the conduct prohibited by the penal statute. It is one thing to recognize that a stepparent is duty-bound to stop the abuse of a helpless child in his or her home and extend that role to the live-in boyfriend or girlfriend. It is quite another to decide that a caregiver with a family-like relationship may be convicted of first degree assault because that caregiver fails to seek medical aid or report suspected child abuse to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Whether one who does not personally inflict the physical injury may be held liable under the assault statute for failure to seek medical treatment and whether a worsening of the victim\u2019s condition because of that failure is required, whether a failure to report continuing abuse may support liability for assault, and whether this doctrine should be restricted to cases of child abuse are questions I believe we must address.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">As Justice Palmer and Justice Berdon point out, liability for assault, absent accessorial liability, where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>trauma causing the physical injury is inflicted by an unknown party, is, to say the least, a \u201cnovel construction\u201d of the assault statute. Cf. <em>Bouie </em>v. <em>City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 353-55, 84 S. Ct. 1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894 (1964). I therefore join Justice Palmer\u2019s concurrence with respect to the due process concerns regarding notice, also alluded to in part V of Justice Berdon\u2019s dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">I should also add that I have doubts concerning the validity of the multiple punishments imposed on the assault counts. Some of those punishments were for multiple counts based on the same injury and for multiple violations of one statute based on the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In footnote 25 of the majority opinion, the court\u2019s order of remand allows the defendant to broaden his claims on appeal. I concur in that order of remand and would expand it to include the issues raised in. this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> There is, however, considerable confusion as to the factual circumstances. The premise of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision and of the certified issue was that the victim was being abused by her mother. This is, however, not borne out in the trial court\u2019s findings. The defendant was acquitted of nineteen counts of assault in the first degree charging him with having faded to prevent the mother from abusing the victim, or having himself injured the victim. The defendant was convicted of six counts of assault in the first degree, including two counts of unspecified reckless conduct, two counts of reckless conduct by allowing the victim to live in a situation of risk of repeated assault, and two counts of reckless conduct by failing to take measures to prevent the victim from living in such a situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>204 App. Div. 2d 575, 612 N.Y.S.2d 65 (1994), the Supreme Court of Now York, Appellate Division, reinstated those counts o\u00ed an indictment charging the defendant mother with assault in the first degree for \u201cfailure to obtain medical care for [her infant child] or other nonfeasance contributing to the assaults . . . Id. The Appellate Division cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Wong, </em>81 N.Y.2d 600, 619 N.E.2d 377, 601 N.Y.S.2d 440 (1993), in which it was alleged, in connection with a child\u2019s death, that the defendants\u2019 failure to seek medical care after the child\u2019s injury was inflicted resulted in the child\u2019s death. See id., 607. The court\u2019s theory of criminal liability in <em>Wong </em>was that a \u201cpassive\u201d defendant could be found guilty of an offense under \u00a7 15.10 of the New York Penal Law.

Cases, such as the one before us, that present revolting facts concerning the physical abuse of a four month old child, test the foundation of our democracy. The rule of law must be upheld even when confronted with alarming allegations of improper acts, indeed allegations of loathsome conduct on the part of the defendant. The question for this court, in cases such as this, is whether the legislature intended to make the conduct with which the defendant was charged criminal under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), assault in the first degree. It is not whether this court, were it sitting as a legislature, would have proscribed the conduct at issue. \u201cSuch action by a legislature may well be commendable, but by a court condemnable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williquette, </em>129 Wis. 2d 239, 263, 385 N.W.2d 145 (1986) (Heffernan, C. J., dissenting). Simply put, we cannot craft a substantive offense ex post facto in order to include conduct that we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>abhorrent to our sensitivities and that of the general public. It is this judicial restraint that sharply puts into focus one of the essential differences between democratic and totalitarian forms of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The facts of this case, as they pertain to the issues before us, are as follows: The trial court concluded that the defendant, Santos Miranda, was guilty of six counts of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), not because he physically abused the child, nor because he aided in the abuse of the child, but, rather, as a result of the following: (1) that he lived with the physically abused child and the child\u2019s mother in the same household as a \u201clive-in boyfriend\u201d; (2) that he established a \u201cfamily-like\u201d relationship with the child\u2014 he considered himself her stepfather and he took care of her like a father; and (3) that he was aware of the child\u2019s injuries but failed to notify the authorities, failed to obtain medical treatment for her, failed to remove her from the circumstances and failed to guard her from future abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Court reversed the defendant\u2019s assault convictions, holding that the \u201cfailure to act when one is under no legal duty to do so, thereby permitting a dangerous condition to exist, is not sufficient to support a conviction for assault in the first degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>41 Conn. App. 333, 338-39, 675 A.2d 925 (1996). I agree with the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The majority\u2019s determination that the facts in this case were sufficient to create a legal duty on the part of the defendant to protect the child from parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>abuse pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) is premised on its unsupported conclusion that had the defendant been the victim\u2019s parent, he would have had an undisputed affirmative legal obligation to protect the child from assault pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). There is an affirmative obligation on the defendant and the parent, under the circumstances of this case, to protect the child, but that duty does not arise under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). Rather, in this state, the obligation to act arises under General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, entitled \u201c[i]njury or risk of injury to, or impairing the morals of, children,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was enacted by the legislature many years ago to address the failure to act with respect to the welfare of a child. This court made it clear, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 159, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984), that the proscription of \u00a7 53-21 included \u201cdeliberate indifference to, acquiescence in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Here, the trial court found the defendant guilty of risk of injury with respect to the child, for which he was sentenced to the maximum term of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 53-21, however, is not before us.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What is before this court on appeal from the Appellate Court is the following certified issue: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that the defendant could not be convicted of violating General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>(3) because he had no legal duty to protect the victim from parental abuse?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>237 Conn. 932, 677 A.2d 1372 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The majority addresses an issue that is necessarily implied in the certified question \u2014 that is, whether the \u201cconduct\u201d referred to in \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) includes the failure to act. I disagree with the majority\u2019s very tenuous argument that it does. Section 53a-59 (a) provides in part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ... (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person . . . .\u201d Although \u201cconduct\u201d can include the failure to act under circumstances when there is a duty to act; 1W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law (1986) \u00a7 3.3., p. 282; the majority points to nothing in the text of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), or its legislative history, to support its conclusion that conduct under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) includes the failure to act. In fact, both the common definition of assault \u2014 \u201ca violent attack with physical means\u201d; Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; and the legal definition of assault\u2014 \u201c[a]ny wilful attempt or threat to inflict injury upon the person of another\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); belie the majority\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Moreover, by construing \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) to include the duty to act, the majority stands a long-standing and fundamental principle of statutory construction on its head: Penal statutes \u201care to be expounded strictly against an offender, and liberally in his favor. This can only be accomplished, by giving to them a literal construction, so far as they operate penally . . . .\u201d <em>Daggett </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 Conn. 60, 63 (1821). Indeed, what this court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cataudella, </em>159 Conn. 544, 271 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>99 (1970), is applicable to this case. \u201cA statute imposing a penalty should receive a strict construction in favor of those who might be subject to its provisions. [N]o act should be held to be in violation . . . which does not fall within its spirit and the fair import of its language. <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Newbury, </em>79 Conn. 338, 340, 65 A. 156 [1906]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 273, 171 A. 660 [1934]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>112 Conn. 39, 46, 151 A. 325 [1930]; <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>137 Conn. 267, 274, 76 A.2d 9 [1950], While a criminal statute is not to be defeated by an unreasonably strict construction of its language, it must be rather strictly construed so that the conduct made criminal will be ascertainable with reasonable certainty from a careful reading of the statute. A corollary to this is the rule that the meaning of a penal statute cannot be extended by presumption or intendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zazzaro, </em>128 Conn. 160, 167, 20 A.2d 737 [1941], <em>State </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>153 Conn. 209, 215-16, 214 A.2d 903 [1965].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cataudella, </em>supra, 555-56; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 221-22 n.7, 479 A.2d 814 (1984) (\u201c[c]riminal convictions will be upheld only when the defendant\u2019s behavior is clearly forbidden by the statute under which he or she has been prosecuted\u201d). A careful reading of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) would never lead a rational reader to believe that a person was subject to criminal liability under the statute for the failure to act \u2014 whether the person is a stranger, a live-in boyfriend, or a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Furthermore, the majority mistakenly relies on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in this case and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>34 Conn. App. 807, 812-13, 644 A.2d 355, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 909, 648 A.2d 158 (1994), to support its claim that the failure to act is included in \u201cconduct\u201d under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). The Appellate Court in this case did not hold that \u201cconduct\u201d in \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the omission to act; rather, it merely stated that \u201cconduct, creating criminal liability, may be by an act or an omission to act <em>if within the intendment of the statute.''\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 339. The Appellate Court in this case concluded, as I do, that \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) does not include the \u201comission to act.\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 812, the Appellate Court did not specifically determine that the defendant\u2019s failure to act \u2014 that is, the failure to call an ambulance when the defendant knew his child was injured\u2014 constituted criminal \u201cconduct.\u201d Rather, the Appellate Court in <em>Jones </em>affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s act of violently shaking and subjecting the child to a sudden impact was conduct that justified his conviction under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Nevertheless, even if the majority were correct that one person can assault another person under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) by failing to act, the defendant\u2019s conviction in this case cannot stand. By superimposing on \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) a common-law duty on the part of a person to act in order to protect a child from harm when that third person voluntarily assumes responsibility for the care and the welfare of the child and considers himself to have a stepfather-stepchild relationship with the child, the majority has created <em>a new crime. </em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (\u201c[a] crime may be defined to be an act done in violation of those duties which an individual owes to the community, and for the breach of which the law has provided that the offender shall make satisfaction to the public\u201d); see also 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 1.2, pp. 8-16. In crafting this new crime, the majority ignores the fact that it is the legislature that defines substantive crimes. This division between the legislature and the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>established in 1971 when the legislature adopted the penal code and repealed General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 54-117,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which recognized common-law crimes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Public Acts 1969, No. 828, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. and 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Notwithstanding the legislature\u2019s clear intention of stripping this court of authority to define substantive crimes, the majority interprets General Statutes \u00a7 53a-4, entitled \u201cSaving clause,\u201d and the official commentary to \u00a7 53a-4, as giving it jurisdiction to create the new crime of assault by a third party for failing to protect a child from abuse. In doing so, the majority grossly misinterprets \u00a7 53a-4, and ignores the final, and most critical, sentence in the commentary. Section 53a-4 provides: \u201cThe provisions of [chapter 951] shall not be construed as precluding any court from recognizing other principles of criminal liability or other defenses not inconsistent with such provisions.\u201d Chapter 951 of the General Statutes, of which \u00a7 53a-4 is a part, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>not define substantive crimes such as imposing new obligations, rather, it provides for principles of liability, such as the mental state required in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-5, and the liability for aiding in the criminal acts of another in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8. The commentary to \u00a7 53a-4 that the majority conveniently omits underscores the prohibition as follows: \u201cThis does not mean, however, that the court is free to fashion additional substantive offenses, for the [penal code] precludes, by repealing section 54-117, the notion of common law crimes.\u201d Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes, Penal Code Comments, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. (West 1994) \u00a7 53a-4, p. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The opinion of this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 630 A.2d 990 (1993), illuminates the majority\u2019s misinterpretation of \u00a7 53a-4. In <em>Walton, </em>this court adopted the <em>Pinkerton</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>principle of liability \u2014 that is, \u201ca conspirator may be held liable for criminal offenses committed by a coconspirator that are within the scope of the conspiracy, are in furtherance of it, and are reasonably foreseeable as a necessary or natural consequence of the conspiracy.\u201d Id., 43. The majority in <em>Walton </em>first explained that it was \u201cnot fashion[ing] an additional substantive offense by applying <em>Pinkerton </em>to the facts of [that] case . . . [because] [t]he <em>Pinkerton </em>principle does not create a substantive offense; it applies a particular principle of vicarious criminal liability to an appropriate case.\u201d Id., 45 n.11. The court in <em>Walton </em>then explained that it could recognize the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle because it \u201chas roots in our state jurisprudence.\u201d Id., 48. The \u201capplication of the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle to a homicide committed in furtherance of a conspiracy has . . . been part of our jurisprudence [since 1945]. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 642, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>133 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>171, 173, 49 A.2d 594 (1946); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>132 Conn. 39, 44, 42 A.2d 354 (1945).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 50-51. Finally, the <em>Walton </em>court concluded that it could recognize the <em>Pinkerton </em>principle because it was not \u201cinconsistent with the notion of accessory liability\u201d found in \u00a7 53a-8. Id., 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The majority argues that it may recognize a duty to protect a child from abuse under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) because it is merely applying a long-standing principle of liability consistent with the principles of liability permitted by \u00a7 53a-4. Even if we assume that it is merely applying a principle of liability rather than creating a substantive crime, the majority, however, unlike the court in <em>Walton, </em>fails to cite any cases in which this court has applied this principle of liability for acts of omission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the majority makes no attempt to explain why the \u201cprinciple of imposing a common-law duty\u201d to protect a child from abuse is not inconsistent with the principles of liability set forth in chapter 951 of the penal code. Indeed, the majority ignores the fact that the recognition of this new duty under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) is inconsistent with the notion of accessory liability in \u00a7 53a-8. For example, this court consistently has held that one cannot be held liable under a theory of aiding and abetting, for merely being present at the time of the crime and acquiescing to the commission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>crime. See, e.g., State v.Pundy, 147 Conn. 7, 11, 156 A.2d 193 (1959) (\u201c[mjere presence as an inactive companion, passive acquiescence, or the doing of innocent acts which may in fact aid the one who commits the crime must be distinguished from the criminal intent and community of unlawful purpose shared by one who knowingly and wilfully assists the perpetrator of the offense in the acts which prepare for, facilitate, or consummate it\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>105 Conn. 757, 762, 136 A. 475 (1927) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Enanno, </em>96 Conn. 420, 425, 114 A. 386 (1921) (same). Therefore, \u00a7 53a-4 precludes the majority from recognizing this new duty to protect a child from abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The legislature will be very much surprised to discover that we have in place, under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), a law that provides that the failure to act is punishable criminal conduct. Although the legislature recently has grappled with the issue of imposing an affirmative obligation on the part of a parent and an unrelated adult to protect children from abuse; see Substitute House Bin No. 5283 (1998) (H.B. No. 5283), entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Facilitation of Abuse of a Child\u201d;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it did not enact the proposed legislation. Nevertheless, the majority of this court, without any understanding of the implications of its decision today and without the aid of expert advice that is available to the legislature through the public hearing process, impetuously and presumptuously crafts a crime of assault that was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>intended by the legislature. Clearly, if the legislature agreed with the majority that, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), parents as well as unrelated adults had an affirmative legal obligation to protect children from abuse, it never would have had a need to consider H.B. No. 5283, a bill that explicitly criminalizes the conduct with which the defendant was charged in the present case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The representatives of several state agencies and several non-profit groups created to support victims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>abuse spoke out against H.B. No. 5283 at the public hearing before the legislature\u2019s select committee on children. The remarks of these speakers set forth several significant reasons why this court should not undertake the legislative function and declare by judicial fiat that, \u201cas a matter of policy under the circumstances of this case,\u201d the defendant in this case had an affirmative legal obligation under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) to protect the child from abuse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">First, those who testified before the committee expressed unanimous concern that holding persons ha-ble for not protecting children from abuse actually would cause more harm than it would prevent. They testified that if the legislature wants to accomplish its goal of preventing children from being injured as a result of violence, it must first consider ways to improve the delivery of services to at risk families under the \u2022 state\u2019s present child welfare system. For example, Diane Edell, program director of the Aetna Foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Children Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, testified that \u201c[t]his law . . . will [not] do anything to protect children. There are other things . . . prevention programs, specialized mental health programs, helping mothers to leave abusive relationships that will help us help our children better.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Select Committee on Children, Pt. 1, 1998 Sess., p. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Furthermore, several speakers testified that, if the legislature imposed liability on persons who fail to protect a child from abuse, it would discourage persons who are in the best position to know whether a child has been abused from informing the appropriate authorities after the abuse occurs. See id., p. 64, remarks of Frederick Berrien, medical director of the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center; id., p. 78, remarks of Raphael Podolsky, an attorney for the Legal Assistance Resource Center of Connecticut, Inc. \u201cIf we want to help these children we need to find ways to make these parents stronger, not create laws that will result in fewer parents coming forward with their suspicions.\u201d Id., p. 56, remarks of Edell, program director of the Aetna Foundation Children Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Finally, according to chief public defender Gerard A. Smyth, H.B. No. 5283 would \u201cdiscourage people from acting as \u2018caretakers\u2019 \u201d of children, and, consequently, would affect the level of care received by children in this state. Id., p. 3 of Smyth\u2019s prepared statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Second, nearly every speaker at the public hearing before the select committee on children testified that the legislature did not need to enact H.B. No. 5283 because \u201cthe situation that [it] is intended to address is already covered by\u201d \u00a7 53-21, the risk of injury to a child statute. Id. According to Smyth, Podolsky, Jessica Stevens, director of the state chapter of the National Organization for Women, Linda Pearce Prestley, child advocate for the state of Connecticut, Gail Burns Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>the executive director of Connecticut Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Inc., and Kristine D. Ragaglia, commissioner of the department of children and families, \u00a7 53-21 can and should be used to prosecute parents and others who fail to protect children from abuse. See id., p. 3 of Smyth\u2019s prepared statement, pp. 72, 51, 9, 42, and p. 2 of Ragaglia\u2019s prepared statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Third, the speakers at the public hearing before the select committee on children agreed that, even if the committee approved H.B. No. 5283, the bill would have to be made more specific in order to set forth the effort that must be extended to satisfy the duty to protect children from abuse. According to Smyth, for example, it was unclear whether parents, guardians and caretakers could satisfy the duty established in H.B. No. 5283, to act to protect such child from physical abuse, by reporting a risk of abuse to the department of children and families; or whether such persons would be required \u201c[t]o take more active measures, such as concealing a child from a custodial parent if necessary . . . [o]r . . . withholding a child from a parent suspected of abuse.\u201d Id., p. 1 of Smyth\u2019s prepared statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Clearly, all of these delineated issues are best left for the legislature\u2019s consideration, not ours. See <em>Mahon </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>165 Conn. 251, 257, 332 A.2d 69 (1973) (\u201cthe adoption of . . . [a] specific exception [to the standard of care applicable to the conduct of minors, holding them to the adult standard of care when they engage in activities which are potentially highly hazardous] is . . . one peculiarly appropriate for further legislative consideration and action rather than for implementation by judicial fiat\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Finally, in crafting this new common-law crime, the majority acknowledges constitutional problems in attempting to apply it in this case. For example, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>majority has created an ex post facto law in its classic sense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 281-82, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995) (\u201c[t]he prohibition of ex post facto laws forbids the enactment of any law which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, even if the new law is not ex post facto, it cannot be applied to the defendant in the present case because a fundamental requisite of due process is that a person must be put on notice, before the alleged commission of a crime, that such nonfeasance is criminal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997) (\u201cdue process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope\u201d); <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972) (statute must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986) (\u201c[w]hen a[n] . . . unforeseeable state-court construction of a criminal statute is applied retroactively to subject a person to criminal liability for past conduct, the effect is to deprive him of due process of law in the sense of fair warning that his contemplated conduct constitutes a crime\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Furthermore, there is at least a question as to whether the defendant\u2019s convictions for assault and risk of injury violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. J. Bruckmann, G. Nash &amp; J. Katz, Connecticut Criminal Caselaw Handbook: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide (1989) p. 151 (where multiple charges are considered same, judgment of conviction may not be entered on both). These constitutional claims, however, will be raised before the Appellate Court. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 800, 640 A.2d 986 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AOJ\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> \u201cThe defendant was charged with twenty-five counts of assault in the first degree.

See part IV of this dissent (legislative Mstory fails to support claim that failure to act on part of parent is conduct proscribed under \u00a7 53a-59 [a] [3]); J. BrucMnann, G.

The parent, as well as the defendant in tMs case, however, could be found criminally liable under \u00a7 53-21 of causing ipjury or risk of injury to, or impairing the morals of cMldren, and the defendant was in fact convicted of that crime. See part I of this dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">Even if the majority is correct that it is merely interpreting \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) in accordance with our common law, its reasomng is flawed. The majority is unable to point to any common law in tMs state that would provide for criminal liability under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) or any other assault statute for the failure to protect a child from abuse. See part TV of tMs dissent. The majority looks for support in 1 W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, supra, \u00a7 3.3, concerning the \u201comission to act,\u201d and ignores the authors\u2019 predicate in \u00a7 3.3 (a): \u201cFor criminal liability to be based upon the failure to act it must first be found that there is a duty to act \u2014 a legal duty and not simply a moral duty.\u201d Id., p. 283. In fact, \u00a7 3.3 is peppered with references to cases in other jurisdictions that have rejected expanding legal duty to conform to moral duty because there was no statutory authority imposing a duty to act. \u201cGenerally one has no legal duty to aid another person in peril, even when that aid can be rendered without danger or inconvemence to himself.\u201d Id., p. 284; see, e.g.,</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Ulvinen, </em>313 N.W.2d 425, 428 (Minn. 1981) (defendant was under no legal duty to warn daughter-in-law that defendant\u2019s son was planning to kill her, no matter how morally reprehensible failure to do so was).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Furthermore, the eases from other jurisdictions that the majority cites are not germane. For example, two of the jurisdictions cited by the majority as imposing an affirmative obligation on parents to protect their children from abuse do so pursuant to statutory authority. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williquette, </em>supra, 129 Wis. 2d 242 and n.1, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that a mother w~ho took no action to stop the known abuse of her children by their father could be held criminally liable under a statute in effect at the time, entitled \u201cAbuse of children,\u201d which provided: \u201cWhoever . . . <em>subjects </em>a child to cruel maltreatment ... is guilty of a Class E felony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Wis. Stat. \u00a7 940.201. That statute was subsequently repealed and replaced by the current statute, Wis. Stat. \u00a7948.03 (1995). Moreover, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State, </em>408 N.E.2d 614, 619 (Ind. App. 1980), the Indiana Court, of Appeals held that a mother who knowingly left her child with a person who repeatedly hit the child could be held criminally liable under the Indiana statute entitled \u201cNeglect of a dependent,\u201d which provided in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person having the care, custody, or control of a dependent who . . . knowingly .... (1) Places the dependent in a situation that may endanger his life or health . . . commits neglect of a dependent . . . .\u201d Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-1-4 (Sup. 1979). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>306 N.C. 466, 473-76, 293 S.E.2d 780 (1982), the only case the majority cites in which a defendant was found guilty of assault for failing to prevent abuse in the absenfce of statutory imposition of a duty to act, the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s holding was based on a theory of accessory liability, not a common-law duty to act under an assault statute. With respect to accessory liability, the trial court in the present case specifically found the defendant not guilty.

According to the state, \u201c[i]t is at least plausible that our legislature rejected [the facilitator abuse amendment] because [1] it was aware of the common-law rule that an adult [who] voluntarily assumes care and responsibility for a helpless child he or she lives [with] has a duty to protect that child from abuse, or [2] it\u2019s own express public policy of protecting children from abuse and neglect and making the homes sale for children, or [3] the fact that [that] certified question is presently pending before this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The detailed record of the select committee on children\u2019s public hearing with respect to child abuse \u2014 including H.B.

No. 5283. Second, the legislators who spoke at the public hearing made it clear that, despite the state\u2019s express public policy of protecting children from abuse and neglect and making homes safe for children, the legislature needed to create a new statutory duty for parents and certain unrelated adults to protect children from abuse.

Rev. 101, 104 (1984), also points out several reasons why the issue of imposing affirmative legal obligations on persons to protect children from abuse is best left for the legislature. \u201cThere is a general, albeit declining, reluctance in the United States to impose affirmative duties and to punish nonperformance of those duties. Various explanations for the reluctance to criminalize inactivity have been offered. First, there is difficulty in defining with sufficient clarity the effort that must be expended in order to satisfy the duty. Second, the inherent ambiguity in defining the scope of a duty leads to speculation about guilt and thereby poses a threat to society more serious than the harm prevented by requiring affirmative conduct. Third, because \u2018prevailing attitudes draw sharp distinctions between overt action and passivity!, the] legislature cannot ignore the mores, nor should it implement them beyond necessary limits.\u2019 Finally, a governmental demand to perform is significantly more intrusive than a command to refrain from harmful action and therefore must be justified by a significant overriding public interest and must be imposed in a way that minimizes the extent of intrusion.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
