The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the policy definition of an underinsured motor vehicle excluded a vehicle owned by the named insured, and that such an exclusion applied to underin-sured motorist conversion coverage made available pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336a;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the exclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from underinsured motorist coverage of a vehicle owned by the named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>insured applies to underinsured motorist conversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>coverage; (3) \u00a7 38a-334-6 (c) (2) (A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies applies to underinsured motorist conversion coverage; and (4) the exclusion in the decedent\u2019s policy was not deleted by a subsequent endorsement. We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The facts are not in dispute. The decedent was a passenger in an automobile owned by her and operated by her husband. She died as a result of a collision caused by her husband\u2019s negligence. The plaintiff exhausted the liability coverage on the automobile policy provided by the defendant, and sought additional benefits pursuant to the underinsured motorist conversion coverage of the same policy. The defendant refused to pay any additional benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The plaintiff brought this action for underinsured motorist conversion benefits. Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the trial court denied the plaintiffs motion and granted the defendant\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs, and the arguments of the parties on appeal, persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed, essentially for the reasons stated and on the basis of the authorities cited in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. See <em>Fleet National Bank </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>45 Conn. Sup. 355, 717 A.2d 861 (1997). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wysocki, </em>243 Conn. 239, 241, 702 A.2d 638 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\"> The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336a provides: \u201c(a) Each insurer licensed to write automobile liability insurance in this state shall offer, for an additional premium, underinsured motorist conversion coverage with limits in accordance with section 38a-336.
