Because the trial court \u2014 understandably and properly \u2014 followed certain language in <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 269, 593 A.2d 111 (1991), and because we are now constrained to disavow that language as incorrect, we agree with the respondent and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The petitioner brought this habeas corpus action seeking a recalculation of the amount of his statutory good time credit in accordance with <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 269. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>court agreed with the petitioner\u2019s interpretation of <em>Seno, </em>and ordered the respondent to amend the petitioner\u2019s time sheet by posting an additional thirty days thereto. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The facts are undisputed. On March 23, 1982, the petitioner committed murder. On June 16,1983, he was sentenced to incarceration for a period of thirty years and he was committed to the respondent\u2019s custody pursuant to a mittimus issued by the Superior Court. Prior to his sentencing, the petitioner had been held in pretrial custody for a period of 358 days and had been awarded 120 days of presentence good time credit. Upon the petitioner\u2019s commitment to custody under the mittimus, the respondent posted his time sheet with 4200 days of statutory good time credit, 358 days of presentence confinement time, and 120 days of presentence good time credit, for a total of 4678 days. The respondent arrived at the 4200 days of statutory good time credit by the following calculation: ten days per month for the first five years (10 days per month x 60 months) of the petitioner\u2019s thirty year sentence, or 600 days; plus twelve days per month for the next twenty-five years (12 days per month x 300 months) of the petitioner\u2019s thirty year sentence, or 3600 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">This calculation was in accordance with the respondent\u2019s construction of \u00a7 18-7a (b), which provides for the calculation of statutory good time credit for persons who, like the petitioner, have been sentenced for offenses committed on or after July 1, 1981, but before July 1,1983. Section 18-7a (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny person sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1981, [but before July 1, 1983] may, while held in default of bond or while serving such sentence, by good conduct and obedience to the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence, earn a reduction of his sentence in the amount of ten days for each month and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>pro rata for a part of a month of a sentence up to five years, and twelve days for each month and pro rata for a part of a month for the sixth and each subsequent ytear of a sentence which is more than five years. . . .\u201d See footnote 2 of this opinion. Thus, according to the respondent\u2019s construction of \u00a7 18-7a (b), a prisoner earns statutory good time credit at the rate of ten days per month for the first five years of his sentence, and at the enhanced rate of twelve days per month for the balance of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Furthermore, under this provision, this statutory good time credit was awarded to the prisoner under the \u201cposting\u201d method, whereby \u201cfor purposes of administrative efficiency statutory good time was calculated and credited at the outset of a prisoner\u2019s sentence on the basis of the sentence imposed by the sentencing court.\u201d <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 275. Therefore, when the petitioner in the present case was sentenced to thirty years incarceration for the crime that he had committed, he was posted with: (1) 600 days for the first five years of his sentence; (2) 3600 days for the next twenty-five years of his sentence; and (3) 478 days of presentence confinement time, consisting of 358 days of actual time of confinement plus 120 days of presentence good time. The petitioner\u2019s release date was calculated accordingly. Thus, the petitioner was posted with credit for all of the time he had spent in presentence confinement augmented by good time attributable to that time, with his enhanced rate of twelve days per month of statutory good time credit for the last twenty-five years of his sentence, and with his unenhanced rate of ten days per month for the first five years of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Finally, it is essential to note that under this posting method employed by the respondent, the enhanced rate of twelve days per month was calculated to begin at the <em>sixth </em>year of the petitioner\u2019s confinement <em>under his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>sentence as imposed by the sentencing court, </em>without regard to his presentence confinement time augmented by his presentence good time. In other words, in determining <em>when </em>to begin the petitioner\u2019s posting of the enhanced rate of twelve days per month statutory good time credit \u2014 that is, in determining when for purposes of \u00a7 18-7a (b) the prisoner may earn \u201ca reduction of his sentence in the amount of . . . twelve days for each month ... for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years\u201d\u2014 the respondent calculated the first five years of the sentence imposed by the sentencing court, and began the enhanced rate at the commencement of the sixth year of that sentence. The respondent did not, however, calculate the \u201csixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (b); by giving the petitioner credit for his presen-tence confinement time. Thus, under this calculation and posting system, the prisoner received credit for his presentence confinement time once \u2014 by having it posted as an additional credit toward his ultimate release date \u2014 but not twice by having it posted as such an additional credit <em>and </em>credited toward the calculation of when the sixth year began for purposes of determining when the enhanced monthly statutory good time would begin. Furthermore, as the petitioner conceded in oral argument before this court, before \u00a7 18-7a was amended in 1982, the respondent employed this system of calculation and posting for prisoners who, like the petitioner, had committed their crimes on or after July 1, 1981, but before July 1, 1983. All of this would have been relatively straightforward and uncontroversial, except for Public Acts 1982, No. 82-379 (P.A. 82-379), and confusion wrought by certain language in <em>Seno </em>interpreting that legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In 1982, the legislature enacted P.A. 82-379, which amended \u00a7 18-7ato include subsection (c). See footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>2 of this opinion. Under P.A. 82-379, prisoners who, like the petitioner in this case, were sentenced for crimes committed <em>on or after July 1, 1981, but before July 1, 1983, </em>continued to receive statutory good time credit according to \u00a7 18-7a (b), and prisoners who, like the petitioner in <em>Seno, </em>were sentenced for crimes committed <em>after July 1, 1983, </em>received statutory good time credit according to \u00a7 18-7a (c). <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 276. In enacting subsection (c), the legislature had two related objectives: (1) \u201cto return to the original concept behind good time, that is, the concept of reward for good behavior\u201d; id., 277; and (2) to eradicate the irrational consequence of the posting system, whereby prisoners could earn statutory \u201cgood time for a time that they, in fact, never serve.\u201d Id., 278. These objectives were accomplished by the \u201c[elimination of the posting system and adoption of a system that awards statutory good time on a monthly basis . . . .\u201d Id., 279. We noted, accordingly, that under \u00a7 18-7a (c), \u201cby adding the phrase \u2018as such sentence is served\u2019 and the word \u2018served\u2019 to language virtually identical to \u00a7 18-7a (b), the legislature dispensed with the posting method and adopted, in its place, a system of calculating statutory good time on a monthly basis.\u201d Id., 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In <em>Seno, </em>we considered for the first time \u201cwhether a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding five years must be incarcerated for five calendar years in order to earn statutory good time at the rate of twelve days per month pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c).\u201d Id., 270. The petitioner in <em>Seno, </em>whose crimes were committed after July 1, 1983, had spent 197 days in presentence confinement, aftd had received an effective sentence of twelve years incarceration. Id., 271-72 and n.4. The commissioner calculated when the petitioner would be entitled to twelve days enhanced statutory good time credit by adding five years to the day he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>been sentenced, and then subtracting from that date the 197 days in which he had been confined before being sentenced. Id., 272 n.4. Thus, in calculating when the petitioner\u2019s enhanced twelve days per month statutory good time credit would commence, the commissioner took into account the number of days in which the petitioner had been in presentence confinement, but did not take into account either the petitioner\u2019s presentence good time, or the statutory good time that he had earned monthly as he served his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The petitioner in <em>Seno </em>claimed that under \u00a7 18-7a (c), the commissioner \u201cshould have calculated the petitioner\u2019s statutory good time at the rate of twelve days per month when his confinement time and credit time from all sources totaled five years.\u201d Id., 272.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe [trial] court dismissed the petition, concluding that, under \u00a7 18-7a (c), only confinement time and credit time for presentence confinement; General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are properly considered in determining when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>enhanced rate of statutory good time commences.\u201d <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Thus, in <em>Seno, </em>we considered the question of <em>when, </em>under \u00a7 18-7a (c), a prisoner starts to earn statutory good time credit at the enhanced rate of twelve days per month. Id., 270. We concluded that in \u201clight of its language and legislative history ... \u00a7 18-7a (c) requires that the [commissioner] calculate a prisoner\u2019s sentence at the rate of twelve days per month once his confinement time and statutory good time total five years.\u201d Id., 282.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This meant that for prisoners whose crimes had been committed on or after July 1, 1983, the commissioner was required to calculate the date on which the enhanced rate of statutory good time was to commence by giving the prisoner credit for: (1) all of his confinement time, both presentence and postsen-tence; and (2) all of his statutory good time, both presen-tence and the postsentence statutory good time that he earned monthly. Moreover, because under \u00a7 18-7a (c) postsentence statutory good time credit is earned in effect at the end of each month of good behavior, this calculation is made by the commissioner on a monthly basis. Under \u00a7 18-7a (c), once those two categories total five years, the prisoner is entitled to earn statutory good time credit at a rate of twelve, rather than ten, days per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In reaching that conclusion in <em>Seno, </em>however, we made two related statements that we now are constrained to conclude were factually and legally inaccurate. First, in discussing the hypothetical case of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>prisoner whose crime had been committed prior to July 1,1983, and who had received a seven year sentence, we stated that \u201c[essentially, the enhanced rate of statutory good time had commenced when his confinement time, approximately forty months, <em>and statutory good time, twenty months, </em>totaled five years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 276. That statement was incorrect because there was no indication that in applying \u00a7 18-7a (b), which applied to such a prisoner, statutory good time was used in properly calculating when the enhanced rate of twelve days per month would commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Indeed, that statement was inconsistent with the immediately preceding paragraph in <em>Seno, </em>in which we indicated the proper calculation for such a prisoner: ten days per month for the first sixty months, totaling 600 days; and twelve days per month for the remaining twenty-four months, totaling 288 days; yielding a total of 888 days posted credit. Id., 275. Under that proper calculation, the commissioner calculated when the enhanced rate of posted statutory good time commenced by calculating when the sixth year of the sentence imposed by the court began, without regard to any statutory good time earned or to be earned during that first five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The second misstatement in <em>Seno </em>was that \u201cthe [commissioner] necessarily concedes that had the petitioner been sentenced for an offense committed before July 1, 1983, he would have earned statutory good time at the rate of twelve days per month <em>once his confinement time and statutory good time totaled five years.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 277. This was incorrect because the commissioner had made no such concession, nor was any such concession necessarily implied by the commissioner\u2019s proffered interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the statute at issue in that case, and because, as the petitioner concedes in the present case, under \u00a7 18-7a (b), as a matter of prior interpretation by the commissioner, statutory good time credit had not been included in the calculation of when a prisoner\u2019s enhanced statutory good time began.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The effect of these misstatements, however, was to mislead the trial court in the present case into an erroneous conclusion. Although <em>Seno </em>involved only the interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (c), and the present case involves only the interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (b), the trial court properly took the misstatements in <em>Seno </em>about \u00a7 18-7a (b) as a \u201cmandate . . . that enhanced statutory good time starts after all confinement time and statutory good time equals five years.\u201d Thus, in calculating the first five years of the petitioner\u2019s sentence, during which he was to receive ten days per month statutory good time credit, as opposed to the balance of the sentence, during which he was to receive twelve days per month statutory good time credit, the trial court eschewed using the sixty month figure employed by the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Instead, the trial court calculated that the first five years meant 1825 days (365 days x 5 years), reduced by the 478 days of presentence confinement and presen-tence good time credit, or a total of 1347 days. The trial court then rounded off that 1347 days to 45 months (45 months x 30 days = 1350 days). The court therefore ruled that the respondent was required to calculate the petitioner\u2019s statutory good time credit at the rate of ten days per month for forty-five months, for a total of 450 days, and at the enhanced rate of twelve days per month for the balance of his thirty year sentence of 315 months, or 3780 days, for a total posting of 4230 days. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>court ordered the respondent \u201cto amend the petitioner\u2019s time sheet to reflect posting at the commencement of his sentence of four thousand two hundred thirty (4230) days of statutory good time in addition to [presentence commitment] time of three hundred fifty eight (358) days and [presentence] good time of one hundred and twenty (120) days.\u201d The net effect of this order was as follows: whereas under the respondent\u2019s calculation the petitioner was posted at the commencement of his sentence with a total of 4678 days (4200 + 358 + 120), under the trial court\u2019s order the respondent must post the petitioner at the commencement of his sentence with 4708 days (4230 + 358 + 120), or thirty days more than the respondent has calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The respondent does not urge us to revisit our conclusions in <em>Seno </em>regarding the proper interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (c). Although he disagrees with it, he accepts it as the prevailing interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (c). He does urge us, however, not to convert the erroneous dictum in <em>Seno </em>regarding the interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (b) into a holding of this court. We agree with the respondent, and we conclude that under \u00a7 18-7a (b), a prisoner\u2019s enhanced statutory good time commences at the sixth year of his sentence as imposed by the court, without regard to any presentence confinement time or presen-tence good time. Under this interpretation, therefore, the respondent\u2019s calculation was correct.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>First, the respondent\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (b) is consistent with its language. That statute provides for good conduct credit of ten days per month \u201cof a sentence up to five years,\u201d and twelve days per month \u201cfor the sixth and subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years.\u201d This language strongly suggests that the phrases \u201csentence up to five years,\u201d and \u201csentence which is more than five years,\u201d refer to the sentence imposed by the sentencing court. There is no indication in this language to suggest that it also includes any presentence confinement time or presen-tence good time.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Second, this interpretation is consistent with the history of \u00a7 18-7a (b). The posting method of calculating statutory good time credit was first instituted prior to 1911. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 199, 550 A.2d 309 (1988). From that time until the amendment of \u00a7 18-7a in 1982 by P.A. 82-379, as the respondent urges us to recognize, the posting method did not take into account any presentence confinement or good time. Indeed, until 1967 a prisoner was not credited at all for presentence confinement time; see Public Acts 1967, No. 549, \u00a7 15, as amended by Public Acts 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>No. 735, \u00a7 1, Public Acts 1975, No. 75-355, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 28, and now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 18-97;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and until 1975 there was no credit for presentence good time. See Public Acts 1975, No. 75-222, as amended by Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358, \u00a7 3, and Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 28, and now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 18-98c.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Third, given this history, it would be incongruous to conclude that, as a result of P.A. 82-379, the petitioner gained additional credit to which he would not have been entitled in the absence of that legislation. Public Act 82-379, which created \u00a7 18-7a (c) to apply to prisoners whose crimes were committed on or after July 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>1983, was animated by a legislative desire to reduce credits that theretofore had been available. Before P.A. 82-379, under the respondent\u2019s then prevailing interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (b), as the petitioner acknowledges, a prisoner in the petitioner\u2019s situation would have received credit for his presentence confinement time and presentence good time but once, namely, as credits toward his ultimate release date, but not also as credits toward the date upon which he would begin to earn statutory good time at the enhanced rate. Under the petitioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 18-7a (b), however, he would receive credit for those times twice. We decline to construe \u00a7 18-7a (b) to yield such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\"> After the trial court granted certification to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470.

Compare <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 680 A.2d 113 (1996), and <em>Matarazzo </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>225 Conn. 314, 623 A.2d 470 (1993). The author\u2019s only response is to quote United States Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson when he concurred in the court\u2019s opinion in <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Kristensen, </em>340 U.S. 162, 71 S. Ct. 224, 95 L. Ed. 173 (1950), despite the fact that it was contrary to an opinion he had issued as Attorney General of the United States. Justice Jackson explained: \u201cPrecedent, however, is not lacking for ways by which a judge may recede from a prior opinion that has proven untenable and perhaps misled others. See Chief Justice Taney, <em>License Cases, </em>[46 U.S. (5 How.) 504, 575, 12 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>256 (1847)], recanting views he had pressed upon the Court as Attorney General of Maryland in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>[25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 419, 6 L. Ed. 678 (1827)]. Baron Bramwell extricated himself from a somewhat similar embarrassment by saying, \u2018The matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.\u2019 <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Styrap, </em>26 L. T. R. (N.S.) 704, 706. And Mr. Justice Story, accounting for his contradiction of his own former opinion, quite properly put the matter: \u2018My own error, however, can furnish no ground for its being adopted by this Court . . . .\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gooding, </em>[25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 460, 478, 6 L. Ed. 693 (1827)]. Perhaps Dr. Johnson really went to the heart of the matter when he explained a blunder in his dictionary \u2014 \u2018Ignorance, sir, ignorance.\u2019 But an escape less self-depreciating was taken by Lord Westbury, who, it is said, rebuffed a barrister\u2019s reliance upon an earlier opinion of his Lordship: T can only say that I am amazed that a man of my intelligence should have been guilty of giving such an opinion.\u2019 If there are other ways of gracefully and good-naturedly surrendering former views to a better considered position, I invoke them all.\u201d <em>McGrath </em>v. <em>Kristensen, </em>supra, 177-78 (Jackson, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-97 provides: \u201cConfinement under a mittimus: Presentence confinement credit prior to July 1, 1981.
