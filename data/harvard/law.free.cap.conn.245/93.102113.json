J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2g\">The sole issue in this appeal is the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which amended the Juvenile Justice Act; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 et seq.; by mandating an automatic transfer to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court (criminal docket or court) for any individual who has attained the age of fourteen years and is charged with certain enumerated offenses. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127 (a), automatic transfer of a child to the criminal docket is mandatory if the child is charged with having committed a capital, class A or class B felony,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or arson murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after he or she has attained the age of fourteen years. The court is precluded from exercising any discretion in the transfer process. Additionally, \u00a7 46b-127 (a) provides that the prosecutor may, within ten days after the automatic transfer to the criminal docket, present a motion to the court requesting that a juvenile charged with a class B felony be retransferred to the docket for juvenile matters (juvenile docket).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">This appeal arises out of four consolidated cases, each challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-127 (a). The underlying relevant facts are not disputed by the defendants. On October 29, 1995, three assailants accosted and attempted to rob a pedestrian in the area of York Street in New Haven. The three assailants, one of whom was wearing a mask, surrounded the victim, demanded cash and attempted to search the victim. One of the assailants claimed to have a gun and threatened to use it if the victim did not comply with their demand. The victim escaped unscathed, however, and called the police. Soon after, the three perpetrators accosted another victim. Using the same method, they obtained $17. Soon thereafter, the defendants Randy D., Angel C. and Jose C., each of whom was fourteen years of age, were apprehended in the vicinity. The police found a mask and $17 in their possession, but no gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The defendants were arrested and charged with first degree robbery in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134, a class B felony, as well as conspiracy and attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48, 53a-49 and 53a-134.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Pursu-ant to the provisions of the newly enacted \u00a7 46b-127 (a), the defendants were automatically transferred to the criminal docket. They filed a motion to dismiss their transfers,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleging that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) is unconstitutional because it did not afford them notice of the pending transfer or an opportunity for a hearing and the assistance of counsel prior to the transfer. They also sought an articulation by the prosecutor regarding his reason for not transferring their case back to the juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>docket. The trial court denied both motions, concluding that the statute was not unconstitutional and that an articulation by the prosecution was not required. The three defendants then entered conditional pleas of nolo contendere to youthful offender status,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> based on an underlying charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree. When the defendants entered their pleas, they preserved the right to appeal the denial of their motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants were sentenced to suspended terms of incarceration ranging from two to five years and three years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The defendant Reggie Battles,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> also fourteen years of age, was identified by the victim as one of five participants in the sexual assault of a young woman on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>18, 1996, in Hartford. He was arrested and charged with the class A felonies of first degree kidnapping in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit first degree kidnapping in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-92. He also was charged with the class B felonies of first degree sexual assault in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and conspiracy and attempt to commit first degree sexual assault in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48, 53a-49 and 53a-70, and with the class A misdemeanor of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61. His case was automatically transferred to the criminal docket where he moved for dismissal, asserting that the transfer was unconstitutional. His motion was denied,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the state filed a substitute information charging him with the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree and conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>commit sexual assault in the first degree. Subsequently, Battles entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere to third degree burglary in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103, first degree unlawful restraint in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-95 and fourth degree sexual assault in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> preserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a; see footnote 7 of this opinion. Battles was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, execution suspended after two years, and five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The four defendants appealed from the judgments of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendants claim that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) violates both the state and federal constitutions in that: (1) it denies them procedural due process by depriving them of a vested liberty interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>their status as juveniles without notice, a hearing or the assistance of counsel; (2) it denies them substantive due process by failing to provide for a probable cause hearing prior to their transfer to the criminal docket; (3) it denies them the equal protection of the laws; and (4) it violates the separation of powers provision of article second of the state constitution because the prosecutor\u2019s discretion to determine which juveniles charged with class B felonies should be tried as adults is without standards or the opportunity for judicial review. The defendants claim that this infringes upon an exclusive function of the judiciary, to wit, the right to control the court\u2019s docket. We do not agree with any of the defendants\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We begin our analysis by noting that the defendants face a difficult task in seeking to prove that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) is unconstitutional. It is firmly established that \u201c \u2018legislative enactments carry with them a strong presumption of constitutionality, and that a party challenging the constitutionality of a validly enacted statute bears the heavy burden of proving the statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Chotkowski </em>v. <em>State, </em>240 Conn. 246, 257-58, 690 A.2d 368 (1997); <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Inc., </em>239 Conn. 708, 754, 687 A.2d 506 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 79, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>196 Conn. 655, 663, 495 A.2d 691, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 951, 106 S. Ct. 318, 88 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1985). Bearing this admonition in mind, we turn to the defendants\u2019 substantive claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The defendants first argue that they have a liberty interest in their status as juveniles and the special benefits that such status entails. They further argue that their automatic transfer to the criminal docket violates their right to procedural due process, namely the right to notice of the pending transfer, an opportunity for a hearing and the right to the assistance of counsel at the hearing prior to the transfer. In the defendants\u2019 view, whenever a state has created a juvenile court system and permits transfers from the juvenile court to the criminal court, a juvenile must be accorded those minimal protections prior to the transfer. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">There is no dispute that adjudication as a juvenile rather than prosecution as an adult carries significant benefits, chief among which are a determination of delinquency rather than criminality; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-121; confidentiality; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-124; limitations with respect to sentencing; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-140; erasure of files; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-146; and isolation from the adult criminal population. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-133; see also <em>In re Tyvonne </em>M., 211 Conn. 151, 158-61, 558 A.2d 661 (1989). Accordingly, we assume without deciding that a juvenile <em>in whom a liberty interest in his or her juvenile status has vested, </em>has a substantial liberty interest in the continuation of that juvenile status and that the juvenile cannot and should not be deprived of that status without the procedural protections claimed by the defendants. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>determinative question, therefore, is whether these defendants had a liberty interest in their juvenile status prior to their automatic transfer to the criminal docket. We conclude that they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The requirements for a successful due process claim are well established. \u201cThe fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides that the State [shall not] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law .... In order to prevail on his due process claim, the [defendant] must prove that: (1) he has been deprived of a property [or <em>liberty] interest cognizable under the due process clause; </em>and (2) the deprivation of the property [or liberty] interest has occurred without due process of law. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>240 Conn. 743, 749, 694 A.2d 775 (1997); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>240 Conn. 727, 739, 694 A.2d 758 (1997). As a threshold matter, therefore, the defendants must show that they have a vested liberty interest in their juvenile status that is cognizable under the due process clause. <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 437-38, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). \u201cLiberty interests protected by the Fourteenth Amendment may arise from two sources \u2014 the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States. <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 223-227 [96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451] (1976). <em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 466, 103 S. Ct. 864, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">As they must, the defendants concede that their liberty interest in juvenile status does not emanate directly from the state or federal constitutions. \u201cAny [special treatment] accorded to a juvenile because of his [or her] age with respect to proceedings relative to a criminal offense <em>results from statutory authority, rather than from any inherent or constitutional right. . . . </em>Because the right to [special treatment] emanates from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the legislature and does not involve any fundamental right, <em>that right can be withdrawn or limited to certain classes of juvenile offenders by the legislature provided the classifications are founded upon a rational basis. </em>... In exercising [the state\u2019s] police power the legislature has a broad discretion, both in determining what the public welfare requires, and in fashioning legislation to meet that need.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 755; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>173 Conn. 414, 417-18, 378 A.2d 528 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The basis of th^ defendants\u2019 argument is their assertion that the Juvenile Justice Act itself has created and vested them with a liberty interest in juvenile status. \u201c[0]nce a state provides its citizens with certain statutory rights beyond those secured by the constitution itself, the constitution forbids the state from depriving individuals of those statutory rights without due process of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 749. In this regard, the defendants\u2019 argument is twofold.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">First, they assert that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) vests the juvenile court with original and exclusive jurisdiction over juveniles who are fourteen years of age or older and charged with any of the enumerated offenses. Consequently, they argue, this creates a liberty interest in juvenile status that vests prior to the automatic transfer. Second, the defendants argue that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does not mandate that all juveniles meeting the statutory criteria be tried as adults. Rather, they contend that because prosecutors have discretion to recommend the transfer of juveniles charged with/ class B felonies from the criminal docket to the juvenile docket, some juveniles coming within the purview of \u00a7 46b-127 (a) may be tried as adults, while others may be tried as juveniles. In their view, the possibility that some juveniles who meet the statutory criteria may be adjudicated as juveniles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>defeats the conclusion that the statute is a mandatory, automatic transfer statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The state argues, however, that defendants who are fourteen or over and are charged with one of the enumerated offenses never have a liberty interest in juvenile status because the statute, which is the sole source of any such right, denies that status ab initio. By mandating that juveniles who meet the statutory criteria automatically be transferred to the criminal docket, the legislature has defined which juveniles are excluded from eligibility for juvenile status. In light of this, the state denies that either the vesting of original jurisdiction in the juvenile court or the discretionary authority of prosecutors with respect to juveniles charged with class B felonies creates a vested liberty interest in juvenile status. Even if jurisdiction does originate in the juvenile court, the state argues, this alone is insufficient to create a liberty interest when the statute expressly denies the right to the continuation of such jurisdiction or the exercise of any substantive adjudication by the juvenile court. The state asserts, moreover, that the existence of discretion creates nothing more than the possibility of the future vesting of juvenile status in certain of these offenders, which is not adequate to create a liberty interest. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The defendants rely heavily upon <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 86 S. Ct. 1045, 16 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966), arguing that it mandates a hearing prior to any transfer of a juvenile to the criminal docket. We conclude, however, that the defendants misinterpret the scope of <em>Kent. Kent </em>simply stands for the proposition that if a statute vests a juvenile with the right to juvenile status, then that right constitutes a liberty interest, of which the juvenile may not be deprived without due process, i.e., notice and a hearing.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 556-58. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>statute at issue does not create a liberty interest, <em>Kent </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The statutory scheme in <em>Kent, </em>was far different from that of Connecticut. In <em>Kent, </em>the statute vested \u201coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction\u201d in the juvenile court; id., 556; and permitted the juvenile court to waive jurisdiction <em>only </em>after \u201cfull investigation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Id., 558. The court noted that the \u201cJuvenile Court Act confers upon the child a right to avail himself of that court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. . . . [I]t is implicit in [the juvenile court] scheme that non-criminal treatment is to be the rule\u2014 and the adult criminal treatment, the exception which must be governed by the particular factors of individual cases.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 560-61. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>It went on to conclude that by placing jurisdiction over all juveniles initially, and presumptively permanently, in the juvenile court, and permitting the court to waive its jurisdiction only after a full investigation, the statute created a substantial and vested liberty interest in juvenile status. Id., 561. That liberty interest could be divested by means of transfer to the criminal docket, but only after the requirements of procedural due process were met. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Conversely, \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does not provide for exclusive jurisdiction in the juvenile court or a waiver of that jurisdiction by the court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen and is charged with one or more of the enumerated offenses has no right to avail himself of juvenile court jurisdiction because the statute <em>expressly precludes </em>the exercise of jurisdiction by the juvenile court, unless and until the criminal court has transferred the case from the criminal to the juvenile docket, which may occur only in the case of juveniles charged with class B felonies who have been recommended for transfer from the criminal docket to the juvenile docket. Moreover, it is implicit in \u00a7 46b-127 (a), unlike the statute in <em>Kent, </em>that adult treatment is the rule for such juveniles and that juvenile treatment is a narrow exception. The applicability of <em>Kent </em>cannot be expanded, therefore, beyond the scope of discretionary transfer statutes to mandatory transfer statutes. Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>46b-127 (a) is a mandatory, not discretionary, transfer statute. It is an automatic, mandatory transfer statute with the transfer based exclusively on the age of the defendant and the offense charged. The existence of discretion in the prosecutor to recommend transfer of certain individuals back to the juvenile docket does not undermine the conclusion that the initial transfer to the criminal docket is not a discretionary transfer. We conclude, therefore, that <em>Kent </em>does not require the conclusion that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) violates the defendants\u2019 rights to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The defendants contend, however, that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) is unlike any other statutory scheme requiring automatic transfer because it appears to vest some type of initial jurisdiction in the juvenile court and then divests the juvenile court of jurisdiction over a juvenile who is charged with one or more of the enumerated offenses. They contend, therefore, that reliance on decisions in other jurisdictions is not persuasive. The defendants point to the fact that a juvenile is brought initially to a juvenile detention facility,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that petitions for the transfer to the criminal docket are prepared in the juvenile court by a juvenile prosecutor and are signed by the juvenile court judge or clerk. They argue that this procedural activity initiates a prosecution in the juvenile court and, therefore, original jurisdiction vests in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the juvenile court, creating a vested liberty interest in juvenile status, of which they may not be divested without a due process hearing. The defendants concede, however, that if this initial processing did not occur in the juvenile court, no due process hearing would be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The state maintains, and the defendants concede, that this initiation of proceedings in the juvenile court is exclusively for administrative purposes and that nothing substantive occurs or can occur while the case is temporarily on the juvenile docket. The state argues, consequently, that the administrative processing of paperwork is insufficient to create a right to juvenile status in the face of the statute that specifically denies the right to juvenile status. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In reaching this conclusion we join the overwhelming majority of courts that have addressed this issue. A review of state and federal decisions reveals that statutes providing, under stated circumstances, for mandatory adult adjudication of offenders of otherwise juvenile age, routinely have been upheld against due process challenges based on <em>Kent. </em>See, e.g., <em>Woodard </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>556 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1088, 98 S. Ct. 1285, 55 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>472 F.2d 1329, 1336-37 n.26 (D.C. Cir. <em>1972); People v. Thorpe, </em>641 P.2d 935, 939-40 (Colo. 1982); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>244 Ga. 17, 19, 257 S.E.2d 525 (1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>P.H., </em>145 Ill. 2d 209, 235-36, 582 N.E.2d 700 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perique, </em>439 So. 2d 1060, 1063-64 (La. 1983); <em>In the Matter of Wood, </em>236 Mont. 118, 121-22, 768 P.2d 1370 (1989); <em>Vega </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>47 N.Y.2d 543, 550-51, 393 N.E.2d 450, 419 N.Y.S.2d 454 (1979); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>654 P.2d 1080, 1084 nn.2 &amp; 3 (Okla. Crim. 1982); <em>Jahnke </em>v. <em>State, </em>692 P.2d 911, 927-29 (Wyo. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The seminal case addressing the constitutionality of automatic, mandatory adult adjudication statutes for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>certain classes of juveniles is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>supra, 472 F.2d 1329. The relevant statute in <em>Bland </em>excluded from the definition of \u201cchild\u201d any individual who was at least sixteen^ years old and charged with certain enumerated offenses, thus precluding any juvenile court jurisdiction over such individuals. Id., 1335. The court in <em>Bland </em>distinguished <em>Kent, </em>noting that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] attempt to equate the United States Attorney\u2019s decision in the case at bar with the transfer of an individual from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to that of adult court is unavailing. In contrast to such a situation, the case at bar involves no initial juvenile court jurisdiction; the United States Attorney\u2019s decision to charge an individual sixteen years of age or older with \u25a0 certain enumerated offenses operates automatically to exclude that individual from the jurisdiction of the Family Division.\u201d Id., 1336 n.26. The defendants would have us read into these statements from <em>Bland </em>the implication that a liberty interest is created if there is any contact of the matter with th^juvenile court, even if that contact is temporary and for only a limited, procedural purpose. A review of cases addressing automatic, mandatory transfer statutes convinces us that <em>Bland </em>is not to be so interpreted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a constitutional challenge to Florida\u2019s automatic juvenile transfer statute raising the same due process divestiture of jurisdiction argument that the defendants present. <em>Woodard v. Wainwright, </em>supra, 556 F.2d 781 (habeas action). The Florida statute expressly vested jurisdiction over all juvenile defendants initially in the juvenile court and automatically divested that court of jurisdiction upon the indictment of the juvenile defendants for certain enumerated offenses.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id., 783. The Fifth Circuit concluded that <em>Kent </em>was inapplicable because the juveniles transferred under the Florida stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ute had no liberty interest in juvenile status and, therefore, the statute did not violate their right to due process. Id., 783-84. In so concluding, the court specifically rejected the argument that the initial vesting of jurisdiction in the juvenile court created a liberty interest because \u201cwe do not believe that petitioners have ever been \u2018given\u2019 the right to juvenile treatment in any realistic sense. They argue that Section 39.02 (1), vesting exclusive original jurisdiction in the Juvenile Division of \u2018proceedings in which a child is alleged to be . . . delinquent\u2019gives them an absolute right to juvenile treatment, which then cannot be divested without a hearing. The entire statute, however, must be read as a whole, and express limitations of jurisdiction are contained in Sections 39.02 (5) (a), (b) and (c). Therefore, the statute clearly limits jurisdiction from the start. It is true that these same petitioners might have been treated as juveniles in previous encounters with the law, but everyone outgrows juvenile treatment sooner or later; these petitioners, through acts alleged or admitted, have just outgrown it sooner.\u201d Id., 785. The court specifically concluded that \u201cSection 39.02 (5) (c), Florida Statutes, <em>divesting the juvenile court of jurisdiction </em>over offenders indicted by a grand jury for crimes punishable by death or life imprisonment, <em>is not unconstitutional in failing to require a hearing before a juvenile can be tried as a,n adult. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Additionally, the Louisiana Supreme Court specifically addressed and rejected the defendants\u2019 argument in upholding its juvenile transfer statute in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perique, </em>supra, 439 So. 2d 1060. The court recognized that \u201cuntil a bill of information is filed or a grand jury indictment [is] returned against a juvenile, he is subject to juvenile rather than adult procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id., 1063. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>was unpersuaded, however, by the defendant\u2019s reliance on this fact to allege, as the defendants allege here, that the juvenile court thus has original jurisdiction, creating a liberty interest in juvenile status of which they may not be deprived without a hearing based on <em>Kent. </em>Id., 1063-64. The Louisiana court found its situation \u201ceasily distinguishable\u201d from <em>Kent </em>and concluded that \u201c[i]n this case, there are no statutory rights of which defendants are being deprived. Once a sixteen-year-old is charged with armed robbery, the question is not one of \u2018transfer\u2019 of jurisdiction. Rather, the juvenile court is automatically divested of jurisdiction. This divestiture is not a matter of discretion on the part of the juvenile court or the district attorney, but is controlled by the statute defining the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 1064.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We find the rationale of these courts to be persuasive. Although the statutes surveyed may differ in some respects from \u00a7 46b-127 (a), they are similar inasmuch as they provide that initial procedures commence in the juvenile court, but adult criminal prosecution is mandated on the basis of the juvenile\u2019s age and the offense charged, thus automatically divesting the juvenile court of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Therefore, despite the fact that the jurisdiction of the juvenile court attaches in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>some nominal sense for the purpose of conducting limited administrative procedures, there is no meaningful attachment of any substantive right to juvenile status or its attendant benefits. Read as a whole, the Juvenile Justice Act; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 et seq.; clearly denies the juvenile court jurisdiction over any juvenile who is fourteen years of age or older and charged with any of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 46b-127 (a).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It also prohibits the juvenile court from participating in any meaningful manner with respect to the transfer of those individuals at the time of the automatic transfer. We have found no case, and the defendants have directed our attention to none,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in which a statute similar to \u00a7 46b-127 (a) was found to have created a liberty interest in juvenile status merely by the existence of contact with the juvenile court for procedural purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The defendants argue, secondarily, that the due process violation is \u201cexacerbate [d]\u201d by the fact that \u201cunre-viewable prosecutorial discretion clearly increases the</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>risk that the wrong children will be prosecuted as adults.\u201d According to the defendants\u2019 argument, the deprivation of juvenile status may occur only in \u201cclearly circumscribed situations\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 360, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); and the absence of standards in \u00a7 46b-127 (a) to control the prosecutor\u2019s discretion whether to transfer certain juveniles from the criminal court to the juvenile court, coupled with the absence of a right to judicial review of that decision, run afoul of this requirement. Disregarding, for the moment, the defendants\u2019 mischaracterization of the scope of prosecutorial discretion,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we are not persuaded that the absence of specific standards relating to the exercise of a prosecutor\u2019s discretion to transfer certain juveniles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to the juvenile court renders \u00a7 46b-127 (a) constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Under federal law, the attorney general has the discretion to direct that any juvenile be prosecuted either as an adult or as a juvenile, and federal law does not provide standards to guide the exercise of discretion by the attorney general.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This discretion is significantly broader than that vested in prosecutors by \u00a7 46b-127 (a), which discretion is limited to recommending transfer to the juvenile court of certain juveniles who would otherwise be tried as adults. The federal courts consistently have concluded that the exercise of discretion by the attorney general \u201cis a prosecutorial decision beyond the reach of the due process rights of counsel and a hearing.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>473 F.2d 334, 335 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 869, 94 S. Ct. 183, 38 L. Ed. 2d 116 (1973); accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Quinones, </em>516 F.2d 1309, 1311 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 852, 96 S. Ct. 97, 46 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1975); see <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Parratt, </em>543 F.2d 1214,1216 (8th Cir. 1976) (interpreting Nebraska law permitting prosecutorial discretion to charge as either juvenile or adult). In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>supra, 472 F.2d 1337, the court concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot accept the hitherto unaccepted argument that due process requires an adversary hearing before the prosecutor can exercise his age-old function of deciding what charge to bring against whom. Grave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>consequences have always flowed from this, but never has a hearing been required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">There is a vast difference between the exercise of judicial discretion without a hearing and the exercise of executive, i.e., prosecutorial, discretion without a hearing. The former has been held to violate due process, while the latter has not. \u201cJudicial proceedings must be clothed in the raiment of due process, while the processes of prosecutorial decision-making wear very different garb. It is one thing to hold, as we have, that when a state makes waiver of a juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction a judicial function, the judge must cast about the defendant all of the trappings of due process, but it does not necessarily follow that a state or the United States may not constitutionally treat the basic question as a prosecutorial function . . . . [T]he character of the proceeding, rather than its consequences to the accused, are largely determinative of his rights. . . . [T]he guaranty of a hearing found in the due process clause of the Fifth [and Fourteenth] Amendments] has traditionally been limited to judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings. It has never been held applicable to the processes of prosecutorial decision-making.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 473 F.2d 336. Consequently, the prosecutor\u2019s right to exercise discretion in determining whether to recommend transfer to the juvenile docket does not violate the defendants\u2019 due process rights.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Another fundamental flaw in the defendants\u2019 due process argument is the presumption that judicial review</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of a prosecutor\u2019s discretionary decision is essential or even desirable. We recently reiterated the principle that prosecutors are vested with broad, albeit not unlimited, discretion and that undue judicial interference in the exercise of their discretion is to be eschewed. \u201cProsecutors . . . have a wide latitude and broad discretion in determining when, who, why and whether to prosecute for violations of the criminal law. . . . This broad discretion, which necessarily includes deciding which citizens should be prosecuted and for what charges they are to be held accountable . . . rests largely on the recognition that the decision to prosecute is particularly ill-suited to judicial review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinchen, </em>243 Conn. 690, 699, 707 A.2d 1255 (1998). We have recognized that \u201cthe basis of prosecutorial charging decisions is one area not generally well suited for broad judicial oversight because it involve [s] exercises of judgment and discretion that are often difficult to articulate in a manner suitable for judicial evaluation. . . . The judicial branch . . . [is] not in the best position to consider the various factors that prosecutors weigh, such as the strength of the evidence, the visibility of the crime, the availability of resources and possible deterrent effects. Nor is the judicial branch anxious to consider the validity of various rationales advanced for particular charging decisions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 575, 663 A.2d 317 (1995). The various factors that go into the decision of whether to recommend transfer to the juvenile docket is as unique to the prosecutorial function as any other charging decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">We are persuaded, therefore, that the lack of judicial review or express standards to guide the prosecutor\u2019s decision does not render \u00a7 46b-127 (a) constitutionally infirm. Because any juvenile that comes within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ambit of \u00a7 46b-127 (a) is, in the judgment of the legislature, presumptively the \u201cright\u201d child to be tried as an adult, there is little danger that the \u201cwrong\u201d child will be tried as an adult. The fact that the juvenile in question, his or her advocate, or even the court, might believe that he or she is better suited to juvenile adjudication than to criminal prosecution is of little significance. If the defendants disagree with the legislative conclusion of which class of juveniles presumptively should be tried as adults, their remedy lies with the legislature, not this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Finally, the existence of prosecutorial discretion does nothing to further the determination of whether juveniles that come under the provisions of \u00a7 46b-127 (a) have a vested interest in their juvenile status. The fact that the prosecutor can recommend transfer of certain offenders from the criminal court to the juvenile docket does not create a liberty interest in juvenile status. In order for the defendants to succeed in their contention that state law creates a liberty interest in their staths as juveniles they must show that the \u201cstate statute creates a right to treatment [as juveniles] or creates a justifiable expectation that such treatment will be afforded to [them].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>224 Conn. 168, 183, 617 A.2d 889 (1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 919, 113 S. Ct. 2365, 124 L. Ed. 2d 271 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>190 Conn. 327, 340, 461 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 938, 104 S. Ct. 350, 78 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1983). The mere fact that the prosecutor may exercise discretion to recommend transfer of certain juveniles to the juvenile docket does not create a justifiable expectation of juvenile status such that its inclusion in \u00a7 46b-127 (a) may be said to create a liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We conclude that any individual who is fourteen years of age or older and charged with the commission of a capital or class A or B felony or arson murder cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>meet the threshold due process requirement of demonstrating a cognizable liberty interest in juvenile status. The Juvenile Justice Act, which is the sole source of any liberty interest in juvenile status and the benefits attendant thereon, read as a whole, expressly excludes juveniles age fourteen and older charged with certain offenses from juvenile status, in the absence of subsequent, affirmative, discretionary action on the part of a prosecutor and the criminal court. We conclude that the lack of notice, a hearing and the assistance of counsel prior to the automatic transfer is not a violation of procedural due process because no process is due in the juvenile court prior to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The defendants also argue that substantive due process requires that the juvenile court conduct a hearing prior to transfer to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed the offense charged in order to prevent the harm that follows the loss of juvenile status. They argue that the absence of a mandatory probable cause hearing in the juvenile court renders \u00a7 46b-127 (a) constitutionally invalid. This argument founders upon the inaccuracy of its major premise, namely, that these defendants have a substantive liberty interest in their juvenile status that is in danger of being lost without a probable cause hearing. As we concluded in part I of this opinion, a juvenile who is at least fourteen years of age and charged with certain offenses has no constitutionally cognizable liberty interest in juvenile status.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We note, however, that the legislature has taken steps to ensure that the protections the defendants complain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>of losing are adequately preserved under \u00a7 46b-127 (a) until after the criminal court has had an opportunity to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged. Section 46b-127 (a) mandates that a juvenile be arraigned within one court day of transfer to the criminal docket. The statute further requires that <em>all </em>juvenile files transferred pursuant to its terms remain sealed for ten days and that the file of any juvenile charged with a class B felony for whom the prosecutor recommends transfer to the juvenile docket must remain sealed until the court rules on the prosecutor\u2019s motion. Additionally, within the ten days of continued confidentiality, the court must conduct a probable cause hearing if such a hearing is required pursuant to <em>Gerstein </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>420 U.S. 103, 124-25, 95 S. Ct. 854, 43 L. Ed. 2d 541 (1975).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> If no <em>Gerstein </em>hearing is required, the defendant nonetheless has the opportunity to move to dismiss the charges pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The court may dismiss the charges if it finds that there is inadequate evidence to support a finding of probable cause with respect to the offense charged. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 460, 512 A.2d 183 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn. App. 520, 527, 495 A.2d 724 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Consequently, the trial court must, either as a matter of course, or upon request of the defendant, make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>determination that probable cause exists to believe that the defendant committed the offense charged. If the trial court concludes that no probable cause exists, it may dismiss the charges. If charges against a juvenile who was transferred to the criminal docket pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127 (a) are dismissed, \u00a7 46b-127 (c)<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> mandates that the juvenile shall resume his or her juvenile status.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Additionally, juveniles continue to remain in juvenile detention, segregated from the adult criminal population, until sentencing after conviction or until they reach the age of sixteen. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (c). By building into \u00a7 46b-127 (a) the safeguard of ten days of continued confidentiality and other protections of subsection (c), the legislature has obviated the fear, alluded to by the defendants, that juveniles may suffer undue harm if prosecutors unfairly charge juveniles with one of the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 46b-127 (a) in order to force juveniles onto the criminal docket when the underlying facts do not support the charge. Finally, the legislature also has provided that at least those juveniles charged with class B felonies, other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>certain sexual assaults, who are on the criminal docket pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127 (a) are eligible for youthful offender status, which provides many of the same protections that juvenile status affords. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-76b et seq., set forth in footnote 6 of this opinion; <em>State </em>v. Matos, supra, 240 Conn. 750-52. With the protections of segregation in confinement, continued confidentiality, youthful offender status and the resumption of juvenile status upon dismissal, a juvenile suffers no appreciably greater harm by having the probable cause determination take place in the criminal court after the transfer than if it had occurred in the juvenile court prior to the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Although the defendants also raise their substantive and proceedural due process claims separately under article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> it is unnecessary for us to address that argument. The defendants concede that we consistently have concluded that the right to juvenile status \u201cresults from statutory authority, rather than from any inherent or constitutional right . . . and does not involve any fundamental right . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 755; <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 417-18; see also <em>In re Tyvonne M., </em>supra, 211 Conn. 157 (no common-law right to juvenile status). Moreover, our research has revealed no case, and the defendants have cited to none, in which we have concluded that article first, \u00a7 8, is implicated in the absence of a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest. Because we conclude that the defendants have no vested liberty interest in juvenile status, they cannot prevail on their state constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The defendants next assert that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) violates the equal protection clauses of the state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>constitutions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> They contend that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does not require that all juveniles who are at least fourteen years of age and charged with class B felonies must be prosecuted as adults, but rather permits some to have their cases adjudicated as juveniles while others are tried as adults at the whim of the prosecutor. Consequently, they argue, fourteen and fifteen year old juveniles charged with certain enumerated felonies are similarly situated, but may be treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The law governing equal protection claims is well established. \u201cTo implicate the equal protection clauses under the state and federal constitutions . . . it is necessary that the <em>state statute in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons standing in the same relation to it differently. . . . </em>The equal protection clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages .... Where, as here, the classification at issue neither impinges upon a fundamental right nor affects a suspect group it will withstand constitutional attack if the distinction is founded on a rational basis. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>240 Conn. 738-39; <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 760-61; <em>Blakeslee Arpaia Chapman, Inc. </em>v. <em>El Constructors, Inc., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 755-56. Consequently, the defendants must show, as a threshold matter, that \u00a7 46b-127 (a), either on its face or as applied, treats similarly situated individuals differently.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We begin and end our discussion with an analysis of that threshold question. We conclude that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) facially does not treat similarly situated individuals differently and that the defendants have presented no evidence, nor even an allegation, of unequal treatment in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The sole basis upon which the defendants rest their equal protection claim is the existence of prosecutorial discretion to recommend that juveniles who are fourteen years of age or older and are charged with class B felonies be transferred from the criminal docket to the juvenile docket. More specifically, the defendants take issue with the necessary corollary of this provision, which allows prosecutors the discretion <em>not </em>to recommend transfer. They argue that this discretion violates their right to the equal protection of the laws. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 assertion, \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does require that <em>every </em>juvenile who is at least fourteen years old and is charged with a capital or class A or B <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>felony or arson murder must automatically be transferred to the criminal docket. It also provides that a prosecutor may recommend transfer to the juvenile court of any juvenile charged with a class B felony. Consequently, every juvenile that comes within the scope of \u00a7 46b-127 (a) is treated identically by the statute. The possibility of different treatment occurs, if at all, at the hand of the prosecutor and the court in recommending and approving the subsequent transfer to the juvenile docket.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We conclude that the mere fact that a statute permits the prosecutor to treat one individual charged with a specific crime differently from another individual charged with the same crime or a crime of similar magnitude does not render the statute discriminatory on its face. We further conclude that the statute is not discriminatory as applied, in the absence of any evidence to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It is firmly settled in both state and federal due process jurisprudence that \u201c \u2018[a]bsent a showing of a selection deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion or other arbitrary classification . . . conscious selectivity in enforcement of the law is not in itself a constitutional violation. <em>Oyler </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>368 U.S. 448, 456, 82 S. Ct. 501, 7 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1962). A defendant claiming discriminatory prosecution must show (1) that others similarly situated have generally not been prosecuted and that he has been singled out and (2) that he is the victim of invidious discrimination based on impermissible considerations such as race, religion, or the exercise of a constitutionally protected right. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Berrios, </em>501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 474, 450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>A.2d 828 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 287-88, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The defendants make no allegation that prosecutors, in applying \u00a7 46b-127 (a), have acted with a discriminatory purpose based on impermissible criteria, nor does the record support such a claim. There is no evidence that any prosecutorial decision to retain certain juveniles on the criminal docket was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. In keeping with our traditional review of inadequately supported allegations, \u201cwe note that the constitutional challenge to [\u00a7 46b-127 (a)] comes to us in the posture least likely to succeed. [We have] frequently noted the imprudence of adjudicating constitutional questions in a \u2018factual vacuum.\u2019 ... A party mounting a constitutional challenge to the validity of a statute must provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. . . . We do not give advisory opinions, nor do we sit as roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of legislative enactments.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Mohi, </em>901 P.2d 991 (Utah 1995), in which the Utah Supreme Court declared the Utah transfer statute unconstitutional in light of Utah\u2019s uniform operation of laws clause, is unpersuasive.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The statute at issue in <em>Mohi </em>was substantially different from \u00a7 46b-127 (a) in that it permitted the prosecutor to decide whether to prosecute any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>juvenile as an adult or as a juvenile, irrespective of age or offense charged, without standards to guide the decision. Id., 999. The Utah court readily acknowledged that its statute is significantly different from statutes such as \u00a7 46b-127 (a), in which the prosecutor\u2019s discretion is limited to the ability to recommend removal to the juvenile docket of a juvenile who would otherwise be tried as an adult. Id. Consequently, the opinion of the Utah court, addressing a statute dissimilar to \u00a7 46b-127 (a) and based exclusively on Utah state constitutional grounds, provides no persuasive authority.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Research has revealed no case, and the defendants point to none, in which a juvenile transfer statute was struck down as violative of equal protection solely because the prosecutor has discretion to recommend that a juvenile who would otherwise be tried as an adult be transferred to the juvenile docket. To the contrary, cases addressing prosecutorial discretion far greater than that provided by \u00a7 46b-127 (a) uphold the constitutionality of those statutes.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We conclude that the defendants\u2019 equal protection claim fails for lack of proof that \u00a7 46b-127 (a), either facially or as applied, treats similarly situated individuals differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The defendants\u2019 final argument is that the discretion of the prosecutor to determine whether to recommend that a juvenile charged with a class B felony be transferred from the criminal docket to the juvenile docket without any statutory standards violates principles of separation of powers.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The crux of this argument, though not entirely clear, appears to be that \u00a7 46b-127 (a), by granting \u201ccontrol by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office over calling cases for trial\u201d usurps the judicial function of controlling the court\u2019s docket. Practice Book \u00a7 44-12, formerly \u00a7 973, provides that \u201c[t]he judicial authority, acting through the clerk, shall control the time and the manner of scheduling all proceedings in criminal cases . . . .\u201d The defendants maintain that allowing prosecutors to decide which juveniles will be allowed to return to the juvenile docket, in their sole, exclusive and unrestricted discretion, without judicial review, imper-missibly infringes upon the judicial function. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The law is well established with respect to evaluating \u201cchallenges to statutes whose constitutional infirmity is claimed to flow from impermissible intrusion upon the judicial power . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 676, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991). \u201cBecause the powers of the three branches of government inevitably overlap, this court has consistently held that the doctrine of the separation of powers cannot be applied rigidly . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and has refused to find constitutional impropriety in a statute simply because it affects the judicial function .... A statute violates the constitutional mandate for a separate judicial magistracy <em>only </em>if it represents an effort by the legislature to exercise a power which lies <em>exclusively </em>under the control of the courts .... In accordance with these principles, a two part inquiry has emerged to evaluate the constitutionality of a statute that is alleged to violate separation of powers principles by impermissibly infringing on the judicial authority. ... A statute will be held unconstitutional on those grounds if: (1) it governs subject matter that not only falls within the judicial power, but also lies exclusively within judicial control; or (2) it significantly interferes with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 177-78; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 676-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We conclude that control of the criminal docket is not an exclusive judicial function. By this we mean only that the prosecution, by exercising its core function of determining which cases to prosecute, obviously exercises some \u201ccontrol\u201d over the criminal docket. That, however, does not infringe on the separation of powers principle; it flows from that principle. Additionally, we conclude that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does not permit the prosecutor to control the docket to the point of interfering with the orderly function of the judiciary. The legislature, by enacting laws that define criminal conduct, in large part already affects which cases will appear on the criminal docket. A prosecutor\u2019s decision whether to charge or whether to take a plea bargain also affects the docket. Although these actions affect the docket, they do not control the time and manner of scheduling. Similarly, the decision whether to request that an individual be transferred to the juvenile docket might affect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>but does not control, the docket. This is particularly true when, as here, the court must approve of the transfer prior to its effectuation. The absence of judicial review over the prosecutor\u2019s decision not to recommend transfer is no more an intrusion upon the judicial function than is the lack of review of a prosecutor\u2019s decision not to charge or not to offer a plea bargain. Consequently, we conclude that \u00a7 46b-127 (a) does not violate the mandate of separate magistracies in article second of the constitution of Connecticut, as amended by article eighteen of the amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (a) provides: \u201cThe court shall automatically transfer from the docket for juvenile matters to the regular criminal docket of the Superior Court the case of any child charged with the commission of a capital felony, a class A or B felony or a violation of section 53a-54d [arson murder], provided such offense was committed after such child attained the age of fourteen years.

The strong presumption of the constitutional validity of a statute is an integral aspect of our jurisprudence, and its elimination or dilution would seriously undermine the foundation of our precedents. Furthermore, the notion of \u201cproving\u201d a statute unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, although phrased in terms appropriate to \u201cproof\u2019 <em>offacts, </em>is a misnomer when applied to the appellate function of determining whether a statute is constitutional. That function involves a quintessential question of law, and is not accurately described in terms appropriate to questions of fact.

Id., 561. The court declined the invitation to conclude that the full repertoire of due process rights applicable in the criminal adjudication of adults was necessary in a juvenile proceedings because it concluded that the statutory requirements were sufficient to address the question of whether a hearing was required. Id., 556. The court, in deciding that a hearing was required, concluded that \u201c[w]e believe that this result is required by the statute read in context of constitutional principles relating to due process and the assistance of counsel.\u201d Id., 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">This language has caused jurists and academicians to struggle with the appropriate interpretation of <em>Kent. </em>See, e.g., <em>Woodard </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>556 F.2d 781, 783-84 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1088, 98 S.

Narrowly construed, <em>Kent </em>requires a hearing only if the applicable statute requires a. hearing because due process requires the court to comply with the statutory mandate. A broader view of the opinion may be that federal due process requires that whenever an individual is given a statutory right to juvenile status, that right may not be divested by a transfer to the criminal court, without a prior hearing. It is unnecessary to resolve this issue in light of our conclusion that, even under the broadest interpretation, <em>Kent </em>is inapplicable to this case because \u00a7 46b-127 (a) precludes vesting of any liberty interest in juveniles who are at least fourteen years old and charged with an enumerated offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\"> The court was reviewing the District of Columbia statutes, D.C.

This is unlike other states where there is a transfer of actual jurisdiction between independent courts. We refer to the concept of the rights that arise upon the commitment of a case to the juvenile docket in terms of jurisdiction vesting in the juvenile court for the sake of convenience in comparing our conclusion to that of other jurisdictions because the concept of venue is inadequate to make this comparison. This should not be viewed, however, in any way as a retreat from our conclusion or rationale in <em>Kelley.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> We find the fact that the juvenile is taken to juvenile detention when first arrested to be of little moment, because this is a right mandated by a separate statutory provision for <em>any </em>individual under the age of sixteen, irrespective of the crime charged, and the juvenile is not deprived of this right pursuant to \u00a7 46b-127 (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-127 (c); footnote 32 of this opinion. By statute, all juveniles are to be taken to a juvenile detention facility and, if they are to be maintained in custody, they must . remain in a juvenile facility during their trial until the earlier of their sixteenth birthday or after sentencing upon conviction as an adult. The defendants assert that some, indeed most, juveniles are actually sent to adult criminal detention facilities pending trial.

The Delaware amendment provided that a juvenile whose case was pending adjudication in juvenile court was required to be transferred automatically to the criminal court on reaching his or her eighteenth birthday. Id., 247. Previously, the statute had required a hearing to determine whether the juvenile in question was better served by remaining in the juvenile court. Id., 248. The statute struck down in <em>Hughes </em>did not mandate that divesture be immediate upon charging the defendant, but that it might occur sometime during the pendency of the case if the defendant reached eighteen years of age prior to final adjudication. Consequently, for some meaningful period of time prior to transfer, the juvenile was permitted to enjoy the benefits of juvenile status. Moreover, the juvenile court exercised exclusive jurisdiction over substantive matters relating to the adjudication. The provisions of the Delaware statute are not similar to \u00a7 46b-127 (a), in which the mandate of criminal adjudication occurs immediately upon charging before any substantive matters are adjudicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\"> Prosecutorial discretion under \u00a7 46b-127 (a) with respect to recommending the transfer of certain juveniles to the juvenile docket is neither unfettered nor exclusive. \u201cAn attorney as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege which has been accorded him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 554-55, 663 A.2d 317 (1995); <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 450, 91 A. 274 (1914); see <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; Trantolo, </em>190 Conn. 510, 524, 461 A.2d 938 (1983). Prosecutors, as attorneys, are constrained by the duties of public office and as officers of the court to act according to law and in the interest of justice. <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 574. Any defendant who has reason to believe that the prosecuting authority has abused its discretion may bring a motion to the court seeking dismissal of the charge. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 set forth in footnote 31 of this opinion; Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 41-8, formerly \u00a7 815. \u201c[T]he purpose of the law [\u00a7 54-56] and the philosophy [behind] it was to prevent unchecked power by a prosecuting attorney.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 460, 512 A.2d 183 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>4 Conn.

The legislature, through the application of \u00a7 46b-127 (a), determines which juveniles are to be placed on the criminal docket, not the prosecutor. The prosecutor recommends removal, but the recommendation must be approved by the court before a juvenile may be removed to the juvenile docket.
