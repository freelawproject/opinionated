J.</author>\n<p id=\"at-dedup-0\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether an insurer is entitled to a reduction of its limits of liability for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage (underinsured motorist coverage) by an amount equal to the sum of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the insured. The trial court concluded that allowing such a reduction would be contrary to public policy. The defendant, Allstate Insurance Company, appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The parties have stipulated to the facts. On March 30, 1990, the plaintiff, Anthony Vitti, was a passenger in a motor vehicle, owned by him and operated by his wife, Joanne Vitti, when his vehicle was involved in a collision with a motor vehicle owned and operated by Pamela R. Ruokonen. The accident, in which the plaintiff sustained serious injuries, was attributable solely to Ruokonen\u2019s negligence. At the time of the accident, the limit of Ruokonen\u2019s liability coverage was $20,000, the entire amount of which was paid to the plaintiff by Ruokonen\u2019s liability carrier. The plaintiff then sought recovery under his own automobile insurance policy, issued by the defendant, which policy provided for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for two vehicles in the amount of $100,000 per covered vehicle. The plaintiff is entitled under his own policy, therefore, to coverage of up to $200,000, less any applicable offsets to the limits of the defendant\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The parties agree that the $200,000 limit of the defendant\u2019s liability should be reduced by the $20,000 paid to the plaintiff by Ruokonen\u2019s insurer and by the $5000 paid by the defendant to the plaintiff as basic reparations benefits. The parties also agree that the plaintiffs injuries would, in the absence of further offsets, entitle him to collect the entire remaining balance of the defendant\u2019s policy. It was determined on April 1, 1991, however, that because the plaintiff was totally disabled as a result of the accident,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was entitled to disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>benefits pursuant to a social security medical determination of impairment made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1 et seq. As a consequence, prior to the time of trial, the plaintiff had received social security disability benefits in the amount of $63,577. The trial court also found that the present value of future social security disability benefits, as noted in an affidavit submitted by the defendant\u2019s expert and undisputed by the plaintiff, is $83,393. The amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the plaintiff, for which the defendant claims an offset against its liability, is, therefore, $146,970. If we agree with the defendant\u2019s claim, the defendant is obligated to the plaintiff for only $28,030 in underinsured motorist benefits. The defendant requests that, if we conclude that the available underinsured motorist coverage may be offset by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the plaintiff, we direct the trial court to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $28,030.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The sole dispute between the parties is whether the defendant may offset the amount of underinsured motorist coverage available to the plaintiff by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the plaintiff. Section 38a-334-6 (d) (2)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, and the policy issued to the plaintiff,* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which materially tracks the regulatory language, permit the defendant to reduce the amount payable pursuant to a claim for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, in the language of the policy, by \u201call amounts paid or payable under any worker\u2019s compensation law, disability benefits law, or similar law.\u201d The defendant argues that social security disability benefits are clearly payable to the plaintiff under a \u201cdisability benefits law,\u201d and, consequently, are properly offset against the plaintiff\u2019s available underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The plaintiff counters that because neither his insurance policy nor the regulation specifically refers to <em>social security </em>disability benefits, they are vague and ambiguous. Accordingly, he maintains that the policy should be construed against the insurer so as not to allow social security disability benefits as an offset. He argues that the regulation must be narrowly construed to apply only to those disability benefits laws that are like workers\u2019 compensation laws.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Alternatively, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>argues that if \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) does permit the defendant to offset social security disability benefits, it is contrary to the public policy underlying our uninsured and underinsured motorist statute and beyond the scope of the statute authorizing the commissioner to promulgate regulations, and is, therefore, void.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u201cInterpretation of an insurance policy, like the interpretation of other written contracts, involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy. . . . Unlike certain other contracts, however, where absent statutory warranty or definitive contract language the intent of the parties and thus the meaning of the contract is a factual question subject to limited appellate review . . . construction of a contract of insurance presents a question of law for the court which this court reviews de novo. ...\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Bulaong, </em>218 Conn. 51, 58, 588 A.2d 138 (1991). Moreover, we have concluded that \u201can insurer may not, by contract, reduce its liability for such uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage <em>except as \u00a7 38-175a-6 [now \u00a7 38a-334-6] of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies expressly authorizes. . . . Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. Ferrante, 201 Conn. 478, 483, 518 A.2d 373 (1986) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>219 Conn. 371, 377-78, 593 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>498 (1991). Consequently, we must interpret \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) and determine its validity. If the regulation is valid, the contract language will be enforceable because it parallels the regulation. Our review of the regulation and the authorizing statute is plenary. See <em>Andover Ltd. Partnership I </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>232 Conn. 392, 396, 655 A.2d 759 (1995); <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>226 Conn. 737, 744 n.8, 629 A.2d 350 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The question of whether an insurer may offset, pursuant to \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2), the available limits of coverage by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to an insured is one of first impression for this court. Although we previously have interpreted this regulation and the attendant public policy considerations underlying the uninsured or underinsured motorist statute, we have done so in the context of other permitted offsets. See, e.g., <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 8, 15, 615 A.2d 1032 (1992) (unclaimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>213 Conn. 532, 538, 569 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 814, 111 S. Ct. 52, 112 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1005, 112 S. Ct. 640, 116 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1991) (claimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976) (amounts received from negligent tortfeasor).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>We begin our analysis with the relevant provision of the insurance contract, which provides that \u201c[t]he limits of this [uninsured or underinsured motorist] coverage will be reduced by . . <em>.2. all amounts paid or payable under any </em>workers\u2019] compensation law, <em>disability benefits law, </em>or similar law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe Connecticut rule of construction of insurance policies is well settled. If the terms of an insurance policy are of doubtful meaning, that permissible construction which is most favorable to the insured is to be adopted; but if they are plain and unambiguous the established rules for the construction of contracts apply, the language, from which the intention of the parties is to be deduced, must be accorded its natural and ordinary meaning, and the courts cannot indulge in a forced construction ignoring provisions or so distorting them as to accord a meaning other than that evidently intended by the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 15. Additionally, if the policy comports with the language of the regulation, it will be deemed to provide that same level of protection permitted by the regulation. Id., 15-16. \u201cIn order for a policy exclusion to be expressly authorized by [a] statute [or regulation], there must be substantial congruence between the statutory [or regulatory] provision and the policy provision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 152, 156, 617 A.2d 454 (1992). The terms in the policy issued by the defendant and \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) correspond in all material respects.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cWe can perceive no incongruence between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the regulation and the policy exclusion that would suggest that the policy exclusion was not authorized by the regulation.\u201d Id., 157. Consequently, if \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) permits an offset for social security disability benefits, the policy language must be deemed to provide the defendant with a legitimate offset. See <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Although the parties advance differing meanings of the phrase \u201cany . . . disability benefits law,\u201d we conclude that the phrase is not ambiguous. The plaintiff argues that this phrase is vague and ambiguous because it does not expressly state that social security disability benefits are a limitation on coverage. The plaintiff suggests that if the commissioner intended to <em>include </em>social security disability benefits as a limitation on coverage, a statement to that effect certainly would have been set forth expressly in a separate subdivision. To the contrary, we believe that the commissioner would have included a separate subdivision only if the intent was to <em>exclude </em>social security disability benefits from the broad scope of the limitation <em>for</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> any . . . </em>disability benefits law.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The commissioner included no such limitation and, therefore, we presume that the regulation intends none. Moreover, we fail to see how the regulation could have stated more clearly that it intended to include <em>all </em>laws providing disability benefits, including those governing social security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u201c[A] court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Peerless Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>241 Conn. 476, 483, 697 A.2d 680 (1997) (interpreting insurance policy language); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio Power, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 635, 656, 708 A.2d 202 (1998) (interpreting statutory language). \u201cOur rules of statutory construction apply to administrative regulations. . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Marcinek, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 744 n.8<em>; Preston </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>218 Conn. 821, 829 n.9, 591 A.2d 421 (1991). \u201c[I]n the absence of other statutory [or regulatory] guidance, we may appropriately look to the meaning of the word[s] as commonly expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>234 Conn. 301, 309, 662 A.2d 732 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The text of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) does not indicate an intention to assign anything other than the ordinary and common meaning to the words in the phrase \u201cany . . . disability benefits law . . . .\u201d The ordinary definition of \u201cdisability\u201d includes \u201cthe inability to pursue an occupation or perform services for wages because of physical or mental impairment . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. The term \u201cbenefit\u201d is defined to include \u201cfinancial help in a time of sickness, old age, or unemployment. . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. \u201cLaw\u201d is defined as \u201ca rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. When the ordinary meaning of these terms is applied to the regulatory language, it is clear that disability benefits paid or payable pursuant to the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are \u201camounts paid or payable under any . . . disability benefits law . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Consequently, we conclude that both \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) and the insurance policy, which tracks the language of the regulation, unambiguously allow the defendant to offset the available uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the plaintiff. We can divine no other meaning.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">The plaintiff argues, in the alternative, that if \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) does permit an insurer to offset its liability by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the insured, then the regulation is invalid because it is not within the scope of the authorizing statute and is contrary to the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage statute. This argument rests upon the plaintiffs interpretation of the public policy considerations underlying the enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>According to the plaintiff, the legislature could not have intended to permit an offset by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable to the insured because to do so would place the insured in a worse position than one who brings a claim against an adequately insured tortfeasor. The plaintiff maintains that the legislature intended that the victim of either an adequately insured tortfeasor or an inadequately insured tortfeasor be in exactly the same position. He relies on our previous statement that \u201c[t]he public policy established by the uninsured motorist statute is that every insured is entitled to recover for the damages he or she would have been able to recover if the uninsured [or underinsured] motorist had maintained a policy of [adequate] liability insurance.\u201d <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>188 Conn. 245, 249, 449 A.2d 157 (1982); accord <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 766, 774-75, 621 A.2d 262 (1993); <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In support, the plaintiff assumes, without citing any legal authority, that the collateral source doctrine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>embodied in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-225a and 52-225b,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> would not permit a tortfeasor or the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer to offset social security disability benefits against a tort judgment. That question has not been addressed by this court or the Appellate Court and is currently undecided. Moreover, that particular issue is not before us and we need not address it. Because the plaintiffs assumption is central to his argument, however, we accept, for the sake of argument, that it is correct; on that assumption, however, we do not agree with the plaintiffs conclusion that an insurer consequently may not deduct social security disability benefits from uninsured and underin-sured motorist coverage limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The plaintiff has a difficult task to demonstrate that \u00a7 38a~334-6 (d) (2) is beyond the scope of the insurance commissioner\u2019s authority. <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>222 Conn. 631, 649, 610 A.2d 1185 (1992); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>216 Conn. 390, 399, 579 A.2d 525 (1990). The commissioner is specifically authorized by statute to promulgate regulations regarding \u201cexclusions, conditions and other terms applicable to . . . uninsured motorists coverages . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>eral Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cRegulations issued by the insurance commissioner to implement the statutes governing uninsured [and underinsured] motorist coverage are presumed valid and have the force and effect of a statute.\u201d <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>217 Conn. 631, 641, 587 A.2d 415 (1991); <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>223 Conn. 22, 30 n.11, 610 A.2d 1292 (1992); <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kulla, </em>supra, 394. The \u201cperson claiming the invalidity of a regulation has the burden of proving that it is inconsistent with or beyond the legislative grant. . . . [Furthermore], the insurance commissioner has a very broad grant of regulatory authority in filling in the interstices of the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage legislation, and in doing so his regulation is entitled to great deference.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra, 649; <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18 n.16; <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 643; <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>We </em>have acknowledged that \u201c[n]ot only is the commissioner obligated to adopt regulations with respect to the minimum provisions to be included in the policy of insurance issued in this state; General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334; <em>we presume that these regulations are \u2018an accurate reflection of the legislative intent articulated in the statute\u2019s more general language.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>General Accident Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>221 Conn. 206, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>211, 603 A.2d 385 (1992); accord <em>AFSCME </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>206 Conn. 465, 470, 538 A.2d 1022 (1988); <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>202 Conn. 583, 599-600, 522 A.2d 771 (1987). This presumption is enhanced when the regulation has been in existence for a long period of time and has been legislatively approved. \u201cThe fact that the commissioner\u2019s regulation has been approved by the standing legislative regulation review committee,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> although not dispositive of the issue before us, is an <em>important consideration </em>in our determination of whether the commissioner\u2019s regulation comports with the legislative intent . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 643. \u201cIf a regulation has been in existence for a substantial period of time and the legislature has not sought to override the regulation, this fact, although not determinative, provides persuasive evidence of the continued validity of the regulation.\u201d Id., 642. As we noted in <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 30, \u201c[s]ince 1979, when underinsured motorist coverage was mandated, [\u00a7 38a-336] has been amended five times, yet, the legislature has never taken action to prohibit an underinsured motorist carrier from reducing payment to its insured in accordance with the regulations.\u201d In light of the strong presumption in favor of the validity of the regulation, we cannot conclude that the commissioner acted outside the scope of his authority in permitting an insurer to offset social security disability benefits solely because such an offset in the case of an adequately insured tortfeasor might not be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Although compensating the victim of an underinsured motorist as if the tortfeasor were adequately insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>is a general public policy objective of the uninsured motorist statute; <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 774-75; <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18; <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 188 Conn. 249; we have concluded that other policy considerations preclude conferring the selfsame rights on both the victim of an adequately insured tortfeasor and the victim of an inadequately insured tortfeasor. See generally <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 774-75 (settlement payment by one who may or may not be responsible for harm to insured); <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 17-18 (unclaimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 538 (workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 475 (settlement by tortfeasor). \u201cAs we have earlier observed, \u2018[t]he plain words of . . . [\u00a7 38a-336] simply require that each policy provide <em>a minimum level of uninsured [and under-insured] motorist coverage </em>\u201cfor the protection of persons insured thereunder.\u201d The statute does not require that uninsured motorist coverage be made available when the insured has been otherwise protected . . . .Nor does the statute provide that the uninsured motorist coverage shall stand as an independent source of recovery for the insured, or that the coverage limits shall not be reduced under appropriate circumstances. The statute merely requires that a certain minimum level of protection be provided for those insured under automobile liability insurance policies; <em>the insurance commissioner has been left with the task of defining those terms and conditions which will suffice to satisfy the requirement of \u201cprotection.\u201d </em>\u2019 . . . <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>[supra, 171 Conn. 472-73].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 538; <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 774-75; <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>supra, 223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Conn. 29-30; see also <em>Bouley v. Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 757, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992) (uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is \u201cless an independent source of recovery than it is a \u2018safety net\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The legislature has acquiesced in this interpretation of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) as providing minimum compensation, limited by alternative sources available to the insured, as determined in the discretion of the insurance commissioner. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 538-39. We noted in <em>Wilson </em>that although \u201cthe legislature is presumed to be aware of the judicial construction placed on its enactments,\u201d it has made no amendment to \u00a7 38a-334, which grants the commissioner discretion to promulgate the applicable regulations, that would indicate its disapproval of our interpretation of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d). Id., 539. Moreover, in the eight years since <em>Wilson, </em>the legislature has yet to evince disapproval of this interpretation, even in light of our recent reiteration in <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 774-75. We find nothing to support the claim that the legislature intended a contrary construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Accordingly, the general objective of equivalent recovery is limited by an insurer\u2019s regulatory authority to reduce the limits of liability as permitted by \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d), as long as the insured retains a minimum level of protection as mandated by statute. See <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 774; <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins.

In the underinsured motorist coverage context, the minimum amount of compensation that the insured is entitled to receive is equivalent to the amount of underinsured motorist protection that the insured carried.

Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 775; <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18. In accomplishing the myriad and difficult policy objectives inherent in the uninsured and underin-sured motorist coverage statute, the legislature expressly left to the sound discretion of the insurance commissioner the authority to develop regulations pertaining to exclusions, including appropriate reductions to the limits of liability. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (a); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 538. We previously have concluded that it expressly has been left to the <em>commissioner </em>to determine whether an alternative source of recovery available to the insured should be an applicable offset; see, e.g., id.; and that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>duly promulgated regulation has the force and effect of statute. See, e.g., <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 641. \u201cSection [38a-336] does not specifically prohibit the adoption of a regulation permitting the reduction of uninsured [and underin-sured] motorist coverage, whereas [\u00a7 38a-334] explicitly authorized the commission[er] to adopt regulations relating to the insuring agreements, exclusions, conditions and other terms applicable to ... uninsured [and underinsured] motorist coverages.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 538. Consequently, we defer to the plain language of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2), the regulation adopted by the commissioner, in determining whether an insurer should be permitted to offset its liability for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage by a potential alternative resource that is available to the insured. See, e.g., <em>Buell </em>v. <em>American Universal Ins. Co., </em>supra, 774-75 (settlement payment by one who may or may not be responsible for harm to insured); <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 17-18 (deference regarding unclaimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 538 (workers\u2019 compensation benefits); <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 475 (settlement by tortfeasor).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Furthermore, we are not persuaded that the insured\u2019s recovery from the insurer must always be identical to that which could be obtained from an adequately insured tortfeasor. We previously have concluded that the insurer \u201cis not the alter ego of the tortfeasor and . . . they do not share the same legal [status].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>243 Conn. 17, 25, 699 A.2d 964 (1997); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 385, 698 A.2d 859 (1997); <em>Mazziotti </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>240 Conn. 799, 817, 695 A.2d 1010 (1997). It is not necessary, therefore, that an uninsured and underinsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>coverage carrier and a tortfeasor invariably be treated the same for all purposes and necessarily be entitled to only the same reductions in liability. The right of an insurer to offset the limits of liability for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is controlled by \u00a7 38a-334-6. See <em>Streitweiser </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>supra, 219 Conn. 377 (\u201c \u2018insurer may not, by contract, reduce its liability for such uninsured or underin-sured motorist coverage <em>except as [\u00a7 38a-334-6] . . . expressly authorizes\u2019 \u201d </em>[emphasis added]); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ferrante, </em>supra, 201 Conn. 482-83.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It would be inappropriate, therefore, to look anywhere other than \u00a7 38a-334-6 to determine what alternative resources available to the insured will be considered an applicable offset. Because of the exclusive application of the regulation to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, it is irrelevant that the receipt of the same resource might not be considered a double recovery against a first-party tortfeasor. Consequently, we decline the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>plaintiffs invitation to look to the collateral source doctrine, applicable to first party suits against a tortfeasor, for guidance in interpreting what alternative sources of payment would constitute a double recovery in the area of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">Moreover, we never have said that an uninsured motorist claimant must have the same level of benefits available as a plaintiff suing a tortfeasor directly. Rather, we have stated that \u201c[t]he purpose of [\u00a7 38a-336] is to compensate an insured <em>to the same extent </em>as he would have been if he had been injured by a motorist carrying liability insurance equal to the [uninsured motorist] coverage carried by the insured . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 647. That is not the same thing as saying that the insured must be in exactly the same position as an injured plaintiff suing a tortfea-sor. It merely requires that the amount of overall benefits available to a plaintiff be equal to the amount of <em>coverage </em>available from a tortfeasor with an equivalent policy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, the plaintiff here must be compensated, from all available sources, in the amount that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>would have been available if the tortfeasor had carried a policy limit of $200,000, which is the amount equal to the plaintiff\u2019s coverage. Allowing an offset for social security disability benefits, the plaintiff will receive $200,000 from all sources, i.e., $20,000 from the tortfea-sor, $5000 in basic reparations, $146,970 in social security disability benefits, and $28,030 from his underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Commencing with our earliest interpretation of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d), we have recognized that in attempting to accomplish the twin policy objectives of uninsured motorist coverage of providing coverage as if the tort-feasor had been adequately insured, and at the same time precluding double recovery, \u201cthe regulations of the insurance commissioner may present some apparently anomalous results under certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 474-75. As a result of the application of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d), injured individuals have often been left in different positions, some better and some worse, depending on various factors relating to the limits of coverage and available resources. Id., 475. This is a necessary, and not unacceptable, reality of this state\u2019s uninsured motorist scheme. \u201cThe purpose of mandatory insurance, minimum liability insurance levels, and uninsured motorists protection requirements can only be to ensure that certain minimum protections are afforded all motorists. <em>These statutory devices cannot serve to eliminate all differences in treatment which may result to an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>insured, due to the varying levels of insurance carried by motorists or because of varying financial resources of motorists.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 475. The ability to obtain social security disability benefits is a financial resource available to the plaintiff that results in a discrepancy in treatment that the statute and the regulation simply do not attempt to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Additionally, we note that we previously have rejected the argument that an insured must recover <em>from his uninsured motorist coverage carrier </em>a total amount equal in all respects to that available from the tortfeasor. In <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 646, we concluded that \u201can insured party injured by a fully insured motorist is able to obtain a contribution from the insurer to his attorney\u2019s fees from the amount of reparations benefits reimbursed to the insurer, while an insured party injured by an uninsured motorist is not.\u201d Although the conclusion reached in <em>Dugas </em>would result in a disparity between the overall recovery from the tortfeasor and that from the uninsured motorist coverage insurer, such disparity was permitted. The legislature may have chosen to allow different treatment between those suing the tort-feasor directly and those suing their carrier for uninsured motorist coverage because identical treatment \u201cwould place greater pressure on insurance rates than [the legislature] was willing to tolerate.\u201d Id., 647. Because uninsured motorist coverage is mandatory for all insureds, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) may be interpreted as furthering the goal of keeping uninsured motorist insurance premiums at a reasonable level. The list of applicable offsets to liability provided by \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) draws a fine line between guaranteeing that the insured is adequately compensated and ensuring that premiums for uninsured and underinsured motorist insurance are reasonably affordable.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In <em>Koskoff, Koskoff &amp; Bieder </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 451, 454, 446 A.2d 818 (1982), we concluded that permitting offsets to the limits of liability comports with the \u201cgeneral purpose of the no fault legislation, which is to minimize the cost of mandatory insurance coverage by minimizing the amount of benefits paid by the insurer.\u201d Likewise, the mandatory nature of uninsured motorist coverage dictates that deference be paid to those public policy choices by the commissioner that serve the goal of keeping premiums down by limiting the liability of the uninsured motorist coverage carrier while at the same time protecting the insured by guaranteeing some minimum level of compensation. Permitting the offset of social security disability benefits against uninsured motorist benefits is one of those policy choices to which deference must be accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u201cThe automobile liability insurance business is one which is extensively regulated . . . and judicial revision of the terms upon which such policies are issued may produce extensive repercussions throughout the insurance industry of the state. In view of the very broad grant of regulatory authority to the insurance commissioner, we are not persuaded that the commissioner was without authority to adopt regulation [\u00a7 38a-334-6 (d)].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 539; <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 171 Conn. 473; accord <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 18 n.16. The insurance commissioner has drawn a careful line regarding applicable offsets and has chosen to include among them \u201cany\u201d disability benefits paid pursuant to governing law. Although the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>may disagree with the location of that line, \u201chis remedy lies with the legislature or the insurance commissioner, not with this court.\u201d <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>supra, 217 Conn. 647; accord <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>supra, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Finally, we are not persuaded by the argument that the plaintiff may have suffered damages that are not compensable by social security disability benefits, such as pain and suffering or medical expenses.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We rejected a similar argument in <em>Wilson </em>with respect to an offset for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We concluded that \u201c[w]e see nothing in the language of regulation [\u00a7 38a-334-6 (d)] that quantifies the kinds of damages that must be paid before a valid reduction in uninsured motorist benefits may occur by reason of any payments made pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law. If damages are paid pursuant to the workers\u2019 compensation law, the uninsured motorist coverage may be reduced accordingly.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 538. The conclusion that social security disability benefits are a substitute for wages is inescapable, and, therefore, such benefits are substantially similar to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Neither workers\u2019 compensation nor social security disability benefits compensate for noneconomic damages and are unlike traditional tort damages in that respect. They both provide compensation, however, during periods of inability to work attributable to disability, whether temporary or permanent. Social security disability benefits are payable only if an individual is disabled, which is defined as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>activity\u201d due to physical or mental impairment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 (a) and (d) (1) (A). Benefits are terminated once the disability lapses and the claimant is able to engage in \u201cgainful activity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 (e). Moreover, social security disability benefits must be reduced by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable to the claimant; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a (a) (2) (A); farther indicating that social security disability benefits are meant to provide wage replacement during periods of disability in the same manner as workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Our conclusion is amply supported by our prior analysis of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) in the context of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In that context, we concluded that offsetting workers\u2019 compensation benefits against uninsured motorist coverage benefits ensures compensation while preventing a double recovery because workers\u2019 compensation benefits provide an alternative protection available to the insured. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 538; <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 19. We discern no material difference between workers\u2019 compensation benefits and social security disability benefits in terms of the public policy objectives of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2). Although there are differences between workers\u2019 compensation benefits and social security disability benefits, we are not persuaded that they should be treated differently in the context of their relation to the purpose underlying \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2), which is to avoid multiple compensation for the same harm. In that context there is no disparity because both workers\u2019 compensation and social security disability benefits represent an alternative source of income to replace wages lost owing to the inability to continue gainful employment activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We conclude that allowing an offset for social security disability benefits does not conflict with the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>intent of the uninsured and underinsured motorist statute. Such an offset serves the policy objective of guaranteeing a minimum level of compensation to all motorists in an amount equal to the limit of their own policy. Moreover, it furthers the policy objectives of preventing multiple compensation for the same harm, as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d), and of limiting the cost of insurance premiums for mandatory uninsured motorist coverage. Consequently, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2), and the insurance policy that echoes its provisions, are valid and permit the insurer to offset the limits of liability by the amount of social security disability benefits paid or payable<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of $28,030.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\"> The stipulation of facts does not expressly state that the disability for which the plaintiff is receiving social security disability benefits was attributable solely to the accident. The parties do not dispute this fact, however, and we, like the trial court, assume it to be true. Clearly, the receipt of social security disability benefits for a disability that is unrelated to the accident for which the plaintiff is claiming uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage could not be allowed as a limitation of that coverage. \u201cImplicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>in the statutory scheme of [General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336] ... is the commonsensical requirement that the underinsured vehicle be causally connected to the loss for which the claimant seeks compensation.\u201d <em>Travelers Ins.

He also argues that because social security disability benefits are different from workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the regulation should not be viewed as including social security disability benefits. We are unpersuaded. There is no indication that the clause was intended to be so limited. The two types of laws are placed in the disjunctive, and, absent any indication that one is subordinate to the other or that one is meant to define the other, each phrase must be given equal weight as an independent limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">The plaintiff cited to twelve state laws providing disability benefits as examples of what the legislature may have meant by the phrase \u201cdisability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>benefits laws\u201d if it did not mean to include social security disability benefits laws. For example, he refers to laws providing disability benefits for probate judges; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-40; municipal workers; General Statutes \u00a7 7-432; bank officers and directors; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-100; schoolteachers; General Statutes \u00a7 10-183aa; state police officers; General Statutes \u00a7 5-142; sheriffs; General Statutes \u00a7 5-142a; chief inspectors; General Statutes \u00a7 51-286; and credit union employees; General Statutes \u00a7 36a-454. Many of the laws cited are no more similar to workers\u2019 compensation laws than is the Social Security Act. Moreover, if the commissioner had intended that the regulation be circumscribed to address only a limited number of laws, then he easily could have said so rather than rely on the creative linguistic and grammatical explanation posited by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b195-7\"> The parties each point to decisions from other jurisdictions for guidance in deciding the public policy considerations relevant to this issue.

Co., </em>843 P.2d 1302, 1305-1306 (Colo. 1993), which concluded that an offset of social security disability benefits would be violative of Colorado public policy. The defendant directs our attention to <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Wise, </em>537 N.W.2d 732, 735 (Iowa 1995), in which the court found such an offset permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Neither the Iowa nor the Colorado statutory scheme coincides with that of Connecticut, the former being of broader scope and the latter more narrow.

The change merely reflects a grammatical necessity stemming from the defendant\u2019s addition of a third clause in an effort to ensure that the limitations <em>of </em>liability in the policy would <em>be as </em>comprehensive as the regulation would permit.

We note, however, that our conclusion that the party seeking uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits is not in the same position as the party claiming directly against the tortfeasor undermines the fundamental premise of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-225a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any civil action, whether in tort or in contract, wherein the claimant seeks to recover damages . . . and wherein liability is admitted or is determined by the trier of fact and damages are awarded to compensate the claimant, the court shall reduce the amount of such award which represents economic damages ... by an amount equal to the total of amounts determined to have been paid under subsection (b) of this section less the total of amounts determined to have been paid under subsection (c) of this section . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-225b provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Collateral sources\u2019 means any payments made to the claimant, or on his behalf, by or pursuant to: (1) Any health or sickness insurance, automobile accident insurance that provides health benefits, and any other similar insurance benefits, except life insurance benefits available to the claimant, whether purchased by him or provided by others .... \u2018Collateral sources\u2019 do not include amounts received by a claimant as a settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> Reductions to the limits of liability, commonly referred to as offsets, are exclusions in an insurance policy.

See <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Co., </em>supra, 213 Conn. 537-38.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>225 Conn. 566, 570-72, 624 A.2d 892 (1993), we concluded that \u00a7 52-225a does not affect the amount of coverage available pursuant to an uninsured and underinsured motorist policy. We concluded that \u00a7 52-225a \u201cdefines the offset for collateral source payments as reducing awards for economic damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death. A claim concerning coverage under an insurance policy does not, in common parlance, give rise to an award for damages of any kind, let alone to an award for damages resulting from personal injury or wrongful death.\u201d Id., 570. Consequently, coverage pursuant to a policy for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is <em>not </em>controlled by the collateral source rule. The singular applicability of the collateral source rule to a claim for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is to permit an insurer to reduce the amount of damages sustained by the claimant by the amount of \u201ccollateral source payments\u201d received by the claimant. Id., 573. That which may or may not qualify as a collateral source under \u00a7 52-225a does not control the determination of which offsets are applicable in the uninsured and underinsured motorist context. As we concluded in <em>Smith, </em>neither \u00a7 38a-336 nor the corresponding regulation, \u00a7 38a-334-6, permit reference to \u00a7 52-225a in determining appropriate limitations and exclusions. Id., 571-72. Rather, \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) exclusively governs \u201cthe grounds upon which such [uninsured and underinsured] insurance may be excluded or limited.\u201d Id., 572.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\"> We further note that accepting the plaintiffs argument would require us to conclude that the portion of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) relating to disability benefits law, which antedates \u00a7 52-225a by a decade, was repealed by implication when the legislature adopted \u00a7 52-225a. Our rules of construction strongly disfavor \u201c \u2018the implied repeal of a regulation by a [subsequent] statute, especially where, as in the present case, the regulation at issue has been approved by the legislative review committee.\u2019 <em>Dugas </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>[supra, 217 Conn. 641].\u201d <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 162; <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Huntley, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 30 n.11. We already have concluded in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 570-72, that \u00a7 52-225a does not apply to claims for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. See footnote 18 of this opinion. We cannot conclude, therefore, that the regulation was impliedly repealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\"> We are not unmindful of the language in <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 27, in which we stated that the purpose of the uninsured and underinsured motorist statute is to put the insured in \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>same position as, but no better position than, the insured would have been had the underinsured tortfeasor been fully insured.\u201d The statement in <em>Haynes </em>was merely a shorthand of our statement in <em>Mass </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., </em>supra, 222 Conn. 647, and cannot be interpreted to mean more than our statement to the same effect in <em>Mass </em>(\u201c[t]he purpose of \u00a7 [38a-336] is to compensate an insured <em>to the same extent </em>as he would have been if he had been injured by a motorist carrying liability insurance equal to the [uninsured motorist] coverage carried by the insured\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> This purpose is evident from the statute itself, which directs the insurance commissioner to consult with representatives of the insurance industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>before adopting regulations relating to uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-334 (b); see also 12 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1967 Sess., p. 1957, remarks of Senator T. Clark Hull (regarding enactment of statute and contribution of leading representatives from state\u2019s insurance industry: \u201cIt is, we believe, a practical [proenterprise] answer to the question of compulsory insurance.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> The; plaintiff did not raise this argument. The Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association, as amicus curiae, sets forth this reasoning as a basis for its proposed interpretation of the statute. Although we would not normally address an issue not raised by the parties; see footnote 11 of this opinion; the defendant did address this issue at oral argument. Moreover, because the issue is already resolved in our prior decisions, we simply restate that conclusion for the salce of clarity in future cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\"> As we noted in <em>Rydingsword </em>with respect to unclaimed workers\u2019 compensation benefits, it may be difficult <em>to </em>determine whether benefits that have not been sought by the insured are actually payable. <em>Rydingsword </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 22 n.21. Adequate evidence must be adduced, and the burden is on the insurer to prove that these social security disability benefits axe, in fact, payable to the insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b215-8\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0A\">dissenting. In the absence of proof that the plaintiffs social security disability benefits are paid solely as a result of injuries attributable to the automobile accident, I do not believe that payments arising from such benefits should reduce the underin-sured motorist coverage. See footnote 1 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">I also disagree that social security disability benefits are within the language of \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (2) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which permits an insurer to reduce underinsured motorist coverage by amounts paid or payable \u201cunder any workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>compensation or disability benefits law.\u201d Social security disability insurance benefits are payable only to those individuals who pay for such coverage over a sufficient period of time, which is measured in units of quarter years. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 (c) (1) (1994); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.130 et seq. Furthermore, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 identifies such benefits as \u201cdisability insurance benefits.\u201d Although mandated by law, such benefits are \u201cinsurance\u201d benefits purchased by an individual, alike to contractual life, disability or medical insurance benefits. Cf. <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Yale New Haven Hospital, </em>243 Conn. 17, 21, 699 A.2d 964 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The majority\u2019s decision to treat social security disability insurance benefits, for which the injured party pays a premium, no differently than workers\u2019 compensation benefits conflicts with the basic intent of the underin-sured motorist statute. See General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336. This conclusion is supported by the insurance commissioner\u2019s regulations, which allow a reduction in underin-sured motorist coverage for medical payments and basic reparation benefits paid or payable to the insured under the insured\u2019s automobile policy. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38a-334-6 (d) (3). There is no regulation otherwise allowing for a reduction in underinsured motorist coverage for other payable insurance benefits for which the injured party paid premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
