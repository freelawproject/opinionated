The state, on the granting of permission from the trial court,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> appealed the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, on the ground that the seizure of the contraband came within the \u201cplain view\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The following facts are not in dispute. Shortly after 3 p.m. on August 12,1995, firefighters from the Windsor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>volunteer fire department responded to a fire at a single-family house at 19 Songonosk Street in Windsor. Fire Captain Angel L. Marrero was one of the volunteer firefighters who responded to the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Pursuant to standard procedure, Marrero and two other firefighters entered the front door of the house to suppress the fire to a point where they could search the house for individuals who might need assistance. Once the fire was sufficiently suppressed, Marrero and another firefighter commenced searching the residence for potential victims. At the same time, they opened windows and doors for ventilation and to allow heat from the fire to escape. When Marrero encountered a locked interior door, he forced his way into the room, which turned out to be the defendant\u2019s bedroom. Finding no one in the room, Marrero proceeded to pull the screens from the room\u2019s windows. While doing so, he observed an open cigar box and a closed cigar box on a dresser adjacent to the window. In the open box, Marrero saw aplastic bag containing what he described as \u201ca green leafy substance,\u201d which he believed might be marijuana. Marrero testified at the suppression hearing that he had no training in identifying drags. Moreover, there was no evidence to indicate that Marrero had any familiarity with the appearance or physical characteristics of marijuana or other drags. After observing the substance in the cigar box, Marrero notified Fire Chief William Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Lewis apprised Sergeant Thomas Lepore of the Windsor police department, who was outside performing traffic control duties, of Marrero\u2019s suspicions. Lepore and Officer Casher Holt then made a warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s house, and Marrero led them to the defendant\u2019s bedroom. After observing a plastic bag filled with a green leafy substance in the open cigar box, Lepore seized the box. Lepore examined the contents of the box and discovered that it contained marijuana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>cocaine in both powder and rock form, a photograph of the defendant and a store shopping card with the defendant\u2019s name on it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">It is a \u201cbasic principle of Fourth Amendment law that searches and seizures inside a [person\u2019s] house without warrant are per se unreasonable in the absence of some one of a number of well defined \u2018exigent circumstances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 477-78, 91 S.

Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). In <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>supra, 443, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court held that in certain circumstances a warrantless seizure by police of an item that comes within plain view during their lawful search of a private area may be reasonable under the fourth amendment.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 237, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990). The plain view exception to the warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>requirement \u201cis based upon the premise that the police need not ignore incriminating evidence in plain view while they are . . . entitled to be in a position to view the items seized.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 193, 435 A.2d 3 (1980); see <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S. Ct. 992, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (1968). Three requirements must be met to invoke the plain view doctrine: First, the items seized must be in the plain view of the police, second \u201cthe initial intrusion that enabled the police to view the items seized must have been lawful; and [third] the police must have had probable cause to believe that these items were contraband or stolen goods.\u201d <em>State v. Ruscoe, </em>supra, 237-38; <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 326-27, 107 S. Ct. 1149, 94 L.

Ct. 93, 96 L. Ed. 59 (1951). \u201cWe cannot . . . excuse the absence of a search warrant without a showing by those who seek exemption . . . that the exigencies of the situation made that course imperative.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U.S. 451, 456, 69 S. Ct. 191, 93 L. Ed. 153 (1948); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 237-38, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984). The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Jeffers </em>that by placing this burden on the state, the fourth amendment \u201cdoes not place an unduly oppressive weight on law enforcement officers but merely interposes an orderly procedure under the aegis of judicial impartiality that is necessary to attain the beneficent purposes intended.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers, </em>supra, 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The trial court concluded that the warrantless seizure of the defendant\u2019s cigar box did not fall within the plain view exception to the warrant requirement because \u201cthe police had no lawful basis for being in [the] defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>bedroom without a warrant . . . .\u201d The state argues that the trial court incorrectly applied the plain view exception to the facts of this case. According to the state, the police officers\u2019 entry of the house was a mere continuation of the firefighter\u2019s initial lawful entry,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and it was permissible for the officers to seize evidence in the plain view of the firefighter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant responds that the officers\u2019 warrantless entry was not lawful because it clearly was detached from the firefighter\u2019s initial emergency entry into the house to extinguish the fire, and, even if the officers\u2019 entry was lawful, the firefighter did not have probable cause to believe that the cigar box contained contraband.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The state concedes that the firefighter was required to have probable cause in order to support its claim that the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>officers\u2019 entry into the house was a continuation of the firefighter\u2019s lawful entry,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but argues that the underlying facts support the legal conclusion that the firefighter had probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\u201c[P]robable cause is a fluid concept \u2014 turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts \u2014 not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Zarick, </em>227 Conn. 207, 222, 630 A.2d 565, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1025, 114 S.

Vincent, 229 Conn. 164, 171-72, 640 A.2d 94 (1994). \u201cThe quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but is substantially less than that required for conviction. Our cases have made clear that [t]here is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause, and [t]hat line necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances. <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Ed. 1879 (1949)]. <em>State </em>v. <em>Penland, </em>174 Conn. 153, 155-56, 384 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S.

Consequently, \u201c[t]here must be facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has trustworthy information, sufficient to justify the belief of a reasonable person that an offense has been or is being committed. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S. Ct. 223, 13 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1964) (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>215 Conn. 667, 672, 577 A.2d 1043 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the appropriate standard under which we review a challenge to a trial court\u2019s granting of a suppression motion. \u201c \u2018This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. That is the standard and scope of this court\u2019s judicial review of decisions of the trial court. Beyond that, we will not go.\u2019 <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Although the trial court focused upon the second requirement of the plain view exception in its memorandum of decision \u2014 whether the officers\u2019 intrusion was lawful \u2014 it is obvious that once the trial court concluded that the state had failed to establish this requirement, it was not necessary to discuss the third requirement of probable cause. The trial court, however, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>addressing the state\u2019s alternative argument that Lep-ore\u2019s warrantless seizure of the cigar box fell within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, did determine the issue of whether Mar-rero had probable cause to believe that the substance was contraband. The trial court found that Lepore did not have probable cause under this exception because \u201cthe information upon which he decided to enter the house\u201d \u2014 Marrero\u2019s suspicion that the box contained marijuana \u2014 was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">After reviewing the record of this case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that Marrero did not have probable cause to believe the substance was marijuana is legally and logically correct, and that it finds support in the facts set out in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision. First, Marrero testified at the suppression hearing that he had no experience in identifying drugs and that when he first saw the bag, he \u201chad a question in [his] mind if it happened to be marijuana.\u201d Because of Marrero\u2019s lack of experience and training in identifying marijuana, he requested that Lepore observe the item. At best, Marrero had a reasonable suspicion that the substance in the plastic bag was marijuana.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Marrero\u2019s reasonable suspicion that the item was contraband, however, \u201cmeans something less than probable cause.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>supra, 480 U.S. 326 (police officer lacked probable cause to conduct search of defendant\u2019s expensive stereo equipment, found in plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>view, because officer had only reasonable suspicion\u2014 i.e., less than probable cause to believe \u2014 that stereo equipment was stolen). <em>In Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 379 U.S. 97, the United States Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]f subjective good faith alone were the test [of probable cause], the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, only [at] the discretion of the police.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) See <em>Byars </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 U.S. 28, 29, 47 S. Ct. 248, 71 L. Ed. 520 (1927) (warrant issued upon information that \u201cstates only that affiant has good reason to believe and does believe the defendant has [contraband] in his possession . . . clearly is bad if tested by the Fourth Amendment and the laws of the United States\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 528, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980) (\u201c[p]urely conclusory affidavits by the affiant . . .that he or she believes that probable cause exists . . . cannot be relied upon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Second, the state failed to prove that Marrero\u2019s belief was \u201creasonably corroborated by other matters\u201d within his knowledge.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>269, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960). \u201c[I]t [is] incumbent upon the prosecution to show with considerably more specificity than was shown in this case\u201d why Marrero thought the substance was marijuana. <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 379 U.S. 97; see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 271 (\u201c[c]orroboration through other sources of information reduced\u201d chance that officer did not have probable cause to search apartment). Marrero testified that he had a question in his mind whether the substance in the cigar box was marijuana. He never testified why he thought it might be marijuana, nor did the state present any evidence to corroborate his belief. In <em>Nathanson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 41, 47, 54 S. Ct. 11, 78 L. Ed. 159 (1933), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cmere affirmance of suspicion or belief without disclosure of supporting facts or circumstances\u201d was insufficient to support the state\u2019s request for a search warrant. See <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 423, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969) (White, J., concurring) (where police \u201cofficer simply avers, without more, that there is gambling paraphernalia on certain premises, the warrant should not issue, even though the belief of the officer is an honest one, as evidenced by his oath, and even though the magistrate knows him to be an experienced, intelligent officer who has been rehable in the past\u201d). Likewise, Marrero\u2019s affirmance of his suspicion and belief that the substance inside the cigar box was marijuana is insufficient to support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We conclude, on the basis of the facts found by the trial court, that Marrero did not have probable cause to believe that the substance he observed in plain view was marijuana or other contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who possesses or has under his control any quantity of any narcotic substance, except as authorized in this chapter, for a first offense, may be imprisoned not more than <em>seven years or </em>be fined not more than fifty thousand dollars, or be both fined and imprisoned;

The house was watched and secured by police officers to ensure no one entered it except police and fire officials. Lepore was afraid someone might take the drugs, given that the fire department would eventually turn the house back to its occupants.

Otherwise, the defendant argues, the police officers were required to obtain a warrant. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>436 U.S. 499, 511, 98 S. Ct. 1942, 56 L.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amz\">with whom BORDEN, J., joins, dissenting. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Angel Marerro, fire captain of the Windsor volunteer fire department, lacked probable cause to believe that the green, plant-like material he observed in plain view in the bedroom of the defendant, Patrick Eady, was marijuana. Moreover, I would conclude that the subsequent observation and seizure of the contraband by a police officer falls within the plain view exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. I also believe that the majority\u2019s conclusion is against the overwhelming weight of authority and, therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The following facts are not in dispute. At approximately 3p.m. on August 12,1995, the Windsor volunteer fire department responded to a reported fire in a single-family residence at 19 Songonosk Street in Windsor. Once the fire was sufficiently suppressed to permit entry into the premises, Marerro and other firemen entered the residence in order to ventilate it and to search for possible victims. During the course of this procedure, Marerro came upon the locked door to the defendant\u2019s bedroom. Marerro forced entry into the room to search for possible victims. Finding none, he proceeded to open the window for ventilation. While opening the window, Marerro observed two cigar boxes on a dresser. One box was open and contained a small, clear plastic bag with a small quantity of a green, leafy substance. It is undisputed that, at the time, Marerro was lawfully in the defendant\u2019s bedroom and properly acting within the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Marerro informed William Lewis, the fire chief in charge at the scene, that he believed that he had found marijuana. Thereafter, Lewis conveyed this information to Sergeant Thomas Lepore of the Windsor police department, who was outside the residence directing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>traffic. Lepore entered the defendant\u2019s bedroom and observed a substance that he recognized as marijuana in the cigar box, as well as cocaine in rock and powder form. The box also contained a shopping card with the defendant\u2019s name on it and a photograph of the defendant. Lepore seized the cigar box and its contents without obtaining a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The items in the cigar box subsequently were confirmed to be cocaine and marijuana. The defendant was charged with illegal possession of narcotics and possession of narcotics with intent to sell in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-279 (a) and 21a-277 (b) and with illegal possession of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (c). The defendant moved to suppress the cocaine and marijuana as the product of an illegal search and seizure. He claimed that the entry by the police officer and the seizure of the cigar box without a warrant violated his fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure because there was no applicable exception to the warrant requirement that existed under the circumstances. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. Thereafter the defendant moved to dismiss the charges pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for lack of sufficient evidence. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The state, on the granting of permission by the trial court, appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The fourth amendment to the United States constitution, made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment, prohibits unreasonable searches <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>and seizures by government agents. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A warrantless search and seizure is per se unreasonable, subject to a few well defined exceptions. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S.

The court concluded, however, that \u201c[a] burning building clearly presents an exigency of sufficient proportions to render a warrantless entry \u2018reasonable.\u2019 Indeed, it would defy reason to suppose that firemen must secure a warrant or consent before entering a burning structure to put out the blaze. . . . [Furthermore, fire] officials need no warrant to remain in the building for a reasonable time to investigate the cause of a blaze after it has been extinguished. And if the warrantless entry to put out the fire and determine its cause is constitutional, the warrantless seizure of evidence while inspecting the premises for these purposes is also constitutional.\u201d (Citations omitted.)

Both <em>Tyler </em>and <em>Clifford </em>involved the seizure of evidence relating to the crime of arson. Numerous state and lower federal courts, including our Appellate Court, have concluded that evidence of crimes other than arson, which evidence is observed in plain view by fire officials while the officials are lawfully present on the premises, also may be seized. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>524 F.

It is undisputed that the first element of the plain view exception, that the initial entry be lawful, was met. Marerro obviously was lawfully performing his duty as a firefighter when he entered the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>bedroom to ventilate the house and to search for possible victims. The open cigar box and its contents were, furthermore, in plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The only questions that remain are whether it was immediately apparent to Marerro that the cigar box contained contraband,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and whether Lepore\u2019s subsequent entry and seizure were a lawful extension of Marerro\u2019s observation. The \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d requirement of the plain view exception is met if, upon discovery of the contraband or evidence, there is \u201cprobable cause to associate the property in plain view with criminal activity without further investigation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Reddick, supra, 207 Conn. 335, citing <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 324-27, 107 S. Ct. 1149, 94 L. Ed. 2d 347 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(1987). I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Marerro lacked probable cause to believe that the cigar box contained contraband. The majority concludes that because there is no evidence that Marerro was an expert in drug identification or that he was personally familiar with marijuana, it is not possible to conclude that he had probable cause to believe that the green, leafy substance was marijuana. I believe that the majority overstates the requirements of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Certainly, Marerro\u2019s testimony alone would be insufficient to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We consistently have held, however, that \u201c[t]he quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but is substantially less than that required for conviction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 513, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992). \u201cWhile probable cause requires more than mere suspicion . . . the line between mere suspicion and probable cause necessarily must be drawn by an act of judgment formed in light of the particular situation and with account taken of all the circumstances. . . . The existence of probable cause does not turn on whether the defendant could have been convicted on the same available evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 237, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). \u201cOur cases have made clear [t]hat there is often a fine line between mere suspicion and probable cause . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 513; <em>In re Keijam T., </em>221 Conn. 109, 115, 602 A.2d 967 (1992). Furthermore, we have concluded that \u201cproof of probable cause requires less than proof by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>In re Keijam T., </em>[supra, 115]; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 295, 641 A.2d 370 (1994).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>233 Conn. 106, 135-36, 659 A.2d 683 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201cProbable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred. . . . The probable cause determination is, simply, an analysis of probabilities. . . . The determination is not a technical one, but is informed by the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent [persons], not legal technicians, act. . . . Probable cause is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules. . . . Reasonable minds may disagree as to whether a particular [set of facts] establishes probable cause.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 541, 628 A.2d 567 (1993). It is axiomatic that \u201c[t]he probable cause test then is an objective one.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 237. The United States Supreme Court has endorsed an objective standard, noting that \u201cevenhanded law enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct, rather than standards that depend on the subjective state of mind of the officer.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 138, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In light of this objective standard, it is inappropriate to focus exclusively, as the majority does, on whether Marerro subjectively knew that the green, leafy substance he had observed was marijuana. We need only look to the evidence presented relating to Marerro\u2019s basis of knowledge and to determine whether a reasonable person would have probable cause to believe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>substance was marijuana on the basis of that knowledge. Consequently, we must determine whether an impartial firefighter of ordinary prudence reasonably would conclude that a small quantity of a green, leafy substance in a plastic bag in a cigar box in a locked bedroom in a single-family residence was probably marijuana. One would have needed no expertise in drug identification to conclude that the green, leafy substance probably was marijuana.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> What other green, leafy substance would one normally keep in a plastic bag in a cigar box in a locked bedroom? To be sure, it is possible that it might have been some innocuous substance such as oregano, and, I suppose, it is possible that an individual might, for some extraordinary reason, keep kitchen spices in the bedroom. We are not concerned here with possibilities, however, but with probabilities. Had the packet been found on the spice rack in the defendant\u2019s kitchen, the probability that it was not marijuana would have been substantially increased. Under the circumstances, however, a reasonable and prudent person reasonably could have concluded that it was likely that the substance observed by Marerro was marijuana. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 197-98 (firefighters capable of recognizing substance as marijuana to meet \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d requirement). Consequently, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Marerro lacked probable cause to believe that the substance he observed was marijuana.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Furthermore, I would conclude that the subsequent entry and seizure of the cigar box by Lepore without a warrant was permissible as simply an extension of Marerro\u2019s lawful entry and observation of the contraband. It is undisputed that in entering the bedroom and seizing the cigar box and its contents, Lepore never exceeded the scope of Marerro\u2019s lawful entry and observation, nor was Lepore\u2019s seizure of the box more than Marerro could have done.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We concluded in <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 267, 528 A.2d 760 (1987), that \u201cwhen a law enforcement officer enters private premises in response to a call for help, and during the course of responding to the emergency observes but does not take into custody evidence in plain view, a subsequent entry shortly thereafter, by detectives whose duty it is to process evidence, constitutes a mere continuation of the original entry.\u201d We based our reasoning in large part on the fact that such a rule enhances sound policy with respect to police investigation techniques. Id., 271. We noted that \u201c[i]t is a reasonable and logical procedure for experienced law enforcement personnel to process evidence at crime scenes. The propose is to promote careful preservation of evidence and to permit a complication-free chain of custody. The promotion of more accurate evidence gathering serves the legitimate interests of all parties. Our conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>in this case serves to further this reasonable practice.\u201d Id. Additionally, we concluded that such a rule comports with the purpose of the plain view doctrine. Id. We noted that \u201c \u2018 [wjhere, once an otherwise lawful search is in progress, the police inadvertently come upon a piece of evidence, it would often be a needless inconvenience, and sometimes dangerous \u2014 to the evidence or to the police themselves \u2014 to require them to ignore it until they have obtained a warrant particularly describing it.\u2019 . . . [T]he defendant cannot be heard to complain that the second entry into the premises by the detectives affected her privacy interests. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Andreas, </em>463 U.S. 765, 772, 103 S. Ct. 3319, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1003 (1983), \u2018[t]he plain view doctrine is grounded on the proposition that once police are lawfully in a position to observe an item first-hand, its owner\u2019s privacy interest in that item is lost; the owner may retain the incidents of title and possession but not privacy.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Our decision in <em>Magnano </em>involved the issue of an initial entry by a patrol officer and a subsequent entry by a detective. As yet, we have not had the opportunity to address the specific situation presented here, where the initial entry is by a firefighter and the subsequent entry is by a police officer. For purposes of plain view doctrine analysis, however, there is no rational distinction between the two scenarios. As in <em>Magnano, </em>the initial lawful entiy by a government agent, who was entitled to seize contraband observed in plain view; <em>State v. Wilson-Bey, </em>supra, 21 Conn. App. 166-67; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 385 Pa. Super. 213; eliminated the defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy and permitted the subsequent entry by a second government agent to do that which the first could have done. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em>466 U.S. 109, 117, 104 S. Ct. 1652, 80 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1984) (\u201c[o]nce frustration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of the original expectation of privacy occurs, the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit governmental use of the now nonprivate information\u201d). The fact that the government agent who made the initial entry was a firefighter rather than a police officer is of no legal significance to a fourth amendment analysis. Subsequent limited entry by Lepore constitutes no greater intrusion upon the defendant\u2019s privacy or possessory interest than did Marerro\u2019s entry and observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">I believe that application of the rule adopted in <em>Mag-nano </em>to situations in which the initial entry is by a firefighter comports with the premise that underlies the plain view doctrine. I believe, moreover, that suppression of such evidence would elevate form over substance and would undermine three decades of state and federal precedent that has sought to infuse some logic and common sense into the exclusionary rule since its pronouncement by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961). Furthermore, it would appear that no useful or beneficial purpose would be served by excluding evidence seized by a police officer who has stepped into the shoes of a firefighter. The entry and seizure by Lepore was limited to what Marerro observed during his initial lawful entry. Lepore\u2019s conduct was not a flagrant abuse of his presence as evidenced by the fact that he did not engage in a general search beyond the scope of Marerro\u2019s observation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Suppressing this evidence will not encourage obtaining warrants, but will serve only to encourage the police to direct fire officials to seize the evidence. A firefighter\u2019s lack of skill in evidence gathering and the resulting broken chain of custody, however, will undermine the legitimate police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>policies that we lauded in <em>Magnano. State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 271. Even if the police do obtain a warrant, it will serve no beneficial purpose because the privacy that the warrant requirement protects already has been frustrated by the firefighter\u2019s plain view observation. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Although we previously have not addressed the specific issue of an initial exigent entry by firefighters who observe contraband followed by a subsequent entry and seizure of the contraband by police, other jurisdictions have addressed this precise factual situation. The overwhelming majority of courts have concluded that the police may step into the shoes of the firefighter to seize evidence without first obtaining a warrant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>474 F.2d 1385 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 829, 94 S. Ct. 55, 38 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1973); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 524 F. Sup. 203-204; <em>Mazen </em>v. <em>State, </em>940 P.2d 923 (Ariz. 1997); <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>902 P.2d 842 (Colo. 1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 914 P.2d 592 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 385 Pa. Super. 197; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>24 Va. App. 478, 483 S.E.2d 487 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 193. Other courts have found no fourth amendment violations in analogous situations where one government agent has observed evidence of contraband and members of a different agency take possession without a warrant. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>556 F.2d 1312 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1063, 98 S. Ct. 1237, 55 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1978) (no warrant required when second group of police officers enter house after another police officer entered to assist officer who entered to render emergency aid and second officers observe evidence in plain view); <em>Steigler </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>496 F.2d 793 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1002, 95 S. Ct. 320, 42 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1974) (no warrant required when police officer seized evidence of arson found by state fire marshal during warrantless investigation after fire was controlled); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gargotto, </em>476 F.2d 1009 (6th Cir. 1973) (warrant not required when Internal Revenue Service obtained evidence of gambling activity that had previously been seized in arson investigation by investigator and police officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">A review of these cases supports the conclusion that the fourth amendment does not require suppression of the marijuana and cocaine seized by Lepore. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>supra, 902 P.3d 844-46, the Colorado Supreme Court was faced with facts virtually identical to those present here. A firefighter, searching for the cause of the fire, entered the defendant\u2019s bedroom. Having determined that the fire started in the mattress, the firefighter removed the mattress and discovered a bucket which contained \u201ca green, leafy substance . . . which he suspected to be marijuana. [The firefighter] then summoned [two police officers] who had been outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>directing traffic, into the residence.\u201d Id., 843-44. The police officers observed the substance and summoned a police detective. The detective identified the substance as marijuana and seized the bucket. Id., 844. The court concluded that there was no violation of the fourth amendment because the firefighter and the police who stepped into his shoes were lawfully on the premises and the evidence was in plain view.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 385 Pa. Super. 199, firefighters observed drug paraphernalia \u201cand a bag containing green matter\u201d during the course of their lawful entry into the defendant\u2019s bedroom. The firefighters summoned the police from outside the apartment, and the police seized the contraband and drug paraphernalia. Id. The court concluded that \u201ca fire [fighter] or fire marshall, who is properly inside premises in the course of his firefighting duties and responsibilities, may seize contraband or evidence of criminal activity other than arson which he inadvertently observes in plain view. Further, when contraband is observed in plain view by a fire marshall who is properly on the premises, he may summon a police officer who may observe and seize the contraband without a warrant.\u201d Id., 213. The court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is only where a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures has been violated that suppression is required. There is no such violation where evidence of crime is inadvertently observed in plain view by a representative of the government who is lawfully in a position from which to make such observation.\u201d Id., 214 \u2014 15. Similarly, under Connecticut law, Marerro could have seized the contraband and delivered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>it to Lepore. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson-Bey, </em>supra, 21 Conn. App. 166-67. There is no reason to deny him the ability to summon a police officer to seize that which he could have seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 193, the Washington Supreme Court concluded that the plain view exception excused the absence of a warrant when firefighters observed what appeared to be marijuana plants in the defendant\u2019s attic and summoned the sheriffs department to seize the plants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court was unpersuaded by the argument that \u201cthe sheriffs officers needed a warrant to enter the residence and to seize the property found by the fire [fighters] because they constituted a separate state agency.\u201d Id., 200. The court concluded that \u201c[o]nce the privacy of the residence has been lawfully invaded, it is senseless to require a warrant for others to enter and complete what those others already on the scene would be justified in doing.\u201d Id., 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">As noted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 474 F.2d 1390,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[t]he purpose of a search warrant is to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>judicial authorization, in advance, of intrusions into constitutionally protected privacy. Where a lawful intrusion has already occurred and a seizure by a State officer has validly taken place as a result of that intrusion, the invasion of privacy is not increased by an additional officer, albeit a federal officer, who is expert in identifying the type of contraband discovered, to enter the premises to confirm the belief of the State officer and to take custody of the evidence. Once the privacy of a dwelling has been lawfully invaded, to require a second officer from another law enforcement agency arriving on the scene of a valid seizure to secure a warrant before he enters the premises to confirm that the seized evidence is contraband and to take custody of it is just as senseless as requiring an officer to interrupt a lawful search to stop and procure a warrant for evidence he has already inadvertently found and seized. . . . <em>The apparent conflict between the Constitution and common sense which the plain view doctrine has reconciled is the same misconception which we here seek to dispel.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">My research revealed only one court that has concluded that a defendant retains a reasonable expectation of privacy after fire officials have lawfully entered the premises and discovered evidence in plain view. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>607 F.2d 280 (9th Cir. 1979), required a warrant prior to entry and seizure by the police of the shotgun found by firefighters while suppressing a fire in the defendant\u2019s residence. <em>Hoffman </em>is decidedly a minority approach and its rationale is not persuasive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Consequently, I believe that the vast majority of jurisdictions that have addressed this issue would agree that Lepore\u2019s seizure of the cigar box did not violate the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Marerro, an agent of the state, was lawfully present in the defendant\u2019s bedroom when he observed the substance that a reasonable and prudent person would have believed more probably than not was marijuana. He could have seized the contraband without first obtaining a warrant. Instead, he called a police officer to confirm his belief rather than unnecessarily intruding upon the defendant\u2019s possessory interest. The defendant cannot reasonably argue that he retained an expectation of privacy after Marerro observed the marijuana. Acceptance of such an argument would not further the purposes of the fourth amendment, and would have no rational relationship to the fundamental purposes that underlie the relationship between the exclusionary rule and the plain view doctrine, which relationship attempts to eliminate the absurd results that would follow from the arbitrary exclusion of all evidence obtained without a warrant. I would conclude that the trial court improperly granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the marijuana and cocaine seized by Lepore. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 provides: \u201cAH courts having jurisdiction of criminal cases shall at all times have jurisdiction and control over informations and criminal cases pending therein and may, at any time, upon motion by the defendant, dismiss any information and order such defendant discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>if, in the opinion of the court, there is not sufficient evidence or cause to justify the bringing or continuing of such information or the placing of the person accused therein on trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> The fourth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Although the defendant refers to a violation of his rights under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, he has failed to provide an independent analysis of the state constitutional issues. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992) (setting forth appropriate factors to be addressed when raising state constitutional claim). \u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue. . . .

We have concluded that \u201c \u2018inadvertence is not required if the items seized fall under the category of contraband, stolen property or objects dangerous in themselves.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 547, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S.

Because marijuana, the possession of which is illegal pursuant to \u00a7 21a-279 (c), is contraband, we need not address the issue of inadvertence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Sailor, </em>33 Conn. App. 409, 414, 635 A.2d 1237 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\"> In <em>Wilson-Bey, </em>the Appellate Court concluded that there was no fourth amendment violation where arson investigators who were lawfully on the premises observed and seized evidence of drug activity without a warrant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson-Bey, </em>supra, 21 Conn. App. 165. The evidence seized included drug manufacturing equipment, crack cocaine vials, a propane torch and a packet of white powder found in the refrigerator. Id. The court concluded that the seizure of these items by fire investigators did not violate the fourth amendment because requirements of the plain view exception were met. Id., 166-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">It is difficult to reconcile the conclusion in <em>Wilson,-Bey </em>with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Marerro lacked probable cause to believe that he had observed contraband. The probability that the evidence observed by firefighters in <em>Wilson-Bey </em>was contraband was far less apparent than under the facts of the present case. There was no indication in that case that fire officials had any greater drug identification experience than did Marerro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-7\"> It bears noting that in determining whether the <em>seizure </em>of the contraband was supported by probable cause, we may also consider the knowledge of the police officer who actually seized the evidence. The seizure in this case was made by a police officer, and I do not believe that the majority would dispute that it is reasonably probable that a police officer is capable of identifying marijuana. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>181 Conn. 562, 587-88, 436 A.2d 33 (1980) (police officer\u2019s testimony sufficient to establish proof beyond reasonable doubt that substance is illegal drug, without chemical analysis). I would conclude, as do a msyority of other courts, that because the police officer may step into the shoes of the firefighter in the \u201csearch,\u201d i.e., being present in the emergency situation, it is permissible to include the knowledge of the firefighter and the police officer in determining if there is probable cause to believe that the substance observed by both was contraband, thus making the seizure lawful. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>474 F.2d 1385, 1390 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 829, 94 S. Ct. 55, 38 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1973); <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>902 P.2d 842, 846 (Colo. 1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Loh, </em>275 Mont. 460, 474, 914 P.2d 592 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Person, </em>supra, 385 Pa. Super. 197. There need not be proof of an independent determination of probable cause by the fire official prior to the police officer\u2019s entry. The relevance of Marerro\u2019s determination of probable cause goes only to a determination of whether it was immediately apparent to him that he was observing contraband. I do not consider this significant because it is not necessary to rely on the finding of probable cause by Marerro to make Lepore\u2019s entry lawful. Nor is it a necessary predicate to the seizure because Lepore\u2019s determination of probable cause was sufficient to make that lawful. Because the majority relies exclusively on Marerro\u2019s finding of probable cause, however, I do the same without conceding that its approach is proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> Indeed, I think it is incorrect to conclude that the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights revolve around whether the firefighter who ventilated the defendant\u2019s bedroom had sufficient knowledge of marijuana to recognize it, when, as a practical matter, an average citizen who has been reasonably alert the last several years almost certainly would conclude, even without having any specific training or detailed knowledge of marijuana plants, that the substance in the cigar box was probably marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-6\"> The majority\u2019s characterization notwithstanding, I believe that most people who observed a green, leafy substance under the same conditions as those facing Marerro would believe that it was marijuana. I think, therefore, that the majority should have concluded that a reasonable person in Marerro\u2019s shoes would have probable cause, not merely reasonable suspicion, to believe that what he observed was marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> The majority asserts that Marerro lacked probable cause because, after the fact, he testified that \u201cI had a question in my mind if it happened to be marijuana.\u201d I do not consider this sufficient to conclude that Marerro, subjectively, had only a suspicion rather than a belief that he had observed marijuana. When asked directly what he thought he had seen, he responded unequivocally, \u201c[mjarijuana.\u201d Although precision in language is a laudable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>goal, it is not achievable and individuals may use a variety of phraseology to indicate their thoughts and beliefs. For example, one might say \u201cI thought,\u201d \u201cI believed,\u201d \u201cit seemed to me,\u201d \u201cit was likely\u201d or even \u201cI had a question in my mind. \u201d Such colorful idioms are a part of our linguistic culture. It certainly would be convenient if Marerro had used talismanic words such as, \u201cI, as a reasonable and prudent person exercising the caution I would exercise in my own daily affairs, reasonably believed that the substance before me probably was marijuana.\u201d Laymen, fortunately, do not generally adopt such legalese in their daily speech patterns. The \u201cquestion\u201d in Marerro\u2019s mind constituted a sufficiently strong belief to compel him to disclose that belief to the police and seek their assistance in seizing the contraband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> Particularly of note, Lepore never opened the second, closed cigar box that was sitting next to the open cigar box because Marerro could not have done so within the scope of his plain view observation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> If Lepore had exceeded the scope of his lawful presence by, for example, opening the second cigar box, that certainly would have been an unlawful search. The fact that he restrained himself from doing so demonstrates the lack of a flagrant abuse of his power. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>474 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>1385, 1390 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 829, 94 S. Ct. 55, 38 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-8\"> The defendant asserts that if we fail to suppress the evidence seized by Lepore, we would be creating a new exception to the warrant requirement. He argues that \u201csubsequent warrantless entries are only permitted when they are purposefully related to the emergency that authorized the initial warrantless entry.\u201d This clearly overstates the limitations of the plain view exception. The patrol officers who entered the defendant\u2019s home in <em>Magnano </em>did so to search for a burglar who was reported to be in the house. <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 262. We acknowledged that it was \u201cundisputed that by the time the defendant had left the premises, the emergency had terminated\u201d and that the detectives arrived after the defendant had been removed from the scene. Id. The detectives entered not to aid in the search for a burglar or to render aid to the victim, but for the express purpose of gathering evidence. Consequently, there is absolutely no merit in the defendant\u2019s contention that the subsequent entry may be limited only to the emergency purpose that permitted the initial entry. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>supra, 436 U.S. 508 (permitting firefighters to remain on premises for reasonable time to complete duties after fire is suppressed and upholding seizures made during that time); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 198 (dismissing contention that exigency must last throughout duration of search and seizure). As did the patrol officers in <em>Magnano, </em>Marerro entered for an emergency purpose, to search for victims and ventilate the room. Lepore\u2019s subsequent entry, while firefighters were still lawfully on the premises, was solely to gather the evidence found in plain view by Marerro during his lawful presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> Notably, the court concluded that the requirement that the evidentiary nature of the substance seized must be immediately apparent was satisfied by the <em>detective\u2019s </em>determination of probable cause. <em>People </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>supra, 902 P.3d 846; see footnote 5 of this dissent. The court made no analysis of the independent probable cause of the firefighter who initially observed the marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> Strikingly similar to the testimony of Marerro; see footnote 8 of this dissent; the firefighters in <em>Bell </em>stated that \u201c T suspected that [the plants] were \u2014 chances are they were marijuana\u2019 \u201d and it \u201c \u2018appeared to be a marijuana-growing operation to me.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra, 108 Wash. 2d 198. There was no evidence that these firefighters were experts in drug identification, nor was there any greater basis for their conclusion than for Marerro\u2019s belief that he had seen marijuana. The court expressly concluded that it was immediately apparent to these firefighters that they were observing contraband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\"> In <em>Green, </em>the court concluded that no warrant was necessary when a fire marshall observed counterfeiting templates during his lawful presence in the residence, and subsequently contacted a Secret Service agent to make a positive identification and seize the plates. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra, 474 F.2d 1390. Rather, the court noted that \u201c[t]he facts of the case sub judice present a classic situation for application of the well established plain view doctrine.\u201d Id., 1389. The court reasoned that the fire marshal \u201csurely could have removed the plates and carried them to the Secret Service\u2019s headquarters, or have handed them to [the agent] outside of the apartment. Thus, [the Secret Service agent] cannot be constitutionally tripped up at the threshold that he stepped across to make his confirmation and to take custody of the plates from [the fire marshall].\u201d Id., 1390.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> In <em>Hoffman, </em>the court concluded that the officer had no exigent purpose for entering the premises and thus could not claim the plain view exception. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>supra, 607 F.2d 283. It did not address, however, whether the police officer could step into the shoes of the firefighters as do other courts that have addressed this issue. The court also concluded that the police officer\u2019s entry exceeded the scope of the firefighters\u2019 initial entry, not because his physical intrusion was greater, but because his pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>pose was not to give aid in suppressing the fire or to perform other firefighting duties. Id., 284. This is clearly not a proper assessment of the plain view exception. As previously noted, the justification of the plain view exception is that seizure of an item observed after a lawful intrusion by the state into the defendant\u2019s private domain does not violate the fourth amendment because the expectation of privacy already has been frustrated by the initial lawful entry and observation. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Andrea, </em>supra, 463 U.S. 772; <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 271. Furthermore, I believe that <em>Hoffman </em>might be decided differently if it were to arise today, in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 496 U.S. 138, that \u201c[t]he fact that an officer is interested in an item of evidence and fully expects to find it in the course of a search should not invalidate its seizure if the search is confined in area and duration by the terms of a warrant or a valid exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d It is no longer compelling, if it ever was, to argue that the purpose of the police officer\u2019s entry controls rather than the scope of the entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
