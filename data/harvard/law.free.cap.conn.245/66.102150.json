Ernest Green (employee) was a full-time employee of the named respondent, the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation (Electric Boat), from 1949 until he retired in June, 1978. During the course of his employment and arising out of it, the employee was exposed to asbestos and contracted malignant mesothelioma, a form of cancer. The employee, however, had no symptoms, was capable of working and did so until he retired from Electric Boat at the age of fifty-four. He was thereafter employed from 1981 to 1985 at the Norwich Convalescent Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In July, 1989, the employee was first diagnosed with cancer, from which he died the following December. His wife, Celestina Green (claimant), filed a claim for dependent\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation death benefits from Electric Boat.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Electric Boat contested the claim and a hearing was held by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the second district (commissioner). At that hearing, the claimant presented evidence of the employee\u2019s average weekly wages at Electric Boat for the twenty-six weeks preceding his retirement. In 1993, the commissioner awarded the claimant dependent\u2019s death benefits at a weekly rate based on the employee\u2019s last wages at Electric Boat, subject to the statutory maximum compensation rate in force at the time of his incapacity. Electric Boat appealed from the award to the compensation review board (review board).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The review board affirmed the award. It found that the commissioner properly had awarded dependent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>death benefits to the claimant and properly had determined the weekly compensation rate to be paid to the claimant. The review board based its decision on its interpretation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a retroactive application of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-310c.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Electric Boat appealed from that decision to the Appellate Court, which, in a closely divided opinion, reversed the review board\u2019s decision and denied the claim for weekly benefits. <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 112, 120, 687 A.2d 550 (1996). The Appellate Court held that the claimant is not entitled to weekly benefits because the employee had no wages during the twenty-six weeks preceding the manifestation of the disease; id., 119; the \u201ctime of injury\u201d in occupational diseases. General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (b) (2). We granted the claimant\u2019s petition for certification <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Electric Boat concedes that the employee\u2019s injuries, from mesothelioma due to asbestos exposure, arose out of and in the course of his employment with Electric Boat. It is undisputed that mesothelioma was the cause of his death. Electric Boat also does not contest the award of funeral expenses to the claimant. Rather, it claims that, under \u00a7 31-306, the weekly benefits to a dependent spouse are nothing because the employee had no weekly wages, at \u201cthe time of injury,\u201d upon which to base a calculation of benefits. Our workers\u2019 compensation law refutes that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We begin by examining the purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act). In interpreting the act, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>must \u201cascertain the intent of the legislature and . . . construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>236 Conn. 722, 737, 675 A.2d 430 (1996). We have found previously that the act \u201cis to be broadly construed to effectuate the purpose of providing compensation for an injury arising out of and in the course of the employment .... The purposes of the act itself are best served by allowing the remedial legislation a reasonable sphere of operation considering those purposes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 97, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). Furthermore, as a general rule of statutory construction, we must construe the act in its entirety, to \u201cproduce a harmonious whole,\u201d rather than looking at each part separately and in isolation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 91, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The act provides the sole remedy for employees and their dependents for work-related injuries and death. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have observed that \u201cboth the employer and the employee have relinquished certain rights to obtain other advantages. The employee no longer has to prove negligence on the part of the employer, but, in return, he has to accept a limited, although certain, recovery. . . . The employer, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>guarantees compensation to an injured employee in return for the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation liability to its employees.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 752, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992). Workers\u2019 compensation guarantees weekly benefits for a permanent loss of earning capacity, based on the employee\u2019s average weekly wage, to an employee and the employee\u2019s dependents for injuries suffered in the course of employment. <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 575, 628 A.2d 595 (1993); <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>217 Conn. 50, 56, 584 A.2d 454 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As Arthur Larson points out: \u201cThe normal unit by which benefits are measured consists of a fixed statutory percentage ... of average weekly wage. . . . [T]he entire objective is to arrive at as fair an estimate as possible of [a] claimant\u2019s future earning capacity . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 5 A. Larson &amp; E. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (1997) \u00a7 60.00, p. 10-604. In the case of permanent disability, it is the loss of earning capacity rather than the actual wage loss that is considered. <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Supermarkets General Corp., </em>340 A.2d 833, 836 (Del. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In this case, the employee\u2019s capacity to earn income was permanently destroyed by his long latent occupational disease. His disease, mesothelioma, contracted at Electric Boat, has an extensively long latency period, between twenty-five and forty years. See <em>Nevada Industrial Ins. System </em>v. <em>Jesch, </em>101 Nev. 690, 692, 709 P.2d 172 (1985). Such long latency occupational diseases do present unique workers\u2019 compensation problems, as we have here. <em>State ex rel. Liposchak </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>73 Ohio St. 3d 194, 196, 652 N.E.2d 753, reconsideration denied, 655 N.E.2d 188 (1995). As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court observed: \u201cOccupational diseases are, from a legal standpoint, peculiar in this\u2014 that they arise, not from an accident or event happening at a precise moment, but from a day by day exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to unheaithful conditions over an extended period; the exact time of their origin is necessarily obscure and their insidious progress is not revealed until, frequently after a long interval, the disability which they create manifests itself.\u201d <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>E. J. Lavino &amp; Co., </em>344 Pa. 163, 165-66, 25 A.2d 163 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">When the original act was passed in 1913, it awarded benefits only to those injured in industrial accidents and not to those incapacitated as a result of an occupational disease. Public Acts 1913, c. 138; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>American Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>90 Conn. 349, 97 A. 345 (1916). In 1927, the General Assembly amended the act\u2019s definition of injury to include occupational diseases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Public Acts 1927, c. 307, \u00a7 7. In the case of an occupational disease, the General Assembly provided that the date of injury was to be determined by the date of incapacity to work. That definition appeared in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (b) (2) concerning death benefits; see footnote 2; which was in effect at the time of the claimant\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In <em>Rousu </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>114 Conn. 24, 31, 157 A. 264 (1931), and later in <em>Michna </em>v. <em>Collins Co., </em>116 Conn. 193, 199-200, 164 A. 502 (1933), cases concerning long latent occupational diseases, this court held that in the case of an employee working at the time of his incapacitation, the wages at the time of the incapacitation and not those at the time of the employment during which the disease was contracted should be used to calculate the loss of earning power.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>F. S. Electric, </em>231 Conn. 529, 540, 651 A.2d 254 (1994), this court also held that if an employee is working at the time of incapacitation from an occupational disease, wages at that time should be used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>compute the average weekly wages for the calculation of weekly benefits. Although an injury and resulting incapacity are substantially coincident in most instances, in <em>Mulligan </em>there was considerable time intervening between the actual injury and the incapacity. Id., 533. The court in <em>Mulligan </em>held that the loss should be measured by the earnings at the time the loss occurs, rather than the earnings at the time of the actual injury. Id., 541. We there reasoned that the wages at the time of the injury may be so remote that changing conditions render them incapable of reflecting the present value of the lost earning power. Id. That reasoning does not require the denial of weekly benefits here. Rather, workers\u2019 compensation law has followed this rationale and did provide a method to calculate lost earning power for a former employee with a long latent occupational disease who is retired and unemployed when the disease manifests itself and incapacitates the former employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In April, 1990, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8), thereafter codified as General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-310c. This legislation, effective October 1,1990, addressed circumstances identical to those in this case. Section 31-310c provided: \u201c[I]n the case of an occupational disease which manifests itself at a time when the worker has not worked during the twenty-six weeks immediately preceding the diagnosis of such disease, the claimant\u2019s average weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the greater of (1) <em>the average weekly wage determined pursuant to section 31-310 </em>... or (2) the average weekly wage earned by the claimant during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>twenty-six calendar weeks last worked by the claimant . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Subdivision (1) of \u00a7 31-310c would be meaningless if General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310 did not provide a manner for calculating benefits in the case of an employee who was not working when the disease manifested itself. We hold that \u00a7 31-310 did provide a method for calculating the average weekly wage of an individual who was unemployed at that time. Section 31-310 provided in relevant part: \u201cWhen the employment previous to injury ... is computed to be less than a net period of two calendar weeks, [an employee\u2019s] weekly wage shall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality at the time of injury . . . .\u201d When an employee is retired and unemployed at that time, the \u201cemployment previous to injury\u201d is necessarily less than two weeks and the contemporaneous prevailing weekly wage is considered the employee\u2019s weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">If Electric Boat was correct in arguing that under \u00a731-310 a worker who is diagnosed with an occupational disease while unemployed does not have an average weekly wage, then the enactment of \u00a7 31-310c (1) would have no effect. The average weekly wage under \u00a7 31-310 for unemployed workers would always be zero. We cannot assume that the legislature enacted a meaningless statute. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 303, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997) (\u201c[w]e presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions\u201d). The legislature clearly intended that the first alternative set forth in \u00a7 31-310c (1), weekly wages under \u00a7 31-310, be a method that produces some result.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The legislative history confirms this interpretation. Representative Joseph Adamo introduced the bill for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>P.A. 90-116 and explained: \u201c[T]he new section related to the computation of the compensation rate for a person regarding an occupational disease who has not worked, we insert new language to provide that it can be done in one of two ways. One, that we go back to the person\u2019s last date of work and compute his average weekly wage under [\u00a7 31-310] and enhance it with the cost of living increase . . . and/or <em>we compare him to a worker doing comparable work at the present time </em>and provide the benefit would be that which is greater.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 33 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1990 Sess., pp. 2282-83. The first method that Representative Adamo referred to, \u201cthat we go back to the person\u2019s last date of work,\u201d was codified in 1991 as \u00a7 31-310c (2) as follows in part: \u201cthe average weekly wage earned by the claimant during the twenty-six calendar weeks last worked by the claimant .. . .\u201d See Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (2). The other method, where \u201cwe compare [an employee] to a worker doing comparable work at the present time,\u201d was codified in 1991 as \u00a7 31-310c (1), which provided in part: \u201cthe average weekly wage determined pursuant to section 31-310 . . . .\u201d See Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (1). It is clear that \u00a7 31-310, in the eyes of the legislature, did provide, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 31-310c, a method for calculating benefits for unemployed workers with occupational diseases based on the prevailing weekly wage for similar work at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">At the time of the enactment of \u00a7 31-310c there was controversy as to the method of calculating the average weekly wages in these circumstances. In <em>Orcutt v. Ohmweave Co., </em>8 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 125 (1990), the review board was called upon to review a commissioner\u2019s 1989 award of disability benefits reissued by that commissioner in February, 1990. The commissioner had used the prevailing weekly wage at the time of the manifestation of the disease in awarding weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>benefits to a retired employee who at the time was not employed within twenty-six weeks of the diagnosis of her asbestosis, a long latent occupational disease. Id., 127. The commissioner relied on the \u00a7 31-310 proviso that where an employee had less than two weeks of employment during that period, prevailing weekly wages for similar employment were to be considered as the average weekly wage in the calculation of benefits. Id., 128; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Phaefflin, </em>136 Conn. 107, 110, 68 A.2d 687 (1949). After the commissioner\u2019s decision and while the employer\u2019s appeal was pending before the review board, the legislature enacted P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The review board in <em>Orcutt </em>issued its decision after P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8, was enacted, but prior to its effective date. The review board ruled that because P.A. 90-116 was not yet in effect, the commissioner could not use prevailing weekly wages at the time the disease manifested itself, as P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (1) would allow. The review board thereupon modified the award of benefits to base it on the last wages earned by the employee before her retirement from the employer, as P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (2) would provide. Although the review board commended the commissioner \u201cfor his powers of prophecy\u201d with respect to P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (1); <em>Orcutt </em>v. <em>Ohmweave Co., </em>supra, 8 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 128; it failed to recognize that his prophecy was self-fulfilling in the subsequent legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The review board\u2019s decision in <em>Orcutt, </em>although contrary to the commissioner\u2019s method of calculation, confirmed that the existing law, under the review board\u2019s interpretation, allowed for the use of the last weekly wages earned by the employee. In this the review board opinion supports the inference that P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8 (2) codified the existing law. See <em>Deremer </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>11 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 317 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>In enacting P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8, the legislature codified both methods of calculation and provided that the average weekly wage should be whichever is determined to be the greater. \u201c[I]f the amendment was enacted soon after controversies arose as to the interpretation of the original act, it is logical to regard the amendment as a legislative interpretation of the original act . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 558, 522 A.2d 753 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The legislative history shows overall the legislation was intended to clarify the existing law. Representative Adamo stated that the bill \u201cwill probably most likely retain the status quo.\u201d 33 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2305. Accordingly, we conclude that in order to give effect to \u00a7 31-310c, it must be construed as clarifying \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Because \u00a7 31-310c clarifies \u00a7 31-310, it is to be applied retroactively. It is \u201c[t]he general rule . . . that when a legislative act is intended to clarify existing law it necessarily has retroactive effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>235 Conn. 850, 859 n.5, 670 A.2d 1271 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mag-nano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 284, 528 A.2d 760 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Although the decision in <em>Orcutt </em>did not precede passage of P.A. 90-116, \u00a7 8, \u00a7 31-310 had provided for a calculation based on prevailing wages long before the enactment of the public act. \u201c[AJbsent a contrary legislative directive, it is presumed that if any part of an act applies retroactively, all of it is retroactive. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 864. Therefore, we conclude that the provisions of \u00a7 31-310c applying the greater sum of calculations based on the prevailing wage when the occupational disease is diagnosed or the wage resulting from use of the last twenty-six weeks of employment would apply in the case of an occupational disease diagnosed in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The claimant sought weekly death benefits based on the average weekly earnings of the employee under \u00a7 31-306 (b) (2). Since \u00a7 31-310 provided the method of calculation of average weekly wages \u201c [\u00b6] or the purposes of\u2019 the act, the provisions of \u00a7 31-310c apply to the claimant\u2019s application for dependent\u2019s death benefits. We conclude that the employee\u2019s complete retirement under the circumstances, at the time of his incapacity, does not bar weekly death benefits for a permanent loss of earning capacity. This is in keeping with the purpose of our act.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the review board with direction that it be remanded to the commissioner to calculate the claimant\u2019s weekly benefits in accordance with \u00a7 31-310c.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

I agree with the majority that the plaintiff dependent widow in this case is entitled to benefits. I disagree, however, that those benefits are to be measured by General Statutes \u00a7 31-310c. I would conclude that: (1) \u00a7 31-310c is not retroactive; (2) the Appellate Court was incorrect in deciding that because the calculation of the decedent\u2019s average weekly wage amounted to zero under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310, there were no dependent death benefits payable under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (b) (2); and (3) the applicable statute for the calculation of dependent death benefits is General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310, namely, \u201cthe average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality <em>at the time of injury </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This means that because the decedent became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>incapacitated in July, 1989, which is the date of injury for an occupational disease, his dependents are entitled to benefits calculated on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">I do not believe that \u00a7 31-310c was intended by the legislature to be retroactive. First, that section sets up a <em>two part </em>calculation, and provides that the <em>greater </em>of the two calculations will be the applicable calculation. Nowhere in prior practice or law has this kind of two part calculation been recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Second, our statutes provide a presumption that legislation is prospective; General Statutes \u00a7 55-3;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we have generally required a strong showing of legislative intent to overcome that presumption. <em>See Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 786, 657 A.2d 616 (1995) (\u201c \u2018[W]e have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. . . . The Legislature only rebuts this presumption when it clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u2019 \u201d). As I explain in more detail later in this opinion, there is no such showing here. I do not think that legislation addressing a particular question can be deemed retroactive simply because a problem of interpretation has arisen. If that were all it took, the exception would swallow the statutory rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Third, the available legislative history is insufficient to draw the inference of retroactivity. The principal support offered by the majority for such an inference is the statement of Representative Joseph A. Adamo to the effect that the legislation would maintain the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d 33 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1990 Sess., p. 2305. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>statement, however, was in response to a question asking what the fiscal effect of the legislation would be\u2014 whether the amount of the benefits under the legislation would be more or less than under prior law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statement by Representative Adamo was not in response to a question asking whether the legislation was intended to clarify the meaning of the preexisting legislation. Indeed, during the same exchange, Representative Francis X. O\u2019Neill described the bill as establishing \u201ca new method for calculating the average weekly wage of a claimant\u201d with an occupational disease. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The only evidence in the legislative history suggesting possible retroactivity is a statement at the public hearing by a union official, George Strutt, on a separate, albeit similar, bill. Strutt commented that that other bill \u201cmerely clarifies the present law on average weekly wages . . . [and] is merely designed to clarify the present practice used in Connecticut, and to provide the protection for workers whose condition develops after retirement.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, Pt. 1, 1990 Sess., p. 318. If that kind of language had been repeated in the legislative debate, there would be a stronger case for retroac-tivity. One isolated statement by a nonlegislator at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>public hearing on a different, albeit similar, bill is not enough, however, to establish a strong showing of legislative intent of retroactivity, particularly where, as here, the bill as passed has the new, two part calculation discussed previously.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Having concluded that \u00a7 31-310c is not retroactive, and therefore cannot govern this case, I turn to the next question: what statute, if any, does control? The Appellate Court reasoned that because the decedent became incapacitated by the disease long after he had ceased working for the employer, the benefits calculation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (2) (\u201cthe average weekly earnings of the deceased [employee] at the time of [his] injury\u201d) yielded nothing because he was not working at that time. <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 112, 119, 687 A.2d 550 (1996). From this, the court reasoned that, therefore, no benefits were payable to the dependent widow. Id. This reasoning seems to allow the tail to wag the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">If an employee died from an occupational disease while still employed, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-306 (2) his dependents would get benefits calculated under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310. Under that calculation formula, if he had worked for the employer for two weeks or more, his average weekly wages or earnings are calculated by taking his total wages for the twenty-six weeks prior to the injury or incapacity and dividing that total by the number of weeks he actually works. If he had worked, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>for less than two weeks, his average weekly wage \u201cshall be considered to be equivalent to the average weekly wage prevailing in the same or similar employment in the same locality at the time of injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">This formula, however, does not specifically cover the case in which, as in this case, the employee died from the occupational disease long after he had stopped working for the employer in whose employment he had contracted the disease. This circumstance leaves the court with two alternatives: (1) we could conclude, as the Appellate Court did, that no benefits are payable; or (2) we could attempt to determine from the available statutory language what benefits <em>are </em>payable. I conclude that the second alternative is more consistent with the entire workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">First, as the majority points out, workers\u2019 compensation legislation is remedial. Second, it cannot be said that the legislature, by neglecting to articulate a specific calculation formula for this kind of situation, intended the dependents to have no coverage. It is likely that many occupational diseases do not manifest themselves until years later. I do not think that the legislature meant to cover only those that have a short enough latency period that the diseased workers become incapacitated while still working. That would be a bizarre result, and would result in a windfall to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The judicial task, therefore, is to determine what statute reasonably might be said to apply. The only one available, it seems to me, is that part of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310 that applies when the employee worked less than two weeks. In the absence of this problem, I think that that language was not intended to cover this kind of case. Rather, it seems to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>directed at the situation where the employee did work for the employer immediately preceding the date of incapacity but for less than two weeks. The language is at least susceptible of a meaning that covers this case because in a literal sense, the decedent worked for the employer \u201cless than a net period of two calendar weeks\u201d immediately prior to his incapacity \u2014 namely, zero weeks. This would indicate that the benefits are to be calculated under that part of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310, which means the prevailing wage at the time of the decedent\u2019s incapacity. Because that figure was never calculated, the case would have to be remanded to the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner to make that calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court for further remand to the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for calculation of the plaintiff\u2019s dependent death benefits under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 31-310.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 55-3 provides: \u201cLimitation of effect of certain acts.
