Wheat (defendant).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sole issue to be decided on appeal is whether the defendant is an \u201cunemployed person\u201d as defined by the Homeowner Protection Act (mortgage act); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-31d through 49-31i;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who may qualify for protection from mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>foreclosure under that act. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s application for protection, determining that, as a matter of law, she was not an \u201cunemployed person\u201d for whom protection was available. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 65-1, and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The following facts are not in dispute. On July 21, 1989, the defendant and her husband, Clayton E. Wheat, executed a promissory note in the principal amount of $750,000 to Connecticut National Mortgage Company. (Connecticut Mortgage). As security for the note, the defendant, as the sole owner of residential real estate located at 22-24 Searles Road in Darien, executed a mortgage deed conveying that property to Connecticut Mortgage. On December 21, 1992, Shawmut Mortgage Company, a predecessor in interest to the plaintiff, instituted an action to foreclose upon the defendant\u2019s mortgage based upon nonpayment of the principal and interest due under the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Thereafter, on January 27,1993, pursuant to the mortgage act, the defendant filed an application in the trial court seeking protection against foreclosure. In general, the mortgage act grants underemployed and unemployed homeowners a six month stay in foreclosure proceedings on their principal residences.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In seeking protection against foreclosure, the defendant claimed that, as an elderly person suffering from an illness that makes it impossible for her to work, she qualified as an \u201cunemployed person\u201d within the meaning of the mortgage act. On July 23,1993, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s application for protection from foreclosure, concluding, as a matter of law, that she was not an \u201cunemployed person\u201d within the meaning of the mortgage act. Specifically, the trial court construed the term \u201cunemployed person\u201d as used in the mortgage act as requiring a previous employer-employee relationship. The defendant did not claim to have ever been employed, and the trial court found that at the time the defendant was (1) unfit for employment, (2) was not seeking employment, and (3) was too ill to seek employment. Consequently, the court denied her protection, and rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that because presently she is not employed and is unable to work due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>to illness, age and disability, she is an \u201cunemployed person\u201d as defined by the mortgage act; see footnote 3 of this opinion; and, therefore, she qualifies for protection under the act. Specifically, the defendant contends that in denying her protection, the trial court improperly equated \u201cunemployed\u201d with \u201celigibility\u201d for unemployment benefits under chapter 567 of the General Statutes, commonly known as the Unemployment Compensation Act (unemployment act). See General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 et seq. According to the defendant, the mortgage act\u2019s definition of \u201cunemployed persons\u201d encompasses individuals who have never worked and are incapable of working in the future. Furthermore, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied her protection under the mortgage act because she was not \u201celigible\u201d for unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Conversely, the plaintiff argues that a person who has never been employed cannot be considered to be \u201cunemployed\u201d under the mortgage act and, therefore, cannot qualify for protection from mortgage foreclosure under that act. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Whether the defendant is an \u201cunemployed person\u201d within the meaning of the mortgage act is a matter of statutory interpretation. Statutory interpretation is a matter of law over which this court\u2019s review is plenary. <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>243 Conn. 255, 258, 701 A.2d 650 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1136, 118 S. Ct. 1838, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1998). In construing statutes, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). \u201c[N]o part of a legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary, and there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 346, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). Statutes are to be construed \u201cin a manner that will not thwart [their] intended purpose or lead to absurd results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 319, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he law favors a rational statutory construction and we presume that the legislature intended a sensible result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 165, 496 A.2d 186 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">We begin with the language of the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 49-31d provides in part that an \u201c \u2018[unemployed person\u2019 means a person who is unemployed for the purposes of [the unemployment act].\u201d The unemployment act does not contain a definition of the term \u201cunemployed,\u201d nor does it define \u201cunemployment.\u201d Instead, the unemployment act contains an extensive definition of \u201cemployment\u201d; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a); and specifies a number of conditions that a previously employed person must satisfy in order to be \u201celigible\u201d to receive unemployment benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-235. The definition of employment contained in the unemployment act begins by stating generally that employment is \u201c[a]ny service . . . performed under any express or implied contract of hire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>creating the relationship of employer and employee.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-222 (a) (1) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">In addition to referencing the unemployment act for a definition of an \u201cunemployed person,\u201d the mortgage act also provides some indication of who is <em>not </em>to be considered unemployed. General Statutes \u00a7 49-3 If (b) provides in relevant part that when the \u201cproperty which is the subject of a foreclosure action is owned by more than one person ... no homeowner [of the property] shall be deemed an unemployed person . . . unless the aggregate <em>earned </em>income of all the homeowners of the . . . property . . . during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the foreclosure action is less than fifty thousand dollars and less than seventy-five per cent of the average aggregate annual <em>earned </em>income during the two years immediately preceding such twelve-month period for all such homeowners . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, the mortgage act defines an \u201cunderemployed person\u201d as \u201ca person whose <em>earned </em>income during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the foreclosure action is (A) less than fifty thousand dollars and (B) less than seventy-five per cent of his [or her] average annual <em>earned </em>income during the two years immediately preceding such twelve-month period.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 49-31d (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Although neither the mortgage act nor the unemployment act explicitly defines which persons are to be considered \u201cunemployed,\u201d the preceding provisions indicate that the legislature intended, in enacting both acts, to benefit persons who previously have held a position of employment. In defining what it means to be \u201cunderemployed\u201d in \u00a7 49-31d (6), and in identifying who is <em>not </em>considered unemployed in \u00a7 49-3If (b), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>legislature repeatedly refers to <em>earned </em>income. Obviously, in order to have had earned income, a person must at one time have been employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Similarly, the unemployment act requires that a person have had earned income in order to qualify for unemployment compensation benefits. Under the unemployment act, a potential recipient must satisfy the eligibility requirements contained in \u00a7 31-235 in order to qualify for benefits. One of the eligibility requirements is that the person claiming benefits must have been paid wages by an employer who is subject to the provisions of the unemployment act during a certain period of time, identified as the \u201cbase period,\u201d prior to claiming benefits. General Statutes \u00a7 31-235 (a) (3). By placing this condition upon the right to receive benefits, the legislature has indicated that, in enacting the unemployment act, it intended to aid only persons experiencing temporary employment-related losses of earned income. The language of both the mortgage act and the unemployment act, therefore, provides a strong indication that only persons who previously have been employed are to be considered to be \u201cunemployed\u201d for purposes of the mortgage act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The legislative policies underlying both acts further support this conclusion. The purpose of the unemployment act is to provide temporary monetary benefits to workers experiencing short-term unemployment or underemployment. See generally <em>Furber </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>164 Conn. 446, 324 A.2d 254 (1973). As we have discussed previously, the unemployment act requires that all potential recipients of unemployment compensation benefits satisfy the eligibility requirements of \u00a7 31-235 in order to actually receive such benefits. Furthermore, once eligibility has been established, the number of weeks during which benefits may be received is limited. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>conditional and temporary nature of the benefits indicates that the legislature intended to benefit only temporarily unemployed workers when it enacted the unemployment act.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Similarly, the legislative history of the mortgage act indicates that it was intended to provide a benefit for workers experiencing a decrease in earned income. The mortgage act was enacted in 1983, at a time when economic conditions were giving rise to extensive job loss, layoffs and cutbacks in employment. Discussions in the state House of Representatives prior to the enactment of the mortgage act evidence that it was designed as a temporary \u201cmortgage moratorium for unemployed <em>workers.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 25,1983 Sess., p. 8973, remarks of Representative R. E. Van Norstrand. Although the legislative history of the mortgage act is not abundant, there is no indication anywhere in its history to suggest that the legislature intended to provide persons other than \u201cunemployed workers\u201d with protection from mortgage foreclosure under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In that regard, it is also significant that, in enacting the mortgage act, the legislature chose to define the category of \u201cunemployed persons\u201d who would be the mortgage act\u2019s beneficiaries by reference to the unemployment act. The decision to identify unemployed persons as \u201cpersons unemployed for purposes of [the unemployment act],\u201d indicates that both the mortgage act and the unemployment act were intended to benefit the same class of persons. Therefore, the purposes underlying both the mortgage act and the unemployment act provide a further reason to conclude that only persons who have been employed previously may qualify as \u201cunemployed\u201d under the mortgage act.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Finally, our conclusion is supported by the fact that the mortgage act contains a requirement that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>consider, prior to affording an applicant protection against foreclosure under the mortgage act, whether the homeowner will likely be able to resume making timely payments after the six month period of protection ends. General Statutes \u00a7 49-31f (d) (1). This requirement indicates that the mortgage act intends only to help persons who are experiencing <em>temporary </em>economic difficulties. Considered in combination with the mortgage act\u2019s references to earned income and the unemployment act, this requirement lends additional support to our conclusion that the legislature had in mind only persons who are experiencing temporary employment-related losses or decreases in earned income as beneficiaries when it enacted the mortgage act.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In the present case, the defendant is a person who has never been employed. Further, she presently is not experiencing a temporary employment-related decrease in earned income.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An interpretation of the mortgage act that would include persons in the defendant\u2019s circumstances within the definition of \u201cunemployed persons\u201d would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the mortgage act, contrary to our expressed function. <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 663. Therefore, we conclude that in order to fall within the definition of an \u201cunemployed person\u201d under the mortgage act, an individual must have been employed previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The defendant claims that, although her financial problems are not the result of a decrease in earned income, she should nevertheless be allowed to benefit from the mortgage act because: (1) she is experiencing temporary economic difficulties due to increased health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>care costs; and (2) the mortgage act was intended generally to aid persons who temporarily are unable to pay their mortgages \u201cdue to economic conditions beyond their control.\u201d Neither the mortgage act nor its legislative history indicate an intent to provide assistance generally to all persons having difficulty paying their mortgage for reasons other than their employment situation and a decrease in earned income. Therefore, these claims by the defendant must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The defendant also argues that General Statutes \u00a7 31-228,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contained within the unemployment act, defines unemployment in such a way so as to include persons in her circumstances. We disagree. According to that section, a \u201ctotally unemployed\u201d individual is a person who \u201chas performed during that week no services for which remuneration of any nature is payable . . . and has not engaged in any self-employment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-228. That section, entitled \u201c[b]enefit for total unemployment,\u201d discusses total unemployment solely in the context of determining a person\u2019s benefit rate. The defendant misconstrues the term \u201ctotal unemployment\u201d as used in \u00a7 31-228 by failing to read it in the context of the entire section. When one rationally reads that section in its entirety; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>supra, 197 Conn. 165; it becomes clear that the defendant is not \u201ctotally unemployed,\u201d because the section contemplates an employer-employee relationship, without which one\u2019s benefit rate cannot be calculated. In other words, one must be \u201cunemployed\u201d before one can become \u201ctotally unemployed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">For all of the reasons previously discussed, we conclude that the defendant, as an individual who never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>previously has been employed, is not an \u201cunemployed person\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 49-3 Id (1) and, therefore, may not qualify for protection from mortgage foreclosure under the mortgage act.* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\"> Connecticut National Mortgage Company, the original mortgagee, subsequently became Shawmut Mortgage Company, which initiated the foreclosure action and subsequently assigned the mortgage to Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A.

The defendant did not raise either claim of error during the trial court proceedings and both claims fail to meet the requirements for exceptions to the general rule that only claims raised below can be argued on appeal. <em>State v. Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can, on appeal, prevail on a constitutional claim of error when the claim was not raised in the trial court only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate the harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id., 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The defendant\u2019s claim that she was denied equal protection of the laws on the basis of her gender fails to satisfy the requirements of the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>The defendant has failed to provide an adequate record for review of her claim because the mortgage act is gender-neutral on its face and the defendant has not introduced any evidence demonstrating that the purpose or intent of the mortgage act is to discriminate. See <em>Golab </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>205 Conn. 17, 26, 529 A.2d 1297 (1987) (\u201c[a]n equal protection claim based on unequal application of the law . . . must be established by competent evidence . . . showing . . . intentional or purposeful discrimination\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Similarly, the defendant\u2019s claim that she was denied equal protection of the laws on the basis of her disability also fails to satisfy the first prong of <em>Golding. </em>The record does not contain any evidence demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s disability is the reason for her previous lack of employment. Although the trial court found that, presently, the defendant is incapable of working, it did not determine whether the defendant\u2019s disability was the reason for her previous lack of employment, nor is there any evidence in the record to support such a conclusion. On the contrary, the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>the record seems to suggest that the defendant\u2019s previous lack of employment was because she had substantial unearned income with which to support herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">In light of the insufficiency of the record, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9v\">dissenting.
