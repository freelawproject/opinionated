The decedent was exposed to asbestos during the first nine years of his employment with the respondent, and was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma in 1990. The respondent concedes that the decedent\u2019s disease arose out of and in the course of his employment with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In 1990, the decedent filed a timely claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-307. Following the decedent\u2019s death in 1992, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the second district (commissioner) awarded benefits to his estate and his wholly dependent widow, Anne Frederick. The respondent appealed from the decision awarding benefits to the compensation review board (review board), which affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The Appellate Court reversed the review board\u2019s decision on the basis of that court\u2019s decision in <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 112, 687 A.2d 550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>(1996). <em>Estate of Frederick </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>44 Conn. App. 124, 686 A.2d 1003 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We recently decided in <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics </em>Corp., 245 Conn. 66, 712 A.2d 938 (1998), that a surviving dependent spouse is entitled to benefits under \u00a7 31-306, when the decedent has not worked for the employer for twenty-six weeks preceding the manifestation of an occupational disease. The certified issue in this case, however, does not sufficiently portray the issues originally presented by the appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision. In this case, the decedent had filed a timely claim before his death, and, therefore, both his dependent widow and his estate have a claim. The certified issue, however, addresses only the dependent widow\u2019s entitlement to benefits. Therefore, we rephrase the certified issue \u201cin order to render [it] more accurate in framing the issues that this case presents.\u201d <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 648 n.1, 674 A.2d 821 (1996). Accordingly, the certified issue is amended to provide as follows: \u201cAre the surviving dependent spouse and the estate of an employee who died as a result of an occupational disease entitled to benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 and General Statutes \u00a7 31-307, respectively, when: (a) the decedent did not work for the twenty-six weeks preceding the date of the manifestation of the occupational disease; and (b) the occupational disease manifested itself prior to October 1, 1990, the effective date of Public Acts 1990, No. 90-116?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Both \u00a7 31-306 and \u00a7 31-307 provide that benefits are calculated pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-310. In <em>Green, </em>we concluded that such benefits are calculated under General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-310c in the case of occupational disease. <em>Green </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 78. Therefore, the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>certified issue is answered in the affirmative, and the benefits are to be calculated in accordance with our decision in <em>Green.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the review board with direction that it be remanded to the commissioner to award benefits to the decedent\u2019s estate and to his dependent widow in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BERDON and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> The second certified issue provides as follows: \u201cIf the answer to the first question is yes, how should the average weekly wage used to determine the amount of the benefits to the surviving dependent spouse be calculated under the facts of this case?\u201d <em>Estate of Frederick </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>240 Conn. 917, 692 A.2d 812 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\"> The original respondents included the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation (Electric Boat), National Employers Company and CIGNA Property and Casualty Company (CIGNA).
