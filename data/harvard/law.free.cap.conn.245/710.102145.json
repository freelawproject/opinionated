Co. </em>v. <em>Pasion, </em>219 Conn. 764, 594 A.2d 468 (1991), we held that under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a written request to reduce uninsured motorist coverage<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> signed by only one of two named insureds under an automobile liability insurance policy was ineffective to reduce the uninsured motorist benefits available to a third party who had been injured in an accident while a passenger in a vehicle covered under the policy. In this certified appeal, we must decide whether, under that statutory subsection, a written request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage submitted by one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>of two named insureds under an automobile liability policy is effective when it is the insured who signed the reduction request form who seeks uninsured motorist benefits. We conclude that, in such circumstances, our decision in <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>does not apply and, furthermore, that the named insured\u2019s request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage is binding as against that insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The material facts and procedural history are undisputed. At all times relevant to this appeal, the defendant, D. Eugene Bryant (Bryant), and his wife, Judith Bryant, owned three vehicles. Two of those vehicles were insured under a policy issued by Colonial Penn Insurance Company (Colonial Penn), and the third vehicle was insured under a policy issued by Royal Insurance Company (Royal). Bryant and his wife were the named insureds under each of the two policies. The Royal policy provided for $250,000 in uninsured motorist coverage. Prior to March, 1988, the Colonial Penn policy provided uninsured motorist coverage of $100,000 for each of the two vehicles covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Upon notification by Colonial Penn that its policy was due to expire, Bryant renewed the policy in March, 1988. Bryant also signed and forwarded to Colonial Penn a form requesting a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage from $100,000 per vehicle to $20,000 per vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judith Bryant, however, did not sign the reduction request form. As a result of Bryant\u2019s request, he and his wife paid a lower premium for the reduced uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Bryant thereafter was injured in an automobile accident on September 20, 1989. After exhausting the tort-feasor\u2019s liability coverage of $25,000, Bryant sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>recover uninsured motorist benefits under the Colonial Penn and Royal policies. The parties stipulated that the Colonial Penn policy provided primary uninsured motorist coverage,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, under then applicable law, the coverage under the Colonial Penn policy could be stacked.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Bryant claimed that because his wife had not signed the form requesting a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage under the Colonial Penn policy, his request was ineffective in light of our decision in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasion, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 764, and, consequently, he was eligible under that policy for uninsured motorist benefits in the total amount of $200,000 ($100,000 x 2 vehicles).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Colonial Penn claimed that Bryant\u2019s request for a reduction in the amount of uninsured motorist coverage was binding on him and, therefore, the policy provided for a maximum of $40,000 ($20,000 x 2 vehicles) in uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The case proceeded to mandatory arbitration pursuant to the Colonial Penn policy. The arbitration panel, with one of the three members dissenting, concluded that: (1) Bryant had sustained damages totaling $180,000; (2) because Bryant had received $25,000 from the tortfeasor, he was entitled to a balance of $155,000 under the uninsured motorist provisions of the applicable policy or policies; (3) in light of our decision in <em>Pasi\u00f3n, </em>Bryant\u2019s request for a reduction in coverage under the Colonial Penn policy was ineffective because the signature of the second named insured, Judith Bryant, did not appear on the request form and, consequently, Bryant was entitled to $200,000 in uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>motorist coverage under that policy; and (4) Colonial Penn, as the primary insurer, was obligated to pay Bryant $155,000 in uninsured motorist benefits. Consequently, Bryant\u2019s claim against Royal was moot because the uninsured motorist benefits payable to Bryant by Colonial Penn were less than the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage under the Colonial Penn policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Colonial Penn appealed from the arbitration award to the trial court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court, relying on our opinion in <em>Pasi\u00f3n, </em>affirmed the decision of the arbitrators. On appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Appellate Court reversed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that Bryant\u2019s request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage under the Colonial Penn policy was binding on Bryant notwithstanding the fact that his wife had not signed the request form. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>45 Conn. App. 558, 565-56, 696 A.2d 1267 (1997). The Appellate Court determined that, under the circumstances, our holding in <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>was not controlling because, in this case, unlike in <em>Pasi\u00f3n, </em>the injured party seeking recovery under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy was the same insured who had signed the form requesting a reduction in coverage and, thus, Bryant\u2019s request was binding on him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 562. The Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Court also identified what it described as \u201canother more compelling reason ... to conclude that the coverage reduction form was effective and binding on both [the insureds]\u201d; id.; namely, the retroactive applicability of an amendment to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2); Public Acts 1993, No. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 l);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> adopted after our decision in <em>Pasion. Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 565. The relevant part of P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 expressly authorized <em>any </em>named insured\u201d to request and obtain a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage. (Emphasis added.) P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1. In accordance with its determination that Bryant\u2019s request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage was effective, the Appellate Court remanded the case to the trial court with direction that it render judgment ordering Colonial Penn to pay Bryant $15,000 under its policy and ordering Royal to pay Bryant $140,000 under its policy. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Royal petitioned for certification to appeal to this court. We granted Royal\u2019s petition limited to the following issues: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that: (1) Under General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), and <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasion, </em>[supra] 219 Conn. 764, the signature of the defendant, D. Eugene Bryant, was sufficient to render the reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>in coverage form effective as to him; and (2) the subsequent amendment to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), and codified at General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (2), clarified \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), with retroactive effect?\u201d <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>243 Conn. 919, 701 A.2d 340 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">On appeal to this court, Royal<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> contends that this case is controlled by <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>and, consequently, that Bryant\u2019s request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage was not effective. Royal further asserts that the Appellate Court improperly gave retroactive effect to the amendment to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) authorizing \u201cany named insured\u201d to obtain a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage. See P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1. Although we disagree with the Appellate Court\u2019s retroactive application of the amendment to \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), we agree that our holding in <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>does not control this case and, moreover, that Bryant is bound by his request for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Before turning to the question of whether <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>is applicable in the circumstances of this case, we first address the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which amended \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) by replacing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the term \u201cthe insured\u201d with \u201cany named insured,\u201d applies retroactively. We disagree that the amendment has retrospective applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 284, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. \u2018Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: \u201cNo provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect.\u201d The \u201cobligations\u201d referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>702 A.2d 1180 (1997). This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, maybe rebutted \u201cwhen the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively.\u201d <em>In re Daniel </em>H., 237 Conn. 364, 372, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); accord <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 483-84, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995); <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991). \u201cWhere an amendment is intended to clarify the original intent of an earlier statute, it necessarily has retroactive effect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Toise </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628, 707 A.2d 25 (1998). We generally look to the statutory language and the pertinent legislative history to ascertain whether the legislature intended that the amendment be given retrospective effect. See, <em>e.g., Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casually Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 290, 679 A.2d 925 (1996); <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Vermilyn Brown, Inc., </em>232 Conn. 780, 787, 657 A.2d 616 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Colonial Penn concedes, and the Appellate Court recognized,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that there is nothing in the legislative history of P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1, to indicate that the legislature intended that the term \u201cany named insured\u201d is to be applied retroactively. Moreover, the statutory language itself contains no suggestion that the legislature intended for the term to be given retrospective effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The Appellate Court nevertheless concluded that, in light of the fact that the legislature\u2019s decision to change the statutory language from \u201cthe insured\u201d to \u201cany named insured\u201d was prompted by our decision in <em>Pasi\u00f3n,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the legislature must have been clarifying its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>original intent and, accordingly, the term \u201cany named insured\u201d should be given retrospective effect. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. Bryant, supra, 45 Conn. App. 564-65. We disagree. Assuming arguendo that the change in language was made in response to our decision in <em>Pasi\u00f3n; </em>see footnote 16; that fact alone is insufficient to overcome the presumption against retroactive applicability; indeed, it sheds little, if any, light on whether the legislature intended for the amendment to be applied retroactively. The mere fact that the legislature changes the language of a statutory provision in response to a judicial decision interpreting that provision does not mean that the legislature necessarily intended that the amendatory language be retroactive. See, e.g <em>., Bayusik v. Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 233 Conn. 478 n.2; <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Della Ghelfa, </em>200 Conn. 630, 640-41, 513 A.2d 52 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Colonial Penn contends that <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 285, supports its claim that P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1, as it amended subsection (a) (2) of \u00a7 38-175c (hereinafter P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 [a] [2]), should be applied retroactively. In <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>we concluded that a different and unrelated part of P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1, later codified at General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> was clarifying legislation and, consequently, had to be given retrospective effect. <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 291. In so holding, however, we observed that the pertinent legislative history of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) provided \u201cuncontroverted support\u201d; id., 290; for the conclusion that the legislature considered the amendatory language to be \u201ca declaration of the legislature\u2019s <em>original </em>intent\u201d rather than a change in the existing statute. (Emphasis added.) Id., 291. By contrast, the legislative history of P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (a) (2) contains no indication that the legislature enacted that provision to clarify, rather than to change, the existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Furthermore, P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (a) (2) provides that no request for a reduction in uninsured motorist benefits by \u201cany named insured\u201d shall be effective unless that insured has signed an informed consent form containing: (1) an explanation of uninsured and underin-sured motorist coverage; (2) a list of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage options available from the insurer; (3) the premium cost for each of those coverage options; and (4) a specific admonition, in twelve-point type, informing the insured of the consequences of choosing reduced coverage and advising the insured to seek assistance from a qualified advisor if he or she is uncertain about the effect of such an election. Neither Bryant nor Royal, however, claims that these requirements are also to be applied retroactively,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>though, by their very nature, they are inextricably linked to the statutory change that allows \u201cany named insured\u201d to elect a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage that is binding on all insureds under the policy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We see no reason why the legislature would have intended for certain provisions of P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (a) (2) to be given retrospective effect and the other, integrally related provisions of that very same subdivision, to be afforded prospective effect only.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Finally, P.A. 93-297, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Automobile Insurance Reform,\u201d made comprehensive changes to the law of uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Among other things, the act abolished intra-policy and inter-policy stacking; allows an insured to purchase uninsured motorist coverage with limits up to twice that of the policy\u2019s bodily injury coverage; allows an insured, in certain circumstances, to recover the highest amount of any one policy under which he or she may be insured; establishes rules prioritizing uninsured motorist benefits due under multiple policies; and creates \u201cunderinsured motorist conversion coverage,\u201d an optional form of coverage that authorizes an insured to collect for damages sustained up to the limit of the conversion coverage without having such coverage reduced by a third party payment or barred altogether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>due to the fact that the tortfeasor\u2019s policy equals or exceeds the limit of the insured\u2019s conversion coverage. J. Berk &amp; M. Jainchill, Connecticut Law of Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Coverage (1993) \u00a7 1.1, pp. 8-9. Thus, the overriding purpose of the act was to change, rather than to clarify, existing law. Because there is no persuasive evidence that the legislature had a different purpose with respect to P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (a) (2), we conclude that the Appellate Court was incorrect in holding that the term \u201cany named insured\u201d has retrospective applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">We next turn to the question of whether our decision in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pasion, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 764, controls this case. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In <em>Pasion, </em>we determined that, under \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), a request for a reduction in uninsured motorist benefits by Carlos Londono, who, along with his wife, Alexis, was a named insured on an automobile liability policy issued to the Londonos by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, was not binding on a third party who was injured in an accident while riding as a passenger in a vehicle covered under the policy. Id., 771. In so holding, we concluded, first, that the requirement that any reduction in uninsured motorist coverage be requested in writing by the \u201cinsured\u201d was ambiguous because it was not clear, in the circumstances of that case, whether the term \u201cinsured\u201d referred to <em>any </em>named insured or to <em>all </em>named insureds. Id., 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We then reviewed the pertinent legislative history,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and observed that \u201c[t]he apparent intent of the legislature in adopting [subdivision] (2) . . . was to assure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that consumers purchasing automobile liability insurance would be made aware of the low cost of equal amounts of uninsured coverage by requiring any reduction in that coverage to be in writing.\u201d Id., 770-71. On the basis of our determination regarding the legislative intent, we concluded as follows: \u201cAlthough the named insureds on the policy involved in [the] case are husband and wife and by virtue of that personal relationship it could be assumed that Alexis Londono was both made aware of the availability of low-cost uninsured motorist coverage and acquiesced in the reduction sought by her husband, such an assumption is far from a certainty. We are even less certain that in situations where the joint owners of an automobile and named insureds on an automobile liability insurance policy are, for example, brother and sister, roommates, or friends, all of whom would be consumers, a conscious choice to reduce uninsured motorist coverage would have been made by all consumers when only one owner/named insured had signed the authorization for reduction in coverage. <em>To permit the signature of one named insured to bind other, possibly uninformed, named insureds would circumvent the legislature\u2019s intent that the decision to reduce uninsured motorist coverage by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>consumers be an informed one.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Relying on our conclusion in <em>Pasion </em>that the legislative objective underlying the signature requirement of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) was to promote informed decision-making by purchasers of uninsured motorist coverage; id., 770-71; the Appellate Court reasoned that in view of the fact that Bryant himself had sought the reduction in coverage, his \u201celection was not uninformed\u201d; <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 562; and, consequently, Bryant\u2019s endorsement and submission of the reduction request form was sufficient to effect a reduction in coverage \u201c[a]s to him.\u201d Id. We agree with the conclusion of the Appellate Court. \u201cIt is not our practice to construe a statute in a way to thwart its purpose or lead to absurd results; <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 121, 513 A.2d 139, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 964, 107 S. Ct. 466, 93 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986); or in a way \u2018that fails to attain a rational and sensible result that bears directly on the purpose the legislature sought to achieve.\u2019 <em>Fairfield Plumbing &amp; Heating Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Kosa, </em>220 Conn. 643, 651, 600 A.2d 1 (1991).\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 859-60, 675 A.2d 835 (1996); see also <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 319-20. In light of the intent and purpose of the legislature in enacting \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), we see no reason why a named insured who personally has elected a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage under that provision, and who has paid a premium commensurate with that choice, should not be bound by that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">This interpretation of \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2) is supported by the relevant scholarly commentary. For example, shortly after our decision in <em>Pasi\u00f3n, </em>and prior to the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in this case, the authors of an authoritative work on Connecticut\u2019s uninsured motorist law presaged the scenario presented by this case: \u201cAn immediate question posed by the holding of <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>whether a rejection of higher limits would be effective if signed by only one of the named insureds if <em>that </em>named insured was the one making claim for benefits.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) J. Berk &amp; M. Jainchill, supra, \u00a7 1.10.2, p. 63. As those commentators noted, \u201c[certainly under [such] circumstances if the court is concerned that appropriate information be disseminated to the named insured so that an \u2018informed decision\u2019 may be made by the named insured, such concern has been satisfied where the injured claimant is the named insured who signed the rejection.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because our holding in <em>Pasi\u00f3n </em>was expressly predicated upon the legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 38-175c (a) (2), namely, that \u201cconsumers purchasing automobile liability insurance would be made aware of the low cost of equal amounts of uninsured coverage by requiring any reduction in that coverage to be in writing\u201d; <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. Pasion, supra, 219 Conn. 770-71; a named insured who, like Bryant, makes a conscious choice to reduce the uninsured motorist coverage under an automobile liability policy cannot reasonably claim that his or her decision is not binding <em>as against him or her </em>simply because another named insured under the policy failed to sign the reduction request form. See <em>Plaster v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins.

Senator Baker, \u201cin moving for acceptance of that committee\u2019s favorable report and passage of Senate Bill 123, stated that this provision would require each insured who purchases more than the legally required amount of liability insurance [to] receive the same amount of uninsured motorist coverage. The insured would have an opportunity to waive in writing the additional uninsured motorist coverage. This change would increase the consumer\u2019s awareness of the value of low-cost uninsured motorist coverage which protects the insured and [his or her] family members. Apparently many drivers pinchase $100,000.00 or more of liability coverage but leave their uninsured motorist coverage at the minimum of $20,000-$40,000.
