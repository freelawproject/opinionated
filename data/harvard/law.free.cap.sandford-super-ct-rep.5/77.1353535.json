The cause was tried at the New York Circuit, in April, 1848, before Justice Hurlbutj and was transferred to this court in. pursuance of the statute. The action was for malicious prosecution. The plaintiff was a stockholder in the Kidd Salvage Company, and the defendants were members and agents of that company. In June and July, 1846, the plaintiff was engaged at Caldwell\u2019s Landing, in inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tigating certain alleged frauds of the said company, and procuring affidavits tending to prove the existence of said frauds. Whilst so engaged, he was arrested by the procurement of the defendants, and certain other members and agents of said company. On the 14th of July, 1846, at an early hour of the morning, a Miss Lemoine, who was a fortune teller and one of the employees of the said company, acting in concert with the defendants and other persons, some members and some agents of said company, sent Cowles, another agent of said company, and one of the defendants, to the police office of the 10th District of the City of New York, to procure the services of Benjamin Whitehouse and Jackson Bumstead, two police officers of said district. Cowles returned with the police officers before mentioned, to the house of the said Lemoine, in Broome street, where they saw and received instructions from the defendant Shelden. He also induced the police officers to accompany him to the Tombs, and thence to the office of the chief of police. The defendant desired the chief of police to allow the police officers to go to Brooklyn, and ascertain whether the plaintiff had passed counterfeit money at Brooklyn, and near the racecourse. On the earnest solicitations of said Shelden, the chief of police consented to send the said two officers to Brooklyn, where they speedily ascertained that the plaintiff was not the man who had passed the counterfeit money, which information they communicated to the defendant Shelden on their return. Afterwards, the defendants, under pretence of effecting the arrest of one Andros, a notorious counterfeiter, induced the chief of police to send the officers aforesaid to Caldwell's Landing, in company with the defendant Shelden. Shelden informed the said chief of police that the plaintiff was aiding Andros to escape, and induced said chief to direct said officers to arrest the plaintiff, if they should detect him in aiding said Andros, as charged by Shelden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-5\">\u2022 The expenses of the officers were to be paid by Shelden, and he gave Bumstead $5 for that purpose, and on a subsequent occasion, his attorney, George Bowman, paid Whitehouse $20 for his services in the matter. The plaintiff was in New York on \u25a0 that day, and might have been arrested before the boat left the city ; but, in pursuance of the suggestions of the defendants, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>arrest was deferred till the boat arrived at Caldwell\u2019s Landing. The officers went to the boat one quarter of an hour before her departure, and there saw the plaintiff, but made no attempt to arrest him. Miss Lemoine and the defendant Shelden were also there, and all the parties went up as passengers in the said boat. On the arrival of the boat at Caldwell\u2019s Landing, the plaintiff, who was accompanied by two ladies, was allowed to go ashore without any molestation, but soon after was arrested by White-house, at the pressing request of the defendants Shelden and others. Before the arrest, the defendant Shelden stated in substance to Whitehouse, at Caldwell\u2019s Landing, that the plaintiff was a notorious counterfeiter, and had passed counterfeit money in four or five places in New York and Brooklyn. The defendants charged the plaintiff with several other crimes, and finally procured his arrest and imprisonment, until the following day, 'when he was carried to New York, and prosecuted by them for several offences, among which was the charge of passing counterfeit money and threatening to shoot Pierson. The plaintiff was, by the procurement of the defendants, taken before nearly all the police magistrates in the city\u2014first, to the office of the chief of police; secondly, to the Tombs <em>\u25a0 </em>thirdly, to Justice Taylor, at Essex Market; fourthly, back to the office of the chief of police, and then again before Wm. Wain Drinker, Esq., the police justice at the Tombs. No one of these magistrates thought the evidence produced against the plaintiff proved such probable cause or reasonable ground to believe the plaintiff guilty, as to warrant his committal, and after a very full examination before Mr. Justice Drinker, he was discharged at about half-past ten or eleven o\u2019clock, P. M., on the fourteenth of July, 1846 ; but, at the request of the defendant\u2019s attorney, Justice Drinker adjourned the examination over till the next Monday, when the plaintiff attended, but no one appearing to prosecute him, he was finally discharged. During all these examinations, the plaintiff did not call any witnesses in his behalf. The examination before Justice Drinker was conducted on the part of the prosecutors by Pierson, Bowman, Coit, and others, and Cram, Cowles, Michael Lynch, and others, were there as witnesses, as well as Shelden and Freeland.. Cram was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>chief witness, and he swore to all the affidavits which Bowman prepared for his signature and verification except one. The plaintiff returned to Caldwell\u2019s Landing on the 15th July, 1846, to pursue his investigations, and collect evidence in relation to the Kidd Salvage Company. On the same day, the defendants, Coit and Michael Lynch, acting in conjunction with the other defendants, went to Leonard Gurnee, Esq., a justice of the peace of Rockland county, made a complaint there against him of his (Carpenter\u2019s) shooting at Lynch some three months before that time, with intent to kill. Lynch was a laborer, employed by the Kidd Salvage Company, in carrying on their operations at Caldwell\u2019s. On the examination, it very clearly appeared that the plaintiff did not shoot at Lynch, and after the examination was closed, Lynch admitted that the complaint was altogether unfounded, and that it was made by the instigation of others. The magistrate being entirely satisfied that there was no probable cause for the charge, dismissed it, without calling on the plaintiff to introduce any evidence in his exculpation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-5\">No sooner had Carpenter, the plaintiff, been discharged from custody, <em>on the complaint of Lynch, </em>than the defendant procured him to be again arrested, on a warrant issued upon the charge of aiding and abetting the escape of Andros, a counterfeiter. This warrant was issued by Justice De Noyells, of Rockland County ; and the defendants in this suit, by their counsel Pier-son, Bowman, Coit,, Prall, and Frazier (who was also district attorney of Rockland county), appeared before the magistrates of Rockland, to prosecute Carpenter. But after Bennett\u2019s discharge, the prosecutors -introduced no evidence against Carpenter, and he was discharged, without offering any evidence himself, or having any offered against him. When he was discharged from this last complaint, his counsel, William Nelson, of Peekskill, and Mr. Cutler, supposing no other prosecution in contemplation, left the village of Haverstraw, where tlie last examination was held, and took the first boat to go to Peekskill. After they had taken the boat, and Carpenter was left at Haverstraw, some of the defendants procured him to be arrested on warrants issued several days before, and which they had kept in their possession for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Carpenter found bail to keep the peace, and was discharged, no one appearing against him at the Rockland Sessions. He then commenced this suit for malicious prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendants moved for a non-suit, specifying, among others, the following grounds : \u20141. That, as to some of the defendants, there was no proof establishing, or tending to establish, any cause of action whatever, and that the court ought so to decide. 2. That this being so, the action being thus far put forth and supported as an action for conspiracy, could not be sustained, and that the court ought so to decide. 3. That the evidence showed no acquittal of the plaintiff in the legal sense of the term, upon any of the charges made against him, and that the counts alleging an acquittal were not sustained. 4. That it appearing that the plaintiff had never been legally acquitted for any of these charges, but only discharged on the application for him to be held to answer, and the defendant\u2019s now offering to prove that he had since been legally held to answer on indictments for the same charges, which indictments were pending untried, such proof should be admitted and held a bar to the action, or the further maintenance of it, the prosecution of those charges not having been legally terminated. 5. That the plaintiff had not established the want of probable cause for the prosecutions. G. That the plaintiff had not proved malice in the legal meaning of the term. 7. That the court was bound to decide if the plaintiff had or had not made out the want of probable cause. The court ruled that the plaintiff had not proved any of the counts of his declaration save the first five, to which counts he must be confined\u2014to which ruling, the plaintiff, by his counsel, excepted. That as to the said first five counts, the court overruled the motion for nonsuit, and overruled all the objections taken by the defendants as applied to the said five counts : To which rulings and decisions of the court, the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-6\">The testimony being closed, the court charged the jury, and among other things stated that\u2014It was incumbent on the plaintiff to show a prosecution of him by. the defendants; that a prosecution was usually instituted by a written complaint, but it may be merely oral if made upon oath as a criminal charge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and taken down by the magistrate in writing for the purpose of investigation. That such a complaint is sufficient to sustain the action, if the plaintiff appears, and is put to trial or examination upon it. But that it was necessary the jury should be satisfied, that it was made to a magistrate with a view to induce him to entertain it, as a criminal charge. That such a complaint did not appear to be proved here until the parties came before Justice Drinker, and all the anterior proceedings the jtiry might lay out of view in this action, except upon the question of malice, and in determining the amount of damages, if they should arrive at that question. That if the jury should find that there was a complaint by the defendants against the plaintiff before Justice Drinker, and that witnesses were examined upon it, and that he was discharged, the- plaintiff had made out the first step in his case, to wit, a prosecution. That the next question which presented itself, was the question of probable cause. That the plaintiff, to maintain this action,, must show, not only a malicious prosecution, but also that it was instituted and prosecuted without any reasonable or probable cause. That the' plaintiff must show this, or his action could not be maintained,, and it was for the jury to inquire whether that had been done here. That the defendants were not called upon in the first instance to prove that they had reasonable or probable cause\u2014the burden of proof did not lie upon them, but the plaintiff must bear it, and he must show to the satisfaction of the jury, in the first instance, an entire absence of probable cause, for without this, however malicious the prosecution might have been, his action must fail. That it was invariably necessary in an action of this nature for the plaintiff to give some evidence, or to show from the circumstances of the prosecution, that it was groundless. That it is not in general sufficient to prove a mere acquittal, or even to prove any neglect or omission on the part of the defendant to make good his charges. That malice may sometimes be inferred from the absence of probable cause, but the want of probable cause cannot be inferred from the most express malice. That what facts and circumstances amount to probable cause is a question of law when either the facts are undisputed, or.sufficient facts' are established to determine the question. But whether those facts and circumstances exist in a particular case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>is a question of fact for the determination of the jury. That whether there was probable cause in the present case, might be regarded as a mixed question of law and of fact, and it became the duty of the court to submit the facts to the jury, with such instructions on the subject, as the case seemed to demand. That probable cause was the existence of such facts or circumstances, or both, as would lead the mind of a man of common sense, and ordinary prudence and caution, to believe the plaintiff to be guilty. That the facts constituting probable cause must have been .known to the defendants, or some of them, or they or some of them must have been informed of such facts before the complaints and prosecutions were instituted, and they must have believed such information to be true. That it was not suEcient that the defendants suspected the existence of crime\u2014they must have actually believed it, and if they acted on information, the jury must be satisfied that they believed in its truth. That it was'for the jury to determine, whether the facts and circumstances detailed in the evidence, afforded the defendants reasonable grounds for believing that the plaintiff was guilty of the offences which they laid to his charge. If probable cause existed, it was a complete bar to. the plaintiff's recovery. That the absence of probable cause alone would not suEce to maintain this action, but the plaintiff must show in addition, that the prosecution against him was instituted by the defendants maliciously. That the malice necessary to support this action consisted in a corrupt intent to do a wrong, or to effect an injury for an improper or unjust motive. That when there is a total want of probable cause, malice may, in some cases, be presumed, or very slight evidence of malice will suEce ; as in case where the accused party is promptly discharged by the magis; trate without being put to the calling of any witnesses. This presumption may, however, be rebutted by showing that the prosecution was instituted and carried on in good faith, and for justifiable ends. That when the advice of counsel is alone relied upon to show the absence of malice, it must appear that such advice was given before the prosecution, upon a fair and full statement of the facts, and that the defendants believed those facts to exist, and the advice given to be correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">The judge further charged that the verdict in this case might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>be against all or any of the defendants, but that the jury could find but one verdict for the plaintiff; and against whatever parties they found a verdict, it could only be against such as they should find acting together in one or more unfounded and malicious charge or charges. That the grounds of their verdict must affect all such defendants acting together. That the plaintiff could have brought a separate suit against each or any of the parties, but having elected to bring one action against all, he could succeed only against such as he could unite by his proof in one or more charges in which such parties acted together maliciously, and without reasonable or probable cause, \u2022and by combination against him. That if the jury should find one -cause of action against some, not implicating the others, they could not find a verdict on that cause of action without acquitting all the others, although some of the others might be liable for the unwarranted institution of the other charges. That the next question was as to damages ; and that if they should find for the plaintiff, they might of course allow him a compensation for his loss of time while under arrest and prosecution, for his expenses, including expenses of defence, and all such damages as were direct and immediate. That the main ground of damages, however, in such an action, is injury to the feelings and character of the plaintiff. That if the plaintiff only recovers for a false and malicious prosecution of a complaint for misdemeanor, or on a prosecution for an offence less than felony, his damages should not be so high as if he recovered for a false and malicious charge of felony. That if he recovered for the complaint of Lynch, or on the charge of concealing Andros, or on the charge of counterfeiting, as these were felonies, he would be entitled to heavier damages than if he recovered for the prosecutions against him for misdemeanors. That it was contended that the plaintiff\u2019s character was bad ; and on this point evidence had been given on both sides, and was before the jury. But if they should find a malicious prosecution for a felony, without any reasonable or probable cause for its institution, and that the plaintiff\u2019s character was. fair, he was entitled to exemplary damages. The counsel for the defendants excepted to so much of said charge as ruled that just and reasonable cause of suspicion, unaccompanied by proof from which the jury might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>infer that the party relied in good faith upon it, in making his complaint, was not sufficient probable cause. Also to so much of the said charge as deprived the defendants of the benefit of any facts proved by them to establish probable cause, except such as were shown to have been known to them, or had been communicated to them at the time of the complaint. The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge the jury that probable cause was-the existence of such facts and circumstances as would lead the mind of a reasonable man (not a lawyer), in the exercise of ordinary judgment and caution, to suspect the plaintiff to be guilty, or to conclude that the question of his guilt or innocence ought \"to be investigated. The court declined to charge in these words, having charged on this point as before stated, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge that a less amount of evidence than would be requisite to establish a <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>case of guilt, would be sufficient to establish probable cause. The court declined so to charge, and the defendants' counsel excepted. The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge that if probable cause in point of fact existed at the time of the arrest, it was not incumbent on the defendants to show that they at the time knew and could testify to the facts, or knew the witnesses or proofs to establish them; the existence of probable cause, in fact, is a sufficient justification. The said justice then stated that he. had very fully charged on that subject before, and that he could only add to what he had before stated, that probable cause in fact accompanied by evidence or circumstances from which the jury might infer that the defendants knew it, or were informed of it, and acted upon \"it, would constitute a good defence, to which the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge that the bad character of the plaintiff, if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was to be taken into consideration whether there was probable cause, as a man of bad character may be reasonably suspected upon slighter grounds than a man of good character. The court declined so to charge, and the defendants' counsel excepted. The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge that if the plaintiff was prosecuted on several charges of felony, and probable cause \"for pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>secution. on any of these charges was established, it was a bar to the whole action for malicious prosecution. The court declined so to charge, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. \u25a0The defendants\u2019 counsel also requested the court to charge that as the defendants were charged with a conspiracy, which is an Indictable offence, involving moral turpitude, this action could not be maintained, except upon sufficient evidence to convict the defendants of the crime of conspiracy. The court declined so to charge, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">The jury retired under the charge of the court, and rendered \u25a0a verdict of guilty against the defendants\u2014Henry Shelden, \u2022James Freeland, William S. Pierson, Michael Lynch, Smith \u25a0Cram, and Theodore G-. Cowles, with $5000 damages and 6 'cents costs ; and of not 'guilty as to the remaining defendants, Henry B. Cowles, William Coit; George W. Norris, Stephen \u2022Lounsberry, and Lawrence Mahon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\"><em>A. L. Jordan, </em>for defendants, argued as follows,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">I. The verdict in this cause cannot be sustained, because there ivas no evidence authorizing the jury to find that the defendants Shelden, Pierson, Freeland, Cram, Lynch, and Theodore G. Cowles were prosecutors <em>of any one charge, </em>for the prosecution of which the action was brought. (1.) In the original arrest neither Freeland, Theodore G. Cowles, nor Lynch had any participation. It is quite clear that the jury must have charged <em>Theodore G. Cowles </em>upon the evidence given against <em>Henry Brown Cowles. </em>T. G. Cowles was not at Caldwell\u2019s at the time of the arrest. He did not go up from New York that evening, but left the boat before she started. (2.) As to the charge of passing counterfeit money, Lynch certainly is not shown to have had any participation in that, nor Cowles nor Freeland.' The court ruled there was no prosecution till the parties came before Drinker. Freeland is not shown to have been before Drinker at all, or to have participated in any way directly or indirectly in the proceedings there. (3.) In the complaint for shooting at Lynch, neither Freeland nor Cowles are shown to have participated. (4.) The prosecution for concealing Andros, and aiding him to escape, was on the complaint of Lounsberry, whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>jury have acquitted, as well as Norris, who was active in that complaint. Indeed the proof was ample to <em>convict </em>the plaintiff on that charge. Neither Freeland nor Cowles are shown to have had any thing to do with it. The verdict in this respect was contrary to the express charge of the circuit judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">II. Great injustice has been done by the credit apparently given to Whitehouse. All the aggravation of the case, if any, was proved by him. Yet it is clear he was unworthy of credit, a.nd was swearing to make others responsible for his own wilful acts. His own testimony is full of the most material contradictions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">III. The circuit judge erred in omitting to submit to the consideration of the jury the circumstances impeaching the credb bility of Whitehouse. And such omission, although not excepted to on the trial, is ground for new trial .upon a case. <em>(Morrison </em>v. Muspratt, 12 Moore, 231 ; <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>8 Conn. R. 319 ; <em>Dunlop </em>&amp; <em>Meigs </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>5 Cow. 243 ; <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Rich, </em>1 Wend, 380 ; <em>Brook </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>13 Price, 667 ; <em>Archer </em>v. Hubbell, 4 Wend. 517, note ; 1 Johns. Cases, 269, note a.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">IY. The separate acts and conversations of individual defendants were admitted in evidence against all to sustain this action, notwithstanding repeated objections and exceptions. This was totally unwarranted in law, and the verdict must be set aside. To admit this evidence a conspiracy must have been assumed to have been declared on and proved, which is an entire error. (1.) This is not an action for conspiracy, but case for malicious prosecution. The declaration contains no count for conspiracy. (2.) If it were such an action, the conspiracy \u2014the unlawful wicked combination\u2014must first be made out against the defendants, to be charged, before the separate individual acts of one, can become evidence against the other. And in this case no conspiracy had been proved. In prosecutions for' conspiracies, it is an established rule that <em>where several persons are proved to have combined together for the same illegal purpose, </em>any act done by one party <em>in pursuance of the original concerted plan, </em>and with <em>reference to the common object, </em>is in contemplation of law, as well as in sound reason, the act of the whole party ; and <em>therefore </em>the proof of such act will be evidence against any of the others <em>who were engaged in the same general conspiracy, </em>without regard to the question whether the prisoner <em>is proved to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>have been concerned in that particular transaction. </em>1 Phill. Ev. 94, (chap. 5, sec. 4.) The acts or declarations of a supposed agent or joint conspirator cannot be received in evidence until proof <em>has been first given </em>to establish the agency or combination. (The <em>People </em>v. Parish, 4 Denio, 153 ; <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Sturtevant, </em>18 Wend. 353.) The rule has never been carried further than that when a common design has been proved, the <em>acts </em>of one in furtherance of the design are evidence against his associates ; but the <em>declarations </em>of one can be received only against himself. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Poll &amp; Lavinia, </em>Sup. Court N. C., 1 Hawks, 492.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-4\">V. The indictments pending against the plaintiff on the very charges for the prosecution of which he complains, were improperly excluded by the circuit judge. (1.) They were admissible for the purpose of showing the prosecution not yet terminated, an absolute determination and end of the prosecution being indispensably necessary to the sustaining of this suit. The prosecution which is charged to be malicious, must be shown to have been determined ; <em>otherwise it'may possibly happen that the plaintiff may recover in the action, and yet if the prosecution is not determined, may be afterwards convicted of the original charge. </em>(2 Phil. Ev. p. 254, chap. 17.) The reason for this rule is given by Lord C. J. Parker, in the case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>(10 Mod. 209,) that if the suit be not determined, the plaintiff <em>may recover in the action for malicious prosecution, and yet be afterwards convicted of </em>the original charge. <em>(Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 Term R. 228 ; See also <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Barstow, </em>1 Dong. 215 ; <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Hall, 2 </em>Barn. &amp; Adolph. 695 ; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>2 Code Reporter, 51.) An indictment on a charge dismissed by a justice is in the nature of an appeal from the justice\u2019s decision. And an appeal is a <em>continuation </em>of the same suit. <em>(Burt </em>v. <em>Place, </em>4 Wend. 598 ; Quoted in <em>Gorton </em>v. <em>De Angelis, </em>6 Wend. 420.) (2.) The indictments were admissible as tending to show probable cause for the prosecutions. A true bill found, constitutes a presumption of probable cause. (See <em>Whitworth </em>v. <em>Hall, 2 </em>Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Adolph. 695 ; 22 Com. L. Rep. 173 ; Per Parke, J.) Where brandy was-condemned by sub-commissioners of. excise, held this showed <em>probable cause, </em>although the condemnation was reversed by the commissioners on appeal, and the defendant had judgment. (2 <em>Esp. Nisi Prius, </em>122.) So as to an inquisition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>lunacy. <em>(Osterhout </em>v. <em>Shoemaker and another, </em>3 Hill, 513 ; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Denman, </em>6 Wend. 497 ; <em>Matter of Christie, </em>5 Paige, 242.) So as to the finding of a sheriff\u2019s jury. <em>(Bayley </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>8 Johns. R. 186 ; <em>Van Cleef and others </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>15 J. R. 147 ; See also <em>Savil </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>1 Salk. Rep. 14, 15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-5\">VI. - The evidence of causes of action arising in Rockland county was improperly received.

The parol evidence of the proceedings by Justice Gurnee, and his discharge of the plaintiff, without production of the justice\u2019s minutes, or accounting for them, was inadmissible, and should have been excluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b109-7\">VIII. On the motion for non-suit, the circuit judge erred. (1.) He erred in refusing to say that, as to any of the defendants, the cause of action was not made out. (2.) He erred in deciding, by overruling the defendants\u2019 objections, that the plaintiff had established the want of probable cause for the prosecutions. The plaintiff had not shown want of probable cause. Qn the contrary, probable cause sufficiently appeared when the plaintiff rested. And the plaintiff should have been non-suited. (3.) He erred in excluding the evidence of indictments pending and thereby holding that such indictments had <em>no tendency to show probable cause, </em>while a discharge by a justice of the peace was sufficient <em>proof of the want of it, </em>and also holding in substance and effect that the plaintiff could recover for the prosecution of a charge, which was not legally determined, on which he was indicted and liable to be convicted and sentenced. Both which propositions are submitted to be utterly untenable upon principle or authority. (4.) He erred in holding that the plaintiff had made sufficient proof of malice in the legal meaning of the term. There was no such palpable want of probable cause as to authorize the jury to find malice. Malice is not spite or enmity, but a corrupt intent to do wrong and work an injury for an unjust motive. <em>(Cohen </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>6 Dowl. &amp; Ryl. 8 ; 2 <em>Greenleaf on Ev., </em>sect. 367 ; 3 <em>Steph. Nisi Prius, </em>2278 ; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>5 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ad. 588 ; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Chaters, </em>2 B. &amp; P. 121 ; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>White, </em>4 Tyrrwhit's R. 800.) And in this action express malice must be proved. <em>(Scheibel </em>v. <em>Fairbairn, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 388 ; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Chaters, </em>supra ; <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>1 Camp. 202 n. ; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Law, </em>1 Peters\u2019 C. C. R. 207 ; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra ; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Jacob, </em>1 Mood. <em>&amp;, </em>Malk. 180.) And for want of such proof in this case the plaintiff should have been non-suited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-5\">IX. The circuit judge erred, to the great prejudice of the defendants, in instructing the jury that a prompt discharge by the magistrate, without' calling witnesses for the accused, was evidence of want of probable cause, and would supply the absence of proof of malice, and apparently throwing the whole burden of proof on the defendants in such a case. This is not the law. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Macdonald, </em>3 Esp. R. 7 ; <em>Gorton </em>v. <em>De Angelis, </em>6 Wend. 418 ; <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Law, </em>1 Peters\u2019 C. C. R. 207 ; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>6 Dowl. &amp; Ryl. 8 ; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>1 Moody <em>&amp; </em>M. 180 ; <em>Purcell </em>v. <em>Macnamara, </em>9 East 361 ; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Alpine, </em>1 Camp. 204 n. ; <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Dunbar, </em>1 Camp. 202 n.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-6\">X. The circuit judge erred in declining to charge as requested by defendants\u2019 counsel: \u201c that probable cause was the existence of such facts and circumstances as would lead the mind of a reasonable man (not a lawyer) in the exercise of ordinary judgment and caution to suspect the plaintiff to be guilty, or to conclude that the question of his guilt or innocence ought to be investigated.\u201d <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>17 Wend. 233 <em>; Dupont </em>v. <em>Munro, </em>3 Wash. C. C. R. 31 ; <em>Foshay </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>2 Denio 617.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-7\">XI. The circuit judge erred in refusing to charge as requested, that probable cause could be made out on less evidence than would establish a <em>prima, facie </em>case of guilt. If this is not so, no one can complain of a crime without employing counsel, and that precaution would not necessarily insure his protection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">XII. The judge erred in charging the jury that no facts could avail the defendants to make out probable cause, except such facts as they could and did show were known or communicated to them at the time of making the charge. If this be so, an avowed felon may pocket damages for the prosecution of the felony which he avows and admits. <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>17 Wend. 229, 231, 233 ; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Barstow, </em>1 Doug. 215 ; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>10 Mon. 209 ; <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 Term R. 228.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">XIII. The circuit judge clearly erred in declining to charge the jury that \u201c the bad character of the plaintiff, if proved to the satisfaction of the jury, was to be taken into considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tion upon the question whether there was probable cause : as a man of bad character may be reasonably suspected upon slighter grounds than a man of good character.\u201d It is submitted to be well settled law, that such- evidence is admissible upon the merits as well as upon the' question of damages. It was not offered in mitigation of damages. Where the charge against the plaintiff was for felony, the defendant has been allowed in his defence, after giving some evidence of probable cause, <em>to prove the general bad character </em>of the plaintiff; for in this case, where the point in issue is whether the defendant acted from malice, and without probable cause, it may be thought material to inquire into the situation of the parties, and <em>whether the defendant had any reasonable ground for suspecting the plaintiff. Now the notoriety of the plaintiff\u2019s character for dishonesty is a circumstance of general suspicion not to be disregarded.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">(2 <em>Phil. Ev. </em>258, ch. 17.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">XIV. If the plaintiff was arrested on divers charges of felony, and probable cause was made out for one of the felonies for which he was arrested, he could not maintain this action. There was sufficient cause for his arrest and prosecution on the one charge thus sustained, and he has no wrong or damage to attribute to the other charges, rather than the one sustained. The circuit judge erred in declining so to charge. A different charge would probably have produced a different verdict, as all the prosecutors of the charge for concealing Andros were acquitted by the jury, and upon the evidence that charge was' most clearly sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">XY. The circuit judge erred in leaving it \"as a prominent question for the jury whether the defendants believed the plaintiff guilty. There were no facts in evidence to impeach the good faith of the charges. In the absence of proof to the contrary, the defendants were entitled to the benefit of the presumption that they believed the facts sworn to. <em>(Foshay </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>2 Denio, 617, 620, 621; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>1 Camp. 549, in notes.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">XYI. Every objection to the refusal to non-suit, applies with greater force to the final charge of the judge, after all the evidence was in. The defendants were entitled to a direction for a verdict in their favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>XVII. On the questions of <em>probable cause, </em>there were facts enough in evidence, undisputed in character, to determine the question in favor of the defendants. To the proof made by the defendants\u2019 own affidavits, (read by the plaintiff,) he (the plaintiff,) made no answer by countervailing proof. The question, then, was whether the depositions of Cram, Norris, Phebe Giles, Mrs. Wakeman, <em>&amp;c., </em>&amp;c, presented sufficient uncontradicted facts to make out probable cause. And this the court was bound to decide, but declined to do so. <em>(Murray </em>v. <em>Long, </em>1 Wend. 142 ; <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>14 Wend. 193 ; <em>Gorton </em>v. <em>De Angelis, </em>6 Wend. 421 ; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Deyo, </em>2 Wend. 424 ; <em>M\u2019Cormich </em>v. <em>Sisson, </em>7 Cow. 717 ; <em>Hill and wife </em>v. <em>Yates and another, </em>8 Taunt. 182.) The defendants had a right to read their own affidavits, if the plaintiff had not read them. <em>(Burt </em>v. <em>Place, 4 </em>Wend. <em>491 ; Burlinghame </em>v. <em>Burlinghame, </em>8 Cow. 141.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">And the warrant on which a party is committed is evidence (when read by plaintiff), of the facts contained in it. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>4 Wend. 555.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">XVIII. On the whole case, it is submitted that great injustice has been done, and that the defendants are entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>E. Sandford, </em>for the plaintiff, made and argued the following points :\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">I. The plaintiff proved, on the trial of this cause, the several prosecutions charged in the declaration. That they were instituted by the defendants, without probable cause, was manifest from the circumstances by which they were surrounded, and the plain perjury by which they were sought to be sustained ; and that the defendants were actuated by a malicious motive, \u201c <em>to put the plaintiff out of the way,\u201d </em>because of his disclosures relative to the frauds of the Kidd Salvage Company, establishing beyond controversy the fact that the defendants were not actuated by a love of public justice in making the arrests and prosecutions. 1. The multiplicity of the charges, presented at extraordinary junctures, taken in connexion with the other events occurring about the same time, show the absence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>probable cause and malice. 2. Probable cause is a reasonable belief, supported by circumstances, that the person accused is guilty of the offence charged. It depends upon the knowledge or information which the prosecutor had at the time the charge was made, and not upon that which he may have acquired at a subsequent period. <em>(Delegal </em>v. <em>Highly, </em>3 Bing. N. C. 950 ; <em>Seibert </em>v. <em>Price, </em>3 Watts and Serg. 438 ; <em>Fashay </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>2 Denio, 617.) 3. Mere suspicion, unaccompanied by proof from which the jury might infer that the party acted, in good faith, upon it, to establish the complaint, was not sufficient probable cause, and the charge of the judge to that effect was correct and legal. 4. Facts and circumstances not known to the defendants before, nor communicated to them at the time of making the complaint, could not furnish them with probable cause. The party charged, being innocent, the object of the party complaining, in showing probable cause, is to show that he had acted <em>in good faith. </em>His good faith cannot be evinced by proving circumstances which were unknown to him. 5. The defendants in this suit were not warranted in giving in evidence the character of the plaintiff, to establish his guilt or their \u25a0 innocence, in respect to the prosecution ; and, of course, it was not admissible to show probable cause on their part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">II. This action is founded on a tort, and the proof of part in itself amounting to a cause of action is sufficient to entitle him. to a verdict. Therefore, proof of probable cause in respect to part would not bar the cause of action in respect to other parts, and the charge on this point Avas legal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">III. The proof of a conspiracy in a civil suit is and may be different from and slighter than what is requisite in an indictment ; and, therefore, the refusal of the judge to charge that the evidence in the two cases should be the same, was correct and <em>legal. </em>'The exceptions in regard to venue are not well taken. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">1. The action of malicious prosecution is transitory. (1 Gilb. C. P. 84 ; Tidd\u2019s Prac. 369, 543; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 269, 270 ; 2 ib. 602, in notes ; 3 Black. Com. 294; Com. D. Act N. 12 ; Bac. Ab. act local and transitory ; Paine and Duer\u2019s Prac. 1, 85; Gra. Prac. 3d Ed. 310-313, 590-598; Co. Lit. 282; Cro. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Car. 443; 1 Wils. 336; 1 Camp. 161; <em>Rafael </em>v. <em>Verelot, </em>2 Sir William Black, Rep. 1058; <em>Glen </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>9 Johns. Rep. 67; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>14 Johns. Rep. 134; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>17 Wend. 323; <em>Lister </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>2 Hill, 320.) It is not an action of trespass or assault and battery, or for any immediate wrong accompanied with force, but for an injury to the feelings and reputation, as well as the property of the plaintiff, expended in his defence. 2. <em>For </em>the arrest and ironing, the actions for malicious arrest and assault and battery lie. This is an action for a prosecution, according to the forms of law, but with malicious motives, and without any justifiable cause, <em>(Sutton </em>v. <em>Johnstone, </em>1 Term. R. 544.) There is no similitude or analogy between an action of trespass or false imprisonment and this kind of action. An action of trespass is for the defendant\u2019s having done that which, upon the stating of it, is manifestly illegal. This kind of action is for a prosecution which, upon the stating of it, is manifestly legal. (Per Lords Mansfield and Loughborough, in <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>1 Term. Rep. 544.) 2. The statute refers to immediate injuries, accompanied with force, in the subdivision which prescribes the place of trial, i. e. trespass, assault and battery; for, in the next subdivision, actions of libel and slander are made transitory, and it is presumed that the legislature intended to place all actions for injuries to the reputation upon the same footing, as they add the-expression, \u201c and all other actions for wrongs, and upon contracts, shall be tried where the venue shall be laid. (2 R. S. 3 Ed. p. 506, \u00a7 2, Sub. 3.) 3. This is not a statute of venue at all. It does not draw the distinction between transitory and local actions ; but leaves it as it was settled by the practice of the court. It merely prescribes the place of trial, where the court, on motion, will direct the cause to go, and the revisors did not intend to affect the. venue or locality of actions, but merely to prescribe by statute the duty of the court, i. e. to adopt the common law practice, and codify it. (6 Revisor\u2019s Notes, 44, referring to Revised Laws and Tidd\u2019s Pra. 543, \u201cVenue;\u201d 1 Paine and Duer, 85, 86, 89; 1 Gra. Prac. 3 Ed. 310, 313, 590, 598.) See the distinction between venue and place of trial, <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Chaplin, </em>(4 Howard\u2019s Pr. Rep. 185.) And by the old practice this and all kindred actions were transitory, (1 CMtt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Pl. 229 to 273 ; 1 Tidd's Pr. 543.) 4. This is an action for conspiracy. An action for conspiracy may be brought in either the county where the defendants conspired, or where the overt act was committed, so an indictment lies in either county. In this case the agreement was in New York, and the overt acts both in New York and Rockland Counties. (1 Sellon, Prac. 244, citing Cro. Eliz. 574; Bulwer\u2019s Case, 7 Coke, 3, a. like <em>The Mayor, </em>&amp;c., <em>of Berwick </em>v. <em>Evart Black ; Smith </em>v. <em>Cranshaw, </em>2 Rol. R. 559 ; <em>Boger </em>v. <em>Hildreth, </em>1 Caines, N. Y. T. R. 1 ; 1 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 269, 276 ; 2 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 602, in notes; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>4 Wend. 227, 265 ; 2 R. S. 3 Ed. p. 506, \u00a7 2, Sub. 3.) Conspiracy to commit a felony is merged in the felony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>4 Wend. 229 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vermilya </em>&amp; <em>Barker, </em>7 Cow.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>3 Denio, 190, S. C. 2 Comstock, 173.) But a conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is not merged in the misdemeanor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>4 Wend. 265.) 5. There was material and important evidence to establish the cause of action in the city and county of New York ; and, therefore, the same was properly laid there. (Tidd\u2019s Prac. 554 ; citing 1 Sid. 405 ; 2 Salk. 569 ; 12 Mod. 515; <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Underhill, </em>2 J. R. 374 ; <em>Bently </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>1 J.

The several exceptions in the case are respectively not well taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">VI. The charge of the Judge was conformable to law. The facts were numerous and conflicting, and such as rendered it impossible for the Judge to pass upon the questions of mere probable cause, as a mere matter of law. It was a mixed question of law and fact, and as such, was properly submitted to the Jury, under the instructions of the court, as to what constituted probable cause. The question of malice is always a question for the Jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">VII. The verdict of the Jury was conformable to the facts, and is conclusive upon the question of probable cause and the question of malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">VIII. The damages are not excessive, and the facts of this case would warrant the court in giving the plaintiff even larger damages than those awarded by the jury, were it in their power. The plaintiff was pursuing a lawful investigation in a lawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>way. He was engaged in developing the truth, with a view to aid in the administration of justice. But, whilst thus employed, he was seized by those to whom he was acting adversely, and ironed, imprisoned, and prosecuted, to prevent the development of frauds in which the defendants were supposed to have been implicated. Now, whether he were an entirely pure man or not, he ought to be protected, and the defendants, who have prostituted the process of the court, to wreak their vengeance upon a man whom they know to be innocent of the crimes they urged against him, ought not now to be permitted to urge that the jury have set an undue value upon his sufferings, and the loss of his reputation. <em>(Townsend, </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 Wend. 150 ; <em>Wilford v. Barkly, </em>1 Burr. 609 ; <em>Little </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>2 Black. R. 1327 ; <em>Gilbert v. Bertenshaw, </em>1 Camp. 230 ; 2 Wils. 405, <em>Redshaw </em>v. <em>Brooks ; Trumbull v.

That the separate acts and declarations of individual defendants ought not to have been admitted in evidence to charge other defendants, not then present; the allegations of a conspiracy contained in the declaration not being sustained by the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">2. That rejecting this evidence, there was an entire failure of proof as to the defendant, Freeland, and that the judge, therefore, erred, in not directing the jury to acquit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">3. That the judge erred in directing that the proof on the part of the plaintiff, was sufficient to sustain the first five counts of the declaration, and in not instructing the jury, that, upon the third, fourth, and fifth counts, all the defendants were entitled to an acquittal; the existence of a probable cause, in reference to the charges set forth in these counts, being conclusively established.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">4. That the judge erred in instructing the jury, that upon the question of malice, and in determining the amount of damages, they had a right to take into consideration the proceedings in Rockland county, anterior to the complaint before Mr. Justice Drinker ; since upon the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, these proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>established against some of the defendants a case of false-imprisonment, and ought, therefore, as constituting a distinct cause of action, for which those defendants might be rendered liable in another suit, to have been withdrawn entirely from the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">5. That the question of probable cause upon a given state of facts, is, in all cases, a question of law, and that the judge, therefore, erred in submitting it to the jury to determine whether the facts and circumstances in evidence afforded the defendants reasonable grounds for believing that the plaintiff was guilty of the offences which they laid to his charge; this was calling upon the jury not merely to pass upon the evidence, but to determine a question which the judge was, himself, bound to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">6. The judge also erred in shifting the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendants, by instructing the jury, that if the defendants acted upon information, the jury must be satisfied that they believed in its truth. The instruction should have been, that the jury was bound to presume that the defendants believed in the truth of the information upon which they acted, unless it clearly appeared from the evidence that the information was false, and that they knew it to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">7. That the court had no power to reform the verdict by limiting it to particular counts or particular defendants, and that being, as found, against law and evidence, it must be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
