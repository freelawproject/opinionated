S. part 3, chap. 8, title 8). The breach assigned, was that the defendants had refused to pay certain debts due to the plaintiff, which were a subsisting lien upon the vessel, when the attachment was issued. The complaint charged, that the debts in question, were contracted by Joseph Bishop and Jeremiah Simonson, ship builders, under the firm of Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simonson, and were due to the plaintiff for certain materials and articles, furnished by him towards the building of the vessel attached, of which the said Bishop &amp; Simonson, were averred to be the owners.

It denied that these materials and articles were delivered to he used and employed in and towards the building of the vessel, and averred that they were sold and delivered to Bishop &amp; Simonson generally, and upon their personal credit, and without any view to the reservation of a lien. It also averred that the plaintiff had received from Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simon-son their draft, or check, in full payment of his claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">The reply took issue upon the alleged payment, and averred that the materials and articles furnished by the plaintiff were delivered to be used and employed in and towards the building of the vessel, <em>and were, in fact, so used and employed. </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Upon these pleadings an order was made by consent, referring the cause to Alexander S.

I knew them in February and March, 1849. I inspected all the timber that came to the plaintiff, and sold it. It is cedar timber; the yards for it were in Cherry and Henry streets.\" Bishop and Simonson were ship-builders then ; .their yard adjoined Mr. Webb\u2019s between Lewis, 5th and 6th streets, and East River. There was a ship about being built in their yard, at that time not com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>menced. Bishop and Simonson came to me to buy cedar, and I sold them a bill on the 14th of February, 1849, of $330 53. I understood from the person who purchased the timber, it was to build a ship for the Mechanics\u2019 Mining Association. I understood it was to be called \u201cThe Mechanics\u2019 Own.\u201d Whether it was Bishop or Allaire his clerk who came when the first bill was sold, I can\u2019t remember. March 2d. Bishop himself came and purchased a bill of $127 74. I asked Bishop how he was getting along with the ship; he said he wanted some larger logs to finish up the frame. The person who made the first purchase told me the ship was for the gold country. Bishop and I talked about the shares in which she was to be owned or was owned. I was in the yard frequently. I saw her a dozen times while she was building. I saw the men chopping up the timber bought of the plaintiff to go into the frame, and I saw it in the frame. Cedar is used for the top timbers of a ship. I saw it used in this vessel\u2014as in all others\u2014for the top timbers. The Ohio had been built there, and we furnished timber for that ship. She was fit to launch, or nearly so, when this suit was commenced. She may have been launched, but I don\u2019t precisely remember. The frame is the early part of building before planking. I can\u2019t tell whether any other vessel was building or not in that. yard at that time. The terms of sale were for cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\"><em>Being </em>cross-examined, witness testified as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">I had sold Bishop and Simonson before for two or three ships, I think. I know I sold them for the Ohio and this ship. I was the only person who sold any cedar or timber for Phillips to Bishop and Simonson. I sold them for the Ohio, and the \u201c Mechanics\u2019 Own.\u201d I am an inspector of timber. I make the sale and inspect the timber, and make a return to Phillips. He enters it on his books. I deliver the bill and he collects the money. I enter in my books so many logs sold. February 14, I sold Bishop and Simonson 69 logs. I delivered the timber to Bishop and Simonson ; having reported to Phillips that I had sold the timber. Then I made my returns to Mr. Phillips of the sales of the day, among which was this, \u201c sold Bishop and Simonson the amount of the bill,\u201d &amp;c. I had sold them once before. I am not sure as to more. The Ohio was all planked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>up before this ship was commenced. The Ohio may have been launched before this one was begun, but I cannot sa.y positively. I never saw any of this timber used in any other ship. I know none of it was used aboard the Ohio. For a vessel of this size I generally sell one hundred and fifty logs. I do not mean to say I saw all this timber in this ship. I can recognise this timber when I see it. I cannot say how many logs I saw, but I should think I saw about the same we sold\u2014about the usual quantity. I can tell the difference between our timber and Florida and Texas timber with certainty. This is Tennessee cedar. I can tell Tennessee from Arkansas cedar. I never saw any bill made out by Phillips for-this timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b370-4\">This paper is a copy of the bills from Phillips\u2019 books, made for me, but not by me.

I purchased cedar of plaintiif, for my firm, on the 14th February, and 2d March, 1849. The articles charged in the bills marked 3 and 4, are of the same description as what I purchased, and the bills are for the articles purchased. I made the bargain with Mr. Bennet. I asked him the price of cedar timber of certain sizes, and got his answer, and engaged to take what we should require for a vessel which we were about to build. These things were bought upon our own credit, no credit was given to any one else. The principal part of the timber was used in the Mechanics\u2019 Own. As to the quantity, I told him as near as I could judge, and we were to take as many as we wanted, and as we wanted them, within or about the range of the quantity spoken of. The bills made out were sent us, and are there marked 3 and 4. Phillips took a check dated some days ahead, and gave the receipt. I don\u2019t know when the ship was named. She was called in the yard Mechanics\u2019 Own, at an early stage, but I don\u2019t know at what time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-6\"><em>Being Cross-Examined, </em>the witness testified as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">We had no other vessel in the yard for which we had occasion to buy cedar at the time of this purchase. We were not building any other. Her keel was 'laid about the date of the first of the bills, but I think a little after. We failed entirely, I think some time after the check fell due. I don\u2019t know when we made an assignment. I think it was in April. We were to take the timber as we should want it and send for it. He was to select out certain sized timber and put it in a pile. The only use for which we wanted it was for the vessel. The statement to him was made that we might get it without delay when we sent for it. The vessel I speak of is the one attached in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\"><em>Being Re-Examined </em>by defendants\u2019 counsel, the witness testified as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">I did not consider we were bound to put this timber to any particular use.

She was built by Bishop &amp; Simonson, under the superintendence of a committee of the Association. Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simonson made a contract with a <em>committee of the Association, in relation to the </em>building for the Mechanics\u2019 Mining Association, a ship of certain dimensions, &amp;c., for a certain price.

They had an article of association, but were not incorporated. They were in writing and printed. One copy was signed and sealed, and put in the register's office. Two copies were executed, one was to be deposited as aforesaid, and the other was retained by the officers of the Association.

The answer denies that Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simonson were the owners of the vessel, or agents, or that the demand against them was a subsisting lien on the vessel, and the onus lay upon the plaintiff, affirmatively, to prove that this debt was a lien. <em>(Wakeman </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>21 Wend. 206.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-10\">II. The statute (2 R. S. 493) does not contemplate or create a lien upon materials for a ship, or upon an incomplete vessel, but on a complete ship, ready for use and capable of sailing from the port (Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1,2,9,) and the \u201c owner,\u201d in \u00a7 1, means the person who is, or is to become the \u201c owner\u201d of the complete vessel, as distinguished from the builder or owner of the materials. And this has been so held in a case where the property in the materials did not pass until completion and acceptance. <em>(Hubbell </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>20 Wend. 182<em>; Van Pelt </em>v. <em>The Ohio, </em>U. S. Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>trict Court, Judson, D. J.; <em>Udall </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>same court (April, 1851), Betts, D. J.; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Hull of a New Brig, </em>1 Story C. C. R. 244; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>a New Brig, </em>Gilpin, 536, 540, 550).</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-5\">III. But in this case the evidence showed that the vessel was built for the association under their superintendence, and was in their possession, so as to belong to them as fast as completed, at the time the plaintiff\u2019s demands accrued, and that Bishop &amp; Simonson had been paid in advance. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>5 B. and Ald. 942; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>4 Ad. and Ellis 448; Addison on Contracts, pp. 45 and 762.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">IY. The materials furnished by the plaintiff were not furnished \u201c towards the building of this vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">1. The demands were not <em>\u201c </em>contracted for this vessel,\u201d but the materials were furnished without any designation of their purpose, or reliance on the credit of the vessel. And the plaintiff ought to have been non-suited for this reason. <em>(Van Pelt </em>v. <em>the Ohio, ubi supra, </em>and the Statute, 2 R. S. 494, \u00a7 4.) And the referee erred in excluding the further evidence offered. (Ante, p. 352.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">2. A part only of these materials went into this vessel. If the materials had been sold expressly for and charged to this vessel, the plaintiff could not have had a lien for the part not used in the vessel. <em>(Udall </em>v. <em>the Ohio, ubi supra; Johnson </em>v. <em>the Sandusky, </em>5 Wend. 510; <em>Crooke </em>v. <em>Stack, </em>20 Wend. 177; <em>Veltman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>3 Comst. 438.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-9\">3. But in the present case the only evidence that the plaintiff furnished to show that the debt was \u201c contracted for this vessel,\u201d was that some of them were used in this vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\">The plaintiff was bound to show affirmatively how much went into the vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-11\">Y. The plaintiff, if he ever had any lien, discharged it by looking to Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simonson\u2019s individual credit, and giving them time by taking their post dated check. <em>(Myers </em>v. <em>Welles, </em>5 Hill 463; <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>14 Wend. 201.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-12\">The judgment of the special term ought to be reversed with costs, and the referee\u2019s report set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-13\"><em>Wm. M. Evarts, </em>for plaintiff, argued as follows :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-14\">. I. The facts necessary to constitute a lien under the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>in this case, were (1,) that a debt of fifty dollars or more should have been contracted in this state by the owner of the vessel, (2,) on account of materials furnished in this state, for or towards building such vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-5\">These facts the referee found in favor of the lien, and in pursuance of the 18th section of the title referred to, reported for the amount of the plaintiff's claim (2 R. S. p. 496, \u00a7 18).</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">II. That there was substantial evidence in support of these facts, appears on the face of the case; and there being such evidence, the court will not review the referee\u2019s finding of matters of fact upon such evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-7\">III. The evidence fully sustains his finding of facts, and admits of no other result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">IV. Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simons on buying materials in their own name, and upon their own liability, and therewith building a vessel, in their own yard, with their own labor, are, in law, <em>owners </em>of such vessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">That they were thus building such vesseljfor others upon contract is immaterial. If there existed a special contract, upon which the legal ownership of the vessel at the time, of these purchases from plaintiff could be brought into question, it should have been produced and proved. Such special quality or effect of the contract cannot be inferred (Abbott on Sh. p. 5; <em>Laidler </em>v. <em>Burlinson, </em>2 M. <em>&amp; </em>W. 602).</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-10\">Y. If the legal ownership of the vessel were in the purchaser or employer, yet the ship-builder in possession, buying materials for it, is to third persons in that behalf the agent of the owners, and a debt thus contracted by him, is contracted by the owners, his principals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-11\">YI. The fact of the non-application of a part of the materials bought for the vessel, to the building of the same, is immaterial. The <em>furnishing </em>of them <em>for </em>building the vessel is the foundation of the lien. The seller is not bound to look to their application, nor can the lien be impaired, by any subsequent act of the purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-12\">If material, the defendants gave no evidence upon which any abatement, on this account, from the plaintiff's claim, could have been made by the referee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-13\">VII. Who was owner when the attachment was levied, or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>any time subsequent to the contract, is immaterial; the lien ceases, or is divested, twelve days after the vessel\u2019s leaving the port, or immediately after its leaving the state, and not from change of ownership (2 R. S. p. 493, \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-5\">VII. The giving of credit to the purchaser does not prevent nor supersede the lien. The terms of the statute import a personal liability, and add a lien from the nature of the consideration of such liability.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-6\">Much less can a sale for cash impede or impair the lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-7\">IX. The post-dated check, drawn upon a bank without funds, given to the plaintiff, was a mere sham or fraud, and no more discharged the lien than it satisfied the debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b379-8\">X. The report of the referee should be confirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\"> The pleadings are lucid and concise, and may be useful as a precedent.

Thorn, their attorney, for answer to the complaint of the said James W.

Phillips,the plaintiff, to Bishop \u00bfSimonson generally and on their personal credit, and not with a view to reserving any lien, on the said hull or ship, and that the draft or check of the said firm of Bishop <em>&amp; </em>Simonson, was taken and received by the said plaintiff, for the amount of the purchase money of said materials or articles, as a payment in full of his said claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\"><em>The reply </em>of James W. Phillips, plaintiff, to the answer of the defendants in this action: The plaintiff denies, that the draft or check of Bishop &amp; Simonson, mentioned in the said answer, was taken, or received by him as a payment, or in full of his claims for the materials or articles in the complaint mentioned, and he avers that the materials and articles furnished by said plaintiff towards the building of said ship or vessel, as in said complaint mentioned, were delivered to -be used and employed in, and towards the building and construction of said ship or vessel, and were, as he is informed and believes, so used, and employed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b379-9\"><em>By </em>the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"AXJ\">Sandford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtI\">The proof that Bishop &amp; Simonson built the vessel, established presumptively the fact, that they were her owners. The evidence that she was built by them, for the Mechanics\u2019 Mining Association, under a contract, does not go far enough to rebut the presumption thus established. In the cases cited on this point, the contracts were produced, and the payments made from time to time to the builder, were fully shown. There is nothing in the evidence before us incompatible with the idea that Bishop &amp; Simonson were to continue the owners of the hull of this vessel, until their work was completed, and the price fully paid. As we cannot anticipate what the case will be when the contract is introduced and evidence given of the payments made by the association, we forbear expressing any opinion as to the question Of ownership, beyond that already stated upon the facts as they now appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The defendants contend that the statute does not create a lien upon an incomplete or unfinished ship ; that she must be complete, ready for use, and capable of sailing from port, in order to be a ship or vessel, within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">We cannot accede to this proposition. The occasion for enforcing a lien for work and materials towards the <em>building </em>of a vessel, arises quite as frequently before she is finished, as it does after that event, and a construction, limiting the lien to the case of vessels completed, would deprive of its benefit a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>class of cases, as deserving of protection as any provided for in the act. Indeed, the effect would be to defeat the statute in respect of the building of vessels, for it would become a general practice, to transfer and remove a ship before she was finished, whenever the builder is likely to stop payment, or is embarrassed in his affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The practice under the statute has long proceeded on the assumption that it contemplated unfinished, as well as complete, vessels ; and we believe that, in the ordinary use of the word, the term <em>ship </em>or <em>vessel </em>is applied, and properly applied, to the structure or frame, as soon as it assumes the shape or form of a ship or vessel. We hear the expression, \u2018\u2018 a ship on the stocks,\u201d constantly applied to ships, in all stages of their construction, and we think the statute intended to adopt the common meaning of the words used in it. Therefore, the fact that the ship in question was unfinished, when the attachment issued, does not affect the plaintiff\u2019s claim for a lien under the act. .</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The next ground of defence is, that the materials furnished by the plaintiff, were not furnished \u201c towards the building\u201d of this vessel, but were furnished to Bishop &amp; Simonson, generally, for their business, without any designation of their purpose, or reliance upon the credit of the vessel. Also, that a part only of his materials, went into this vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">As to the first branch of the objection, the referee has found that the timber, for which the plaintiff claims, was furnished by him to Bishop &amp; Simonson, as materials for, or towards the building of this ship, and that no term of credit was given to Bishop &amp; Simonson, for the price. The evidence fully sustains the fact, that the timber was furnished for this particular ship ; and, although, as in every case, the material man charged the price to Bishop &amp; Simonson, looked to them for payment, and thus gave them credit for the same, this does not conflict with his also looking to the vessel, and relying uporn the statute lien as his security.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">But it does appear, and so the referee states, that a part of tlie timber so furnished, was not used in this vessel ; some of it was sold by Bishop and Simonson\u2019s assignees, and it is probable some went for the repair of other vessels. The plaintiff insists that this non-application of the timber to the building of this ves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>sel, for which it was bought, is immaterial; that the statute confers the lien when it is sold and delivered for building- the vessel, without regard to its actual application for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">We do not think that this position is a sound one. The whole theory of a lien for labor and materials rests upon the basis, that such labor and materials have entered into, and contributed to the production or equipment of the thing upon which the lien is impressed. This imposes on the material man the necessity of seeing to it, that his materials are applied to the purpose for which they are procured, if he design to rely upon a lien given to him, by reason of such purpose. The laborer makes the application himself, and hence the difficulty does not extend to'hia case. If the law were, as the plaintiff contends, it would produce inextricable confusion. A ship builder, in doubtful credit, would buy lumber and materials sufficient for building a ship, from several distinct persons. He would buy them for a particular ship designated, and each material man would sell to' him \u201c for or towards the building\u201d of that ship. He would sell some of the materials thus acquired, and use some in building or repairing other ships. Which of these material men is to have a lien ? Or are all entitled to a lien, amounting in the aggregate, to several times the value of the materials which actually entered into the construction of the ship ; thus, probably, totally displacing, or reducing to a small proportion, the lien of laborers, sail makers, &amp;c., whose work and supplies were used in the building of the ship ?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It is very apparent that such an interpretation of the statute would lead to its complete defeat, as far as any praiseworthy object is to be effected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Under the act of 1198, (1 R. L. 130,) which, among other things, gave a lien for supplies, furnished for, or towards the fitting, furnishing, or equipping of a ship or vessel, the late supreme court, in deciding that fuel supplied to a steamboat did not come within the act, placed it on the ground that the supplies contemplated by the act must be such as enter into the construction or equipment of a vessel, and become a part of her, as distinguished from such articles as are daily consumed, and constantly replaced. The court apparently assume that to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>stitute a lieu, the articles must, at all events, go into the vessel, or. be used in or about it, and not merely be furnished for that object, although used for some other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">It may well be doubted, whether a literal interpretation of the words of the statute (2 R. S. 493), confer a lien, unless the articles furnished are actually used in the building, &amp;c., of the vessel against which it is claimed. Can it be said that materials are furnished <em>for, or towards building </em>a ship, when no part of them enter into, or become a part of, the ship ? They may be furnished <em>for the purpose of </em>being thus applied, but is that the same thing as being furnished <em>for the ship ? </em>In other words, does not the idea of furnishing an article for, or towards the building of a ship, embrace as well its application\u2018to, or in the ship, as its procurement for that object ? I may buy an article of furniture, for the purposes of my library, and with a full intention of placing it there, and then change my mind, and sell it to another. Can it be said that such article was bought for, or towards furnishing my library ?</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">This doubt, and our conviction that the spirit of the act does not warrant its extension to materials bought for, but never used, in the building of a designated vessel, make it our duty to hold, that for the timber which did not enter into the construction of the ship in question, the plaintiff had no lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">This interpretation of the statute imposes no undue hardship upon material men. The act gives them a privilege over all general creditors, on 1he footing, that the articles furnished by them, have contributed to the making of the ship, against which it is claimed. It is certainly not asking too much, that they shall look to the application of what they furnish, if they intend to create the statutory lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">It was incumbent on the plaintiff to prove the extent of his lien. He did not prove it to the amount allowed to him by the referee, and we must therefore set aside the report, and order a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
