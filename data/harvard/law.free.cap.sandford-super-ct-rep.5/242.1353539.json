' On -his cross-examination, -he-said he had lodged there before ; that it was customary to - pay for lodgings and other things as you got \u25a0 them; that he cotild -not'say whether he had-stayed there-more than one-night -before; he paid for each meal as he got it, and for his -night\u2019s \u2022 lodgings as he got them <em>; that -he did not remember that he saw Bis'trunk when he paid his'- bill-in-, the morning, nor-that Be then -said- that </em>\u2022 <em>he </em>- <em>would </em>\u25a0 <em>return. </em>His direct - \u25a0 examination - being,- re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>sumed, he testified that he did not pay the witness, Clark, at all, on the morning of the 13th day of March, that he paid the defendant in person for his lodging, in. silver, .a two shilling piece. Nobody else was then by.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">The plaintiff then re-called <em>Burr </em>Clark, who testified <em>that defendant keeps lodgers </em>and boards by the plate, that persons can come there and lodge without having meals ; can stay without paying at the time ; there is no such custom as that of paying for things when one gets them, except that persons' usually paid for the articles ordered for their meals at the time\u00a1 eaeh article being a separate charge ; am positive that I saw him go to the trunk, that it was there at the time he paid his bill, <em>and that Sandford said he was going out of town, and should not return ; </em>I directed Sandford to set the trunk down the night before; Sand-ford was not there in the afternoon to my knowledge; I cannot say whether the trunk was there when I returned; I did not look for it; I came back in about half an hour, he was not there when I returned ; he recollects that the young man was there before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-6\">When the testimony was closed, the judge charged the jury that upon the evidence the defendant must be regarded as a common innkeeper, and that the only question for their determination was, whether the trunk had been taken by Sandford Wintermute, since, if they believed it had been taken by any other person, even after Sandford had paid his bill, the defendant was liable. That as it was clearly proved that the trunk had been placed in the charge of the defendant, the burden of proving its restoration rested upon him, and consequently unless the jury believed that Sandford had taken the trunk with the fraudulent intent of charging its loss upon the defendant, and was guilty of perjury in swearing that he had not taken it, they must find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-7\">To each and every portion of this charge the counsel for the-, defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-8\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $55, for which sum, with costs, judgment was duly entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-9\"><em>C. </em>N. <em>Potter, </em>for the appellant (the deft.).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-10\">The defendant was not a common innkeeper, for the proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>definition of an inn is a house for the reception of travellers \u2022only, or, if other guests are received, it is only in favor of travellers that the common law liability of an innkeeper attaches, and Sandford Wintermute was not a traveller. The counsel cited <em>Thompson </em>v. Lacy, 3 B. &amp; Ald. 283; 2 Lord Raymond 867; 3 Hill. 491; Story on Bailments, \u00a7\u00a7. 475, 477 ; Bacon\u2019s Abridg. Title Inn (C.), 1, 3, 5, 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">If this point is against me, still, upon other grounds, the plaintiff was not entitled to a verdict. The young Wintermute was not the guest of the defendant when the loss happened ; he \u2022had paid his bill and gone away with the intention of not returning. The relation between him and the defendant, and with it the liability of the defendant as an innkeeper, had wholly ceased, and it is only as an innkeeper that he is, or can be charged. If the delivery of the trunk was necessary to be proved, it was sufficiently proved by the testimony of Burr Clark. In addition to the authorities before cited, the counsel referred, to 1 Salk. 388; 5 Term R. 213: 9 Wend. 114; 5 Barb S. C. R. 560; 10 Metcalf 472.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-6\"><em>J. Anthon, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">The admissions in the answer, and the unquestioned testi mony in the case, justified the judge in his charge that the defendant was an innkeeper. On this point, two of the cases cited by my learned opponent, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>3 B. &amp; Ald. 283; and <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>5 Barb. 560, are direct authorities in our favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-8\">In all other respects the charge of the judge was correct. The material issue made by the pleadings was the actual restoration of the trunk, and of this there was no proof whatever. The judge was therefore right, in saying that the only question to be determined by the jury, was whether the trunk had been taken by young Wintermute, for, if taken by a stranger, the defendant was certainly liable.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"AbB\">Oakley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5E\">In order to charge the defendant as an innkeeper, it was not necessary to prove that it was only for the reception of travellers that his house was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>kept open. It was sufficient to prove that all who came were received as guests, without any previous agreement as to the duration of their stay or the terms of, their entertainment, and such was the proof actually given. There may be a distinction between the liability of the keeper of an inn and of a mere boarding-house, where transient persons are not received at all, and none are received but for a certain time and upon certain terms. But it is not pretended that' the defendant\u2019s house was a mere boarding-house. It was a public house of entertainment for all who chose to visit it, which is the true definition of an inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It is plain, however, that the liability of an innkeeper, as such, in any particular case, continues no longer than the continuance of the relation between him and the guest. That relation ceases, when the guest pays his bill and leaves the house,, with the declared intention of not returning. In such a case it is at his own peril, we apprehend, that he leaves his baggage or other property behind him. The innkeeper has a right to believe that he has taken it with him, and is, therefore, no longer responsible for its safe keeping, unless it is specially committed to his charge ; and then, only, as an ordinary bailee. His common law liability is at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Whether young Wintermute, in the case before us, had not ceased to be the guest of the defendant, before the trunk was lost, and, consequently, whether the liability of the defendant for its safe keeping, had not then ceased, was a question that directly arose upon the evidence, and which, therefore, as the turning question in the cause, ought to have been submitted to the jury. That it was, in fact, submitted, is not asserted, and the charge of the judge, as stated in the case, clearly shows that it was not. To repair this omission, a new trial must be granted, and an opportunity thus be given to the defendant, of obtaining the verdict, to which, under a proper direction, a jury may think him entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">It has occurred to us, that there is a difficulty in the way of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, which, it is proper, should be stated, for the consideration of the counsel. It seems to have been conceded, upon the trial, that as Wintermute, the son, was a minor, the property in the trunk, and its contents, was vested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>father,-in whose name,-therefore,-this suit wasproperly brought, \u25a0 but, whether this concession' was necessary to have- made/We 'think, may b\u00e9- seriously- doubted. The'son whsnoTbnger a member of his' father\u2019s family, but had left- his home With the intention of providing for his own support; and whether, under these circumstances, the father continued to be the owner of the\u2019 wearing apparel, and Other articles; which the son' had been permitted\" to take With him, for his own- exclusive'use,-is a question, that may' deserve to b\u00e9 considered.-</p>\n<author id=\"b268-4\">Duer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ1\">The grounds of the charge, which I gave to the jury, were, that, under the pleadings,-the defendant wgs bound to prove, affirmatively1,- the- redelivery df the trunk,- and that' the requisite proof of this fact, had' not been given: I am U'oW satisfied,-that there was evidence, from Which, the jury, if they credited'the defendant\u2019s Witness, would have been-warranted'to infer the fact of a red\u00e9livery, and consequently, that'the question ought' to have been submitted t'o the jury. If is upon' this ground; that 1 concur in granting a tiew trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The difficulty,-which the Chief Justice has suggested, as to the right of the plaintiff, to maintain this action, I am inclined to think-, will not be overcome,- unless, .upon' the next trial, further and mofe satisfactory evidence- of the ownership of the father shall be given. As the- case stands,-the prestimption; it seems' to me, is\" against his title:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Judgment reversed: and' new trial granted', with costs to abide the \u00e9vent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
