It appeared, from the affidavit read, that in <em>September, </em>1818, l^e plaintiff filed a bill in the Court of Chancery against the defendant and <em>Benjamin Sherman, </em>for the purpose of having * i <em>a </em>a decree for the allowance of \u00e1 set-off on a bond executed . . by the plaintiff and his two brothers to the defendant, and by him assigned to <em>Sherman. </em>The set-off consisted of a demand for a large quantity of pork, hams, &amp;c. alleged to have been sold by <em>Stebbins </em>to <em>Grant </em>in the spring of 1815. The Chancellor dismissed the bill with costs, on the ground, among others, that a general settlement had taken place between <em>Grant </em>and <em>Stebbins </em>of their partnership transactions, in which the <em>pork, lard, </em>&amp;c. sought to be set off, had been included. <em>Stebbins </em>appealed ; and the Court of Errors, at its last session, affirmed the decree, with costs, including one hundred dollars extra costs, adjudged by that Court, and also the costs in the Court of Chancery, taxed in <em>April </em>last, at 475 dollars, which had not been paid, <em>Stebbins </em>being insolvent. Since the decision of the Court ol Errors, <em>Stebbins </em>brought the present action in this Court, tc recover for a quantity of pork, hams, &amp;c. which was alleged in the affidavit to be the same pork, hams, &amp;c. which had been the subject of litigation in the suit in the Court oi Chancery.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\n<em>Oakley</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axue\">cited 2 <em>Bl.
