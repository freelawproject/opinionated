On the 7th of <em>April, </em>1817, the Bank of <em>JYew-York, </em>in which the note was lodged, received from the Assignees of <em>Bostwick </em>and <em>Sterling </em>payment of the note, which had been charged to them in account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9e\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\"The defendant gave in evidence his. discharge under the inso{vent act} dated the 6th of February, 1818, which was objected to, because no notice of it bad accompanied the plea \u00b0f the general issue; but the judge overruled the objection. The plaintiffs then gave in evidence an agreement, dated the 13th of February, 1818, executed by J. <em>Haggerty </em>and <em>W. Cairns, </em>which recited, that, whereas they, <em>Haggerty </em>and <em>Cairns, </em>as acting assignees of the estate and effects of <em>Boslwick </em>and <em>Sterling, </em>were holders of a certain note, (being the one above described,) 8ic., and whereas the said <em>F. Doremus, </em>on a certain compromise made with him, on the 9th day of <em>August, </em>gave to them, <em>H. </em>and C., as assignees. See. four promissory notes of fifty-three dollars each, payable in three, six, nine, and twelve months, all of which were endorsed by <em>N. Weed, </em>and two of them paid as they became due respectively, and had paid the costs of a suit against <em>Doremus </em>and <em>Wilbur </em>on the said note, and the costs, also, of another suit against <em>A. Ogden </em>and <em>Co., </em>also endorsers on the said note; and whereas the said <em>R. Wilbur </em>had given to them, <em>H. </em>and <em>C., </em>as assignees, &amp;e. his promissory note for four hundred and thirty-nine dollars and twelve cents, payable in six mouths, endorsed by <em>N. </em>and <em>H. Weed; </em>they, the said <em>Haggerty </em>and <em>Cairns, </em>in consideration of the premises, &amp;c. accepted the said two notes of <em>Doremus, </em>which had not yet become payable, and the said note of <em>Wilbur, </em>in full satisfaction and discharge of the said note of <em>Davison, Day, </em>and <em>Pierson, </em>above described, and which they thereby assigned to .the said <em>Doremus </em>and <em>Wilbur </em>for their own benefit. It appeared that a <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued on the 31st of <em>December, </em>1817, on a judgment recovered against <em>Doremus </em>and <em>Wilbiir, </em>as endorsers of the above mentioned note ; that <em>Wilbur, </em>who was taken on the <em>ca. sa. </em>was discharged by the attorney of the plaintiff in the suit, who thereupon endorsed on the execution, \u201c Satisfied the 12th of <em>January, </em>1818,\u201d and the sheriff also endorsed it satisfied; and it was returned and filed, <em>January </em>the 18th, 18-18.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\"><em>Wilbur, </em>at this time, resided in <em>Neiv-Jersey, </em>and carried on business on his own account, and <em>Doremus </em>was living as clerk, with a merchant in <em>New-York.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>A verdict was taken for the plaintiffs, for seven hundred and eighteen dollars and eighty-one cents, subject to the opinion of the Court, on a case containing the facts above stated*</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-4\"><em>R. Sedgwick, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARY2\">1. The notes given by <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>were accepted by <em>H. </em>and C. as payment, and are, therefore, to be considered as so much money paid. <em>(Cuming </em>v. <em>Hackley, </em>8 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>202. 206. <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Root, </em>11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>484. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>518. <em>Service </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>90. 9 <em>Johns. Rep, </em>409. 15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>241.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">2. The suit is rightly brought in the names of <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>as they were partners when the endorsement of the original note was made; though the notes given in payment were made by <em>JJ. </em>alone. <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>Robertson, 2 Term Rep. </em>282.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-10\">3. The discharge of <em>W. </em>on a <em>ca. sa. </em>cannot affect the right of action in this case, as the payment of the notes was subsequent. <em>(Seymour </em>v. <em>Minturn, </em>17 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>169.) Besides, the attorney had no power to discharge <em>W. </em>from the execution, until the money was paid. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>8 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 361.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-12\"><em>Griffin, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azrr\">Without particularly discussing the first point, the second point made is clearly with the defendant. This is an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>for <em>money paid </em>by the plaintiffs to the \u00fase of the defendant. It is necessary, therefore, to show a joint payment by the plaintiffs. Now, the plaintiffs were not partners when the notes were given. They were not joint, but separate notes. Suppose the money recovered by the plaintiffs, it will not be divided between them, as partners; but each will take the amount paid by him. <em>(Brand </em>v. <em>Boulcott, </em>3 <em>Bos. and Pull. </em>235. 5 <em>Esp. N. P. Rep. </em>194. <em>Osborne and another </em>v. <em>Harper, 5 East\u2019s Rep. </em>225.) To authorize a joint action, there must be a joint fund out of which the money is paid. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-16\">Again; the discharge of <em>W. </em>from the <em>ca. sa. </em>was a complete satisfaction and discharge of the judgment against <em>D. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>and <em>W. </em>as endorsers of th\u00e9 original note ; and the subseqUent proceedings were in fraud of the insolvent act.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ad7k\">Spencer, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The principal question is, whether the plaintiffs can maintain a joint suit, on the evidence in this cas\u00e9 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover does not depend on a joint liability, as endorsers of the note, on which the defendants were prior endorsers, but on the fact, whether the plaintiffs jointly paid Ihe note: Nor does this cause involve the question how far a negotiable note may be deemed a payment of a precedent debt, when taken as payment. The plaintiffs were partners, and prior to any payment of the note endorsed by them, and which is the foundation of this suit, had become insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The assignees of <em>Bostwick &amp; Sterling, (Haggerty </em>and <em>Cairns,) </em>who were the holders of the note made by <em>Davison, Day, &amp; Pierson, </em>received of <em>Doremus, </em>on the 9th of <em>August, </em>1817, four notes, amounting together to two hundred and twelve dollars, endorsed by <em>N. Weed, </em>and two of which, being one hundred and six dollars, were paid prior to th^ 13th of February, 1818. The assignees also received of <em>Wilbur, </em>the costs'of the suit against <em>Doremus Sr Wilbur, </em>and <em>A. Ogden 8r Co., </em>and also a note made by <em>Wilbur </em>to N\u2022 <em>Sr, H. Weed, </em>and\" by them endorsed, for four hundred and thirty-nine dollars and 82 cents, dated the 13th of <em>February, </em>1818, payable in six months,-ffn full of their liability on the note of <em>Davison, Day, Sr Pierson, </em>and wholly discharged them.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6S\">In <em>Graham and others </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>(2 <em>Term Rep. </em>282.) the plaintiffs and two other persons were joint owners of a privateer; the defendants were owners of another privateer; a prize was taken, condemned, and sold, by agreement between the owners of the two ships. The sentence of condemnation having been afterwards reversed, restitution with costs was awarded, which were' paid solely by the plaintiffs, the two other partners, in the interim, having become bankrupts. It was held, that the plaintiffs could not maintain the action for a moiety of the sum paid, for it was either a partnership transaction, and then all the partners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ought to be joined, or it stood as-a separate payment by each individual, when each should have brought a separate action. This case leaves the point undecided, whether all the partners, as well those who paid, as those who had become bankrupts and paid nothing, could maintain the action. The case of <em>Osborne and another </em>v. <em>Harper </em>(5 <em>East, </em>225.) bears more strongly on the question. There, <em>A. B </em>and <em>C. </em>having dissolved partnership, C. after the dissolution, drew bills, in the partnership firm, in favour of <em>D., </em>he being ignorant of the dissolution. D. sued all the former partners, and recovered judgment. <em>A. </em>and <em>B., </em>after-wards, through their attorney, satisfied the judgment, and brought a joint action against <em>D.; </em>and the question was whether the action could be sustained by <em>A. </em>and <em>B. </em>jointly or not. The Court were of opinion, that unless it appeared, in point of fact, that the damages in the former action had been paid out of a joint fund or stock, a joint action could not be supported; for without a joint fund there could not be a joint payment; and the action was finally maintained upon its being shown to the Court, that their attorney had advanced the five hundred pounds on the joint credit of the plaintiffs ; and Lord <em>Ellenborougk </em>said, that created \u00e1 joint fund for the discharge of the execution ; and, consequently, a joint action would lie. <em>Brand and Herbert </em>v. <em>Boulcott, </em>(3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>235.) coincides with this doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">It appears to me that the principle advanced in <em>Osborne and another </em>v. <em>Harper </em>is the true one : That to enable several persons to join in demanding the repayment of a sum of money, it ought to have been paid out of a joint fund. Here the plaintiff's contributed to the payment separately, and in unequal parts, without any community of interest in the money paid, and, therefore, they cannot maintain a joint suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
