H. </em>to <em>F. Runyan, </em>one of the lessors, which had not been proved or recorded, prior to the 20th of <em>February </em>last, when the release was dated; but of which fact the defendants* attorney was not informed until about the first day of <em>June. </em>He had offered to plead the release at the Circuit, but the judge refused,to receive the plea, on the ground that the release had been given before the last <em>May </em>Term. The affidavit of the defendant <em>B. </em>further stated, that since the circuit he had obtained a release from <em>F. Runyan, </em>another of the lessors, of all his right and title to the premises in question, and that <em>Allen, </em>the other lessor, claimed title to the premises, under a deed from <em>Runyan, </em>executed whilst the defendant <em>B. </em>was in possession of the premises, holding adversely.

That the other two lessors were not beneficially interested in the suit, but were made plaintiffs, because the title of the lessor <em>A. </em>was derived under them. He contended that the nonsuit was properly granted. <em>(Adams\u2019 Eject. </em>290.) The plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>which is of matter arising after issue joined, and before trial, must be pleaded without delay. <em>(Jackson v. Rich. </em>7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>194.) The reason of the indulgence as to such pleas, in cases of bankruptcy or insolvency (2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>294. 9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>255.) does not apply to this case.
