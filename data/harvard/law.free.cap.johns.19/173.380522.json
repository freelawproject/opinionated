Upon the application of the defendants, the executions were withdrawn, and the attorney for the plaintiffs consented to receive certain securities, and apply the proceeds, as collected, to certain other bonds, in his hands, and the above judgments. The amount collected not being sufficient to <em>^ \u00b0 </em>e \u00b0 'satisfy the bonds and judgments, the attorney of the plain<em>,.rr </em>,, , ,, , . ... . <em>J , </em>r <em>tms </em>called on the defendants to adjust and pay the amount due on the judgments. The defendants requested indulgence, from time to time, promising to pay the balance due. After being so indulged with time until <em>January, </em>1821, the attorney of the plaintiffs issued executions <em>anew; </em>but, by mistake, the name of the late Chief Justice was inserted in the teste of the writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-12\"><em>Van Bur\u00e9n, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An2\">moved to set aside the executions for irregularity: 1. Because, they were tested in the name of the former Chief Justice; and, 2. because the judgments had not been revived by <em>scire facias. </em>He cited, 2 <em>Wils. </em>82. 3 <em>Salk. </em>322. <em>Barnes, </em>205. 1 <em>Sellon's Pr. </em>515.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-14\"><em>J.

He insisted, that as the delay of execution was at the request, and in favour, of the defendants, it was not necessary to sue out a <em>scire facias. </em>(2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Pr. </em>1005. 2 <em>Burr. </em>660. 6 <em>Bac.

Where the execution is delayed for a year, at fh\u2019e request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>and for the benefit, of the defendant, the reason of the rule requiring a <em>scire facias </em>does not apply. In <em>Mitchell v. Cue, </em>(2 <em>Burr. </em>660.) the court of K. B. said, that the rule as to reviving a judgment above a year old, was to, prevent <em>surprise </em>on the defendant $ and that where he himself had, by injunction, and other methods, tried to delay the plaintiff he ought not to be allowed to take advantage of it, to the prejudice of the plaintiff. Here the circumstances are equally strong for creating an exception to the rule. The executions had been delayed, from time to time, at the urgent and repeated request of the defendants, down to. the time, when they were delivered to the sheriff. There was no reason or necessity, under these circumstances, for issuing a <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Mqtion denied\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
