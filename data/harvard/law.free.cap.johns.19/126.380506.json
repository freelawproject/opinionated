By the rules and practice of the Court below, special bail may be required m an action of slander; and special bail had been filed in the cause, in that Court. On the return of the <em>habeas corpus </em>to this Court, the defendant filed common bail. The plaintiff claiming to be entitled to special bail, also, in this Court, after the usual rule for that purpose, sued out a <em>procedendo.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-8\"><em>Nelson, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbU\">now moved to set aside the <em>procedendo, </em>on the ground, that this Court, in requiring bail on the return of a <em>habeas corpus </em>to a Court of Common Pleas, would be governed by the same rule as if the cause had been originally commenced in this Court; and he relied on the case of <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>(14 <em>Johns.
