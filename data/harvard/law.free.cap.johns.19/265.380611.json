The defendants appealed to the Court of C. P. of <em>Ulster </em>county; and on the trial of the appeal in that Court, a verdict was found for the appellee, for less than 11 <em>twenty-jive </em>dollars; and the Court awarded costs to the ap- , v 1 pellantS. ,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-15\"><em>Cole, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1N\">now moved for a writ of <em>mandamus </em>directed to the judges of the Court of C. P., commanding them to vacate the rule entered by them awarding costs to the appellants, and to enter a rule awarding costs to the appellee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b273-16\"><em>Sudam, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZI\">In the 20th section of the act, it is declared, that if judgment shall be rendered for the appellee, he may, at his election, <em>\u201c </em>have execution on such judgment, for the amount thereof, together with costs, as in other cases on judgments in the said Court of Common Pleas.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Now, where a judgment is recovered in a Court of C. P. for iess than twenty-five dollars, the defendant is entitled to costs. The appellant brought the action, at his own risk, un^er this act before the justice, to recover fifty dollars, and if he has failed in the experiment, it is his own fault. He is entitled to costs only where he would have been entitled to them in the Court of Common Pleas, before the passing of the act to extend the jurisdiction of justices of the peace. The appeal is remedial; and if a verdict should be recovered before a justice for forty-nine dollars, which on appeal should be reduced to one dollar, and yet the appellant must pay costs, the remedy would be worse than the disease.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-4\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">We are of opinion that the words, \u201c as in other cases on judgments in the said Court of Common Pleas,\u201d in the <em>twentieth </em>section of the act, apply only to the manner of issuing the execution, not to the judgment or amount to be recovered. The appellee is entitled to costs in all cases where there is a verdict in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
