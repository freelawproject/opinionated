The witness made the engagement, and <em>While </em>and the deputy left his house, and the .witness, on the next <em>Sunday, </em>saw <em>Whitef </em>at large, in <em>Ridgway, </em>without any officer. <em>Close, </em>the deputy, testified that he went with <em>H.

For any indulgence which shall go to hazard the debt, we must consider you as responsible. Yours sincerely, <em>H. Ely. Oak Orchard, February </em>26th, 1819.\u2019\u2019 It appeared that the deputy asked <em>White </em>for security, that he would go to gaol on <em>Monday, </em>and they went to <em>Lawrence\u2019s </em>house, as above stated, and <em>L. </em>engaged to produce <em>W. </em>at <em>Batavia, </em>on <em>Monday </em>after, and on that day <em>W. </em>was there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-9\"><em>White </em>testified, that his situation was not altered by the indulgence shown to him: that, at the time of his arrest on the <em>ca. sa., </em>he asked <em>Ely </em>if it was essential that he should be taken away immediately, and <em>Ely </em>said that it was not necessary. That he remained within the gaol liberties a year and a half; the present suit was brought on the 24th of <em>February, </em>1820.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to any oral testimony of the conversations between <em>Ely </em>and <em>Close, </em>and between <em>Ely </em>and <em>White, </em>as it appeared that they had resulted in the writing which had been produced, and the testimony was received, subject to this objection. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, for the amount of their debt, 712 dollars and 27 cents, and for 22 dollars and 85 cents damages, subject to the opinion of the Court, on a case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-11\">The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the verdict being taken, subject to the opinion of the Court, and particularly to any verdict for interest.

That whether the escape was with the consent of the plaintiffs, was a question of fact, as to the intent and meaning of the writing given by <em>Ely </em>to the deputy, atid ought to have been left to the jury. Jurors are to try the fact, and judges are to decide the law arising from the fact. It is the undoubted right of the jury to find a general or special verdict. They are to weigh all the evidence, oral or written; .and it is not merely a trial by witnesses, but by <em>jury. Co. Litt. </em>226. b. 228. <em>a. Hale\u2019s. Hist. C.

That it was competent to the plaintiff to prove the conversation between <em>Ely, </em>one of the plaintiffs, and the deputy sheriff, at the time the writing was delivered to the deputy, as a part of the <em>res gesta, </em>it being all one transaction. The general rule as to the admissibility of parol evidence to explain written instruments, does not apply to this case. <em>Phillips, (on Evid. </em>443.) who has collected the cases on the subject, and stated the rule and distinctions with clearness, says, that \u201c though an ambiguity apparent on the face of a written instrument, cannot be explained by extrinsic evidence; yet,'where a question arises as to the general intention of the parties, concerning which the instrument is not decisive, proof of independent facts collateral to the instrument may be properly admitted.\u201d Parol evidence is always admissible to show fraud. (8 <em>Term Rep. </em>379. 14 <em>Vesey, </em>170. 1 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>22. 5 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>68. 14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>210. 1 <em>Gallis\u2019s Rep. 170. 1 Johns.

But the writing, in itself, shows such an interference \u2022on the part of the plaintiffs, as must subject them to all the consequences. The indulgence shown to <em>W. </em>was manifestly produced by this writing; and if it was not the intension of <em>Ely, </em>that the deputy should indulge the prisoner, it \u25a0was an artful mode of leading the sheriff into a situation that might render him liable; and tfce Court will not, allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>a party to avail himself of a fact, produced by his own artifice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">3. The verdict includes <em>interest </em>on the debt, to which the plaintiffs were not entitled; and we object to any alteration of the verdict in this respect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-7\">Spencer, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqQ\">delivered the opinion of the Court. If it is meant that the defendant\u2019s counsel, by objecting to the verdict being taken, subject to the opinion of the Court, insisted on his right to address the jury, and on their right to deliberate on the evidence, (which I think is fairly implied in the objection,) then it becomes necessary to inquire, what is, and ought to he, the course of proceeding at the circuit. If the facts in a cause are indisputable, and the Judge either has doubts on the point of law, or wishes to have it considered more deliberately, I can see no objection to his advising the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, or defendant, subject to the opinion of the Court. In such a case, if either party refused consent, I should consider it advisable to decide the point of law, giving the party against whom.the decision was made, an opportunity to make a case. If the facts were disputable, or if there was any thing within the province of the jury to consider of, the course would be, if either party objected to a case subject to the opinion of the Court, toxsubmit the case to the jury, with such remarks on the law and facts, as were called for by the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In this case, the facts relied on by the plaintiffs, to prove an escape, were not disputed. The validity of the defence was in question only; and if it depended merely on the writing given by <em>H. Ely, </em>whether he authorized the deputy to let <em>White </em>go at large for a limited period, the construction of the object and intent of the paper writing, would be matter of law for the decision of the Judge at the Circuit, and, ultimately, for the -Court; but if the antecedent and accompanying facts were to be taken into consideration, in deciding the import and meaning of the writing, I should then consider it a matter proper to be submitted to the jury. I should, however, distinguish between cases in which a right to property arising <em>ex contractu, </em>was in dispute, and cases where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>a penalty was sought to be recovered, <em>ex delicto; </em>in the latter cases, I should refer the whole matter, with my opinion on the law and facts, to the jury. The present is a case of the latter description ; and 1 should not, therefore, have directed a verdict subject to the opinion of the Court, against the expressed wishes of the defendant\u2019s counsel. My reasons for the distinction to which I have referred, proceeds on the ground that it is a case <em>slricli juris; </em>and should the defendant obtain a verdict, and the action appear to be a hard and unconscientious one, the Court would scarcely grant a new trial, though it might be against evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The first inquiry on the merits of the case, depends on the competency of the parol evidence, as explanatory of the circumstances under which the writing was given by <em>Ely </em>to the deputy, <em>Close.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">It appears to be good law, that though an ambiguity is apparent on the face of a written instrument, it cannot be explained by extrinsic evidence ; yet, where a question arises as to the general intention of the parties, concerning which the instrument is not decisive, proof of independent facts, collateral to the instrument, may be properly admitted. <em>(Phillips on Evid. </em>443, 444.) In the case of the <em>King v. The Inhabitants of Laindon, </em>(8 <em>Term Rep. </em>379.) by the opinion of all the Judges, parol evidence was held admissible, to show the intention of the parties to a contract, by the ascertainment of a fact collateral to the written instrument, it being in some measure equivocal. <em>Peake (on Evid. </em>116.) says, no evidence <em>of an expressed intention </em>can be received to explain an ambiguity on the face of the instrument, and thereby to make that valid, which, of itself, would not avail; yet, that, in other cases, both species of ambiguity are open to explanation by parol evidence ; and that, even in the case of a will, where the testator makes use of terms of equivocal import, though his declarations are not admissible, yet the circumstances of his family and fortune may be proved and taken into consideration, in order the better to enable .a Court of justice to put a construction upon his words. In <em>Cole v. Wendel, </em>(8 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>118.) where the written contract was to pay five per cent, advance on sixty shares in the <em>Hudson Bank, </em>the doubt was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>whether this advance was on ten dollars then paid in upon the shares, or on the nominal amount of the shares, they being 50 dollars each. It was held, that the terms of the contract were equivocal, and that, on the strictest principles, the circumstances of the case might be proved, and taken into consideration, in determining how the five per cent, advance was to be calculated. The same principle was recognized by the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, </em>in <em>The </em>Mechanics\u2019 <em>Bank v. Bank of Columbia, </em>(5 <em>Wheat. Rep. </em>326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">I have no doubt, that the writing in this case <em>is, per se, </em>of equivocal import. It certainly does mean, that the deputy should grant indulgence to <em>White. </em>What kind of indulgence, is the only doubt. It was to be of that nature, that should not hazard the plaintiffs\u2019 debt; for any indulgence of that kind, they would consider the deputy responsible. Now, to ascertain the kind of indulgence with respect to which the writing is equivocal, and that might be shown\" by the deputy to <em>White, </em>on the principles of the cases referred to, we have a right, in order to ascertain the intention of the parties to the writing, to inquire into collateral and extraneous facts. These facts are, that <em>White </em>was arrested on the <em>ca. sa., </em>forty miles from <em>Batavia, </em>where the gaol is, and that he waited two or three days, on account of the state of his family, to prepare to go to gaol. These facts do not contradict the writing, but are essential to a right understanding of its import and meaning. The wish expressed, that as much indulgence might be shown to <em>White, </em>as could be done with safety to the sheriff) without hazarding, in any way, the debt, is susceptible of but one construction ; that the sheriff should guard hims\u00e9lf against <em>Whitens </em>absconding, and that the plaintiff\u2019s situation, in relation to their debt, should not be hazarded by any act of <em>White, </em>in disposing of his property. It is fairly inferrable from the case, that <em>H. Ely </em>was present, and fully knew, that in consequence of the writing he gave, the deputy entered into the arrangement with <em>White, </em>that he should appear on the ensuing <em>Monday, </em>at <em>Batavia. </em>It appeal's that the plaintiffs\u2019 debt was not in the least impaired by the indulgence given to <em>White; </em>that he remained in gaol for eigh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>teen months, on the plaintiffs\u2019 execution; and that they never thought of suing the sheriff until almost a year after-wards. Under these circumstances, the case ought to have been submitted to the jury on the facts, for them to decide on the effect and import of the writing connected with these collateral facts, and whether greater indulgence was shown to <em>White </em>than was intended by the writing. There must be a new trial, with costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
