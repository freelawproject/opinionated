The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the sufficiency of this proof, and the objection was allowed by the judge. The defendants\u2019 counsel then called <em>L., </em>the attorney and counsel for the plaintiff, who testified, that he was acquainted with the handwriting of the plaintiff; that previous to the commencement of this suit, and his retainer, as attorney and counsel for the plaintiff', he knew nothing of the plaintiff\u2019, or of his handwriting; and that he had no knowledge of his writing, except what was communicated to him by the plaintiff, as his counsel in the cause, and he submitted himself to the direction of the judge, whether he was bound to answer the question put to him; and the judge decided, that it was not proper for the witness to answer the question ; and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, for 1,240 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApK\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AhI\"><em>Caines, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_Wv\">He cited 2 <em>Johns.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqV\">delivered the opinion of the Court. To prove a party\u2019s signature, it is not indispensably necessary that the witness should have seen him write. <em>Phillips </em>(367.) gives the true rule : \u201c The admissibility of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>dence must depend upon whether there is good reason to believe, that the specimens, from which the witness has derived his knowledge, were written by the supposed writer of the paper in question.\u201d In <em>Titford </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>214.) it was held, that the signature of the endorser was well proved by a person who had been in the habit of seeing his correspondence, and, from that circumstance, believed the signature to be his. The witness in this case had received the plaintiff\u2019s notes, all of which, except one, had been paid; the payment of the notes, with his signature to them, unexplained, was a full admission, that he had made and subscribed them. If, then, the witness had sufficiently observed, to ascertain the distinctive and prevailing character of the handwriting, he was in a situation to identify the plaintiff\u2019s signature, and he ought to have been asked, if he believed the plaintiff\u2019s name to the receipts to be his handwriting; if he had answered that question affirmatively, then the receipts should have been received in evidence. The questions to the attorney and counsel were not pushed far enough. If he knew nothing but what his client had communicated to him, he could not be compelled to disclose that; but if he became acquainted with his client\u2019s signature, in any other manner, though it was subsequent to his retainer, he was bound to answer; for an attorney and counsel may be questioned, as to a collateral fact within his knowledge, or as to a fact which he may know, without being entrusted with it as an attorney in the cause. <em>(Brant </em>v. <em>Kline, 17 Johns. Rep. </em>338. 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>431.) There must be a new trial; the costs to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">New trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
