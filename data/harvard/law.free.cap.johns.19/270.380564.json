The defendant asked for a favour, which was granted to him, upon the payment of costs. That was the <em>condition </em>on which the trial of the cause was put off; and it ought to have been, performed by the defendant, without any previous demand or request of the plaintiff. The costs ought to have been paid <em>instanter ; </em>and it was the duty of the defendant to seek the plaintiff, and tender the costs, without waiting for a formal demand of them. The costs were regularly taxed, and payment of the bill demanded of the defendants\u2019 attorney, who attended the taxation, having been previously served with a copy of the bill, and notice of the taxation. The case of <em>Jackson, ex dem. Lewis, v. Lowry, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>114.) is in point, to show that the demand of the costs of the <em>attorney </em>was regular, and that an attachment will lie in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-20\">Rule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
