The first was on a promissory note alleged to have been made by <em>Lemuel Holmes, Abel Wilson, and William B. Foot, </em>in the usual form, for 450 dollars, dated <em>September </em>10, 18\u00cd6, payable in <em>June </em>after date, with interest. The second count set forth the making of a note of the same date and amount, and payable in the same manner, and as having been made by <em>Lemuel Holmes, </em>and by <em>Abel Wilson, </em>and <em>William B. Foot, </em>they, <em>Wilson and </em>Foot, then and there being pur. chasers and joint dealers in goods, wares, merchandize, and lumber, under the style of <em>Wilson and Foot, </em>the proper hand of <em>Lemuel Holmes </em>being thereto subscribed, and the proper name and firm of <em>Wilson and Foot </em>being als\u2019o'thereto subscribed, by one of the said firm, by the name and description of <em>Wilson and Foot, </em>sureties. The third count contained the several money counts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\"><em>Holmes </em>and <em>Wilson </em>pleaded, jointly, <em>non assumpsit.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2qZ\"><em>Foot </em>pleaded separately, <em>non assumpsit, </em>and, secondly, in bar, that at the time of making the note in the second count mentioned, he was a partner and joint dealer in goods, wares, merchandize and timber, with <em>Wilson, </em>as alleged ; and that <em>Holmes, </em>for a long time prior thereto, was indebted to the plaintiff, Sabin,-in the amount secured by the note, in his individual capacity, and in no wise relating to, or connected with the business of the firm; and that <em>Holmes, </em>in his private capa, city, and <em>Wilson </em>in the nnme of the firm, without authority and against the consent of <em>Foot, </em>executed and delivered to the plaintiff below, the promissory note in the second count mentioned, and for no other cause whatever. The plaintiff replied, that <em>Holmes </em>in his private capacity, and <em>Wilson, </em>in file-name of the firm, <em>did not execute and deliver </em>to the plaintiff below, the said note, without (he authority and against the consent of <em>Foot, </em>in manner as he had alleged in his said second plea, which he prayed might be inquired of by the country, &lt;^c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">On the trial, a bill of exceptions was taken, which stated, that the plaintiff below, to prove and maintain the issue joined, proved, by <em>Appleton Fool, </em>that the note then produced, and which is truly described in the second coiint of the declaration, was signed by <em>L. </em>Holmes, in his own proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>hand, and with his name, and that the names of \u201c <em>Wilson &amp; </em>Foot, sureties,\u201d subscribed to the said note, was in the proper hand-writing of the said <em>Mel Wilson, </em>and that the said <em>Wilson </em>and <em>William B. Foot, </em>at the time of making the said promissory note, were partners, as in the second count is alleged, and then rested. The defendants moved for a non-suit, on the ground that the plaintiff had not proved the authority or consent of <em>Foot </em>to the making of the note. The Court were of opinion, that the plaintiff was bound to prove the authority or consent of <em>Foot, </em>to the making the note, and which they decided he had already done; and \u2022 thereupon directed the parties to proceed to the jury. . Then followed the signatures of the judges. The record proceeded to state, that the defendants showed in evidence, that about the time the note was given, the plaintiff stated, that he had a demand against <em>Holmes </em>for about 500 dollars, and wished to obtain security; and that he, afterwards, said, he had obtained the security of <em>Wilson Foot, </em>for the payment of his demand. The plaintiff then showed, that during the winter, after the note was given, <em>Holmes </em>was connected with <em>Wilson Foot, </em>in collecting and making a large .quantity of boards, for the <em>Montreal </em>market; that in the spring and summer of 1817, <em>Wilson Foot </em>carried the boards to market; and that after the note became due, he heard a conversation between <em>Holmes, </em>and <em>Foot </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>in which <em>Holmes </em>alleged, that when the note was given, it -was agreed, and understood by and between them, that <em>Holmes </em>should be connected with, and aid and assist <em>Wilson fy Foot </em>in making and marketing the boards, and that the \u2022 note to the plaintiff should be satisfied out of the avails of the boards; and <em>Holmes </em>complained, that <em>Wilson fy Foot </em>had not paid and satisfied the plaintiff\u2019s debt, in pursuance of that agreement. That the allegations of <em>Holmes </em>were not denied by <em>Wilson </em>or <em>Foot; </em>but <em>Wilson </em>said, that <em>Holmes </em>was indebted to them, <em>Wilson Foot, </em>for goods sold, in as large a sum as his share of the raft of boards, and which -sum <em>Wilson </em>contended, <em>Holmes\u2019 </em>share of the boards should. pay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoZ\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff below, on the Jast issue; and in their verdict said, that <em>Holmes, </em>in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>private capacity, and <em>Wilson, </em>in the name of the firm, did not execute and deliver to the plaintiff the said note, without the authority, and against the consent of <em>Foot, </em>as <em>Foot </em>in his second plea hath alleged, and they assessed the damages at 505 dollars and 4 cents, besides costs ; on which judgment was rendered by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b165-3\">The case was submitted to the Court, on the record and \u25a0points stated.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b165-4\">Spencer, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4X\">delivered the opinion of the Court. I cannot consider the facts spread upon the record subsequent to the attestation of the judges to the exceptions taken by the defendants below, as legally before us. We find these facts on the record, but they are placed there by the plaintiff\u2019sattorney, in making up his judgment roll, without the apparent sanction of the Court below. It is the business of a Court of errors to review the points decided in the Court below, and as to which, exceptions are taken, and not such matters of evidence as are not excepted to. When the plaintiff rested his cause, and the defendants moved for a nonsuit, he should have asked permission to introduce such further evidence as he had, before the Court expressed an opinion on the motion; or he should have had the evidence, afterwards given, incorporated into the bill of exceptions, before it was signed and sealed, if such additional evidence, in his judgment, entitled him to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The plaintiff proved Holmes\u2019 signature to the note, and, also, that <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Foot </em>were partners, and that <em>Wilson </em>signed the name of the firm ; and it appeared on the face of the note, that they signed as \u201c sureties\u2019\u2019 to <em>Holmes. </em>Whether we apply this proof to the general issue, or to the special plea, the plaintiff has not maintained either issue. It was incumbent on him to show, that all the defendants were liable on the note, and that <em>Wilson </em>executed the note with the express assent and authority of <em>Foot. </em>In this case, it appearing that the signature of the name of the firm, by <em>Wilson, </em>was not for a partnership debt, <em>Wilson </em>could not bind his partner <em>Foot. </em>All the cases were reviewed in <em>Dobb </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>(16 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>38.) and the principle es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>tablished is this, that where a note is given in the name of a firm, by one of the partners, for the private debt of such partner, and known to be so by the person taking the note, the other partner is not botind, unless he has been previously consulted, and has consented to the transaction; and the bur-then of the proof, that the partner, who did not sign the note, consented to be bound, is thrown on the creditor. The same principle applies with greater force, when one of the partners becomes security for another person, and attempts to bind his copartners. The creditor is aware, that he is pledging the partnership responsibility in a matter in nowise connected with the partnership business ; and that is \u00e1 fraud on such of the partners as do not assent expressly that the firm shall be bound. When, therefore, it appeared, from the plaintiff\u2019s own showing, that the note was signed by <em>Holmes, </em>as principal, and by <em>Wilson, </em>with the name of the firm of <em>Wilson &amp; foot, </em>as sureties-for <em>Holmes, </em>nothing was shown to bind <em>Foot, </em>and the plaintiff failed to maintain the issue. On the motion for a nonsuit, the Court held, that the plaintiff was bound to prove the authority or consent of <em>Foot </em>to the making the note, which the Court considered he had done. There was no proof of any authority or consent of <em>Foot, </em>except the proof of the signature' of <em>Wilson, </em>of the name of the firm. The Court, then, c\u00e9rtainly drew a very incorrect legal inference from the fact proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The only remaining question is, whether there was error in not nonsuiting the plaintiff. In the case of <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>(13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>334.) it was decided, that a Court of Common Pleas may compel a party to be nonsuited, without and against his consent, when, in their opinion, the evidence offered by him does not support his action, and there are no questions of fact to be weighed and considered by the jury. It was, also, decided in that case, that a bill of exceptions would lie to the decision of the Common Pleas upon a motion for a nonsuit, if such opinion was upon a mere matter of law arising upon facts not disputed. This Court may not have intended, in that case, to say, that, a writ of error would lie to the decision of the Common Pleas; when they nonsuited the plaintiff upon a point of law; but I per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>ceive no difference in the cases ; if a Court can rightfully nonsuit the plaintiff upon an undisputed state of facts, when the law is against him, they ought to do so; and the refusal to do it, is an error, in point of law. It ought not to be left with the Common Pleas to nonsuit the party when he has entirely failed to make out his case, or to omit to do it, capriciously. In the case last cited, we say, that the power of nonsuiting the plaintiff must be vested in the Court; that it results necessarily from their being made the judges of the law of the case, when no facts are in dispute, and that otherwise there is no meaning in what has been considered a salutary rule in Courts of justice, that to questions of law the judges are to respond. In many of the Courts of Common Pleas, there are no judges of the degree of counsellors, of this Court; and, of course, no new trials can be had, however outrageous the verdict may be in point of amount, or however unsupported by evidence. In fact, in Courts thus constituted, having no power to grant new trials, the citizen may be deprived of the benefit of the laws made for the protection of his rights and property. In my judgment, we ought, as far as the law will permit, to give facility to suitors, by extending to them the right of taking their exceptions, so as to have the law applicable to their cases examined on a writ of error. On the ground,' then, that the Court of Common Pleas refused to nonsuit the plaintiff below, when the evidence adduced entirely failed to make out his case, the judgment must be reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>issue from this Court. It has not been made an objection, that the writ of error is prosecuted solely in the name of <em>Foot. </em>I presume that the defendants below have been secured, or that the parties have waived all objection on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, returnable in this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
