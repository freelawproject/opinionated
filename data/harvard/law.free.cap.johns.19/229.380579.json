(2 <em>Wils. </em>261. 3 <em>Burr. </em>1725. 2 <em>Johns.Rep. </em>850. 11 <em>Johns Rep. </em>141. 1 <em>Wils. </em>255. <em>T.

The declaration contains every material and necessary allegation to support the action, and pursues the statute. (2 N. <em>P. L. </em>125, 126. 513.) The breaches, also, are well assigned. The collectr or is required by the act (2 N. P. <em>L. </em>138. sess. 3.) to account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>wjtjj (reasurer for all the money which he collects, or is di e <em>J </em>rected to collect; and if he neglects to do so his bond become: forfeited. By suffering a default, the defendants admit that th&lt; breaches are well assigned; and the jury have found them to b&lt; true. If some of the breaches are well assigned, ^nd some had and the defendant demurs generally, the -plaintiff is entitled tc judgment for those which are well assigned. -(2 <em>Saund. </em>380. 1 <em>Saund. </em>286. <em>n. </em>9. <em>Cro. Jac. 557.)</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>Seelye, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlH\">1. It is made the duty of the supervisors te deliver the tax list, with their warrant, to the collectors, on <em>o\u00ed </em>before the first day of <em>November, </em>in each year; (2. <em>N. R. L. 51</em>1 sess. 4.) but it appears by the declaration, that the tax list and warrant were not delivered, in this case, until the 25th of <em>November, </em>and no excuse is shown for the delay. If the supervisors might delay the delivery of the tax list and warrant for a month, they might delay it until the very last day, and then ii the collector was in default, bring their actio,n against his sureties. It is obvious from the act, that it was the intention of the legislature, that the collectors should have three months for malting their collections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">, 2. It appears from the declaration, that the plaintiff seeks to recover of the sureties <em>of A: </em>the <em>fees of collection, </em>as well as the amount which the treasurer was entitled to receive. The amount of the tax list is 899 dollars and 90 cents, including the collector\u2019s fees, and the first breach assigned is for the nonpayment of that sum to the -county treasurer; but the exact sum due to the treasurer was only eight hundred and fifty-four dollars. A <em>surety </em>cannot be made responsible beyond the legal liability of his principal. The plaintiff must set forth his cause of action according to his legal rights.^ If the breach varies from the sense or substance of the covenant or contract, it is insufficient. (1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>328. <em>Sir T. Jones' Rep. </em>125.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">3. The two first assignments of breaches in the declaration show no cause of action. The statute (2 <em>N. R. L. </em>126. sect. 1.) requiring the collector to give security, directs the mode of giving the bond ; that it shall be given in double the amount o\u00ed taxes to be collected. The bond cannot become forfeited, until the collector makes default in paying over the money; nor until after the county treasurer has issued his warrant against the collector, and it is returned <em>nulla bona, he. </em>Now, there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>irment of these facts in the two first assignments of breaches, \u00ede assignment of each breach should show a good cause of ac-n. No resort can be had to the third assignment of breach this case, to help the first; for each must be good and per;t in itself. (13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>483. 10. <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>560. <em>Co, 2.) </em>There being a judgment by default in this case, it is not be considered as if there was a verdict. It is rather like the se of a general demurrer to the assignments of the two first eaches. <em>(2 Burr. </em>900. 10 <em>East's Rep. </em>363.) But we con-id that the defect would not be cured by a verdict, had it me before the Court in that shape. (1 <em>Saund. </em>228. <em>n. </em>1. <em>Saund. </em>178.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">4. The bond being taken for more than double the amount the tax list, is not pursuant to the statute. It includes the mmutation of the two quakers, for which the sureties of the Hector were not liable. A failure of the collectorto pay over e amount of the tax list, is the only ground of forfeiture of the ind, according to the act; but the plaintiff claims the whole.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ANT\">Without going into a particular consideration all the points made on the argument of this cause, it is suffisnt for its determination to advert to one of them only, which decisive against the plaintiff in error. If we take into view e whole of the declaration and the breaches assigned, it is event that the plaintiff has, by the inquisition, recovered damais to which he is not entitled, either against the collector or his reties, namely, the <em>fees of collection </em>given by the statute to e collector. It is to be intended that the damages have been sessed on the breaches as assigned. We are, therefore, of opion that th,e judgment of the Court below ought to be affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
