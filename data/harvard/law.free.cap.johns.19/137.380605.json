The plaintiffs averred a performance on their part, and assigned, as a breach of the defendant\u2019s covenant, the non-payment of the stipulated price. The defendant pleaded, 1. <em>Non est factum ; </em>2. Payment of the one half of the price, and as to the other half, that the plaintiffs did not deliver the . . r timber, &amp;c.; 3. A submission and award, &amp;c.; 4. Pay- . . , . \u00ab . , , . . . . ment, &amp;c. with <em>notice </em>o\u00ed special matter to be given in evii \u00bb .

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>witness testified, that he Was well acquainted with the handwriting of the defendant; and that the signature to the conUact was in his proper handwriting. The evidence was objected to, but the judge decided, that it was sufficient to <em>j </em>.l t . prove the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-7\">The evidence as to the other facts in the case, are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the Court, as delivered by Mr. Justice <em>Platt. A </em>verdict was taken for the plaintiff, for 1,463 dollars and 77 cents, subject to the opinion of the Court on a case, with liberty to enter a verdictfor the defendant, or for the plaintiffs, for such sum as the Court might direct, and with leave to either party to turn the case into a special verdict, or bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AgqK\"><em>Z.

That the evidence of the absence of the subscribing-witnesses to fhe contract, was sufficient to authorize proof of the handwriting of the defendant, by another witness. 2. That the delivery of the timber was proved, to <em>Mel Livingston, </em>who was shown to be the agent of the defendant; and that this delivery was on the <em>Salmon </em>river, below the <em>French </em>mills, and within the county of <em>Franklin. </em>The plaintiffs began to deliver it on the 17th of <em>June, </em>and completed the delivery on the 30th of <em>June, </em>1812, when the receipt of <em>L., </em>the defendant\u2019s agent, was given, for the remainder of the -timber, agreeably to the contract, to which it refers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-10\">3. Though it appeared, that <em>Walter Buchanan </em>and the defendant, were <em>British </em>subjects, residing in <em>Canada, </em>and <em>R. Buchanan, </em>a naturalized <em>American </em>citizen, residing at <em>French </em>Mills, within this state; yet, admitting the fact that both were alien enemies, they had a right to appoint an agent within the <em>United Slates, </em>to settle their affairs. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>10 <em>Johns.

Again ; war between the <em>United Stales </em>and <em>Great Britain </em>then existed* by which <em>R. B., </em>the other plaintiff, and the defendant, became enemies to each other, and could not, therefore, law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>fully contract. Besides,- the arbitrators were alien enemies, and could make ho award, binding on <em>R. B. (Kyd on Awards, </em>242. 2 <em>Mod. </em>228. 15 <em>Johns.

That the evidence as to the absence of the subscribing witness, who resided within this state, was not sufficient. 2. That the evidence of the delivery of the timber was not sufficient. There was no proof 6f any delivery to the defendant himself. The declaration of war Was on the 18th of <em>June, </em>1812, and. <em>eo instanti, </em>there was an end t\u00f3 all further transactions between the parties. A delivery of timber, after that day, was unlawful ; and the 800 dollars which depended on the delivery df the residue of the timber, cannot, therefore, be the ground of an action. It does not appear how much was delivered on the 17th of \u00abTime, but the delivery was not completed Until the 30th of <em>June, </em>1812.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">' 3. One partner may submit a matter to arbitration, so as <em>to </em>bind his co-partner, and it is not averred in the pleadings that the submission was by deed. (3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>68. 14 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>387. 17 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>58.) At the time of the submission, one of the partners was resident in the <em>United States, </em>and the other in <em>Canada. </em>Though the war suspended the partnership, it did not sever their joint interest in <em>choses in action. </em>On principles of commercial policy and convenience, one partner ought to be allowed to bind his co-partner by submission to an award. The defendant performed the award, on his part, by paying the sum awarded against him; and the plaintiffs acquiesced, by accepting and endorsing it on the award. It is, now, too late to object to the award. (2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pull. </em>338. 2 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>254. 3 <em>Term Rep. </em>454. 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>466. 8 <em>Term Rep. </em>548. 15 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>57. 16 <em>Johns.

There is no express authority which says, that one partner cannot bind his co-partner by a submission to arbitration.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A9-f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Platt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnOM\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AC_6\">On the part of the plaintiffs, I think the contract was'duly proved, and also that they delivered the quantity of timber according to contract, viz. to the defendant\u2019s agent, <em>Niel </em>Livingston, who resided during the spring and summer of 1812, at <em>French Mills, </em>in the county of <em>Franklin. </em>The evidence to establish such agency is clear and satisfactory and the plaintiffs proved a receipt, in the following words, viz. : \u201c <em>Salmon River, 30th June, </em>1812. This day was culled by <em>John Hursden, </em>the remainder of the eight thousand feet of square oak timber, agreeable to <em>Walter </em>and <em>Robert Buchanan\u2019s </em>contract with <em>John Curry, </em>bearing date the 11 th <em>February, </em>1812, and was examined and received by me, according to my advice from <em>Wm. Johnson, Esq. Niel </em>Livingston.\u201d The defendant proved by <em>Joshua T. Cozens, </em>that <em>Walter Buchanan </em>had acknowledged to him, that the defendant had paid the advance money, that is, 800 dollars, payable 1st <em>March, </em>1812, according to contract. It was proved that <em>Robert Buchanan, </em>one of the plaintiffs, was a naturalized <em>American </em>citizen, and resided at <em>French Mills, </em>in <em>Franklin </em>county : and that <em>Walter Buchanan, </em>the other plaintiff, and the defendant, <em>John Curry, </em>were <em>British </em>subjects, and resided in <em>Canada, </em>during the late war.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The places of delivery named in the contract are so general, that the plaintiffs had an election to deliver the timber within the <em>United States, </em>or in <em>Canada. </em>And it does not appear whether it was actually delivered in <em>Canada, </em>or in the <em>United States. </em>Nor -does it appear how much of the timber was delivered <em>before the declaration of war, </em>(18th <em>June, </em>1812,) or how much <em>afterwards. </em>A part, however, to complete the contract, was delivered, as appears by the receipt, at\" <em>Salmon River, </em>on the 30th <em>June, </em>1812.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The first ground of defence was, that the war dissolved tire -contract; and that it became unlawful to fulfil such an agreement between the defendant, who was an alien enemy residing in <em>Canada, </em>and one of the plaintiffs, who was an <em>American </em>citizen resident here.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">To have transported the timber into <em>Canada, </em>pursuant to the contract, during the war, would have been unlawful: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>and so far, the contract was dissolved, or restrained, by the change from peace to war. But, upon the supposition, which is well warranted by the proof, that the defendant, an alien enemy residing in <em>Canada, </em>had an agent resident at <em>French Mills, </em>within the <em>United Stales, </em>who received the timber due on this contract, <em>during the war, </em>at places <em>with' in the United States, </em>I see nothing unlawful or inconsistent with the duty of allegiance, in the mutual performance of the contract, in such a manner, during the war. If such a contract had been entered into during the war, it would have been illegal and void. But this agreement appears to have been made before the war, in good faith, and according to the usual course of business. There is no ground for the position taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel, that it was unlawful for the contracting parties voluntarily -to carry this prior agreement into effect, by delivering and receiving the timber within the <em>United States, </em>during the war. The war suspended the remedy by suit on the contract ; but it is not unlawful, voluntarily to pay debts, or perform contracts to alien enemies,' if the payment be made, or the duty be performed in our country.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The rule is founded in public policy, which fdrbids, during war, that money, or other resources, shall be transferred, so as to aid or strengthen our enemies. The crime consists in' <em>exporting </em>the money or property, or placing it in the power of the enemy; not in delivering it to an alien enemy, or his agent, <em>residing here, </em>under the control of our own government.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">-Suppose, an <em>American citizen, </em>previous to the war, had contracted to furnish a quantity of flour or cotton to a Bri<em>tish </em>merchant, to be delivered to his agent at the port of <em>Jtfew-York; </em>would a declaration of war between the two nations, render it unlawful to fulfil the contract ? I think not. In such a case, the interests of commerce are perfectly compatible with the rights of war; and public policy does not forbid the transfer. None of the authorities cited, support the doctrine contended for by the defendant on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In the case of <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>69.) it was decided, that an alien resident in the <em>United States, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>during a war between his country and the <em>United Slate's, </em>may sue and be sued,- as in peach. If he may su\u00e9, <em>'a foriiov\u2019h </em>he may receive payment,- without suit. <em>Eme\u00f1gon, </em>(1 <em>Trait. des Ass. </em>567.) says, \u201c Les cf\u00e9\u00c9nces que l\u2019eti'\u00e1rig\u00e9r a chez nu\u00fcs, lors de la declaration de guerre, stibsist\u00e9ht en leur entier. S\u2019il est forc\u00e9 de se retir\u00e9r, il j\u00fai \u00e9St loisible de laisser sa procuration a un atni ptiUr exiger c\u00e9 qtfi l\u00fci est dtfy et pour actionner ses ti\u00e9bite\u00fcrs \u00e9'ti justice.\u201d In <em>Conn </em>v. <em>Penn, </em>and <em>Deniston </em>&amp; <em>M\u2018Gregor </em>v. <em>Imbrick, </em>(Circuit <em>Court </em>of U. S. <em>Pennsylvania,) </em>Judge <em>Washington </em>decided, th\u00e1t debts might be paid to the agent of ari alieri \u00e9\u00f1emy residing here, but that no <em>remittance </em>could b\u00e9 (nad\u00e9 during vfrar.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The defendant,- also, relies upon \u00e1 <em>submission, and award, </em>to bar this suit. It appears, that on the 7th daj7 of <em>Aprils </em>1813, (during the war,) at <em>Cornwall, </em>iti <em>Upper Canada, Walter Buchanan </em>(on\u00e9 of the plaintiffs) entered iftto formal bonds of submission to arbitration, with the defendant, of all matters in difference between these plaintiffs \u00e1tid lite defendant, embracing the very claim now before u\u00bf, <em>Walter Buchanan </em>signed and sealed th\u00e9 arbitration bond, <em>for Robert Buchanan, </em>a\u00e1 Well as in his own right; <em>Robert </em>then being a citizen of the <em>United </em>Slates, and resident here. An <em>award </em>was made pursuant to the submission, on the 7th of <em>April, </em>1813 ; whereby the defendant, <em>John Curry, </em>Was required to pay to the plaintiffs, on account of this timber, <em>731. </em>16s., lawful money of <em>Upper Canada, </em>on or before th\u00e9 l\u00e9t of <em>June </em>theti1 tiext. The defendant gave in evid\u00e9nce \u00e1 receipt, endorsed on the award, in these words, viz: \u201c Received, <em>Montreal, </em>20th <em>July, </em>1813, from Mr. <em>John </em>Curry, 741. 7s. <em>3d., </em>it being the amount of this award, with interest. Walter Buchanan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">To this award the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objects, <em>first, </em>that on the authority of <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Waddington, </em>(15 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 57.) the war dissolved the partnership between <em>Walter </em>and5 <em>Robert Buchanan; </em>and, 2dly, that <em>Walter </em>could not, <em>as partner, </em>seal a bond of submission, so as to bind his copartner <em>Robert, </em>and that no special authority for that pulp\u00f3se was-given, or could be given, by <em>Robert </em>to <em>Waller, </em>during the war. In my judgment, these objections are not well founded. Although the war dissolved the partnership, yet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>effect wag no greyer than if the partnership had been dig-solved by the mutual agreement of the partners. In that cage, neither of them could apy longer malee any new contract to bind the other; but either of the former partners would have a right to receive payment, or settle the concerns of the partnership. The dissolution is prospective merely, It is true\u00bb that, strictly speaking, one partner cannot, as such, bind his copartner under seal, to comply with an award. And it is clear, that <em>Robert Buchanan </em>is not bound by tiffs, technically, as an award. But I think it has the effect of extinguishing all claims on behalf of these plaintiffs arising out of that contract. There was a claim for money due on the contract, as the price of the timber: <em>Waller </em>Buchanan, and the defendant, being together in <em>Canada, </em>could not adjust it; and in order to determine the true balance, they agreed to submit the question to arbitration. The arbitrators reported a sum as due upon the contract; and the acting partner there agreed to accept it, and gave a receipt on the back of the award, declaring that he was satisfied with that adjustment of the claim. Now, it is clear, that the award is binding on <em>Walter Buchanan, </em>whatever aray be its effect as to <em>Robert. </em>In <em>Strangford </em>v. <em>Green, (2 Mod. </em>228.) the Court said, \u201c the defendant may undertake for his partner; and having engaged for himself and his partner, to perform the award, notwithstanding the partner is not bound ; yet if he refuses, it, is a breach of the defendant\u2019s promise.\u201d <em>(Kyd on Awards, </em>42.) I think <em>Robert </em>is also concluded by that award, after payment of the sum awarded, considering it as a compromise, or liquidation of the claim, which <em>Walter </em>was authorized to make, in virtue of his general authority as partner in that contract. Here had not only been an award, but the sum awarded as a full satisfaction for the timber, has been accepted as such by <em>Walter Buchanan. </em>If all this had been done without sealing the submission, it would undoubtedly have concluded <em>Robert, </em>as well.as <em>Waller. </em>The partnership demand would have been extinguished ; and, as it regards this suit, I think the effect is the same, whether the final balance due on the contract was liquidated and paid by mutual agreement of the defendant with one of the partners, or through the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>tervention of arbitrators. It operates in the nature of a release by one partner, or as an accord and satisfaction. In <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Dubarry, </em>(1 <em>Salk. </em>70.) <em>Holt, </em>Ch. J. said, \u201c \"that money paid and accepted, in pursuance of a void award, might be pleaded or taken as an accord with satisfaction.\u201d In my view, therefore, it is immaterial, whether the bonds of submission were duly proved at the trial or not. The <em>receipt </em>of <em>Waller Buchanan, </em>on the award, is in itself sufficient to bar this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">We are of opinion, that the defendant is entitled to judg ment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
