During surveillance in connection with a heroin-trafficking investigation in Hartford, Connecticut, officers observed Gomez commit several traffic violations and stopped his car. During the five-minute traffic stop, the officers prolonged the seizure by asking Gomez narcotics-related questions not pertinent to the traffic violations. After the questioning, Gomez consented to the search of a closed bag in the car\u2019s trunk, which contained nearly a half-kilogram of heroin and drug-packaging materials.</p> <p id=\"b106-17\" pgmap=\"106\">Gomez moved to suppress this evidence, arguing that, inter alia, his seizure violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers measurably extended the stop for investigatory reasons unrelated to the traffic violations. Applying this Court\u2019s holding in United States v. Harrison, 606 F.3d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam)\u2014-that questioning unrelated to traffic violations during a five-to-six minute stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2014the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Hall, C.J.) denied Gomez\u2019s suppression motion. Shortly before the district court\u2019s suppression ruling, however, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution\u2019s shield against unreasonable seizures,\u201d indicating that the critical question is whether the unrelated investigation \u201cprolongs\u2014ie., adds time to\u2014the stop.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 1612, 1616, 191 L.Ed.2d 492 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b107-4\" pgmap=\"107\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Rodriguez abrogates our holding in Harrison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We also conclude that Gomez\u2019s seizure, albeit only five minutes in length, contravenes Rodriguez\u2019s holding and therefore violates the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, we conclude that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies because, at the time of the stop, the officers reasonably relied on our precedent in Hamson. As to Gomez\u2019s other arguments, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in concluding that (i) the initial stop was based on valid probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe he committed a traffic violation, and (ii) he consented to the searches of the car, its trunk, and the closed bag in the trunk. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p> <p id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">I. The Heroin-Trafficking Investigation</p> <p id=\"b107-7\" pgmap=\"107\">In March 2014, Hartford police detective James Campbell and Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) special agent Michael Schatz\u2014members of a DEA task force\u2014were investigating a large-scale heroin-trafficking organization operating out of Hartford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Based on information from a wiretap and cooperating sources, Campbell and Schatz suspected that the organization, led by Alex Ortiz-Gomez, was in the process of packaging several kilograms of heroin for street-level sale. In addition to this information, Campbell and Schatz knew that law enforcement officers in New Jersey stopped Ortiz-Gomez and his cousin, Defendant-Appellant Brayan Gomez, in a black Honda Accord the previous year, and during a search of the ear the officers discovered nearly $80,000 in cash, which the DEA seized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b107-11\" pgmap=\"107\">On March 19, Campbell and Schatz began surveillance of two addresses associated with Alex Ortiz-Gomez\u2014one in Hartford and another in East Hartford. The following morning, Campbell observed Brayan Gomez exit the Hartford address and drive away in a white Acura.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Schatz followed Gomez to the East Hartford address, where Gomez briefly entered and exited the residence, switched cars, and again drove away. Gomez left the East Hartford address in a black Honda Accord\u2014the same car involved in the $80,000 New Jersey cash seizure a year earlier.</p> <p id=\"b107-12\" pgmap=\"107\">With Campbell and Schatz (in separate vehicles) covertly following, Gomez drove to a nearby Ramada Inn hotel in East Hartford and parked the black Honda. Although Campbell and Schatz did not arrive in time to see Gomez enter the hotel, Campbell saw him exit the Ramada Inn a few minutes later carrying a \u201cweighted\u201d black duffel bag. After placing the bag in the Honda\u2019s trunk, Gomez drove away again, this time towards the highway; Campbell and Schatz continued to follow.</p> <p id=\"b108-2\" pgmap=\"108\">When Campbell saw Gomez place the duffel bag- in the car\u2019s trunk and drive away,- he notified Schatz and other nearby officers via radio transmissions that he planned to. execute a pretextual stop of the Honda if Gomez committed a traffic violation, Gomez then drove through a red light before entering the highway. After Gomez merged on to' the highway, Campbell and Schatz observed him speeding and changing lanes without using a directional signal.</p> <p id=\"b108-3\" pgmap=\"108\">Gomez did not travel on the highway for long; he slowed to exit via an off-ramp in East Hartford, allowing Campbell and Schatz to catch up. According to Campbell, Gomez committed a third traffic violation at the end of the off-ramp by making a right turn at a red light without stopping.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b108-4\" pgmap=\"108\">II. The Traffic Stop</p> <p id=\"b108-5\" pgmap=\"108\">Shortly after Gomez exited the highway, Campbell used his unmarked car\u2019s lights and siren to pull Gomez over. .Schatz arrived at the scene shortly thereafter and parked his car in front of the-black Honda, which was on the road\u2019s shoulder. While Schatz remained in his-car, Campbell approached the Honda on the driver\u2019s side and noticed, through the open driver-side window, that Gomez \u201cappeared to be nervous as far 'as what [is] typical in a normal traffic stop\u201d\u2014keeping his hands on the steering-wheel, visibly shaking, and maintaining his gaze forward through'the windshield. -Campbell asked Gomez to turn off the car\u2019s engine. When Gomez, without complying,- asked why he was stopped, Campbell again directed Gomez to turn off the engine for .\u201csafety-purposes.\u201d -</p> <p id=\"b108-10\" pgmap=\"108\">Shortly' after Gomez turned off the engine, Campbell\u2019s questioning detoured from traffic violations to the subject of heroin: -</p> <blockquote id=\"b108-11\" pgmap=\"108\">Question: After [Gomez] shut the car off, what interaction did .you have with him at [that] point? Campbell: Once he. complied and shut the vehicle off, he again asked me why he had been stopped. I told him that we were, conducting an investigation into bad heroin as well as firearms within the city of Hartford. Then I also told him that, you know, I observed him trav-elling at-a high rate of speed as well as travelling through the red lights. .</blockquote> <p id=\"b108-13\" pgmap=\"108\">App\u2019x 248 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b108-14\" pgmap=\"108(86) 109(15)\">At Campbell\u2019s request, Gomez provided him with the car\u2019s registration,' which listed Joan Sanchez as the owner. At that time, Campbell did not also ask for Gomez\u2019s license. Campbell then asked Gomez where he was coming from, and' Gomez responded, untruthfully, that he had come from home. After Campbell inquired where he was travelling, Gomez replied that he was going to the home of his sister-in-law Joan Sanchez\u2014the owner of the black Honda^-but he did not know her exact address. Then, Campbell asked for the name of Joan Sanchez\u2019s spouse; Gomez responded that she .was married to Alex Ortiz-Gojnez.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b109-5\" pgmap=\"109\">After this initial questioning with Gomez in the driver\u2019s seat, Campbell asked him to exit the car and walk around to the passenger side.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At that point, Schatz exited his car and joined Gomez and Campbell in a grass area on the side of the road. While they stood in the grass, Campbell again told Gomez that they were investigating \u201cbad heroin that had been laced with Fen-tanyl and firearms\u201d in Hartford, and Gomez replied that he did not \u201cknow anything about that.\u201d- App\u2019x 250; see also App\u2019x 48. \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b109-6\" pgmap=\"109\">According to Campbell, he then asked whether Gomez \u201cmind[ed]\u201d if \"Campbell searched the car, and Gomez replied \u201cno, you can go ahead ... [tjhere\u2019s nothing in there.\u201d App\u2019x 250; see also App\u2019x 50. While Schatz watched Gomez, Campbell conducted a search of the front passenger area and found a receipt from the Ramada Inn. The receipt, which displayed Gomez\u2019s name and home address,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> indicated a stay from March 17 to March 19 (the day before the stop) that was paid for in cash.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b109-7\" pgmap=\"109\">After Campbell found the receipt, he approached Gomez and asked \u201cif he had anything on his person.\u201d App\u2019x 253. Gomez replied that he did not. Campbell \u25a0 then conducted a pat-down and asked him to remove the items from his pockets. Gomez removed his wallet, which contained his license, and two Ramada Inn room keys from his pants pocket. With the receipt and room keys -in hand, Campbell asked Gomez if he had stayed at -the Ramada Inn. Gomez initially responded that he was not staying at the- -hotel, but that his friends were. When Campbell pressed Gomez as to why he had the keys if only his friends were staying there, Gomez admitted that he had been staying there as well.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b109-13\" pgmap=\"109\">Campbell then asked Gomez whether he had anything in the car\u2019s trunk,, and whether he \u201cmind[ed]\u201d if Campbell opened it. See App\u2019x 256-58; see also App\u2019x 58-59. According to both Campbell and Schatz, Gomez replied with.words to the .effect of \u201cgo ahead.\u201d App\u2019x 257-58, 312; see also App\u2019x 58-59, 176. When Campbell opened the trunk, he saw the black duffel bag that Gomez had carried out of the.hotel earlier, a large cardboard box, and several smaller cardboard boxes stamped with the words \u201cCity Vibe.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b109-14\" pgmap=\"109(48) 110(73)\">With the trunk open, Campbell asked whether Gomez \u201crhind[ed]\u201d if he opened the duffel bag. App\u2019x 256-58; see also App\u2019x 62-63. According to both Campbell and Schatz, Gomez said something al\u00f3ng the lines of \u201cno, but what are you looking for?\u201d App\u2019x 256, 258, 313'; see also App\u2019x 62-63, 177. Campbell opened the bag to find more than 13,000 baggies of heroin packaged for sale, a larger bag containing raw heroin, and other items used in packaging narcotics; in total, the duffel bag contained 378.6 grams of heroin. An East Hartford police officer who had arrived at the scene a few minutes earlier arrested Gomez. Gomez never received a citation for the traffic violations that he committed before the stop.</p> <p id=\"b110-4\" pgmap=\"110\">Campbell and Schatz testified that the entire stop\u2014from the moment Campbell pulled Gomez over to the moment he opened the duffel bag\u2014lasted about five minutes. App\u2019x 271, 318.</p> <p id=\"b110-5\" pgmap=\"110\">III. District Court Proceedings</p> <p id=\"b110-6\" pgmap=\"110\">In March 2014, a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut returned an indictment charging Gomez with one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). In June 2014, Gomez moved to suppress the heroin and drug-packaging materials, arguing that they were fruits of an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Relying on his own two-page affidavit, Gomez claimed that he did not commit traffic violations and did not consent to the searches of the car, its trunk, or the closed duffel bag. Therefore, Gomez argued that (i) the traffic stop was not supported by probable cause or reasonable suspicion, and (ii) the warrantless searches were executed without his consent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b110-7\" pgmap=\"110\">In November 2014, the district court (Burns, J.) held a suppression hearing during which Campbell and Schatz testified; Gomez did not testify.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With the district court\u2019s permission, Gomez supplemented his motion with a post-hearing brief in February 2015, arguing that Campbell\u2019s questions concerning the drug investigation were unrelated to the traffic violations and extended the traffic stop in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In March 2015, the presiding district judge retired without rendering a decision on Gomez\u2019s motion to suppress.</p> <p id=\"b110-12\" pgmap=\"110\">In June 2015, after the case was transferred to a different district judge (Hall, C.J.), the district court held a second suppression hearing. Two months before that resumed hearing, the Supreme Court decided Rodriguez v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 191 L.Ed.2d 492 (2015), but neither Gomez nor the Government filed a supplemental brief concerning Rodriguez before or after the second hearing. During the second hearing, Campbell and Schatz testified again, and the court heard oral argument. The parties and the district court did not discuss Rodriguez during the hearing, but they did discuss this Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Harrison, 606 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam).</p> <p id=\"b110-15\" pgmap=\"110(85) 111(51)\">In late June 2015, the district court issued a ruling denying Gomez\u2019s motion to suppress. See United States v. Gomez, No. 14-cr-63, 2015 WL 3936397, at *1-3 (D. Conn. June 26, 2015). First, as to Gomez\u2019s argument that the initial stop was unlawful, the district court credited the testimony of Campbell and Schatz, concluding that there was probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe that Gomez drove through a red light before entering the highway and was speeding on the highway.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id. at *2. Second, the district court rejected Gomez\u2019s argument that he did not consent to the searches notwithstanding his affidavit, again finding the testimony of Campbell and Schatz credible and \u201clargely consistent with each other, as well as with their prior testimony in the [first suppression] hearing.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b111-5\" pgmap=\"111\">Third, the district court concluded that Campbell did not unreasonably extend the traffic stop in violation of the Fourth Amendment, even though it acknowledged that he questioned Gomez about matters unrelated to the traffic violations. See id. at *2-8. The district court relied on this Court\u2019s holding in Harrison:</p> <blockquote id=\"b111-6\" pgmap=\"111\">The Second Circuit has previously found a stop of five to six minutes was not unlawfully prolonged, United States v. Harrison, 606 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2010), and other circuits have upheld longer intervals....</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b111-7\" pgmap=\"111\">There is no evidence on the record to contradict testimony by Detective Campbell and Special Agent Schatz that the stop lasted five minutes at most until Gomez was arrested. Based on the rec-. ord before it, the court finds that, while Gomez was questioned about matters unrelated to the traffic violation during this time period, such questioning did not unreasonably prolong the stop so as to render it unconstitutional.</blockquote> <p id=\"b111-8\" pgmap=\"111\">Id. at *3. The district court did not address the Government\u2019s alternative argument that independent reasonable suspicion of a drug offense justified extending the traffic stop for the narcotics questioning. See id. at *2-3.</p> <p id=\"b111-9\" pgmap=\"111\">After the district court denied his motion, in September 2016 Gomez conditionally pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that allowed him to appeal the district court\u2019s suppression ruling. In January 2016, the district court sentenced Gomez to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). After the district court entered judgment on January 8, 2016, Gomez timely appealed.</p> <p id=\"b111-12\" pgmap=\"111\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b111-13\" pgmap=\"111\"> \u201cOn appeal from a denial of a suppression motion, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its resolution of questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact de novo.\" United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 94-96 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, we also \u201cpay special deference to the district court\u2019s factual determinations going to witness credibility.\u201d United States v. Jiau, 734 F.3d 147, 161 (2d Cir. 2013).</p> <p id=\"b111-14\" pgmap=\"111\">Gomez raises three arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the officers unconstitutionally prolonged his traffic stop, a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Second, Gomez argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the initial stop was based on valid probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe he committed a traffic violation. Third, he challenges the veracity of the officers\u2019 testimony and the district court\u2019s factual finding that he verbally consented to the searches of the car, its trunk, and the closed duffel bag in the trunk.</p> <p id=\"b111-15\" pgmap=\"111\">I. Duration of the Traffic Stop</p> <p id=\"b111-16\" pgmap=\"111\">A. Traffic Stops after Rodriguez v. United States</p> <p id=\"b111-18\" pgmap=\"111(20) 112(129)\"> The Fourth Amendment guarantees \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures....\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. \u201cTemporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a \u2018seizure\u2019 of \u2018persons\u2019 within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment].\u201d Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Therefore, traffic stops must satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness limitation, which. \u201crequires that an officer making a traffic stop have probable cause or reasonable suspicion that \u00a1the person stopped has committed a traffic violation or is otherwise engaged in or about to be engaged in criminal activity,\u201d United States v. Stewart, 551 F.3d 187, 191 (2d Cir. 2009) (alterations and emphasis omitted).</p> <p id=\"b112-4\" pgmap=\"112\">1. Pre-Rodriguez Supreme Court Decisions.</p> <p id=\"b112-5\" pgmap=\"112\">A decade before Rodriguez v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 191 L.Ed.2d 492 (2015), the Supreme Court explained in Illinois v. Caballes that even when a traffic stop is based on; probable cause' or reasonable suspicion at the outset, \u201c[i]t is nevertheless clear that a seizure that is lawful at its inception can violate the Fourth Amendment if its manner of execution unreasonably infringes interest's protected by the Constitution.\u201d Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005). More specifically, \u201c[a] seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission/\u2019 Id.</p> <p id=\"b112-9\" pgmap=\"112\">In Caballes, the Court considered a ten-minute traffic stop for speeding where one officer led a narcotics-detection .\u2022 dog around the driver\u2019s car while a second officer simultaneously \u201cwas in the process of writing a warning ticket.\u201d Id. at 406,125 S.Ct, 834. The dog alerted to the presence of marijuana, and the driver was arrested and subsequently convicted of a state narcotics offense. Id. at 406-07,125 S.Ct. 834. The Court affirmed the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cconclusion that the duration of the stop ... was entirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop,\u201d and held that no Fourth Amendm\u00e9nt violation occurred. See id. at 408, 125 S.Ct. 834 (noting the state court had \u201ccarefully reviewed\u201d the details of the officer\u2019s conversations with the driver and the radio transmissions \u201ct'o determine whether he had improperly extended the duration of the stop to enable the dog sniff to occur\u201d),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b112-10\" pgmap=\"112(135) 113(34)\">A few years later, in Arizona v. Johnson, the Court further considered \u201c[a]n officer\u2019s inquiries into matters unrelated to the justification for the traffic stop.\u201d Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 333, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009). The Court explained'in Johnson that a stop remains lawful so long as such inquiries do not \u201cmeasurably extend the duration of the stop.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). In Johnson, during the time necessary for an officer to complete the processing of a traffic stop for a suspended vehicle registration, a different officer on the scene acquired reasonable suspicion that a passenger in. the back seat was armed and dangerous. Id. at 328, 129 S.Ct. 781. The officer frisked the passenger and found an unlawful handgun. Id. The passenger moved to suppress the handgun in the resulting criminal prosecution, but the Supreme Court concluded that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred because, in part, the traffic stop was not \u201cmeasur.ably extend[ed].\u201d Id, at 333,129 S.Ct. 781.</p> <p id=\"b113-5\" pgmap=\"113\">2. Circuit Courts Applying Johnson and Caballes</p> <p id=\"b113-6\" pgmap=\"113\">After Johnson and Caballes, several of our sister circuits determined whether unrelated investigations during otherwise lawful traffic stops \u201cmeasurably extended]\u201d such stops or prolonged them beyond the time \u201creasonably required\u201d to issue a ticket. See Johnson, 555 U.S. at 333, 129 S.Ct. 781; Caballes, 543 U.S. at 407, 125 S.Ct. 834. Rather than adopt a per se rule that any extension of a traffic stop for an unrelated investigation is unlawful, several circuits assessed the overall reasonableness of the stop\u2019s duration and the extension on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b113-7\" pgmap=\"113\">In particular, the Eighth Circuit developed a de minimis rule: a brief, minutes-long extension of a traffic stop to conduct an unrelated investigation, such as a dog sniff, is a de minimis intrusion on a driver\u2019s personal liberty that does not violate the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Alexander, 448 F.3d 1014, 1017 (8th Cir. 2006) (upholding four-minute delay as de minimis intrusion); United States v. Martin, 411 F.3d 998, 1000, 1002 (8th Cir. 2005) (upholding two-minute delay). The Fourth Circuit adopted a similar rule. See United States v. Farrior, 535 F.3d 210, 220 (4th Cir. 2008) (concluding that \u201cany delay in conducting ... drug-dog sniff amounted to .a de minimis intrusion on [driver\u2019s] liberty interest\u201d and was thus \u201cnot unreasonable as a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b113-10\" pgmap=\"113\">In United States v. Harrison, we applied Johnson and Caballes in the context of a traffic stop (for a defective license plate! light) that was' extended by officer questioning; a search of the car revealed a gun and, ultimately, crack cocaine. See United States v, Harrison, 606 F.3d 42, 44-45 (2d Cir. 2010) (per curiam). After the officer recognized the driver from previous traffic stops that had uncovered narcotics, he inquired about the driver\u2019s travels that night, then separately questioned the passengers to \u201csee if they would corroborate\u201d the driver\u2019s story, and then c\u00f3'n-fronted the driver with the conflicting account of one of the passengers.

Furthermore, while we did not expressly adopt the de minimis rule, we cited decisions from other circuits for the proposition that \u201cMonger intervals than five to six minutes have been deemed tolerable.\u201d Id.

Rodriguez</p> <p id=\"b114-5\" pgmap=\"114\">In Rodriguez v. United States, the Supreme Court rejected the Eighth Circuit\u2019s de minimis rule, holding that \u201ca police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution\u2019s shield against unreasonable seizures.\u201d Rodriguez v. United States, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1609, 1612, 191 L.Ed.2d 492 (2015). Rodriguez involved a seven or eight minute delay between the completion of a traffic stop, which had ended with a written warning, and a dog sniff that ultimately uncovered methamphetamine in the car. See id. at 1612-13.</p> <p id=\"b114-7\" pgmap=\"114\">Adopting findings made by a magistrate judge, the district court in Rodriguez found that the officer lacked independent reasonable suspicion of a drug offense to extend the detention once he issued the written warning, but it nevertheless denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that the seven-to-eight minute extension was \u201conly a de minimis intrusion on Rodriguez\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights and was therefore permissible.\u201d Id. at 1613-14. The Eighth Circuit affirmed, held that the delay was an acceptable de min-imis intrusion, and did not review the district court\u2019s finding that the officer lacked independent reasonable suspicion to extend the seizure. See id. at 1614.</p> <p id=\"b114-11\" pgmap=\"114\">The Supreme Court vacated the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment, beginning by explaining that \u201c[l]ike a Terry stop, the tolerable duration of police inquiries in the traffic-stop context is determined by the seizure\u2019s mission\u2014to address the traffic violation that warranted the stop and attend to related safety concerns.\u201d Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Acknowledging Caballes (dog sniff) and Johnson (questioning of a passenger by a different officer)\u2014in which the Court \u201cconcluded that the Fourth Amendment tolerated certain unrelated investigations that did not lengthen the roadside detention\u201d\u2014 the Court reiterated that \u201c[bjecause addressing the infraction is the purpose of the stop, it may last no longer than is necessary to effectuate that purpose.\u201d Id. (emphasis added) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, \u201c[ajuthority for the seizure ... ends when tasks tied to the traffic infraction are\u2014or reasonably should have been\u2014completed.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b114-12\" pgmap=\"114(68) 115(61)\">To be sure, the Court recognized that an officer \u201cmay conduct certain unrelated checks during an otherwise lawful traffic stop.\u201d Id. at 1615. But \u201che may not do so in a way that prolongs the stop, absent the reasonable suspicion ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individual.\u201d Id. Therefore, officers may conduct certain ordinary inquiries related to a traffic stop, such as \u201cchecking the driver\u2019s license, determining whether there are outstanding warrants against the driver, and inspecting the automobile\u2019s registration and proof of insurance,\u201d without independent reasonable suspicion of other crimes. Id. However, tasks not related to the traffic mission, such as dog sniffs or \u201c[o]n-scene investigation into other crimes,\u201d are unlawful if they prolong the stop absent independent reasonable suspicion. Id. at 1616.</p> <p id=\"b115-5\" pgmap=\"115\">In so holding, the Court emphasized that the \u201ccritical question\u201d is not whether the unrelated investigation \u201coccurs before or after the officer issues a ticket,\u201d but whether conducting the unrelated investigation \u201cprolongs\u2014ie., adds time to\u2014the stop.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the Court specifically rejected the Government\u2019s contention that an officer may \u201cincrementally\u201d prolong a stop to conduct an unrelated investigation \u201cso long as the officer is reasonably diligent in pursuing the traffic-related purpose of the stop, and the overall duration of the stop remains reasonable in relation to the duration of other traffic stops involving similar circumstances.\u201d Id. (alteration omitted). The Court explained that an officer does not \u201cearn bonus time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation\u201d by \u201ccompleting all traffic-related tasks expeditiously\u201d because \u201c[t]he reasonableness of a seizure ... depends on what the police in fact do.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b115-8\" pgmap=\"115\">The Court remanded to the Eighth Circuit, leaving open \u201c[t]he question whether reasonable suspicion of criminal activity justified detaining Rodriguez beyond completion of the traffic infraction investigation, ...\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>Id. at 1616-17.</p> <p id=\"b115-9\" pgmap=\"115\">On remand, the Eighth Circuit again affirmed, but it did not address reasonable suspicion of a drug offense.

Rather, it concluded that the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied because officers conducted the extended traffic stop in objectively reasonable reliance on binding circuit precedent at the time of the stop: the de minimis rule.

Rodriguez Abrogates Harrison</p> <p id=\"b115-14\" pgmap=\"115\"> We begin by addressing Gomez\u2019s contention that the district court erred by applying Harrison rather than Rodriguez,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> which the Supreme Court decided two months before the June 2015 suppression hearing.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b115-15\" pgmap=\"115(26) 116(10)\">Although at least one district court in this Circuit has recognized Rodriguez\u2019s abrogation of Harrison,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we have not yet had the opportunity to consider the issue. We conclude that Harrison \u215b holding does not survive Rodriguez,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b116-4\" pgmap=\"116\">We held in Harrison \u25a0 that unrelated questioning \u201csubsumed\u201d in a five-to-six minute traffic stop does not measurably prolong a stop so as to render it unconstitutional. See Harrison, 606 F.3d at 46. We explained that the Constitution demands only that a seizure remain reasonable, and that the five-to-six minute seizure was \u201cbrief\u2014shorter than intervals that \u201chave been deemed tolerable\u201d in other circuits. Id.</p> <p id=\"b116-5\" pgmap=\"116\">Iri Rodriguez, however, the Court held that a'police stop \u201cexceeding the time needed to handle the matter for which the stop was' made\u201d violates the Fourth Amendment absent independent' reasonable suspicion of another offens\u00e9. Rodriguez, 136 S.Ct. at 1612. Moreover, the \u201creasonableness of a seizure ... depends on what the police in fact do,\u201d rather than a comparison to the duration of a hypothetically expeditious seizure or the duration of a seizure in similar circumstances. See id. at 1616. Therefore, an officer may not obtain \u201cbonus time to pursue an unrelated criminal investigation,\u201d and if such an investigation does-in fact \u201cprolong[]\u2014ie., add[] time to\u2014the stop,\u201d the seizure is unconstitutional absent reasonable suspicion of the other offense. Id. (internal quo- \u25a0 tation marks omitted). In Harrison, even though the officer testified that he \u201chad all of the information needed to issue the traffic ticket\u201d (the stop\u2019s mission), he added time to the seizure by \u201capproaching] the [passengers] in the car to corroborate [the driver\u2019s] story\u201d\u2014an inquiry unrelated to the traffic violation. Harrison, 606 F.3d at 46. Based on the total length of the stop, we concluded that this extension was reasonable. See id. That conclusion, however, conflicts with, and thus must yield to, Rodriguez\u2019s, holding: unrelated inquiries that prolong or add time to a traffic stop violate the Fourth Amendment absent reasonable suspicion of a separate crime.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> See Rodriguez, 136 S.Ct. at 1616.</p> <p id=\"b116-9\" pgmap=\"116\">Accordingly, we conclude that Rodriguez abrogates Harrison, and that the district court therefore erred by applying Harrir son in denying Gomez\u2019s motion to suppress. See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *3 (noting that this Court \u201cfound a stop of. five to six minutes was not unlawfully prolonged\u201d, in Harrison, and that there was no evidence to contradict the testimony of Campbell arid Sch\u00e1tz that the stop lasted \u201cfive minutes at most\u201d).'</p> <p id=\"b116-10\" pgmap=\"116\">2, Gomez\u2019s Traffic Stop is Unconstitutional</p> <p id=\"b116-11\" pgmap=\"116(12) 117(60)\"> ' We conclude that Gomez\u2019s traffic stop violates the Fourth Amendment because Campbell\u2019s investigative inquiries unrelated to the traffic violations \u201cprolonged]\u2014i.e., add[ed] time to\u2014the stop.\u201d Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1616 (internal quotation marks omitted). In applying Rodriguez, we look to what Campbell \u201cin fact d[id],\u201d not whether \u201cthe overall duration of the stop remains reasonable in relation to the duration of other traffic stops involving similar circumstances.\u201d Id.</p> <p id=\"b117-5\" pgmap=\"117\">Although both Campbell and Schatz testified that the stop lasted no longer than five minutes, the district court\u2019s factual findings confirm that \u201cGomez was questioned about matters unrelated to the traffic violation[s] during this time period.\u201d Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *3 (emphasis added). The district court concluded, by \u2018applying Harrison, that these unrelated questions did not \u201cunreasonably\u201d prolong a concededly brief stop, but we have no doubt that Campbell\u2019s inquiries did in fact add time to the stop in violation of Rodriguez,</p> <p id=\"b117-6\" pgmap=\"117\">From the moment that Campbell first approached the black Honda, his questioning \u201cdetour[ed] from th[e] mission\u201d of the stop (Gomez\u2019s traffic violations) to the DEA\u2019s heroin-trafficking investigation. See Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1616. As Campbell stated on direct examination:</p> <blockquote id=\"b117-7\" pgmap=\"117\">Once [Gomez] complied and 'shut the vehicle off, he again asked me why he had been stopped. 'I told him that we were \u25a0 conducting an investigation into bad heroin as well as firearms within the city of Hartford. Then I also told him that, you know, I observed him travel[l]ing at a high rate of speed as well as travelling through the red lights.</blockquote> <p id=\"b117-8\" pgmap=\"117\">App\u2019x 248 (emphasis added). After Campbell asked for the car\u2019s registration (but notably not Gomez\u2019s license\u2014necessary to write a ticket), he asked Gomez who Joan Sanchez\u2014 the car\u2019s owner\u2014was married to, and Gomez responded that she was married to Alex Ortiz-Gomez (the suspected leader of the heroin-trafficking organization).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> When Campbell asked Gomez to exit the car, his inquiries again turned to \u201cbad heroin that had been laced with Fen-tanyl and firearms\u201d in Hartford. App\u2019x 250. Once Campbell searched the interior of the car and discovered the Ramada Inn receipt,, he conducted a pat-down, which produced the hotel room keys. With the receipt and room keys in hand, Campbell inquired whether Gomez was staying at the Ramada Inn, pressing him as to why he possessed the keys if only his friends were staying there. Finally, Campbell searched the car\u2019s trunk and the contents of the trunk.</p> <p id=\"b117-11\" pgmap=\"117(139) 118(45)\">These undisputed facts* demonstrate that Campbell spent much of the time of the stop, if not most of it, asking questions and executing searches related to the heroin investigation rather than conducting \u201cordinary inquiries incident to the traffic stop\u201d\u2014such as checking Gomez\u2019s license, determining whether ther\u00e9 were outstanding warrants for him, and inspecting the car\u2019s proof of insurance. See Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1615 (alteration omitted). Even assuming Gomez\u2019s detention lasted only five minutes, Campbell extended the Seizure to ask questions pertinent to \u201can unrelated Criminal investigation.\u201d Id. at 1616. Under Rodriguez, this violates the Fourth Amendment. See id. (explaining that reasonableness of stop depends on what officer in fact does rather than overall duration of stop in relation to other stops in similar circumstances). Just as an officer may riot earn \u201cbonus time\u201d to eon-duct inquiries for an unrelated criminal investigation by efficiently processing the matters related to the traffic stop, see id, an officer may not consume much of the time justified by the stop with inquiries about offenses unrelated to the reasons for \u25a0 the stop. '</p> <p id=\"b118-4\" pgmap=\"118\">The Government does not appear to dispute this conclusion, arguing only in passing that Campbell and Schatz \u201csimultaneously pursued the traffic violations and the heroin trafficking investigation.\u201d Ap-pellee\u2019s Br. 14. However, the record belies that argument. While Officer Campbell was initially questioning Gomez in the driver\u2019s seat of the black Honda, Agent Schatz had not even exited his car yet. And when Schatz did join them on the side of the road, he stood by and watched Gomez while Campbell questioned him and searched the car. This is not a situation where one officer expeditiously completed all traffic-related tasks while another officer questioned the driver or conducted a dog sniff without extending the stop. See Caballes, 543 U.S. at 406, 408, 125 S.Ct. 834 (declining to disturb state, court\u2019s conclusion that stop was not improperly extended where second officer \u201cimmediately\u201d responded to the scene of a stop and conducted dog sniff while first officer \u201cwas in the process of writing a warning ticket\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b118-5\" pgmap=\"118\"> The Government\u2019s principal argument, however, is that the extended traffic stop is lawful under Rodriguez because the officers possessed independent reasonable suspicion that Gomez was trafficking heroin. See Appellee\u2019s Br. 30-35; see also Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1615 (explaining that stop may not be prolonged to conduct unrelated investigation \u201cabsent the reasonable suspicion ordinarily demanded to justify detaining an individual\u201d). In so arguing, the Government contends that we should affirm on the basis of reasonable suspicion of a drug crime\u2014an issue that was litigated below but the district court did not reach. See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *2-3.</p> <p id=\"b118-7\" pgmap=\"118\"> \u201cIn general, \u2018a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u2019 \u201d Booking v.

United States v. Freeman, 735 F.3d 92, 95-96 (2d Cir. 2013). Here, in its opinion and order, the district court made only four factual findings, which related exclusively to the traffic violations, Gomez\u2019s consent to the searches, the duration of the stop, and the nature of the questioning during the stop.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *2-3. Accordingly, as to the factual portion of the reasonable suspicion issue, we are left with insufficient factual findings upon which to base a conclusion concerning reasonable suspicion. Moreover, the Government has not brought to our attention any \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d that would result from not reaching the reasonable suspicion issue here. See Baker, 239 F.3d at 420.

Gomez did not file a supplemental brief concerning Rodriguez or even bring that case to the district court\u2019s attention during the first suppression hearing. ;</p> <p id=\"b121-13\" pgmap=\"121(31) 122(35)\">After the first hearing, Gomez filed a supplemental brief in February 2015 (a month after the Supreme Court heard oral \u00e1rgument in Rodriguez) contending, for the first time, that Campbell unreasonably prolonged the stop.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In his supplemental brief, however, Gomez once again did not mention Rodriguez or argue that Harrison was wrongly decided; rather, he argued that Harrison was factually distinguishable from the stop here.</p> <p id=\"b122-4\" pgmap=\"122\">After the case was transferred to a different district judge with Gomez\u2019s motion pending, the district court held a second suppression hearing in June 2015, two months after the Supreme Court decided Rodriguez, In advance of the hearing, Gomez did not file a supplemental brief, nor did he discuss the Supreme Court\u2019s decision during the hearing. When the district court twice questioned his counsel about Harrison during the hearing, his counsel did not raise Rodriguez.</p> <p id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">Simply put, the first time Gomez argued that Harrison was no longer controlling precedent\u2014or even cited Rodrigue\u00ae\u2014\u00bfwas in his opening brief on appeal. We therefore conclude that the Government\u2019s failure to raise the good-faith exception prior to its brief on appeal was understandable. See In re Nortel, 539 F.3d at 133 (declining to consider argument not previously raised where party offered \u201cno reason\u201d for failure to present argument earlier).</p> <p id=\"b122-6\" pgmap=\"122\">Accordingly, under these circumstances, we will exercise our discretion to consider the Government\u2019s good-faith argument, and we conclude that the exception applies because the officers conducted Gomez\u2019s five-minute traffic stop in objectively reasonable reliance on our then-binding precedent in Harrison. Therefore, although Rodriguez abrogates Harrison, and Gomez\u2019s traffic stop was unlawfully extended absent independent reasonable suspicion in violation of Rodriguez, the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies.</p> <p id=\"b122-8\" pgmap=\"122\">II. Legality of the Initial Stop</p> <p id=\"b122-9\" pgmap=\"122\"> Gomez also contends that the traffic stop was unlawful at its inception because Campbell did not have valid probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe he committed a traffic violation. See Stewart, 551 F.3d at 191. Although we \u201canalyze de novo the ultimate determination of such legal issues as probable cause,\u201d United States v. Howard, 489 F.3d 484, 490-91 (2d Cir. 2007), Gomez challenges the district court\u2019s factual finding (and corresponding credibility determination) that the stop was justified by at least one traffic violation. See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *2 (\u201cThe court finds that [the officers\u2019] testimony was credible and supports a finding that they had probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Gomez had committed a traffic violation.\u201d). Accordingly, Gomez concedes that we review the district court\u2019s finding for clear error. Appellant\u2019s Br. 17, 24; see Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 94-95.</p> <p id=\"b122-10\" pgmap=\"122\">Based on our review of the testimony during both suppression hearings and the contemporaneous radio communications, we conclude that the district court committed no error, clear or otherwise, in finding that Campbell had probable cause or reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop. Campbell and Schatz testified consistently with each other across both hearings that Gomez drove through a red light before entering the highway. Moreover, the radid communications corroborate their testimony. Additionally, they both testified repeatedly\u2014again corroborated by the radio communications\u2014that Gomez was speeding while on the highway.</p> <p id=\"b122-11\" pgmap=\"122(25) 123(14)\">Faced with this evidence, Gomez raises two arguments to. challenge the district court\u2019s credibility determination. See Jiau, 734 F.3d at 151 (explaining that we \u201cpay special deference\u201d to a district court\u2019s factual determinations \u201cgoing to witness credibility\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b123-5\" pgmap=\"123\"> First, Gomez points to certain radio transmissions Campbell made (before Gomez even ran the red light entering the highway) indicating that the officers \u201cdefinitely\u201d needed to stop him. See App\u2019x 202 at 13:39-14:46. Based on Campbell\u2019s statements, Gomez argues that the officers intended to stop him \u201cno matter what\u2014even if they had to manufacture a traffic violation in order to do so.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 30. This argument is unpersuasive. As an initial matter, it is well established that \u201can officer\u2019s use of a traffic violation as a pretext to stop a car in order to obtain evidence for some more serious crime is of no constitutional significance.\u201d United States v. Dhinsa, 171 F.3d 721, 724-25 (2d Cir. 1998); see Whren, 517 U.S. at 813-14, 116 S.Ct. 1769. Moreover, when confronted during the suppression hearing with these pre-violation statements, such as needing to \u201cdefinitely ... take a shot at [Gomez],\u201d Campbell explained:</p> <blockquote id=\"b123-6\" pgmap=\"123\">Everybody was aware of the nature of our investigation. When we saw [Gomez] leave with a bag, I wanted everybody to be available if an opportunity to conduct a traffic stop or anything else presented itself. Meaning if he conducts any violations that we [a]re going to conduct a motor vehicle traffic stop for everybody to be aware.</blockquote> <p id=\"b123-7\" pgmap=\"123\">App\u2019x 236 (emphasis added). The district court, which listened to the radio communications, did not clearly err in crediting Campbell\u2019s explanation. See United States v. Delva, 858 F.3d 135, 160 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that where \u201cthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b123-10\" pgmap=\"123\"> Second, Gomez urges us to conclude that Campbell \u201coffered false testimony\u201d about Gomez\u2019s purported third traffic violation\u2014turning right at a red light without stopping after exiting the highway\u2014in order to cast doubt on Campbell\u2019s testimony as to the other two violations. Appellant\u2019s Br. 32. Although Campbell\u2019s testimony about the third violation may be inconsistent and contradicted by Schatz\u2019s account, Gomez\u2019s argument is insufficient to disturb the district court\u2019s finding for two reasons. First, we pay special deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determination, see Jiau, 734 F.3d at 151, and \u201ca factfinder who determines that a witness has been .,. contradictory ... in some respects may nevertheless find the witness entirely credible in the essentials of his testimony.\u201d United States v. Delacruz, 862 F.3d 163, 176 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the district court expressly based its finding on only the first and second traffic violations\u2014the red light before entering the highway and the speeding while on the highway. See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *2. Again, both officers testified consistently, corroborated by the radio communications, about those two violations. At the very least, the district court\u2019s conclusion is supported by a permissible view of the evidence and thus is not clearly erroneous. See Delva, 858 F.3d at 160.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b124-3\" pgmap=\"124\">Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in finding that Gomez\u2019s traffic stop was based on valid probable cause or reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation.</p> <p id=\"b124-4\" pgmap=\"124\">III. Consent to the Searches</p> <p id=\"b124-5\" pgmap=\"124\"> Finally, Gomez argues that the district court committed dear - error in crediting the officers\u2019 testimony and finding that Gomez verbally consented to Campbell\u2019s searches of (i) the interior of the black Honda, (ii) its trunk, and (iii) the closed duffel bag in the trunk. His argument is Unavailing,</p> <p id=\"b124-6\" pgmap=\"124\"> It is \u201cwell settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent.\u201d Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The existence and scope of a \u25a0 defendant\u2019s consent is a question of fact we review for clear error, and the \u201c[G]overnment has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent to search was voluntary.\u201d United States v. Gandia, 424 F.3d 255, 265 (2d Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Guerrero, 813 F.3d 462, 467 (2d Cir. 2016) (\u201cWe fio not reverse a finding of voluntary consent except for clear error.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b124-7\" pgmap=\"124\"> Here, based on the record of the suppression hearings and the district court\u2019s credibility findings, we encounter no such error. \u25a0 See Gomez, 2015 WL 3936397, at *2 (\u201cThe court finds [the officers\u2019] testimony credible. Thus, notwithstanding Gomez\u2019s sworn statement to the contrary, the court finds that he did consent to the search of his vehicle, including the trunk ,...\u201d (footnote omitted)). Both Campbell and Schatz testified .consistently during two hearings that Gomez verbally consented three separate times: first, to the search of the car\u2019s passenger area; second, to the search of the trunk; and third, to the search of the closed duffel bag in the trunk. We conclude that, the district court committed no error in finding that Gomez consented to the three searches.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b124-10\" pgmap=\"124\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b124-11\" pgmap=\"124\">We conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Rodriguez abrogates our holding in Harrison, and that the extension of Gomez\u2019s traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless,-the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule applies because the. officers reasonably relied on our then-binding precedent. As to Gomez\u2019s remaining arguments, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the initial traffic stop was valid' and that Gomez consented to the searches. We therefore AFFIRM the-judgment of the district court. .</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b107-8\" pgmap=\"107\">. This opinion has been circulated to all the judges of the Court prior to filing,</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b107-9\" pgmap=\"107\">. Unless otherwise noted, the following background is drawn from the testimony of Campbell and Schatz during the June 2015 suppression hearing, the second suppression hearing that was held due to the retirement of the district judge originally assigned to this case. In denying Gomez\u2019s motion to suppress, the district court credited their testimony as to the issues of (i) a traffic violation, (ii) Gomez\u2019s consent to the searches, (iii) the duration of the stop, and (iv) the nature of the questioning during the stop.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b107-14\" pgmap=\"107\">.

The precise order of Campbell's initial statements to Gomez is not entirely clear, as he testified during the November 2014 suppres- \u25a0 sion hearing that h&amp; first notified the-Gomez about his traffic violations and \u201c[t]hen ... told [Gomez] that [the officers] were doing an investigation involving heroin and firearms...,\u201d App\u2019x 47-48. Furthermore, on cross-examination during the suppression hearings, Campbell admitted that he \"may\" have initially told Gomez, untruthfully, that he was stopped because he fit the description of someone involved in a shooting.

According to Campbell, traffic from the nearby intersection was passing on the driver\u2019s side, and he therefore asked,-Gomez to exit the Honda,for safety purposes.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"9\"> <p id=\"b109-10\" pgmap=\"109\">.

Harrison from Rodriguez are unpersuasive. First, although Harrison involved questioning while Rodriguez involved a dog sniff, the Court treated both as investigations unrelated to the traffic stop\u2019s mission. See Rodriguez, 135 S.Ct. at 1614 .(noting that Johnson (questioning) and Caballes (dog sniff) both involved unrelated investigations); see also id. at 1616 (\"On-scene investigation into other crimes .... detours from [a traffic stop\u2019s] mission.\u201d). Second, the fact that the questioning in Harrison occurred before a ticket was issued (no ticket was ultimately issued, it seems) while the dog sniff in Rodriguez followed the issuance of a ticket is of no. moment because in both situations, unrelated investigations extended the seizure.. As the Court explained in Rodriguez, \u201d[t]he critical question . . is not whether the [unrelated investigation]- occurs before or after the officer issues a ticket ... but whether conducting the sniff prolongs\u2014i.e., adds time to\u2014the stop.\u201d Id. (citations arid internal quotation marks omitted).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"25\"> <p id=\"b117-9\" pgmap=\"117\">. This is an unusual question for a traffic stop.that, under Rodriguez, must be.focused 'on the traffic violations that justified the stop.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"26\"> <p id=\"b119-6\" pgmap=\"119\">. Specifically, the district court made the following findings: (i) \u201cthat [the officers] had probable cause or reasonable suspicion that Gomez had committed a traffic violation;\u201d (ii) \"that [Gomez] did consent to the search of his vehicle, including the trunk;\u201d (iii) \u201cthat the process was reasonable in time, and that the officer\u2019s unrelated inquiries did not measurably extend'the duration of the stop;\u201d and (iv) \"[that] Gomez was questioned about matters unrelated to the traffic violation during th[e] [stop].\u201d App\u2019x 339-40, 342 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"27\"> <p id=\"b119-7\" pgmap=\"119\">. If it reached the issue, the district court could have\u2014had it made more detailed findings of fact\u2014found that there was reasonable suspicion to extend the stop. Setting aside what occurred during the traffic stop\u2014which may have been unlawfully extended from its outset\u2014the officers testified that prior to the stop they observed: Gomez leave an address associated with Ortiz-Gomez (the suspected leader of a heroin-trafficking organization); drive to a second address associated with Ortiz-Gomez; quickly change cars; drive away in a car that had been previously stopped with Ortiz-Gomez and $80,000 in cash; drive to a hotel just miles away from the two addresses; exit the hotel minutes later carrying a weighted duffel bag that he was not carrying previously; and, before driving away, place the duffel bag in the car's trunk (rather than its passenger compartment). See supra at 81-82. In other words, a pretextual stop and reasonable suspicion are not mutually exclusive; an officer may conduct a pretextual stop based on a traffic violation and then, in full compliance with Rodriguez, extend the stop if the officer develops reasonable suspicion based on the actions of a driver or passenger either (i) before the stop, or (ii) during traffic-related processing of the stop. But again, an officer may not extend an otherwise lawful stop for non-traffic related purposes absent reasonable suspicion of another offense.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"28\"> <p id=\"b120-7\" pgmap=\"120\">. Gomez has not argued-that this variation of the -good-faith exception does not also apply to seizures, as opposed to searches, conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent. See Davis, 564 U.S. at 231-32, 131 S.Ct. 2419 (noting that the Court created the exclusionary rule as a deterrent sanction to bar the introduction of evidence \"obtained by way of d Fourth Amendment violation\u201d (emphasis added)).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"29\"> <p id=\"b120-8\" pgmap=\"120\">.
