BEFORE: ROGERS, TATEL, and MILLETT, Circuit Judges .</judges> <opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b1088-17\" pgmap=\"1088\">ORDER</p> <author id=\"b1088-18\" pgmap=\"1088\">PER CURIAM .</author> <p id=\"b1088-19\" pgmap=\"1088\">Upon consideration of the emergency motion for an injunction pending .appeal and for expedited consideration of this appeal, the response thereto, and the reply, it is '</p> <p id=\"b1088-20\" pgmap=\"1088\">ORDERED that the motion for a mandatory injunction pending appeal be denied. Appellant has not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal. See John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017); D.C. Circuit Handbook of Practice and Internal Procedures 33 (2017).</p> <p id=\"b1088-22\" pgmap=\"1088(25) 1089(43)\">Appellant\u2019s motion for an injunction pending appeal centers on an as-applied claim of unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Specifically, Appellant contends that the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\u2019s (\u201cWMATA\u201d) policy governing the placement of advertisements on its buses permits advertisements discussing and promoting secular holiday activities, but disallows advertisements promoting religious activities during the holiday season or a religious perspective on celebration of the holiday season.</p> <p id=\"b1089-4\" pgmap=\"1089\">Appellant has failed to establish a substantial likelihood of success because, at least at this early pre-discovery procedural stage, Appellant\u2019s argument of discriminatory treatment is grounded in pure hypothesis. Appellant has not come forward with a single example of a retail, commercial, or other non-religious advertisement on a WMATA bus that expresses the view that the holiday season should be celebrated in a secular or non-religious manner. Appellant references a CorePower Yoga advertisement, but that advertisement contains no discernible holiday, seasonal, religious, or irreligious content. Appellant also points to a WMATA-permitted Salvation Army advertisement encouraging donations to its seasonal Red Kettle campaign so that funds can be used to help the less fortunate. That advertisement underscores, however, that WMATA does not exclude religious speakers from advertising when their proposed messages comport with the allowed categories of speech. Neither does anything in that advertisement suggest that WMATA is discriminating against a religious perspective on worthwhile eleemosynary activities; in fact, it indicates the opposite.</p> <p id=\"b1089-5\" pgmap=\"1089\">Appellant repeatedly cites a statement in WMATA\u2019s district court papers proposing a \u201csecular half\u2019 and \u201creligious half\u2019 to Christmas celebrations. See WMATA Opp\u2019n to TRO or Prelim. Inj., Dist. Ct. Docket # 10, at 14-15 n.3. The citation, however, refers to a footnoted legal argument made by counsel addressing an argument in the alternative. Appellant identifies no basis for concluding that the defendant WMATA applied any such test in denying Appellant\u2019s proposed advertisement, or that WMATA has actually made Christmas or the holiday season a permissible subject of advertising. Cf. Grossbaum v. Indianapolis-Marion County Building Auth., 63 F.3d 581, 588 (7th Cir. 1995) (where City had \u201crecogniz[ed] the \u2018holiday season\u2019 as a topic of discussion\u201d in a forum, religious perspectives on that allowed topic could not be excluded).</p> <p id=\"b1089-8\" pgmap=\"1089\">Positing next that WMATA\u2019s advertising ban is arbitrarily enforced, Appellant argues that WMATA allowed a Christian radio station to advertise on the side of its buses. But the advertisements identified by Appellant were on unidentified non-WMATA buses. Mem. Op. at 33 n,20. And while WMATA admits that it did allow that same radio station to advertise on its buses in April 2017, the record is silent as to the content of those advertisements.</p> <p id=\"b1089-9\" pgmap=\"1089\">With respect to Appellant\u2019s facial challenge to WMATA\u2019s decision to exclude religion as an advertising subject, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the government may impose reasonable limitations on the subjects for discussion in a limited public forum, so no substantial likelihood of success in demonstrating WMATA\u2019s unreasonableness has yet been shown at this procedural stage. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 831, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) (noting that the University policy \u201cdoes not exclude religion as a subject matter,\u201d but instead unconstitutionally foreclosed religious perspectives on permitted subjects).</p> <p id=\"b1089-11\" pgmap=\"1089(43) 1090(60)\">Finally, Appellant has failed to demonstrate any substantial burden on its ability to freely exercise its religious beliefs. Although WMATA has declined one proposed advertisement, Appellant has not demonstrated how, in the absence of viewpoint discrimination, that decision substantially burdens Appellant\u2019s ability to exercise its religion. See Branch Ministries v. Rossotti, 211 F.3d 137, 142-43 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Because Appellant has not shown a likelihood of success on its free speech or free exercise claims, it follows that its hybrid-rights claim must fail as well. See Henderson v. Kennedy, 253 F.3d 12, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2001).</p> <p id=\"b1090-4\" pgmap=\"1090\">In denying the injunction pending appeal, we emphasize the preliminary nature of this order, which does not speak to the ultimate merits of any of Appellant\u2019s claims on a more mature record. It is</p> <p id=\"b1090-5\" pgmap=\"1090\">FURTHER ORDERED that the following expedited briefing schedule will apply in this case:</p> <p id=\"b1090-7\" pgmap=\"1090\">January 12, 2018 Appellant\u2019s Brief and Appendix</p> <p id=\"ASRu\" pgmap=\"1090\">Appellees\u2019 Brief February 6, 2018</p> <p id=\"ana-dedup-1\" pgmap=\"1090\">Reply Brief February 16, 2018</p> <p id=\"b1090-9\" pgmap=\"1090\">The Clerk is directed to schedule this1 case for oral argument on the first available date following the completion of briefing.</p> <p id=\"b1090-10\" pgmap=\"1090\">To enhance the clarity of their briefs, the parties are urged to limit the use of abbreviations, including acronyms. While acronyms may be used for entities and statutes with widely recognized initials, briefs should not contain acronyms that are not widely known. See D.C. Circuit Handbook of Practice and Internal Procedures 41 (2017); Notice Regarding Use of Acronyms (D.C. Cir. Jan. 26, 2010).</p> <p id=\"b1090-12\" pgmap=\"1090\">Parties are strongly encouraged to hand deliver the paper copies of their briefs to the Clerk\u2019s office on the date due. Filing by mail may delay the processing of the brief. Additionally, counsel are reminded that if filing by mail, they must use a class of mail that is at least as expeditious as first-class mail. See Fed. R. App. P. 25(a), All briefs and appendices must contain the date that the case is scheduled for oral argument at the top of the cover. See D.C. Cir. Rule 28(a)(8).</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
