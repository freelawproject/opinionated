His Guidelines range was 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, and both the government and the Probation Office recommended \u2018 a within-Guidelines sentence. The district court, however, sentenced Singh to a term of imprisonment, of 60 months\u2014nearly three times the top of the Guidelines range.</p> <p id=\"b136-21\" pgmap=\"136\">Singh appeals, contending that the sentence was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the sentence and remand- for further proceedings. Singh\u2019s request that we order reassignment of the case to a different judge is denied.</p> <p id=\"b136-22\" pgmap=\"136\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"Aj6\" pgmap=\"136\">A. The Facts</p> <p id=\"b136-23\" pgmap=\"136\">The facts are largely undisputed and are summarized as follows:</p> <p id=\"b136-24\" pgmap=\"136\">1. Singh\u2019s Personal History</p> <p id=\"b136-25\" pgmap=\"136(49) 137(35)\">Singh was born in Guyana on September 9,1971, and has never been a citizen of the United States. He was one of five children, and he and his family moved to the United States when he was still a child. After residing with Singh\u2019s uncle in Florida for a year, the- family moved to New York City. Although his parents separated, they both still live in the Bronx. Three of his siblings also live in the Bronx, and one lives in upstate New York.</p> <p id=\"b137-5\" pgmap=\"137\">In 1997, Singh married a woman who was a permanent resident of the United States. Together they had a daughter, now approximately seventeen years old. Before his arrest, he lived with his wife and their daughter in the Bronx and had a positive relationship with both.</p> <p id=\"b137-6\" pgmap=\"137\">2. The Offense Conduct</p> <p id=\"b137-7\" pgmap=\"137\">Singh was convicted in. the Southern District of New York of larceny and postal theft on February 22, 1995. He was thereafter sentenced to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. The conviction qualified as an aggravated felony within the meaning of 8 U.S.C, \u00a7 1326(b). On December 21, 2004, an immigration judge ordered Singh removed from the United States, and he was eventually removed from the country on April 9, 2010.</p> <p id=\"b137-8\" pgmap=\"137\">At some point after his removal, Singh illegally reentered the United States, and he was arrested by the New York City Police Department (the \u201cNYPD\u201d) in the Bronx on February 9, 2012. On March 21, 2012, he was again ordered removed from the country based on the reinstatement of his earlier removal order. On May 16, 2012, he was once again removed from the United States.</p> <p id=\"b137-9\" pgmap=\"137\">, At some point thereafter, Singh illegally reentered the United States again, as on June 26, 2014, he was arrested, once again, by the NYPD in the Bronx. This was his second illegal reentry into this country. Federal agents took him into custody on July 21,2015.</p> <p id=\"b137-12\" pgmap=\"137\">3. Singh\u2019s Criminal History</p> <p id=\"AXl\" pgmap=\"137\">In addition to the 1995 conviction for larceny and-postal theft, Singh had been convicted of seven other crimes when he appeared for sentencing in this case:</p> <blockquote id=\"b137-13\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 a conviction in-1993 for possession of stolen property (stolen mail) for which he was sentenced to a $100 fine;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-14\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 two convictions in 1994 for receiving stolen- property for which' he was sen-fenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 3 months and- home confinement of 3 months; '</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-16\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 a conviction in 2002 for forgery for which he received a conditional discharge and was sentenced to a $500 ' fine;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> </blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-18\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 a conviction in 2002 for petit l\u00e1rceny for which he received a conditional discharge;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-19\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 a conviction in 2012 for shoplifting for which he was sentenced to time served (72 days) and 10 hours of community service; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b137-20\" pgmap=\"137\">\u2022 a conviction in 2014 for petit larceny for which he received a conditional discharge.</blockquote> <p id=\"b137-21\" pgmap=\"137\">B. The Proceedings Below</p> <p id=\"AZP\" pgmap=\"137(64) 138(29)\">In an indictment filed August 17, 2015, Singh was charged with one count of illegal reentry into the United' States after having been removed following a conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). On December 21, 2015, Singh appeared before Magistrate Judge Henry B. Pitman and pleaded guilty &gt;to the sole count of the Indictment, -without a plea agreement. Judge Pitman recommended that the district court accept the plea. The district court accepted the plea by order filed January 12, 2016.</p> <p id=\"b138-4\" pgmap=\"138\">On March 18, 2016, the Probation Office submitted a Presentence Investigation Report (the \u201cPSR\u201d) in anticipation of sentencing. The Probation Office computed the Total Offense Level as 13, based on a base level for illegal reentry of 8; an 8-level increase because Singh was deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony; and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The PSR noted that Singh had \u201cclearly demonstrated acceptance of responsibility for the offense\u201d and had \u201cassisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of [his] own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of the intention enter a plea of guilty.\u201d PSR, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37. The Probation Office noted that Singh had eight prior convictions, as discussed above, but concluded that the convictions resulted in only three criminal history points, placing Singh in Criminal History Category II. Six of the eight convictions carried zero criminal history points.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(l), (2), (3). The PSR calculated a Guidelines range of imprisonment of 15 to 21 months and recommended a sentence of 21 months.</p> <p id=\"b138-6\" pgmap=\"138\">Singh submitted a sentencing memorandum, with attachments, including letters from his family, and requested a below-Guidelines sentence of time served (he had served almost nine months). The government submitted a sentencing letter requesting a sentence \u201cwithin the applicable Guidelines range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment,\u201d stating that \u201csuch a sentence would be sufficient but not greater than necessary to serve the legitimate purposes of sentencing.\u201d App. at 79, 82, The government agreed with the Probation Office\u2019s calculation of Singh\u2019s recommended sentence, which included a three-level reduction \u201cbased on the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d Id. at 80.</p> <p id=\"b138-7\" pgmap=\"138\">By letter dated February 16, 2016, Singh wrote directly to the district court. The letter stated in part as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b138-8\" pgmap=\"138\">Your Honor I\u2019m So Sorry For my Action or wrongdoing. I\u2019ve Realise my Action were wrong. I\u2019ve causes the courts and the citizen of United States, Also my Family allot of pain and trouble. Your Honor I\u2019ve Hurts my Daughter, wife, mother, Father and Family Feeling so much.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b138-9\" pgmap=\"138(30) 139(27)\">Your Honor at the time of all my conviction in the past, I\u2019ve allot of Bad Friend and Company who I follow and do bad thing. Your Honor I wasn\u2019t thinking what I was getting into or doing. I Follow my Friend and take thing playful and Funny. Your Honor I was Foolise, selfish and dumb.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-5\" pgmap=\"139\">Your Honor I Came Back to United States Because I was Fear for my life. I was in Danger in Guyana which I was attack, Beaten up, Robbed and threatened to Be kill for my money and other thing.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-6\" pgmap=\"139\">Your Honor I\u2019ve No family in Guyana. My wife, child, Mother, Father and all my sister and Brother are Residing in the United States. Your Honor I was all alone in Guyana and Scare.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"pAqW\" pgmap=\"139\">[[Image here]]</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-7\" pgmap=\"139\">Your Honor I only Came Back Because I was in Danger and Fear For my life and to Be with my Family. I\u2019m sorry for Breaking the law. I\u2019m Begging for another chance. Please my only Daughter is very worry about what\u2019s going to happen to her Father.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b139-8\" pgmap=\"139\">Your Honor these long Jail months have taught me hard lesson, not to do anything wrong again. Your Honor From my heart I promise I will not Break the Law again For the sake of my daughter and Family.</blockquote> <p id=\"b139-9\" pgmap=\"139\">App. at 76-78.</p> <p id=\"b139-10\" pgmap=\"139\">Sentencing proceeded on April 8, 2016. That morning, the district court issued an order notifying the parties that it was \u201cseriously considering an upwards variance in connection with the sentencing of Mr. Singh.\u201d App. at 83.</p> <p id=\"b139-11\" pgmap=\"139\">At the sentencing, the district court adopted the factual findings set forth in the PSR. The district court then explained that it was not \u201cinclined\u201d to allow Singh a deduction for acceptance of responsibility because of certain statements Singh made in his letter: first, Singh\u2019s statement that he reentered because he feared for his life \u201cappear[ed] to indicate his attempt to avoid responsibility for the crime,\u201d and, second, his statements that \u201che had been under the influence of bad friends\u201d and had \u201cdone things thinking they were playful and funny\u201d and that he had been \u201cfoolish and selfish\u201d demonstrated that Singh \u201ccertainly does attempt to avoid responsibility for the aggravated felony.\u201d App. at 90-92.</p> <p id=\"b139-13\" pgmap=\"139\">As to Singh\u2019s statements that he had been threatened in Guyana, defense counsel represented that \u201c[f]rom day one Mr. Singh has told me and my office that he was attacked, robbed, and in danger down in Guyana and that was a portion of his motivation for returning.\u201d App. at 99. Counsel represented that \u201cMr. Singh has never said otherwise. In fact, he has been explicit and clear about the threats that he was under in Guyana. He was robbed, beaten with a gun and put in [a] hospital in Guyana.\u201d Id. Counsel further reported that Guyanese of Indian descent who returned to Guyana were often targeted for robberies, especially after having lived in the United States. Counsel explained that he did not \u201cfocus\u201d on these issues in his sentencing submission because the information was uncorroborated. The district court responded to defense counsel by stating \u201cI accept your statement.\u201d Id. at 100.</p> <p id=\"b139-14\" pgmap=\"139(109) 140(26)\">The district court then advised the parties that it had determined to give Singh the acceptance of responsibility deduction, noting \u201cI don\u2019t want to create an appeal point relating to whether or not [USSG \u00a7 ] 1B1.3, relevant conduct, will or will not, in an illegal reentry situation, include certain things related to an aggravated felony.\u201d Id. The district judge stated, however, that \u201cI will consider the various issues that I have with acceptance of responsibility under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3563(a), in light of all the information.\u201d App. at 100. The district court concluded, as the PSR had recommended and the parties agreed, that the Guidelines calculation was a Total Offense Level of 13 and a Criminal History Category of II for a range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p> <p id=\"b140-4\" pgmap=\"140\">The district court and the parties then turned to a discussion of the \u00a7 3563(a) sentencing factors. In the end, the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court explained as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"APM\" pgmap=\"140\">I do not. see this as a heartland \u2022 case for illegal reentry. I see this as .a case where we have a defendant who has repeatedly harmed the public. While he has not engaged in drug offenses or violent offenses, the kinds of crimes he is engaged in relate to a variety of conduct which is harmful, and it is harmful to members of the public. The public shouldn\u2019t be exposed to it, It\u2019s repeated and it\u2019s repeated so often and so brazenly that I do not have any hope. I have no expectation, frankly, that it could stop. I don\u2019t know what the issue may be that\u2019s causing it. ...</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-8\" pgmap=\"140\">I don\u2019t believe he can live here honest\u25a0ly. I don\u2019t believe he has any right to live in this country at all. I believe that \u25a0 he has no right to be present on U.S. soil. I think he should be deported back to Guyana and he can make his life in Guyana as he deems appropriate. It .could.have been different, but it\u2019s not.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A4yN\" pgmap=\"140\">I. think reentry -for him in terms of personal deterrence, .it plays a very, very important role in his sentence. I . think reentry -is highly likely. Indeed I . would say that I.think reentry is.almost certain, an attempt at.reentry is almost .certain for this.defendant.,He has done it two times before. There is nothing at all in the record at.all to indicate he wouldn\u2019t do it agajn. ....</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-13\" pgmap=\"140\">I do take into consideration the fact that this defendant has spent the majority of his life in the United States. It is also the fact that I take into consideration that he has spent the majority of . his adult life- back and forth. He has committed a lot of crimes and he has \u25a0 had a lot of opportunities to lead a different life. So all of these factors I take into consideration. ...</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A4r\" pgmap=\"140\">... I put out the notice this morning that the court was considering an upward variance, a variance because I do not believe, as I\u2019ve said before, that the guidelines appropriately take into consideration the totality of the. circumstances that are at issue here with the defendant\u2019s background, with the prior leniency that\u2019s been shown to the defendant, with his multiple reentries. So it\u2019s not just a single reentry after a single aggravated felony. It\u2019s actually more than that. And I do believe that the consistent history of his crimes indicates that there is' a very high likelihood of recidivism. I think it\u2019s an unusually high likelihood of recidivism.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b140-16\" pgmap=\"140\">Since I\u2019m convinced that he will reenter and commit more crimes, I do believe there is some need for and a strong need for incapacitation for some period of time. In other words, I do not believe that deportation right now actually serves the public interest. I believe that the public interest in this country is best served by a period of incapacitation, which will prevent reentry. ...</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"AzS1\" pgmap=\"140\">I believe that time served, something that would then send this defendant on now to the immigration authorities and into immigration custody, would be the wrong message. It would be the wrong message and I think it would be most likely to inspire the defendant and in-.cent the defendant to return, I also think that 21 months, which is the guidelines range, is far too little to achieve the goals .that I am considering necessary under all of the factors under 3553(a).</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b141-4\" pgmap=\"141\">Based upon the particular facts and circumstances relating to this defendant, having thought long and hard about all of the facts and circumstances of this defendant, I do believe that a sentence of 60 months is appropriate. A period of 60 months is a sufficient but not greater than necessary sentence. It is an upwards variance.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"A79A\" pgmap=\"141\">However, it does provide the incapacitation which this court believes is absolutely necessary to prevent the nearly immediate reentry which I believe'will occur.</blockquote> <p id=\"b141-6\" pgmap=\"141\">App. at 109,112-17.</p> <p id=\"b141-7\" pgmap=\"141\">The district court entered judgment on April 11, 2016. On April 20, 2016, Singh\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the district court requesting a recommendation that the Bureau of Prisons designate Singh to the Moshannon Valley Correctional Center in Pennsylvania. By memorandum endorsement dated the same day, the district court denied the request, writing that \u201cApplications for designation should generally be made at-the time of sentencing,\u201d and stating:-\u201cThe Court will not now, for this defendant, make such a recommendation.\u201d App. at 123.</p> <p id=\"b141-8\" pgmap=\"141\">This appeal followed.</p> <p id=\"b141-9\" pgmap=\"141\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b141-10\" pgmap=\"141\">A. Applicable Law</p> <p id=\"b141-11\" pgmap=\"141\"> We review a sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion, standard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 562 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 446 (2007); see United States v. Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d 265, 278 (2d Cir. 2012) (\u201cour standard is \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 \u2018a particularly deferential form of abuse-of-discretion review\u2019 \u201d) (quoting United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 188 &amp; n.5 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc)); accord United States v. Thavaraja, 740 F.3d 253, 258 (2d Cir. 2014)..</p> <p id=\"b141-13\" pgmap=\"141\"> A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court \u201cfails to calculate (or improperly calculates) the Sentencing Guidelines - range, treats the Sentencing Guidelines- as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.\u201d United States v. Chu, 714 F.3d 742, 746 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).-We will set aside a sentence as substantively unreasonable only in \u201cexceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189 (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir. 2007)). We wjll identify \u201cas substantively unreasonable only those sentences that are so \u2018shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law\u2019 that allowing them to stand would \u2018damage the administration of justice.\u2019\u201d Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 289 (quoting United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2009)).</p> <p id=\"b141-14\" pgmap=\"141(130) 142(55)\"> Our review for substantive unreasonableness is \u201cparticularly deferential.\u201d Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 289 (citing Gall, 552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). The Supreme Court has made clear that \u201cresponsibility for sentencing is placed largely in the precincts of the district courts.\u201d Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191. Hence, \u201cour role in sentencing appeals is to \u2018patrol the boundaries of reasonableness,\u2019 \u201d Rigas, 583 F.3d at 122 (quoting Cavera, 550 F.3d at 191), ^vith due respect for the sentencing court\u2019s \u201cvery wide latitude to decide the proper degree of punishment for an individual offender and a particular crime,\u201d Cavera, 560 F.3d at 188. Though the standard for finding substantive unreasonableness is high, this Court has not shied away from doing so when appropriate. See United States v. Dorvee, 616 F.3d 174, 188 (2d Cir. 2010) (\u201c[I]t would be manifestly unjust to let Dorvee\u2019s sentence stand.\u201d); United States v. Jenkins, 854 F.3d 181, 188 (2d Cir. 2017) (\u201cWe conclude that the factors upon which the district court relied ... cannot bear the weight of the sentence the district court imposed.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b142-4\" pgmap=\"142\"> District courts are to use the Guidelines as a \u201cstarting point,\u201d and then make an independent sentencing determination, taking into account the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d and all the statutory factors. Cavera, 550 F.3d at 188 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Sentencing courts are not to \u201cpresume that the Guidelines range is reasonable,\u201d and instead they \u201cmust make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d Gall, 552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p> <p id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142\"> Where there is a variance from the Guidelines range, on appellate review, \u201c Ve may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines\u2019.... \u2018[A] major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d 93, 135 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 47, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p> <p id=\"b142-6\" pgmap=\"142\">B. Application</p> <p id=\"b142-7\" pgmap=\"142\">Singh challenges his sentence on both procedural and substantive grounds. While we usually address the procedural arguments first in sentencing appeals, here we begin with the substantive challenge because it informs our analysis of the procedural arguments.</p> <p id=\"b142-9\" pgmap=\"142\">1. Substantive Unreasonableness</p> <p id=\"b142-10\" pgmap=\"142\"> As the Supreme Court has observed in a different context, \u201cthe measure of what is conscience shocking is no calibrated yard stick.\u201d Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 847, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998); accord O\u2019Connor v. Pierson, 426 F.3d 187, 203 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe shocks-the-conscience test is necessarily imprecise.\u201d). In this case, on this record, even if Singh\u2019s sentence does not shock the conscience, \u201cit at the very least stirs the conscience.\u201d United States v. Aldeen, 792 F.3d 247, 255 (2d Cir. 2015).</p> <p id=\"b142-11\" pgmap=\"142\">The district court imposed a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for an illegal reentry case, where the Guidelines range was only 15 to 21 months and the government and the Probation Office had both recommended a within-Guidelines sentence. The district court imposed a sentence almost three times the high end of the Guidelines range. Moreover, as shown by Sentencing Commission statistics, the sentence of 60 months drastically exceeded nationwide norms. In fiscal year 2013, the average sentence for illegal reentry offenders was 18 months and the median sentence was 12-months. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, Illegal Reentry Offenses, at 9 (April 2015) (\u201cComm\u2019n Report\u201d), available at https:// www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/ researeh-and-publications/research-projects-and-surveys/immigration/2015_ Illegal-Reentry-Report.pdf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An above-Guidelines sentence was imposed in only 1.3% of all illegal reentry cases, id. at 10, and in cases (like the instant one) with an 8-level enhancement for an aggravated felony, an above-Guidelines sentence was imposed in only 1.2% of the cases, id. at 11 Table 2.</p> <p id=\"b143-4\" pgmap=\"143\"> The district court concluded that a substantial variance was warranted here because of Singh\u2019s \u201cconsistent history\u201d of criminal conduct and the \u201cvery high likelihood of recidivism.\u201d App. at 115.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Singh indeed had eight prior convictions, as the district court acknowledged, however, none involved violence or narcotics trafficking. See id, at 109. Six of the eight convictions were more than ten years old. Four were more than twenty years old, counting back from the date of sentencing, and Singh was only 21 and 22 years old when he committed those offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The four more recent convictions occurred over the course of fifteen years, and three were so minor they resulted in conditional discharges, that is, the sentencing court did not believe the crime warranted imprisonment or even probation. Moreover, the Sentencing Commission statistics show that 57.2% of illegal reentry offenders were in Criminal History Category (\u201cCHC\u201d) III or higher, Comm\u2019n Report at 9. Singh was only in CHC II, and yet he was sentenced to more than three times the national average for all illegal reentry offenders, 57.2% of whom were in a higher CHC.</p> <p id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143\">As we note above, a major variance must be supported by \u201ca more significant justification.\u201d United States v. Stewart, 590 F.3d at 168 (quoting Gall, 552 U.S. at 47, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586). In the context of the Sentencing Commission\u2019s statistics for illegal reentry cases and all the circumstances here, we are not persuaded, on this record, that the justification offered by the district court was sufficient to support the magnitude of the variance. See Cavera, 550 F.3d at 189. Our concern is heightened by the procedural issues we turn to now.</p> <p id=\"b143-9\" pgmap=\"143\">2. Procedural Reasonableness</p> <p id=\"b143-10\" pgmap=\"143\">We have two areas of concern with respect to procedural reasonableness. First, there may have been factual errors in the district court\u2019s discussion of the record. Second, the district court\u2019s reluctance to credit Singh\u2019s acceptance of responsibility (although it did so in the end) suggests that the district court may have conflated Singh\u2019s statements in mitigation with a failure to accept responsibility.</p> <p id=\"b143-11\" pgmap=\"143\">a. Factual Issues</p> <p id=\"b143-12\" pgmap=\"143(41) 144(148)\"> As to the apparent factual errors, the district court concluded that \u201creentry is almost certain, an attempt at reentry is almost certain for this defendant. He has done it two times before.\u201d App. at 113 (emphasis added). The district court also referred to \u201cthe multiple[] numbers of times that he has been arrested and spent time in jail and been deported.\u201d Id. at 114. These comments suggest that the district court believed that Singh had been guilty of two earlier illegal reentries and that it was sentencing him for a third illegal reentry. Indeed, the PSR had erroneously stated that \u201cthe instant offense is the defendant\u2019s third arrest for illegally reentering the United States,\u201d PSR at 23, a statement the parties acknowledge was wrong. In fact, Singh had been arrested for illegal reentry only twice\u2014including for the instant offense. While the government argues on appeal that the district court might have been including the current offense in its comments and that the district court understood there were two and not three illegal reentries all together, the district court\u2019s words suggest otherwise. '</p> <p id=\"b144-4\" pgmap=\"144\">The district court also concluded that Singh \u201chas spent the majority of Ms adult life back and forth,\u201d that is, between Guyana and the United States. App, at 115. In fact, however, Singh, who was 44 years old at the time of sentencing, was not deported for the first time-until 2010, when he was nearly 39. It was simply not correct that he had spent \u201cthe majority 'of his adult life back and forth.\u201d To the contrary, he had spent the majority of his adult life living in the United States. The district court\u2019s conclusion that Singh was \u201calmost certain\u201d to illegally reenter again surely was influenced-by these apparently erroneous views of the facts.</p> <p id=\"b144-5\" pgmap=\"144\">Finally, the district court determined as a factual-matter that this was \u201ca defendant who has repeatedly harmed the public. ... [T]he kinds ,of crimes he is engaged in relate to a variety of conduct which is harmful,' and it is harmful to members of the public. The public shouldn\u2019t be exposed to it. It\u2019s repeated and it\u2019s' repeated so often and so brazenly that I do not have any hope.\u201d App. at 109. The district court further commented: \u201cI am-indeed almost certain that'this defendant-will try to reenter. I also believe that he 'will then be extremely likely to commit additional crimes, which exposes the American public to crimes from this individual.\u201d Id. at 114.</p> <p id=\"b144-7\" pgmap=\"144\">We are not persuaded that\u2019 the district court\u2019s abject view of Singh\u2019s record and prospects for reform is supported by the record. As discussed above, although Singh had eight prior convictions, the district court may have overstated their seriousness. Four of the convictions were more than twenty years old, involving crimes committed by Singh when he was only 21 or 22 year\u2019s old, and two others were more than ten years old. None involved guns or violence or narcotics. Three of the more rec\u00e9nt convictions resulted only in conditional discharges, without any term of prison or probation. A sentencing judge has the formidable task of trying, to some extent, to predict the future, as she must determine whether the defendant has really learned his lesson, whether he is likely to break the law again, and whether he will be able to turn his life around for the better. While the trial judge\u2019s decisions on these difficult matters are entitled to great deference, we do not believe the record here supports the trial, court\u2019s apparent conclusion that Singh was essentially beyond redemption. See Yuen Jung v. Barber, 184 F.2d 491, 495 (9th Cir. 1950) (\u201cAll modern legislation dealing with crime and punishment proceeds upon the theory that aside from capital cases, no man is beyond redemption.\u201d),</p> <p id=\"b144-8\" pgmap=\"144(45) 145(66)\"> A sentencing determination based on clearly erroneous factual findings is procedurally unreasonable. See United States v. Chu, 714 F.3d at 746; United States v. Cossey, 632 F.3d 82, 86 (2d Cir, 2011) (per curiam)1. A variance; such as that imposed here\u2014some three times the high end of the range\u2014must be based on an accurate reading of the record. A remand for clarification of the facts is therefore appropriate. See United States v. Juwa, 508 F.3d 694, 699-700 (2d Cir. 2007) (remanding for resentencing where there was uncertainty as to whether district court had assumed defendant had engaged in \u201cmultiple instances of sexual abuse, as opposed to [a] single instance\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b145-5\" pgmap=\"145\">b. The Question of Acceptance of Responsibility</p> <p id=\"b145-6\" pgmap=\"145\">At the outset of the sentencing, the district court explained that it was not \u201cinclined to allow the acceptance of responsibility deductions.\u201d App. at 90. After hearing from counsel, the district court advised that it did not \u201cwant to create an appeal point\u201d and granted Singh the acceptance points, but noted that it would consider the acceptance of responsibility issues \u201cunder 3553(a).\u201d App. at 100. Hence, despite giving Singh credit for acceptance of responsibility, the district court remained concerned that Singh had not fully accepted responsibility. The concern emanated from statements in Singh\u2019s letter to the court that he had been acting foolishly and selfishly, under the influence of friends, when he committed his earlier crimes and that he had returned to the United States in part for fear of his life in Guyana.</p> <p id=\"b145-7\" pgmap=\"145\">It appears that the district concluded that Singh\u2019s comments in his letter were a basis for imposing a higher sentence and that the district court may have imposed a substantive variance and punished Singh for trying to offer explanations for his conduct. If indeed the district court conflated Singh\u2019s statements in mitigation with a failure to accept responsibility, then it committed procedural error.</p> <p id=\"b145-8\" pgmap=\"145\">Considered as a whole, Singh\u2019s letter was an apology and a statement of remorse. It was a plea for mercy-and an attempt to explain his motivations. Singh stated that he was \u201cso sorry\u201d for .his actions and admitted that he had engaged in \u201cwrongdoing.\u201d App. at 76. He acknowledged that he had caused his family and others a lot of \u201cpain and trouble.\u201d Id, He explained that his \u201clong jail month\u2019s\u201d (he had been in prison for. more .than eight months at the time) had taught him a \u201chard lesson, not to do anything wrong again.\u201d Id, at 78. He promised not \u201cto break the law again for the sake of (his] daughter and family.\u201d Id. It was in. this context that Singh made the statements of concern to the district court,</p> <p id=\"b145-10\" pgmap=\"145\"> A defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and his assertion of mitigating circumstances are not necessarily inconsistent or incompatible. The concepts are related but independent. Cf. United States v. Douglas, 569 F.3d 523, 527 (5th Cir. 2009) (\u201cWe hold that \u2018lack of remorse\u2019 and \u2018acceptance- of responsibility\u2019 can be separate factors and that a district court may consider each independently of the other.\u201d); United States v. Andrews, 390 F.3d 840, 847-48 (5th Cir. 2004) (holding, in pre-Booker case, that district court-erred in upwardly departing from Guidelines range on grounds defendant \u201chad not completely accepted 'responsibility,\u201d where it had granted defendant acceptance-of-responsibility reduction in calculating range),</p> <p id=\"b145-11\" pgmap=\"145(74) 146(189)\"> The Guidelines authorize a two-step decrease in offense -level if \u00e1 defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El;l(a). An additional one-step decrease is available, \u201cupon motion of the government,\u201d where the defendant\u2019s offense \u25a0 level without any acceptance-of-responsibility credit is at least 16 and his \u201ctimely\u201d notification of his intent to plead guilty saves the government from preparing for trial and permits \u201cthe gov-eminent and the court to allocate their resources efficiently.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3El.l(b); see generally United States v. Delacruz, 862 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir. 2017). \u201c\u2018[T]he paramount factor in determining eligibility for \u00a7 3E1.1 credit is whether the defendant truthfully admits the conduct comprising the offense or offenses of conviction.\u2019\u201d United States v. Kumar, 617 F.3d 612, 637 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting United States v. Teyer, 322 F.Supp. 359, 376 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)). In deciding whether to grant acceptance-of-responsibility credit, the district court is to consider, inter alia, whether the defendant \u201ctruthfully admitted] the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitted] or not falsely denfied] any additional relevant conduct.\u201d U.S. . Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 Application Note 1(A). A defendant is not required, however, \u201cto volunteer, or affirmatively admit, relevant conduct beyond the offense of conviction\u201d to qualify for the reduction. Id.; see United States v. Zapata, 1 F.3d 46, 49-50 (1st Cir. 1993) (conduct underlying an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is not conduct \u201cpart of the instapt offense\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) nor relevant conduct).</p> <p id=\"b146-4\" pgmap=\"146\"> A defendant has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to'be heard at sentencing to offer mitigating circumstances. United States v. Feng Li, 115 F.3d 125, 132-33 (2d Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the coprt, before imposing sentence, \u201cto permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 (i) (4) (A) (ii). A defendant\u2019s right to \u201cattempt to mitigate punishment\u201d has \u201chistorical roots in the common law,\u201d and \u201cthe opportunity to plead for mercy is another provision in a procedural body of law designed to enable our system of justice to mete out punishment in the most equitable fashion possible, to help ensure that sentencing is particularized and reflects individual circumstances.\u201d Feng Li, 115 F.3d at 133 (quoting United States v. Barnes, 948 F.2d 325, 328 (7th Cir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b146-7\" pgmap=\"146(219) 147(41)\"> Singh\u2019s assertions that he was \u201cfoolis[h], selfish and dumb\u201d when he followed his friends in committing crimes some twenty years earlier, when he was only 21 or 22 years old, and that he returned to the United States in part for fear of his life (and to be with his family) were not, in our view, inconsistent with his acknowledgment of responsibility and wrongdoing. App. at 77. These comments did not indicate a lack of remorse, but were merely an effort by Singh to explain why he broke the law. He truthfully admitted the conduct comprising the offense of conviction. A defendant\u2019s motivation for engaging in criminal conduct is unquestionably a proper consideration at sentencing. See, e.g., Stewart, 590 F.3d at 140-41 (\u201cIn evaluating culpability, we cannot discount the relevance of the defendant\u2019s motivations\u2014i.e., whether mercenary, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958 (murder for hire), or born from a commitment to the use of violence.\u201d); United States v. Hansen, 701 F.2d 1078, 1083 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting \u201c \u2018the long unbr'oken tradition of the criminal law that harsh sanctions should not be imposed where moral culpability is lacking\u2019\u201d (quoting Lennon v. INS, 527 F.2d 187, 193 (2d Cir. 1975))); accord Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 41, 130 S.Ct. 447, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009) (holding that defense counsel failed to provide effective assistance where \u201c[t]he judge and jury at [defendant\u2019s] original sentencing heard almost nothing that would humanize [defendant] or allow them accurately to gauge his moral culpability\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b147-5\" pgmap=\"147\">There may be cases, of course, where a defendant\u2019s claim of mitigating circumstances does undermine his acceptance of responsibility, and the district court may take that lack of genuineness into account. See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E.1 Application Note 3. An example is provided by United States v. Douglas, in which the Fifth Circuit affirmed a sentence where the district court granted acceptance-of-responsibility credit but then upwardly departed because of the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. 569 F.3d at 527-28.</p> <p id=\"b147-6\" pgmap=\"147\">There the defendant was charged with felony possession of a weapon; he had handed a loaded handgun to a child who then accidentally shot himself. The district court awarded the defendant aceeptance-of-responsibility credit, but departed above the Guidelines range because of the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. Id. The sentencing allocution included the following exchange:</p> <blockquote id=\"b147-7\" pgmap=\"147\">The Defendant: I have nothing to say. I have nothing to say your honor.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-8\" pgmap=\"147\">The Court: So you have not learned anything from the offense?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-9\" pgmap=\"147\">The Defendant: Have I learned anything?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-10\" pgmap=\"147\">The Court: That\u2019s exactly what I asked.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-11\" pgmap=\"147\">The Defendant: I should have stayed in Mexico. I shouldn\u2019t have come back.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-13\" pgmap=\"147\">The Court: You have no remorse for what happened?</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b147-14\" pgmap=\"147\">The Defendant: I didn\u2019t do it. He [the child] done it to himself.</blockquote> <p id=\"b147-15\" pgmap=\"147\">Id. at 525. In contrast, in this case, Singh did show remorse. His efforts to seek mercy did not undermine his acceptance of responsibility.</p> <p id=\"b147-16\" pgmap=\"147\">\u201cSentencing, that is to say punishment, is perhaps the most difficult task of a trial court judge.\u201d Jack B. Weinstein, Does Religion Have a Role in Criminal Sentencing?, 23 Touro L. Rev. 539, 539 (2007). While there are many competing considerations in every sentencing decision, a sentencing judge must have some understanding of \u201cthe diverse frailties of humankind.\u201d See Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (plurality opinion). In deciding what sentence will be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to further the goals of punishment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), a sentencing judge must have a \u201cgenerosity of spirit, that compassion which causes one to know what it is like to be in trouble and in pain.\u201d Guido Calabresi, What Makes a Judge Great: To A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr., 142 U. Pa. L. Rev. 513, 513 (1993); see also Edward J. Devitt, Ten Commandments for the New Judge, 65 A.B.A. J. 574 (1979), reprinted in 82 F.R.D. 209, 209 (1979) (\u201cBe kind. If we judges could possess but one attribute, it should be a kind and understanding heart. The bench is no place for cruel or callous people regardless of their other qualities and abilities. There is no burden more onerous than imposing sentence in criminal cases.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b148-3\" pgmap=\"148\">To the extent the district court increased Singh\u2019s punishment because of a perception that in attempting to explain his actions and plead for mercy he did not fully accept responsibility, it committed procedural error.</p> <p id=\"b148-4\" pgmap=\"148\">C. The Request for Reassignment</p> <p id=\"b148-5\" pgmap=\"148\">Singh requests that we order that the case be reassigned bn remand to a different judge for resentencing.</p> <p id=\"b148-6\" pgmap=\"148\"> \u201cRemanding a case to a different judge is a serious request rarely made and rarely granted.\u201d United States v. Awadallah, 436 F.3d 125, 135 (2d Cir. 2006). We will grant- a request for reassignment on remand only in ' \u201c \u2018unusual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Brennan, 395 F.3d 59, 75 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Robin, 553 F.2d 8, 10 (2d Cir. 1977)). We are not persuaded that reassignment is necessary or appropriate here. We are confident that on remand the experienced and capable district judge will conduct a full resentencing, in compliance with all . procedural requirements, and impose a sentence that is fair, reasonable, and sufficient but not longer than necessary to meet the goals of justice.</p> <p id=\"b148-16\" pgmap=\"148\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b148-17\" pgmap=\"148\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED' and the case is REMANDED for resentencing. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b137-10\" pgmap=\"137\">. See N.Y.

Subsections (2) and (3) provide that certain prior sentences are counted: (1) prior sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month imposed within fifteen years of the \"commencement of the instant offense\u201d; (2) prior sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, whenever imposed, that resulted in the defendant being incarcerated within the fifteen-year period; and (3) prior sentences imposed within ten years of the \"commencement of the instant offense,\u201d Id. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(1), (2). Here, it is not clear when Singh commenced the instant offense as the record does not establish when he reentered after his May 16, 2012 removal, but he was found here on June 26, 2014. If that is considered the commencement date, none of the six convictions involved sentences imposed within the prior ten years and none resulted in a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.
