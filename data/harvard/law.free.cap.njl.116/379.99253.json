It is alleged that defendant is the publisher of the \u201cAsbury Park Evening Press,\u201d in which the asserted libelous statement appeared. The process was directed to, and the sheriffs return shows, service upon \u201cAsbury Park Press, a body corporate of the State of New Jersey.\u201d The correct corporate name of the publisher of the newspaper referred to is \u201cAsbury Park Press, Inc.,\u201d and the service of process was made upon Wayne D. McMurray, the secretary of that corporation. This rule is prosecuted by Mr. McMurray individually, on the. theory that \u201cthe designation [of the defendant] is false in law,\u201d and \u201cshould not be immune from attack ;\u201d the corporation of which he is secretary has not challenged the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>It is not McMurray\u2019s province to thus assail the service of process upon the corporation. He is not a party to the action. Concededly, the party intended to be summoned was the corporation of which he was secretary, and service was made upon him in that representative, capacity. It is a case of mere misnomer in a minor and immaterial particular. The abbreviation \u201cInc.,\u201d while a part of the name, is merely descriptive of its corporate character. The process described the defendant as a body corporate, and, therefore, it sufficiently identified the party to be cited. The misnomer, trivial as it is, is a defect which the defendant may waive; and, in any event, is curable by amendment. <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hotel Cape </em>May, 82 <em>N. J. L. </em>32. 'In no view of the matter, can it be said that the individual interests of McMurray have been affected; and he therefore has no standing to attack the service,,unless it be as the agent and in the name of the corporate defendant, which is not the case. And, in that situation, an appropriate amendment would be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Eule discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
