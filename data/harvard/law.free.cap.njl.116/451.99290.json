Jur. </em>794.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Mr. Justice Minturn, in writing the opinion of the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>Morril </em>v. Morril, 104 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>561, quoted with approval the following language from the case of <em>Southcote </em>v. Stanley, 1 H. <em>&amp; N. </em>247 : \u201cWhere one visits the private home of another as a social guest the owner is bound to take the same care of him that he takes of himself, and the other members of his family, and no more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>We </em>have examined the proofs in this case and can find nothing which justified the submission of the case to the jury. The circumstance that the stairs may not have been adequately lighted,, and that the stairs and sidewalls were of similar material, cannot alter the legal rule of duty towards licensees and such as come upon the premises to enjoy hospitality as a guest, which is to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring them. See <em>Fleckenstein </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co., </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>145. The rule stated in the case of <em>Crouse </em>v. <em>The Stacy Trent Co., </em>110 <em>Id. </em>124, applies only to business visitors where, of course, the rule is different. See, also <em>Feingold </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co., </em>116 <em>Id. </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><em>We </em>need not consider the other matters presented by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
