The rule to be applied by the court when a verdict has been set aside, is stated in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>73 Conn. 136, 137, 46 Atl. 869, as follows: \u201cThe jury is that tribunal which is regarded by the law as one especially fitted to decide in controverted questions of fact upon evidence. The jury decides how much credibility is to be given to each witness, what weight justly belongs to the evidence, and between the statements of hostile and contradictory witnesses, where the truth is. And if the verdict to which they have agreed is a conclusion to which twelve honest men acting fairly and intelligently might come, then that verdict is final and cannot be disturbed. In such a case if the trial judge should set aside the verdict he would himself be in error. He would pass the bounds of his own proper function and invade the province of the jury. It is only when the verdict is manifestly and palpably against the evidence in the case \u2014 so much so as to indicate the jury was swayed by passion, ignorance, partiality or corruption \u2014 that it should be set aside on that ground and a new trial granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This record does not disclose that the jury might not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>have fairly and reasonably believed the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, nor that the verdict was one which the jury might not reasonably have reached on the evidence before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">There is error, the judgment is reversed, and the Superior Court is directed to render judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
