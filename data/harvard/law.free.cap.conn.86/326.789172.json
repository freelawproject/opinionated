The south and west boundary lines, on private property, are of the same length, respectively, \u25a0 as said north and east boundary lines. In 1908 the defendant commenced proceedings for the establishment of a building line on both sides of Irving Street. On November 1st, 1909, the report of the bureau of compensation to the board of aldermen, recommending the adoption of a fifteen-foot building line on both sides of Irving Street, and assessing the benefits and damages to all persons affected, including the plaintiff, as equal, was accepted, and an order passed and recorded, and said assessments levied as reported, and said report was afterward approved by the mayor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201c Said assessment of benefits and damages was never published in any of the daily newspapers of said city, and the plaintiff never received any notice, official or otherwise, from said city, or any of its officers or agents, that said building line had been adopted by the board of aldermen, or approved by the mayor of said city, or that the assessment of benefits and damages by reason of its adoption had been reported as equal, and the first intimation thereof was not received by the plaintiff until several months after the acceptance and approval of said report by the then mayor of said city, as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">By reason of the facts alleged in the preceding paragraph, the plaintiff was deprived of her right to appeal to the Superior Court within the time limited by the city charter, either from said assessment of benefits and damages, or from the order adopting said building line, or from the approval thereof by the mayor. The establishment of such building line would confer no benefits on the plaintiff, but would render the plaintiff\u2019s said lot practically worthless. The board of aldermen have refused the plaintiff\u2019s petition for the repeal or change of said building fine, and the building inspector has refused to permit the plaintiff to build a two-story house on her said lot, on account of said building fine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">The prayer for relief asks for damages, in case it should be held that the building line is valid, and for a decree declaring it void, in case it should be held to be invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">The defendant demurred to the substituted complaint, upon grounds which may be stated, in substance, as follows: The complaint does not allege that the plaintiff did not have notice of the proceedings to establish the building line, and of the hearing on the assessment of benefits and damages, but does allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that the report of benefits and damages was accepted and recorded in the records of the board of aldermen. The plaintiff, through her own fault, failed and neglected to appeal, by application to the Superior Court for relief, from the order, by which said report was acoepted and recorded and said assessment made, and said building line established, as she had the right to, by the city charter, at any time within thirty days after the time when said report was accepted and said assessment of benefits and damages made, and her right to take such appeal was in no way affected by the fact that no notice was published in any newspaper that such assessment had been made, nor did the fact that there was no such publication affect the validity of the establishment of said building line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">The trial court sustained the demurrer upon the grounds therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-7\">Sections 78, 79 and 80 of the city charter (13 Special Laws, pp. 412, 413 and 414) provide that when the common council shall decide to establish any building line, the- department of public works shall, after notice mailed to all owners residing in the city, and after a public hearing, cause a survey of the land or layout of the public work to be prepared, and an assessment of benefits and damages to be made; that the bureau of compensation shall advertise in two or more daily papers, three times, the time fixed for a hearing before them, and the subject-matter thereof; that they shall estimate the probable expense of establishing the building line, shall assess benefits and damages for or against all persons interested; that the assessments shall be made of the excess of benefits over damages, if any, or <em>vice versa; </em>that they shall report their doings to the department of public works, and that that department shall report its doings to the common council (by amendment of the city charter the board of aldermen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>now take the place of common council, 13 Special Laws, p. 1114), in writing, showing a particular designation of the land to be taken or the layout of the proposed public improvement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-6\">Portions of \u00a7\u00a7 81 and 85 of the city charter (13 Special Laws, pp. 413, 414) appear in the footnote.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-7\">\u201cSec. 81.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">The principal questions discussed before us were whether the plaintiff was entitled to the notice by publication in the newspapers, provided for in \u00a7 81 of the city charter, as affecting her right of appeal given by \u00a7 85; and if so, whether the failure of the defendant to publish such notice rendered the proceedings for the establishment of the building line void.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Section 85 gives the right of appeal to any one aggrieved by the order of the common council (board of aldermen) making the assessment, \u201cwithin thirty days after the doing of the act complained of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The act by which the plaintiff was aggrieved was the establishment of the building line without awarding her any damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Since by the acceptance and approval of the report of the bureau of compensation and the department of public works, the benefits and damages were assessed as equal, and there were, therefore, no damages to be paid, the act of making the assessment and adopting the building line and devoting the plaintiff\u2019s property to the designated public use, was, by the language of \u00a7 81, fully completed when the report of the department of public works was accepted and recorded in the records of the board of aldermen, and the time within which an appeal could be taken began to run then, and was limited to thirty days from that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">The publications in the newspapers, provided for in \u00a7 81, formed no part of the making and completing of the assessments, and the establishing of the building line. By the express provisions of the charter the assessments were completed and the building line established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>when the report of the department of public works was accepted and recorded and the damages paid, if there were any damages to be paid. The publications in the newspapers were, by the language of \u00a7 81, not to be made until after the assessments were thus legally completed, and the building line so established. Again, as the charter does not expressly provide for the publication of but one notice, which was to be published within one week after compliance with the provision in regard to the payment of damages, <em>and after the report of the director of public works that the improvements \u201chave been completed,\u201d </em>it is not clear when that notice was to be published when the work was not completed until more than one week after compliance with the provision in regard to the payment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">But whether \u00a7 81 provided for the publication of only one notice, or of two notices, one of which was to be made within one week from the time the damages had been paid, and the other after the public work had been completed, they were not notices which interested parties were entitled to receive as affecting their right of appeal. Such notice or notices are in no way referred to in the provision of \u00a7 85 fixing the time when an appeal may be taken. They seem to have been intended to be published only in cases where, by the assessment, damages were awarded or benefits were required to be paid, and as notices to persons interested, that the damages awarded them had been paid in the manner provided in \u00a7 81, and as notices to persons who had not paid the benefits assessed against them, that such benefits were due and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The publication of such notice or notices was undoubtedly omitted in the present case because, by the assessment adopted, no damages or benefits were to be paid, and it could not therefore properly be said that the damages had been paid or that the benefits had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>become payable. Section 81 makes no provision for such publication, within one week after the assessment is completed, in cases where there are no damages or benefits to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">But it is claimed that if these publications were only notices that damages had been paid, in the manner provided in \u00a7 81, or that benefits were payable, that the proceedings for the assessment of damages and the establishment of a building line were void because, in that case, property-owners received no notice of the assessment, and Therefore no opportunity to be fully heard by an appeal to the Superior Court, as the charter contemplated they might be heard, upon the question of the assessment made.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">This claim cannot be sustained. In the absence of any averment to the contrary, we must assume that the plaintiff received the notice provided in \u00a7\u00a7 78 and 79 of the charter, of the public hearing regarding the establishment of the building line, and notice of the hearing before the bureau of compensation as to the assessment of benefits and damages, provided for in \u00a7 80. <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Macdonald, </em>73 Conn. 125, 130, 46 Atl. 871; <em>State </em>v. <em>Main, </em>69 Conn. 123, 140, 37 Atl. 80; <em>Atwater </em>v. <em>O\u2019Reilly, </em>81 Conn. 367, 71 Atl. 505. Having been notified of the inception of the assessment proceedings, and of the hearing before the bureau of compensation, the plaintiff became chargeable with notice of the entire proceedings from the time of the reference to the board of compensation for the purpose of ascertaining benefits and damages, to the time the report of the department of public works was finally accepted and ordered to be recorded. The entire matter was, in contemplation of law, one proceeding, of each step in which the plaintiff was not entitled to receive a new notice, in order to render the proceedings valid, unless such new notice was required by the provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>charter. <em>Fair Haven &amp; W. R. Co. </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 75 Conn. 442, 454, 53 Atl. 960; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 39 Conn. 467, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The facts averred in the complaint fail to show either that the plaintiff lost her right of appeal by reason of the failure to make the publications provided in \u00a7 81, or that the proceedings became invalid by reason of such failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The plaintiff was not prejudiced by the decision of the court upon the defendant\u2019s motion to state in two counts what was claimed to be two causes of action. In the substituted complaint, containing but one count, she was permitted to make the two desired prayers for relief based upon the defendant\u2019s failure to make the publications described in \u00a7 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">After the trial court had sustained the demurrer to the complaint, the plaintiff asked leave to amend the complaint by alleging, in substance, that since her petition for a change in said building line, as described in the complaint, \u00a7 78 of the city charter had been amended, making it more difficult than before to obtain from the board of aldermen any change of a legally established line. The court properly refused to permit the amendment, upon the ground that such amendment could not affect the sufficiency of the complaint or the decision of the court upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">There is no error</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
