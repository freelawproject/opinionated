Induced by defendant\u2019s fraudulent misstatement as to the price, the plaintiff paid to him $3,250, which was in fact $2,000 more than his share. In an action for damages it was held:\u2014</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-10\">1. That upon the defendant\u2019s purchase a trust presumptively arose in favor of the plaintiff, who thereby secured a one-half interest in the equity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-12\">2. That the trial court erred in rendering a judgment for the plaintiff to recover the full amount paid by him, since there had been no rescission of the contract nor any offer to return the benefit received by the plaintiff under it; nor was the action susceptible of being regarded as one for a recovery of money misappropriated or converted by the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-14\">3. That the measure of damage was the difference between what the plaintiff was induced to and did in fact pay, and what he should have paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-16\">4. That it was immaterial that the property was in fact worth more than the price asked for it, or that it was worth as much as, or more than, the price represented by the defendant, since the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of his bargain, and could not be deprived of that by the fraud of his copurchaser.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b493-18\">Where material corrections, which may affect the ultimate conclusion, are made by this court in the finding, a judgment will not .ordinarily be directed, but a new trial will be ordered.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b493-19\">Argued October 16th, 1912</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AV-\">decided February 15th, 1913.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-20\">Action to recover damages for fraud in inducing the plaintiffs to enter into a contract for the purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>real estate, brought to and tried by the Superior Court in New Haven County, <em>Burpee, J.; </em>facts found and judgment rendered for the plaintiffs for $4,021, and appeal by the defendant.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Axn\">\n<em>Error and cause remanded.</em>\n</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b494-6\"><em>Charles F.

The principal corrections asked for are (1) the striking from the finding of that part of paragraph eleven which recites that \u201cthey [the plaintiffs] have never received from any one any consideration or valuable thing therefor; and they have had no consideration or valuable thing whatever by reason of their arrangement and agreement with the defendant, and the payment of said money to him\u201d; and (2) an addition to the finding, that pursuant to said agreement the title was taken in the name of the defendant January 21st, 1908; that he gave said mortgage of $3,000 on said date; and that he assumed and has paid all of the carrying charges upon said property except a part of the mortgage interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">These facts were in evidence and uncontested. They are material, since they show that the defendant, pursuant to the agreement, took title to this real estate for \u2022the joint benefit of himself and the plaintiffs, which was worth $12,500, or $2,500 in excess of the mortgages at the date of purchase and the inception of the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The fact that the title was taken in the name of the defendant did not deprive the plaintiffs of their one-half interest in the property. Upon the purchase by the defendant, presumptively a trust arose in favor of the plaintiffs. <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>59 Conn. 188, 195, 22 Atl. 149; <em>Corr\u2019s Appeal, </em>62 Conn. 403, 408, 26 Atl. 478. The plaintiffs, therefore, secured by their contract a half interest in an equity worth $2,500; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>finding, that the plaintiffs received no consideration by reason of the agreement, is contrary to the conclusion necessarily arising from the established facts. In these several particulars the finding should be corrected, and as the judgment to be rendered must depend upon their consideration, we do not feel at liberty, under the circumstances of this case, to direct a judgment. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>82 Conn. 619, 621, 622, 74 Atl. 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">The finding that the value of the property at the date of purchase was $12,500 rather than $18,000, as the defendant claimed, was made upon a conflict of evidence. The defendant\u2019s witnesses placed the value of the property at $18,000, and no other witness testified directly as to its value; but the court had before it the size, character, and location of the premises, the price of purchase and the renewal at the same price, and we cannot hold that its conclusion could not have been reasonably reached from these considerations, rather than from the opinion of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Upon learning of the fraud perpetrated upon them, two methods were open to the plaintiffs: to rescind the contract and recover the payments made thereunder, or to accept the contract and recover the damages occasioned by the fraud. So far as the finding discloses, the plaintiffs neither rescinded, nor attempted to rescind. On the contrary, they retained its benefits, and the plaintiff Lowe, so far as appears in the finding, has never released the $8,000 mortgage given him for the joint protection of himself and the other plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The trial court gave judgment for the sums paid the defendant by the plaintiffs, with interest from the date of payments;, thus, either treating the contract as rescinded by the plaintiffs, as they now claim in their brief, or else treating the case as one of conversion, as the defendant claims was done. Some justification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the defendant\u2019s contention is found in the manner in which the judgment was reached, as set forth in the memorandum of decision, and in a ruling made during the trial, in which the court said in part: \u201cI appreciate from the complaint that the plaintiff is suing the defendant for misappropriating money which he obtained under false pretences. . . . The question is, what did he do with the money he got from the plaintiffs? If he didn\u2019t use it to buy this property, he appropriated it to himself, and has got it now, as they claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Whatever be the measure of damages adopted by the court, it did not adopt the only one applicable to an action of fraud of this character. In this case the plaintiffs were led into the contract by fraudulent representations as to the price, and the cash payments required. Upon the facts as found, the purchase price was $12,500 instead of $18,000, as represented, and the plaintiffs were fraudulently induced to agree to pay in $4,000, and did pay in $3,250 of this, when their share of the true price under the contract was $1,250. The measure of damages in such case, where one joint purchaser is by fraud induced to pay the represented price for property which he subsequently ascertains is more than that in fact paid, is the difference between what he in fact paid and what he should have paid of the true price. It is immaterial in.the assessment of damages that the property was in fact worth more than the true price, or as much, or more, than the represented price. The joint purchaser is entitled to the profit of his bargain, and cannot be deprived of that by the fraud of his cojoint purchaser. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Gavitt, </em>114 Iowa, 183, 184, 185, 86 N.
