B. Davis against defendant, who claimed under a parol gift from said Davis, and twenty years adverse possession. Defendant having proved declarations of J. B. Davis in support of defendant\u2019s title after the date of the alleged gift, plaintiff was permitted by the Circuit Judge (Kershaw) to prove other declarations of Davis to the contrary during the same period, accompanied by acts, such as building a gin, pasturing stock, contracting to lease the land to another, &amp;c. Alleged error in admitting such testimony in reply was the only question brought before this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-5\"><em>S.

As we gather from the \u201cCase,\u201d the defendant not only sought to prove a gift by parol, accompanied by possession thereunder, but also by at least three witnesses introduced testimony as to declarations made by J. B. Davis subsequent to 1868, the date of the verbal gift. The plaintiff, in reply, proved by Mrs. Dean other declarations of the said J. B. Davis, connected with his acts, or proposed acts. This was not error. <em>Boozer </em>v. <em>Teague, </em>27 S.
