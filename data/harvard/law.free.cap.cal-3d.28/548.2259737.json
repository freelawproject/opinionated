(Compare <em>In re Richard W. </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 960 [155 Cal.Rptr. 11], with <em>In re Ruben M. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 690 [158 Cal.Rptr. 197].) After an independent study of the issue, we have concluded that the thoughtful opinion of Justice Wiener for the Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, in this case correctly treats the issues and that we should adopt it as our own. That opinion, with appropriate deletions and additions,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Michael B. (Michael) appeals from a dispositional order of the juvenile court continuing his status as a ward (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 602, 775; all statutory references are to the Welf. &amp; Inst. Code unless otherwise indicated) and committing him to the [] Youth Authority (YA). Although the only petition filed in this proceeding was pursuant to section 602, Michael\u2019s YA commitment was increased by an additional two years and four months for previously sustained offenses. [] [Under the circumstances of this case, the failure of the district attorney to provide prior notice of his intent to seek aggregation of the terms of confinement allowable under prior sustained section 602 petitions] requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>Procedural and Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">This appeal concerns Michael\u2019s most recent petition filed September 19, 1978, which alleged he came within the provisions of section 602 because he committed forgery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470; count I) and disobeyed a court order <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 166, subd. 4; count II). On September 29, 1978, he admitted the allegations in count I; count II was dismissed. The dispositional hearing was held immediately following his admission. He was committed to YA for a term of five years and four months, representing three years for the forgery and two years and four months aggregated for previously sustained offenses alleged within petitions dated January 26, 1977, and February 23, 1977.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The relevant portion of the minor\u2019s prior record is as follows: A petition filed January 26, 1977, charged the minor with four counts of vehicle theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851). A true finding was made on February 17, 1977, on one count and the minor was declared a ward under section 602. He was released on probation to his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">On February 23, 1977, another petition was filed alleging that on February 19, 1977, Michael was involved in a hit and run accident (Veh. Code, \u00a7 20002, subd. (a)); had stolen a vehicle <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 10851); and had driven a vehicle without a license <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 12500, subd. (a)). The allegations were admitted on February 24, 1977, and true findings were made that same date. As a ward of the court, he was placed in the San Diego County Juvenile Ranch facilities until released on May 20, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">\n<em>The Minor Was Not Given Adequate Notice of the Court\u2019s Intention to Aggregate His Maximum Term of Confinement Based Upon His Prior Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The minor claims the failure to file a supplemental petition under section 777 prevents the court from [] [computing] the maximum period of confinement on the basis of [aggregated terms for] prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Section 777 requires the filing of a supplemental petition to change or modify a prior disposition [by removing a minor from the physical custody of his parents or by placing him in more restrictive custody. It does not make express reference to modifications of previous orders to increase the permissible period of physical confinement. Pursuant to section 777] the minor must be afforded notice of the intended change [in custody], as well as the time and place of the hearing, and the petition must contain a concise statement of facts in support of the conclusion the minor\u2019s previous placement has been rehabilitatively ineffective. <em>(In re Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d 690, 696; <em>In re Reynaldo R. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 250, 253-255 [150 Cal.Rptr. 71]; <em>In re Glenn K. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 342, 345-346 [141 Cal.Rptr. 486]; \u00a7\u00a7 775, 776, 777.) Before the previous dispositional order may be modified, the court must make an express finding the previous order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>fact has been rehabilitatively ineffective. <em>(In re Reynaldo R., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d at p. 255; <em>In re Denise C. </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 761, 766-767 [119 Cal.Rptr. 735].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">After a new petition is sustained under section 602, [on the other hand,] the court may consider the juvenile\u2019s entire record before exercising its discretion at the dispositional hearing [and may rely on prior sustained section 602 petitions in determining the proper disposition and maximum period of confinement. <em>(In re Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at p. 696; see <em>In re John G. </em>(1977) 72 Cal.App.3d 242, 245-246 [139 Cal.Rptr. 849].) Section 726, which permits aggregation of terms in computing that period, expressly authorizes aggregation on the basis of prior sustained section 602 petitions but does not sanction consideration of prior section 777 petitions for this purpose. A practice has developed, therefore, of filing new section 602 petitions, rather than section 777 supplemental petitions, to charge new offenses even when the minor is already a section 602 ward. (Cf., <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 226 [127 Cal.Rptr. 641, 545 P.2d 1345].) This practice is not contrary to law. Although section <em>777 </em>recites that a \u201csupplemental petition\u201d is required in order to change or modify a previous order by removing the minor from his parents\u2019 custody or by directing his commitment to the Youth Authority, a section <em>777 </em>petition is not the exclusive method of initiating proceedings calling for such a change or modification. As stated in a recent case it is \u201cclear that the proposers of section <em>777 </em>did not contemplate that that section must, necessarily, be utilized in cases...where a different and more onerous disposition is to be based on a new criminal offense.\u201d <em>(In re John G., supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d 242, 245.) Thus, section 726 authorizes the court in a section 602 proceeding to \u201caggregate the period of physical confinement on multiple counts, or multiple petitions, including previously sustained petitions adjudging the minor a ward within Section 602. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We have decided, however, that] where the prior offenses are to be considered to aggregate the maximum term to extend it beyond that which could be imposed for the new offense, due process requires notice of the juvenile court\u2019s intention in order to provide the minor with a meaningful opportunity to rebut any derogatory material within its prior record. <em>(In re Robert S. </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 355, 362 [154 Cal.Rptr. 832]; <em>In re Aaron N. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 931, 939-941 [139 Cal.Rptr 258].) Further, in compliance with the <em>Boykin-Tahl </em>protec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tions afforded a minor <em>(In re Ronald E. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 315, 321-323 [137 Cal.Rptr. 781, 562 P.2d 684]), the legislative intent embodied within the Juvenile Court Law and the pertinent California Rules of Court mandate the advising of a minor of the possible consequences of the pending petition, including generally the possibility of aggregation and specifically \u201cthe maximum period of physical confinement, at the detention or jurisdictional hearing, or at some point before an admission is accepted or a contested jurisdictional hearing commences.\u201d <em>(In re Richard W., </em>supra, 91 Cal.App.3d 960, 978; \u00a7\u00a7 633, 700, 776, <em>777 </em>and Cal. Rules of Court, rules 1324 (a)(3), 1353(a), 1354(e)(4).) Thus, we conclude [] [that a petition under section 602 must contain notice of the intent to rely upon previous sustained petitions under section 602, in order to aggregate the maximum period of confinement on the basis of those petitions. (See <em>In re Richard W., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 978.) To the extent contrary to this conclusion, <em>In re Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d at pages 697-698, is hereby disapproved. Absent the filing of a petition containing such notice, the court is limited to the maximum period of confinement of the new offense(s) set forth in the section 602 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">It has been suggested that this procedure would require the filing of both a section <em>777 </em>supplemental petition and a section 602 petition when a new offense has been committed and thereby necessitate \u201ctwo hearings,\u201d resulting in a \u201cduplication of effort,\u201d as well as \u201cconfusion or even inconsistent results.\u201d <em>(In re Ruben M., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.3d 690, 700.) Yet no compelling reason appears why separate petitions or duplicative hearings should be required under the rule we announce. So long as the minor is given the requisite <em>notice </em>of the intent to rely upon the minor\u2019s prior offense or offenses or upon the ineffectiveness of prior dispositions in order to enhance the maximum period of YA commitment for the current offense, the issues may be presented in a single unitary petition which contains the requisite allegations, and may be disposed of in the course of a single proceeding otherwise conforming to law. (See <em>In re Reynaldo R., supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d 250, 254-255, involving use of a single petition filed under \u00a7\u00a7 602 and 777; see also, <em>In re John G., supra, </em>72 Cal.App.3d 242, 245; <em>In re Aaron N., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.3d 931, 941.)</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The filing of a unitary petition satisfies the essential demands of due process. (See <em>In re Arthur N., supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 226, 233.) Although the petition would include a reference to the minor\u2019s prior offenses, that disclosure violates no constitutional or statutory right. A similar disclo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>sure necessarily occurs whenever a change in disposition is sought with respect to a minor who was previously adjudicated a juvenile court ward under section 602. The inclusion of allegations regarding the necessity of a change in placement is expressly sanctioned by section <em>777. </em>Moreover, in adult criminal proceedings, the pleadings frequently contain allegations of prior convictions for enhancement or aggravation purposes. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 969 et seq.)]</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Here, Michael was denied due process. He was not given adequate notice that his maximum term of confinement could be aggregated on the basis of his prior offenses. Before his admission, he was told by the trial court that based upon his present charge and the background information provided by the probation report, he could be committed to YA until his 23d birthday. However, although this admonishment exaggerated the severity of his potential maximum term, since the estimate was excessive by approximately 22 months, it did not explain the mechanical consequences of his plea. The brevity of the statement was its flaw, as Michael was not told of the effect of his plea upon his previously sustained section 602 petitions. The shorthand, ambiguous admonishment had the effect of being no more than an attempt to advise the minor of his potential maximum term of confinement for the present charge alone. Michael was deprived of notice of the possibility of aggregation based upon his prior offenses, adequate time to prepare his defense, and a meaningful opportunity to be heard to rebut any derogatory material relating to his prior record. Due process mandates the remanding of this matter to the juvenile court \u201cfor redetermination of the maximum permissible term of physical confinement by means of procedures which give fair notice to the minor and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>(In re Robert S., supra, 92 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 363; <em>In re Samuel C. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 351, 360 [141 Cal.Rptr. 431].)</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Michael has not, however, carried his burden of establishing prejudice resulting from the improper admonishment as it pertains to the taking of his admission to the truth of the allegations within the forgery count. Since the record sheds no further light upon this issue, we conclude it is not reasonably probable that had the court properly admonished Michael, he would have been persuaded to deny the truth of the allegations he ultimately admitted. <em>(In re Ronald E., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 325-326; <em>In re Richard W., supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d at p. 980; <em>In re Jimmy M. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 369, 373-374 [155 Cal.Rptr. 534]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wagoner </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 605, 610-611 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>[152 Cal.Rptr. 639]; <em>Ganyo </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 522, 530 [145 Cal.Rptr. 636].)</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">[Michael complains that the trial court failed to enter a finding that there was a factual basis for his admission of the forgery allegations. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1354(e)(6).) On the record before us, however, we find no reasonable likelihood of prejudice to Michael from the omission. The charge involved knowingly forging his mother\u2019s name to a $50 check and attempting to cash it. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470.) A probation report set forth additional details of the offense. At the hearing, the court read the charging allegations to Michael <em>in his mother\u2019s presence </em>and he admitted the forgery. No contrary evidence was introduced. Under the circumstances, the trial court unquestionably would have found that there was a factual basis for Michael\u2019s admission.] We affirm the true finding as to count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>The Imposition of Consecutive Terms Was Proper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Michael urges consecutive terms for Vehicle Code section 10851 (vehicle theft) and Vehicle Code section 12500 (driving without a license) constitute double punishment prohibited by Penal Code section 654.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">A similar contention was rejected [by us as follows] []: \u201c[S]ection 654 of the Penal Code proscribes multiple punishment for a single \u2018act or omission which is made punishable\u2019 by different statutes, i.e., a single <em>criminal </em>act or omission. Since the mere act of driving is made punishable by no statute, it is not the type of act or omission referred to in section 654. The acts \u2018made punishable\u2019 which this petitioner committed were (1) driving with a suspended license and (2) driving while intoxicated, two separate and distinct criminal acts; that they were committed simultaneously and that they share in common the neutral noncriminal act of driving does not render petitioner\u2019s punishment for both crimes in conflict with Penal Code section 654.\u201d <em>(In re Hayes </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 604, 611 [75 Cal.Rptr. 790, 451 P.2d 430]; see <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>ple </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 545, 551-552 [153 Cal.Rptr. 40, 591 P.2d 63].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (End of Court of Appeal opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The dispositional order pertaining to the determination of the aggregate maximum permissible term of confinement is reversed for proceedings consistent with this opinion to permit a redetermination upon notice with the full opportunity for the minor to be heard.

A requirement of due process, intended to protect an individual, is used in the best <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>fashion to <em>restrict </em>that individual\u2019s statutorily defined rights. Unfortunately, the path the majority take to reach this goal is strewn with the remnants of what used to be called due process of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">When a section 602 petition is sustained in juvenile court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judge must make two determinations. First, the appropriate disposition or \u201ctreatment\u201d of the minor must be determined. Then, if the disposition selected results in the removal of the minor from the custody of his parent or guardian, the judge must \u201cspecify that the minor may not be held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.\u201d (\u00a7 726.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Complexities may arise if the minor has had section 602 petitions sustained prior to the sustaining of the current petition. In this event, it has been held that the juvenile court may consider the prior petitions in determining the appropriate disposition of the minor\u2019s current case. (See <em>In re Reynaldo R. </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 250 [150 Cal.Rptr. 71].) In this case, appellant, Michael B., does not dispute that the juvenile court judge could consider his prior sustained petitions in reaching the decision to commit him to the Youth Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Having made this decision, the juvenile court was then obligated to set a \u201cmaximum term of imprisonment.\u201d (\u00a7 726.) In fixing this term, a judge is authorized to use the terms prescribed in the Penal Code for the offenses found to be true in past and present sustained petitions. Thus, the question arises whether this use of prior sustained petitions requires some form of notice to the minor that such aggregation of prior and present petitions may occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Appellant contends that the Legislature has required such notice in the form of a supplemental petition. Section 777 dictates that a supplemental petition be filed before the juvenile court may make any \u201corder changing or modifying a previous order by directing commitment to the Youth Authority. ...\u201d Since the use of previously sustained petitions to fix the maximum term of imprisonment in a new case amounts to a \u201cchanging or modifying\u201d of the orders in those prior cases, a supplemental petition would seem to be a legislatively mandated prerequisite to such use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since no section <em>111 </em>petition was filed below in connection with the juvenile proceedings against appellant, that court\u2019s order setting his maximum term of imprisonment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The majority eschew this straightforward analysis in favor of a constitutional approach, although their reasons for doing so are not immediately apparent. At one point they seem to indicate their belief that section 777 was inapplicable to the proceedings against appellant. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 552-553.) Then, on other pages they appear to acknowledge that the provisions of section 777 should have been followed below. Thus, they expressly hold that a \u201climited reversal\u201d is necessary in this case because the juvenile court failed to comply with section <em>Ill's </em>requirement of \u201can express finding [that] the previous order in fact has been rehabilitatively ineffective.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 552-553, fn. 2, and accompanying text.) Moreover, they must acknowledge that the order now at issue did \u201cchange or modify\u201d the orders in the prior cases since they explicitly recognize \u201cthe effect of [appellant\u2019s] plea upon his previously sustained section 602 petitions.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 555.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In the end, however, it appears that the majority choose the constitutional rather than the statutory route to a notice requirement because it allows them to \u201cannounce\u201d their own rule and thereby implement a policy which they believe is superior to that which would result by strict adherence to section <em>111. </em>They are concerned that the filing of a section <em>111 </em>supplemental petition in conjunction with a section 602 petition would \u201cnecessitate two hearings, resulting in a duplication of effort, as well as confusion or even inconsistent results.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 554, quotation marks in original deleted.) They also see \u201cno compelling reason.. .why separate petitions... should be required....\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Their concern about \u201cduplicative hearings\u201d <em>{ibid.) </em>is unwarranted if not misleading. While section <em>111 </em>requires that a separate supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number><em>petition </em>be filed if prior sustained petitions are to be used to increase the maximum term of imprisonment for a new offense, it does not require that the <em>court hearing </em>on this use of prior petitions be separate from the dispositional hearing on the new offense. Obviously, both petitions may and should be heard together, as the Legislature undoubtedly intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The majority\u2019s further concern\u2014i.e., that they see \u201cno compelling reason\u201d for the filing of separate petitions\u2014reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of this court. This court may not refuse to follow a statutory provision simply because, in our view, the Legislature had \u201cno compelling reason\u201d for enacting it. The fact remains that the Legislature <em>has </em>enacted it, believing it to be a valuable and appropriate protection for minors. Unless the provision is unconstitutional\u2014and no one has suggested that a supplemental petition requirement is unconstitutional\u2014this court is duty bound to honor the Legislature\u2019s wishes regardless of our own personal views. It is disingenuous to cloak ourselves in the trappings of due process so we can dispense with the valid legislative notice requirement of section 777. Due process principles were enacted to <em>protect </em>persons in appellant\u2019s situation, and it is a perversion of these principles to use them as a means of <em>limiting </em>his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There is a second serious error in the majority opinion. Rule 1354(e) of the California Rules of Court provides in relevant part that upon an admission by a minor of the truth of section 602 allegations against him, \u201cthe court shall make findings as to each of the following, noted in the minutes of the court:. . .(6) That there is a factual basis for the minor\u2019s admission; [and] (7) That the allegations of the petition as admitted are true as alleged. .. . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">There was no compliance with these rules in the juvenile court proceedings below. Appellant was merely asked whether he \u201cunderstood\u201d the petition which had been read to him, and he \u201cadmitted the truth of Count I.\u201d This record is insufficient to comply with rule 1354(e). In addressing this issue, the majority opinion erroneously finds a factual basis for appellant\u2019s admission because appellant was charged with and did admit a crime. The majority have totally confused two separate concepts. I must dissent on this basis as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Finally, the majority\u2019s resolution of the multiple punishment issue is contrary to views expressed by former Chief Justice Traynor in <em>In re Hayes </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 604, 611-617 [75 Cal.Rptr. 790, 451 P.2d 430] (dis. opn.). Since I agree with the former Chief Justice\u2019s views on this issue, I again must voice my strong dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-12\">For the first time in this court\u2019s history, the majority opinion uses the concept of an individual\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law to restrict that same individual\u2019s statutory rights. Since I agree that the case should be remanded, 1 concur in that portion of the majority opinion which reverses the lower court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-13\">A petition under section 602 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is filed when the juvenile court is asked to assume jurisdiction over a \u201cperson who is under the age of 18 years when he violates any law ... or any ordinance ... defining crime .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Hereinafter, all statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless expressly slated otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The Court of Appeal in <em>In re Ruben M. </em>(1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 690, 697-698 [158 Cal.Rptr. 197], came to a different conclusion based in large part upon a comment to proposed section 777 by the Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice. However, <em>Ruben </em>A/.\u2019s reliance on this comment is misplaced, for the version of section <em>111 </em>which the special study commission proposed was substantially altered by the Legislature pri- or to enactment. (See Sen. Amends, to Sen. Bill No. 332 (1961 Reg. Sess.) Feb. 23, 1961, and Mar. 17, 1961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Of particular note is the February 23 amendment, which deleted subdivision (d) of proposed section <em>777. </em>The deleted subdivision would have provided that \u201c[n]o [section 777] modification of a previous order shall be made upon the ground that a minor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>since committed a crime. In such event a new petition must be filed....\u201d It was this deleted language which would have implemented the portion of the special study commission\u2019s report on which <em>Ruben M. </em>relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">This confusion in the majority opinion\u2019s view of section <em>777 </em>is not in any way attributable to the Court of Appeal which previously considered this case. While purporting to \u201cadopt\u201d the opinion of the Court of Appeal, today\u2019s majority actually have deleted the central portions of that opinion and replaced them with language substantially opposed to that court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">The Court of Appeal held in this case that \u201c[t]he sole statutory method permitting aggregation under section 726 is the <em>filing of a supplemental petition as required by section </em>777.\u201d (Italics added.) It was this \u201cfailure to comply with section 777\u201d which required reversal, according to the Court of Appeal. Today\u2019s majority opinion adopts that court\u2019s opinion on the basis that it \u201ccorrectly treats the issues,\u201d yet the distinguished members of the Court of Appeal will, I suspect, have difficulty recognizing their \u201ccorrect treatment\u201d in this court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
