J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcJ\">This appeal presents the question whether an individual who fraudulently obtains aid to families with dependent children (AFDC) in violation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 11483 may also be prosecuted for perjury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 118).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">On April 10, 1975, respondent Margie Jenkins went to the Sacramento County Welfare Department to request AFDC benefits for her daughter. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11200 et seq.) She was given a lengthy document, a WR-2 form, which she was instructed to fill out in order to establish her child\u2019s eligibility for the AFDC program.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">On April 15, respondent returned to the welfare department with the completed WR-2 form, and an eligibility worker reviewed the form with her. Respondent then signed the form in the space provided, underneath the sentence \u201cI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing statements on this form are true and correct.\u201d Respondent reported on the WR-2 form that her gross income for April was $278. Evidence adduced at her preliminary hearing below indicated that respondent and her daughter together earned $471 gross ($412 net) for that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The eligibility worker explained to respondent her \u201creporting responsibilities,\u201d which included the requirement that respondent fill out, sign, and mail back to the welfare office each month a \u201cMonthly Income Report,\u201d a WR-7 form. Evidence at the preliminary hearing indicated that respondent filled out WR-7 forms and obtained AFDC benefits for her daughter for some of the 13 months following her meeting with the eligibility worker. During that period, respondent and her daughter had a total gross income from various jobs of about $1,770. In her WR-7 forms for May 1975 and March 1976, respondent either underreported or failed to report her earnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The errors in the WR-2 and WR-7 forms resulted in an overpayment of more than $200 in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Based on this evidence, the district attorney filed a two-count information in superior court. In count I, respondent was accused of a felony violation of Welfare and Institutions Code section 11483 (AFDC fraud) during the period from April 1, 1975, to May 31, 1976.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Count II alleged that respondent committed perjury in violation of Penal Code section 118 when she signed the WR-2 form on April 15, 1975.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>spondent moved to dismiss count II on the ground that the Welfare and Institutions Code statute proscribing AFDC fraud was a specific statute which precluded the state from prosecuting her under the more general perjury statute in the Penal Code. The superior court granted the motion, and the prosecution has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In the 13 chapters constituting part 3 of division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, the Legislature has provided for public assistance programs for certain needy persons in this state. (\u00a7\u00a7 11000-15520.) Chapter 1 of part 3 contains \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d pertaining to those programs (\u00a7\u00a7 11000-11175); chapter 2 sets forth the AFDC program (\u00a7\u00a7 11200-11489).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Among the general provisions in chapter 1 are statutes relating to applications for public aid or assistance. (\u00a7\u00a7 11050-11063.) Section 11054 requires each applicant to file an \u201caffirmation\u201d of eligibility before aid or assistance may initially be approved. Such \u201cstatements\u201d shall be on prescribed forms and \u201cin <em>the case of applicants for aid to families with dependent children, </em>shall contain a written declaration that the affirmation is made under penalty of perjury.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>italics added.) If a person signs \u201ca statement containing such declaration\u201d and willfully and knowingly with intent to deceive states as true any material matter which he knows to be false, he is \u201csubject to the penalties prescribed for perjury in the Penal Code.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Once an applicant has begun to receive aid, he or she may be required to fill out \u201cnew statements\u201d at any time for purposes of continuing assistance. <em>{Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Chapter 2 of part 3 specifically sets forth the AFDC program. The chapter prescribes (inter alia) the eligibility requirements for AFDC benefits (\u00a7\u00a7 11250-11268) and requires the county to \u201credetermine eligibility annually\u201d (\u00a7 11265, subd. (a).). The county <em>must </em>at the time of such redetermination, and <em>may </em>monthly or at such other intervals as may be deemed necessary, require the family to complete a \u201ccertificate of eligibility containing a written declaration of such information as may be required to establish the continuing eligibility and amount of grant.... \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Each adult member of the family must provide, \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d the information necessary to complete the certificate of eligibility. (\u00a7 11265, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Two provisions in the \u201cEnforcement\u201d portion of chapter 2 make AFDC fraud illegal: sections 11482 and 11483.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Both sections prohibit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the obtaining of aid by means of \u201cfalse statement or representation.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 480-481 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].) Section 11482 also prohibits unsuccessful <em>attempts </em>to obtain aid. A violation of section 11482 is punishable as a misdemeanor, whereas a prosecution under section 11483 may proceed either as a misdemeanor or as an alternative felony-misdemeanor, depending upon whether or not the amount of aid illegally obtained exceeded $200. Both now and at the time of respondent\u2019s alleged crime, the punishment prescribed for a felony violation of section 11483 has been less than that prescribed for perjury under the Penal Code.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Unlike section 11054 in chapter 1, none of the AFDC statutes in chapter 2 contains language which expressly authorizes an individual\u2019s being \u201csubjected] to the penalty prescribed for perjury in the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">In dismissing the perjury charge below, the superior court impliedly ruled\u2014and respondent reasserts on appeal\u2014that since section 11483 is a \u201cspecial\u201d statute dealing with AFDC fraud, the more \u201cgeneral\u201d perjury provisions of section 118 do not apply. Reference is made to \u201c\u2018the general rule that where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act, and thus conflict with it, the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment.\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Williamson </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 651, 654 [276 P.2d 593], citations omitted; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Attorney General responds by relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Isaac </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 679 [128 Cal.Rptr. 872], in which the Court of Appeal held that a prosecution for perjury under section 118 was not precluded by the misdemeanor provisions of section <em>11482. </em>The Court of Appeal noted that \u201c[a] special statute does not supplant a general statute unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>all of the requirements of the general statute are covered in the special statute.\u201d (56 Cal.App.3d at p. 683.) The court then compared the elements of section 118 with those contained in section 11482. Since section 118 applies only to false statements <em>under oath or affirmation </em>whereas section 11482 (like \u00a7 11483) covers <em>any </em>false statements, the court concluded that \u201cthe rule articulated in <em>Williamson </em>is inapplicable. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">However, this analysis is defective for it is incomplete. It is true, as the <em>Isaac </em>court divined from <em>Gilbert, </em>that the <em>Williamson </em>rule is applicable when each element of the \u201cgeneral\u201d statute corresponds to an element on the face of the \u201cspecific\u201d statute. However, the converse does not necessarily follow. It is not correct to assume that the rule is inapplicable whenever the general statute contains an element not found within the four corners of the \u201cspecial\u201d law. Rather, the courts must consider the <em>context </em>in which the statutes are placed. If it appears from the entire context that a violation of the \u201cspecial\u201d statute will necessarily or commonly result in a violation of the \u201cgeneral\u201d statute, the <em>Williamson </em>rule may apply even though the elements of the general statute are not mirrored on the face of the special statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Two cases underscore this point. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Swann </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 447 [28 Cal.Rptr. 830], the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing indicated that the defendant had made two purchases of goods using a stolen credit card. The prosecution charged the crime of forgery, a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 470.) The accused moved under Penal Code section 995 to dismiss the forgery count on the ground that the Penal Code provisions relating to credit card use precluded a conviction for the more general crime of forgery. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 484a, subd. (b)(6).) The superior court granted the section 995 motion, and the Court of Appeal affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The Court of Appeal stated that \u201cthe People do not have the power to prosecute under the general felony statute in a case such as this where the facts of the alleged offense parallel the acts proscribed by a specific statute.\u201d (213 Cal.App.2d at p. 449.) The court noted that the crime of forgery contained as an element a requirement that the accused \u201csign\u201d the credit instrument, whereas the offense of credit card use applied on its face to any \u201cuse\u201d of the credit card. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 451.) Nevertheless, the court held the credit card use law was a special statute precluding prosecution for forgery, because \u201cthe Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>enacting section 484a. . <em>.contemplated false or unauthorized signatures on credit invoices </em>by parties engaged in the misdemeanor use of credit cards under subsection (6) of subdivision (b) of the statute since such signatures are required of credit card users <em>in the customary use of such cards.\u201d (Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A similar holding was recently rendered by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ruster </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 690 [129 Cal.Rptr. 153, 548 P.2d 353, 80 A.L.R.3d 1269]. In <em>Ruster </em>an individual had used a false name and a false social security number to obtain unemployment insurance benefits. Convicted of grand theft and 14 counts of forgery, the defendant argued that these convictions were barred by section 2101 of the Unemployment Insurance Code, which makes it \u201ca misdemeanor to willfully make a false statement or representation... to obtain.. . any benefit or payment. .. .\u201d The court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The reasoning employed by the court in precluding the forgery convictions is particularly relevant here. The court observed that forgery contained one element\u2014\u201csigning the name of another, or of a fictitious person\u201d to a document\u2014which was not a requirement on the face of the unemployment insurance fraud statute. (16 Cal.3d at p. 698.) Nevertheless, the court held that section 2101 was a special statute which barred a conviction under the general forgery statutes. The court discussed <em>Swann, supra, </em>with approval, and concluded, \u201c[h]ere, too, the Legislature unquestionably contemplated that the special statute might be violated by means of forgery. Indeed, applying for aid under a false identity, which entails signing eligibility questionnaires and pay certification cards with a false name, is apparently one of the most common forms of unemployment insurance fraud.\u201d (16 Cal.3d at p. 699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In the present appeal, it is true that the assertedly \u201cgeneral\u201d crime of perjury requires as an element of the offense that a false statement be made <em>under oath or affirmation </em>whereas the crime of AFDC fraud applies on its face to <em>any </em>false statement made to obtain benefits. However, this fact does not per se render the principles of <em>Williamson </em>inapplicable. Consideration must be given to the entire context surrounding the \u201cspecial\u201d statute to determine the true overlap of the statutes and to ascertain the intent of the Legislature. To the extent that <em>Isaac, supra, </em>holds to the contrary, it is hereby disapproved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Respondent argues that although section 11483 contains on its face no requirement that a person\u2019s false statement to obtain AFDC benefits be made under oath or penalty of perjury, reference to other portions of the Welfare and Institutions Code reveals that <em>in fact </em>a person cannot obtain AFDC benefits without making such a statement. Thus, an initial application for AFDC benefits must contain an affirmation of eligibility, including \u201ca written declaration that the affirmation is made under penalty of perjury.\u201d (\u00a7 11054.) Moreover, both the annual redeterminations of eligibility and the monthly income reports require the family to complete a certificate of eligibility \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d (\u00a7 11265.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The Attorney General suggests two factual situations in which an individual assertedly could be guilty of AFDC fraud without violating the perjury provision of section 118. The first assertedly would occur \u201cwhen the applicant is detected as making a false application prior to the initial declaration of eligibility.\u201d However, this example erroneously assumes that an applicant can \u201cmak[e] a false application\u201d and obtain aid<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> without completing the application under penalty of perjury. That assumption is squarely refuted by the plain terms of section 11054, requiring all AFDC applications to be completed under penalty of perjury \u201cbefore approval of assistance.. . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s second example relates to an AFDC applicant who has lawfully obtained AFDC benefits but who subsequently has a \u201cmaterial change of circumstance which lowers the amount of benefits he should receive. If the applicant does not notify the appropriate authorities pursuant to his WR-2 certification, he will continue to receive benefits until the next WR-7 form arrives. If the applicant then terminates his receipt of benefits, and never completes the WR-7 form, no perjury is committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>However, the facts set forth in this example would not result in criminal liability either for perjury under section 118 or for fraud under section 11483. Initially, it is not at all obvious that a failure to report income under the postulated circumstances would amount to a \u201cfalse statement or representation or...impersonation or other fraudulent device....\u201d But even assuming this element of section 11483 to be present, the manner in which the AFDC program is administered would preclude the applicant from actually obtaining benefits to which he or she is not entitled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, there would be no violation of section 11483.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">It would appear that there are no situations in which an individual can violate section 11483 without also committing perjury. The specific-versus-general rule of <em>Williamson, Swann, Gilbert, </em>and <em>Ruster </em>would therefore seem to be applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">However, due to the unique circumstances of the present case, this conclusion does not end the inquiry.  The doctrine that a specific statute precludes any prosecution under a general statute is a rule designed to ascertain and carry out legislative intent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The fact that the Legislature has enacted a specific statute covering much the same ground as a more general law is a powerful indication that the Legislature intended the specific provision alone to apply. Indeed, in most instances, an overlap of provisions is determinative of the issue of legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>lative intent and \u201crequires us to give effect to the special provision alone in the face of the dual applicability of the general provision... and the special provision....\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In the present case, however, there exists what can only be characterized as overwhelming indications of a contrary legislative intent. In this limited situation, the usually decisive rule that a specific statute precludes prosecution under a general statute cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The language of two relevant provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code, i.e., sections 11054 and 11265, is significant. Section 11054, which is a general provision applicable to all of the public assistance programs in part 3 of division 9, requires applicants for these programs merely to file an \u201caffirmation\u201d of eligibility prior to receiving aid. In the next sentence, the statute expressly mentions the AFDC program and states that \u201cin the case of applicants for aid to families with dependent children,\u201d these \u201cstatements\u201d of eligibility \u201cshall contain a written declaration that the affirmation is made under penalty of perjury.\u201d Thus, of all the programs in part 3, only AFDC applications are required by section 11054 to be completed under penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The third sentence of section 11054 contains the statement that \u201c[a]ny person signing a statement <em>containing such declaration. </em>. .is subject to the penalty prescribed for perjury in the Penal Code\u201d if he or she willfully and knowingly and with intent to deceive makes a false statement. (Italics added.) The explicit function of this third sentence is to authorize a perjury prosecution under section 118. Moreover, that legislative purpose is aimed specifically and exclusively at AFDC applications. The only referent for \u201ca statement containing such declaration\u201d in the third sentence is language in the second sentence which refers to a \u201cstatement ]... containing] a written declaration\u201d that the affirmation of eligibility is made under penalty of perjury. The quoted language from the second sentence, in turn, applies solely to AFDC applicants. The conclusion is unavoidable that section 118 has been incorporated into the AFDC program by virtue of section 11054, at least as to initial applications for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The situation is only slightly different with respect to annual redeterminations of aid and monthly eligibility reports. Section 11054 permits \u00e1 county to require \u201cnew statements\u201d at any time for purposes of continuing assistance. Section 11265, which is one of the AFDC provisions in chapter 2, obliges a family receiving AFDC to complete a \u201ccertificate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of eligibility\u201d at each annual redetermination of eligibility. It also permits the county to require such certificates \u201cmonthly or at such other intervals as may be deemed necessary.... \u201d Each adult member of the family is obligated to provide \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d the information necessary to complete such certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Under other circumstances, it might be possible to infer that section 118 does not apply to misstatements on such certificates since neither section 11265 nor any other provision in chapter 2 contains language like that of section 11054, explicitly making such misstatements \u201csubject to the penalty prescribed for perjury in the Penal Code.\u201d However, the history of section 11265 reveals this inference to be incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Prior to 1971, section 11265 did not contain the requirement that information relevant to a certificate of eligibility be provided under penalty of perjury. Instead, it provided that \u201c[a]ny person signing such certificate who willfully states therein any material matter which he knows to be false is <em>guilty of a </em>misdemeanor.\u201d (Italics added.) Relying in large part upon this language, the Court of Appeal held that section 11265 was a special statute pertaining to redetermination certificates and thus precluded prosecutions for perjury for any misstatements. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 134 [56 Cal.Rptr. 258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In 1971, the Legislature deleted the language relied upon in <em>Smith. </em>(Sen. Bill No. 796 (1971 Reg. Sess.); Stats. 1971, ch. 578, \u00a7 25, p. 1154, eff. Aug. 13, 1971.) In place of the misdemeanor provision, the Legislature inserted the present sentence, obligating a family to provide the necessary information \u201cunder penalty of perjury.\u201d Shortly after this substitution was made in Senate Bill No. 796, an analysis of the bill was prepared by the Legislative Analyst. The proposed amendment to section 11265 was described as follows: \u201cSection 25 of this bill proposes elimination of the current provisions defining attempts to fraudently secure AFDC assistance as a misdemeanor. It further provides that persons attempting to secure such aid fraudently shall <em>be deemed to be guilty of perjury.\u201d </em>(Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 796 (as amended Aug. 10, 1971) by Leg. Analyst, at p. 17, original underscoring deleted, italics added.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>In light of this history, the conclusion appears unavoidable that the Legislature intended the perjury provisions of the Penal Code to be available as an alternative charge for misstatements made in connection with annual redeterminations and monthly eligibility reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Respondent tenders two arguments in support of her contention that section 11483 bars prosecution under section 118. Initially, she points out that the penalty provisions of section 11483 were enacted in 1970, well after the language had been added to section 11054 explicitly authorizing perjury prosecutions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> To the extent these two statutes conflict, she argues, the later enactment (\u00a7 11483) should prevail as an implied repeal of the older statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The difficulty with this contention is that it proves too much. If the 1970 amendments to section 11483 constituted an implied repeal of the language in section 11054, then it would seem to follow that the 1971 amendment to section 11265 impliedly repealed both sections 11482 and 11483. This court can (discern no such legislative intent. The more logical interpretation is that the Legislature has permitted perjury prosecutions as an alternative to AFDC fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Finally, respondent points out that section 11483 contains a requirement that \u201call actions necessary to secure restitution shall be brought against persons in violation of this section as provided in Sections 12250 and 12850.\u201d (Cf. fn. 2, <em>ante, </em>at p. 498.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 948, 955 [140 Cal.Rptr. 657, 568 P.2d 382], this court held that this provision \u201cmust be accorded mandatory effect\u201d and that the state could not bring a criminal action for AFDC fraud until it had sought restitution. These holdings were based squarely on our finding that this restitution requirement was intended by the Legislature to \u201cprovide protection for individuals accused of welfare fraud....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 961, original italics deleted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Respondent complains that if a perjury prosecution is permissible as an alternative to section 11483, the state can circumvent this protection by the simple device of charging perjury rather than AFDC fraud, thereby frustrating legislative intent. It is noted that a divided Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Batten </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 848 [150 Cal.Rptr. 567] approved a perjury prosecution for misstatements in obtaining AFDC benefits without requiring the state to conform to the restitution requirement of <em>McGee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Respondent\u2019s argument has merit. Allowing a perjury prosecution to go forward where the state has made no attempt at restitution would fly squarely in the face of the Legislature\u2019s repeated insistence on a request for restitution. That intent was manifested for the first time in 1957 (see <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 959) and was reiterated in the 1970, 1977, and 1979 amendments to section 11483.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">However, the consequence of accepting this argument should not be to bar prosecutions for perjury. Rather, the various legislative intents can be easily harmonized. To carry out the Legislature\u2019s oft-expressed wishes with regard to restitution, no prosecution under section 118 for AFDC fraud may be commenced until the restitution requirements set forth in section 11483 are satisfied.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">An individual cannot commit AFDC fraud without also violating the perjury provisions of the Penal Code. However, there is overwhelming evidence that by incorporating section 118 into the AFDC program via sections 11054 and 11265, the Legislature intended to permit prosecutions for AFDC fraud to proceed either under section 11483 or section 118. Therefore, under these limited facts, the usually conclusive rule that specific statutes preclude a prosecution for a general crime must give way to the clear and incontrovertible evidence of the .Legislature\u2019s intent. The superior court\u2019s order dismissing the perjury charge is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b526-5\">There may have been other months in the period from April 1975 through May 1976 in which respondent obtained AFDC benefits and omitted to disclose income. However, the evidence presented at the preliminary examination below showed failures to report income only in the three months discussed in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 11483 currently provides: \u201cWhenever any person has, by means of false statement or representation or by impersonation or other fraudulent device, obtained aid for a child not in fact entitled thereto, the person obtaining such aid shall be punished as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201c(1) If the amount obtained or retained is two hundred dollars ($200) or less, by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months, a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500), or by both such imprisonment and fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201c(2) If the amount obtained or retained is more than two hundred dollars ($200), by imprisonment in the state prison, or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">\u201c <em>When the allegation is limited to failure to report not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000) of income or resources, or the failure to report the presence of an additional person or persons in the </em>household, all actions necessary to secure restitution shall be brought against persons in violation of this section as provided in Sections 12250 and 12850. <em>Such action for restitution may be satisfied by sending a registered letter requesting restitution to the last address at which the person was receiving public </em>assistance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The underscored portions of section 11483 were added by Statutes 1979, chapter 1171, section 1, No. 8 West\u2019s California Legislative Service, page 4789, No. 6 Deering\u2019s Advance Legislative Service, page 1034.

A copy of the affirmation shall be furnished to the applicant or other person completing it ,at the time it is filed. Such other person completing an affirmation who willfully and knowingly with intent to deceive states as true any material matter which he knows to be false is subject to the penalty prescribed for perjury in the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u201cA county department may also require like statements to be completed prior to approving restoration of aid as provided by Section 11051, and may require new statements at any time for purposes of continuing assistance.\u201d The section has remained unchanged since 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\">Section 11265 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) The county shall redetermine eligibility annually. The county shall at the time of such redetermination, and may monthly or at such other intervals as may be deemed necessary, require the family to complete a certificate of eligibility containing a written declaration of such information as may be required to establish the continuing eligibility and amount of grant pursuant to Section 11004 of this code.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">\u201c(b) The certificate shall include blanks wherein shall be stated the names of all children receiving aid, their present place of residence, the names and status of any other adults living in the home, the name, and if known, the social security number and present whereabouts of a parent who is not living in the home, and any outside income that may have been received through employment, gifts, or the sale of real or personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">\u201cEach adult member of the family shall provide, under penalty of perjury, the information necessary to complete such certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Although organized somewhat differently, the above-quoted portion of section 11265 was in effect during the time respondent\u2019s daughter received AFDC benefits.

Moreover, under the Uniform Determinate Sentencing Act, perjury is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 126.) If an individual is sentenced to prison for a felony violation of section 11483, the base term of imprisonment is sixteen months or two or three years. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 18.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">At the time of respondent\u2019s alleged crime, perjury was punishable under the Indeterminate Sentence Law by imprisonment for 1 to 14 years in state prison, and felonious AFDC fraud by imprisonment for 1 to 10 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In an early portion of the <em>Ruster </em>opinion, it was stated that \u201ca special statute does not supplant a general statute unless <em>all </em>of the elements of the general statute are included in the special statute.\u201d (16 Cal.3d at p. 694, italics in original.) This language is easily susceptible of misconstruction and is in fact inconsistent with the actual analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>undertaken in <em>Ruster </em>itself. To avoid further undue confusion, the quoted language on page 694 of Ruster\u2014but <em>only </em>this language\u2014is also disapproved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The Department of Social Services used the WR-2 forms (now CA-2 forms) when an applicant initially applied for AFDC benefits or when the annual redetermination of eligibility was made. (See Dept, of Social Services, Manual of Pol. &amp; Proc., Eligibility &amp; Asst. Standards, std. 40-181.11 [hereafter EAS].) The WR-7 form (now CA-7 form) has been employed for the income reports which are filled out \u201cmonthly or at such other intervals as may be deemed necessary....\u201d (\u00a7 11265, subd. (a).) At the time respondent\u2019s daughter received AFDC benefits, WR-7 forms were required on a monthly basis. (See now EAS, std. 40-181.22.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">If an applicant makes out a false application but obtains no AFDC benefits, the crime defined by section 11483 has not been committed. (See fn. 2, ante, at p. 498.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">After a family has received AFDC benefits for two months, the amount of aid to which it is entitled is determined by the so-called Prior Month Budgeting System (PMB). (See EAS, std. 44-315.6.) Under PMB, the amount of benefits received in one month (e.g., October) depends primarily upon the family\u2019s income two months earlier (i.e., in August).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Under long-standing regulations of the Department of Social Services, a recipient must file an eligibility and income report (i.e., a WR-7 form) in every month for which benefits are sought. (See EAS, stds. 40-181.11, 40-181.22.) No aid will be provided unless that form has been completed and returned to the county AFDC office. (See EAS, std. 44-315.72.) If no WR-7 form is received, the recipient\u2019s AFDC grant is terminated. (EAS, std. 44-315.72.) According to amicus, this is in fact the most common method for recipients to terminate AFDC aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Finally, section 11455 provides that \u201c[i]f on the first day of the month a child is eligible for aid, aid for the entire month shall be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Application of these rules to the hypothetical situation suggested by the Attorney General indicates that no overpayment would result if a family on AFDC had an increase in income and simply decided to refrain from filling out or returning any more WR-7 forms. Any aid that family was currently receiving would be based upon the family\u2019s situation two months earlier\u2014when it was eligible for the current amount\u2014 and all future aid would be terminated by virtue of the failure to complete the next monthly WR-7 form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\">At oral argument respondent repeatedly declined to argue that the rule has constitutional implications. Therefore, this court need not consider that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The Legislative Analyst\u2019s description was somewhat misleading, for Senate Bill No. 796 did not propose elimination of <em>all </em>provisions that treated attempted AFDC fraud as a misdemeanor. The bill left section 11482 intact. Nor did the amendment proposed in Senate Bill No. 796 provide that <em>all </em>attempts to secure AFDC benefits fraudulently would be punishable as perjury. By its very terms, the amendment to section 11265 applied only to annual redeterminations and monthly eligibility reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">These overbroad statements in the Legislative Analyst\u2019s report do not aid respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>however, for they suggest that some legislators may have believed the 1971 amendment was even more punitive than in fact was true.
