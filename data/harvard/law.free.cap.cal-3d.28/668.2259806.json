(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5; unless otherwise indicated subsequent statutory references are to this code.) Accordingly, petitioner\u2019s demurrer to applicants\u2019 petition for such writ was properly overruled, and His petition for mandate and/or prohibition to restrain further trial court proceedings will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In reviewing this matter we reaffirm our traditional reluctance to interpose prerogative writ review of rulings on pleadings. <em>(State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 237, 243, fn. 3 [115 Cal.Rptr. 497, 524 P.2d 1281]; <em>Babb </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 851 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) We are persuaded, however, that the procedural validity herein presented is an important and continuing issue in California administrative practice fully meriting our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Procedural Posture</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">According to factual allegations in the petition, applicants were required to vacate apartment dwellings occupied by them as tenants after the City of Oroville declared them to be dangerous and unfit for human habitation. Applicants thereupon unsuccessfully applied to the Butte County Department of Social Welfare (county) for funds to relocate. Thereafter, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 10950, applicants requested and received a \u201cfair hearing\u201d before an appropriate officer of that department for the purpose of challenging county\u2019s action. Following the hearing, during which applicants presented testimony and arguments, petitioner denied their claims on the ground that departmental regulations covering \u201cnon-recurring special needs\u201d do not authorize expenditure of housing relocation funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Seeking to compel petitioner to set aside his decision and to afford them relief, applicants petitioned the Superior Court of Butte County for a writ of mandamus pursuant to section 1094.5, claiming that the departmental regulations violated federal and state law. (See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(e); Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 11450, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Petitioner demurred to applicants\u2019 petition, contending that the appropriate method of challenging the validity of a departmental regulation was either by petition for \u201cordinary\u201d mandamus under sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion 1085 or by an action for declaratory relief pursuant to section 1060. Following the overruling of his demurrer petitioner here seeks an extraordinary writ to annul the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Judicial. Interpretation of the Applicable Statutes</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Initially, we note that a demurrer must be overruled if the moving party has alleged facts entitling him to some form of relief.  More specifically, we have said that if a proper basis for issuance of mandamus is alleged, \u201cit is unimportant that plaintiffs pleading was not in form a petition for mandamus.. .. \u201d <em>(Boren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 634, 638 [234 P.2d 981]; see also, <em>Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 802, 813-814 [140 Cal.Rptr. 442, 567 P.2d 1162] [proceeding brought pursuant to \u00a7 1085 properly treated as one brought pursuant to \u00a7 1094.5].) Here, petitioner apparently conceding that applicants\u2019 factual allegations would state a cause of action for issuance of a writ of mandamus pursuant to section 1085 (rather than \u00a7 1094.5), the propriety of the trial court\u2019s order overruling petitioner\u2019s demurrer becomes even clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Section 1094.5, subdivision (a), provides as follows: \u201cWhere the writ is issued for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal, corporation, board or officer, the case shall be heard by the court sitting without a jury. All or part of the record of the proceedings before the inferior tribunal, corporation, board or officer may be filed with the petition, may be filed with respondent\u2019s points and authorities or may be ordered to be filed by the court. If the expense of preparing all or any part of the record has been borne by the prevailing party, such expense shall be taxable as costs.\u201d When the three elements of hearing, evidence, and discretion are found to be present, \u201cby the very terms of the statute [\u00a7 1094.5, subd. (a)], the procedure there set forth is to be utilized in all cases in which review of a final adjudicatory order is sought by mandate. ... \u201d <em>(Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp., supra, </em>at p. 814, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Of course, mandamus pursuant to section 1094.5, commonly denominated \u201cadministrative\u201d mandamus, is mandamus still. It is not possessed of \u201ca separate and distinctive legal personality. It is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>remedy removed from the general law of mandamus or exempted from the latter\u2019s established principles, requirements and limitations.\u201d <em>(Grant </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 820, 826 [43 Cal.Rptr. 270]; see <em>Anton </em>v. <em>San Antonio Community Hosp., supra, </em>19 Cal. 3d at p. 814.) The full panoply of rules applicable to \u201cordinary\u201d mandamus applies to \u201cadministrative\u201d mandamus proceedings, except where modified by statute. (See 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 213, p. 3970; Cal. Administrative Mandamus (Cont.Ed.Bar 1966) \u00a7 1.5, p. 7.)  Because applicants are conceded to have stated a cause of action for some form of extraordinary relief, petitioner\u2019s demurrer properly was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">More fundamentally, however, the specific extraordinary relief sought by applicants here\u2014a writ of mandamus pursuant to section 1094.5\u2014is the proper means for review of an adjudicatory decision of the Department of Social Services which is alleged to be invalid because it is based upon an invalid regulation. The propriety of such procedure is grounded upon two statutory footings\u2014sections 10950-10965 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, containing the manner for assertion of entitlement to public social service benefits, and section 1094.5 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Several sections of the Welfare and Institutions Code are pertinent. Section 10950 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any applicant for. . .public social services is dissatisfied with any action of the county department relating to his application... he shall,. . . upon filing a request with the State Department of Social Services. . ., be accorded an opportunity for a fair hearing.\u201d The \u201cfair hearing,\u201d by virtue of section 10953 of the code, is to be conducted by the director of the department, by the department\u2019s administrative adviser, by a referee employed by the department or, in certain cases, by a representative of the Office of Administrative Hearings, each acting with all the powers and authority conferred upon the head of the department. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7 10954.) Other sections of this code provide for the procedural details of the hearing. <em>{Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 10955-10960.) The statutes impose no limitation, factual or legal, upon the issues which may be raised in the \u201cfair hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Section 10962 of the Welfare and Institutions Code explicitly provides for judicial review of the director\u2019s final decision in the following manner: \u201cThe applicant. ., within one year after receiving notice of the director\u2019s final decision, may file a petition with the superior court, under the provisions of Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>praying for a review of the entire proceedings in the matter, upon questions of law involved in the case. Such review, if granted, shall be the exclusive remedy available to the applicant... for review of the director\u2019s decision. [H],. .The applicant... shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, if he obtains a decision in his favor.\u201d Significantly, the judicial review contemplated is \u201cof the entire proceedings,\u201d including, of course, \u201cquestions of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Applicants have fully complied with the requirements of this statutory scheme in asserting their claims for social service benefits: They applied to the county for such benefits; upon denial of their applications, they sought and obtained a \u201cfair hearing\u201d; and upon receipt of the director\u2019s final decision rejecting their applications, they timely filed in the superior court a petition for section 1094.5 mandamus, as directed by Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Quite apart from the specific authorization of Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962, we have declared as a general principle: \u201cSince the enactment of section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is no longer open to question that in this state the writ of mandamus is appropriate \u2018for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Boren </em>v. <em>State Personnel Board, supra, </em>37 Cal.2d at p. 637.) The scope of the proceeding is contemplated by section 1094.5, subdivision (b): \u201cThe inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the [administrative agency] has proceeded without, or in excess of jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the [agency] has not proceeded in the manner required by law,...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The Contentions and the.Decisional Law</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Petitioner argues, initially, that although routinely it may be proper to review adjudicatory decisions by a section 1094.5 proceeding, the absence of any substantial factual dispute renders such a proceeding inappropriate in the present matter. Petitioner notes that the parties agree that the regulations in question preclude the relief sought by applicants on the facts of their respective cases. Rather, it is the asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>invalidity of the regulations themselves which is the essential basis for applicants\u2019 claims. Because the <em>promulgation </em>of that regulation was a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d as opposed to \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d (or adjudicatory) function, petitioner urges that a review by administrative mandamus is inappropriate, and that applicants\u2019 remedy is limited to \u201cordinary\u201d mandamus or declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In so contending, however, petitioner ignores the fact that applicants\u2019 claims were denied in an adjudicatory hearing. Nor does the fact that one of the issues involved an attack on the validity of administrative regulations transform an essentially adjudicatory determination into a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d one. The \u201cfair hearing\u201d in which applicants\u2019 request for assistance was denied was, manifestly, \u201ca proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to be taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal, ...\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (a).) The proceeding was adjudicatory in nature because it involved \u201ca determination by the agency of what the facts are in relation to specific private rights or interests.\u201d (Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.2, p. 10; see <em>Wulzen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1894) 101 Cal. 15, 24 [35 P. 353].) It is readily apparent that applicants\u2019 claims are predicated upon the existence of facts which are peculiar to them: notice to quit specific dangerous and unfit rental housing, request for relocation assistance, and denial of assistance by the county. The assertion of such claims places in issue the validity of the regulations pursuant to which relief was denied them. This does not immunize their case from the clear statutory direction which gives them section 1094.5 review of that denial as their \u201cexclusive remedy.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10962.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Petitioner emphasizes the well established \u201ccritical distinction involved in judicial review of quasi-legislative and quasi-adjudicative administrative acts,\u201d and relies upon our analysis in <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28, 34-35, footnote 2 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29], wherein we said: \u201cGenerally speaking, a legislative action is the formulation of a rule to be applied to all future cases, while an adjudicatory act involves the actual application of such a rule to a specific set of existing facts.\u201d (See also <em>Wulzen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors, supra, </em>101 Cal. at p. 24; Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.8, p. 17.) Our review of the record convinces us that the case involves the latter category within the <em>Strumsky </em>formulation. Accordingly, contrary to petitioner\u2019s assertions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>neither <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Perluss </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 824 [27 Cal.Rptr. 19, 377 P.2d 83], nor <em>Brock </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 109 Cal.App.2d 594 [241 P.2d 283] constitute useful precedent. Each of these cases involved \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d determinations for which section 1094.5 review was disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">From the foregoing we conclude that an unsuccessful applicant for welfare benefits may contest the validity of a regulation which mandates the denial of his application both in the \u201cfair hearing\u201d provided by section 10950 and in the subsequent judicial review under section 1094.5. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10962; <em>Verdugo Hills Hospital, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Health </em>(1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 957 [152 Cal.Rptr. 263]; <em>Ross Gen. Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 346 [147 Cal.Rptr. 801]; <em>Rosas </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 77 [88 Cal.Rptr. 907, 43 A.L.R.3d 537]; see also <em>Repko </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 249 [122 Cal.Rptr. 29]; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 215, p. 3972; Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.9, p. 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In <em>Rosas, supra, </em>10 Cal.App.3d 77, a welfare applicant who was denied public assistance pursuant to a departmental regulation which excluded alcoholism as an \u201cimpairment\u201d qualifying a person for such benefits sought to invalidate the regulation on the ground that it was an unreasonable interpretation of the governing statute. Having failed to obtain relief in the administrative \u201cfair hearing,\u201d applicant \u201cwas entitled to [seek]\u201d section 1094.5 relief. (10 Cal.App.3d at p. 86.) The <em>Rosas </em>court invalidated the regulation in part and concluded that the director\u2019s application of the invalid regulation was not proceeding \u201cin the manner required by law.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5, subd. (b).) (To the extent language in <em>Rosas </em>may be interpreted as approval of \u00a7 1094.5 review of regulations which have <em>not </em>been applied to applicants within specific factual settings (see 10 Cal.App.3d at p. 86), such language is disapproved.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The <em>Rosas </em>reasoning and result were applied in <em>Ross, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.3d 346, in which an applicant for exemption from new Health and Safety Code requirements was denied relief under a departmental regulation. Applicant sought and was granted section 1094.5 review of the administrative determination in the superior court. Upon appeal, the court cited <em>Rosas </em>for its holding that \u201cthe validity of [the] regulations as applied to the situation of the case at bench was placed in issue by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>[applicant\u2019s] petition for administrative mandate.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 351.) It thereupon proceeded to find the regulation invalid because, \u201cas applied to the fact situation here presented the regulation is contrary to the statute.. . . \u201d (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The reasoning of this line of cases was recently summarized in <em>Verdugo Hills, supra, </em>88 Cal.App.3d 957:  \u201cThe validity of an administrative regulation, in whole or in part, as applied to a petitioner in an administrative mandamus proceeding, may be challenged therein by that petitioner where the basis of the challenge is that the regulation or some portion thereof is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute . .. and is therefore void.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 962-963.) <em>Verdugo Hills </em>noted that \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d under section 1094.5 is established if \u201cthe administrative agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law. Proceeding pursuant to an invalid regulation is not proceeding in the manner required by law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The <em>Verdugo Hills </em>rationale is squarely applicable to the facts before us. Applicants may seek review of petitioner\u2019s decision denying them benefits while simultaneously challenging the validity of the regulations in question. If the trial court should find that the regulations are invalid as applied to applicants, it may grant them relief for petitioner\u2019s \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d in applying invalid regulations. Neither law nor logic should compel any different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We are unpersuaded by the force of the related objections to section 1094.5 review advanced by petitioner, namely, that (1) the \u201cwrong\u201d standard of review necessarily will be applied to the administrative promulgation of the regulation, and (2) an inadequate \u201crecord\u201d is generated in the \u201cfair hearing\u201d required by section 10950 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">It is true that the judicial review of an administrator\u2019s \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d conduct traditionally has been limited to a determination of whether such action has been \u201carbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or whether he has failed to follow the procedure and give the notices required by law.\u201d <em>(Brock </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>109 Cal.App.2d at p. 605.) Petitioner asserts that this contrasts sharply with section 1094.5, subdivision (c) which requires entirely different standards of review\u2014\u201cweight of the evidence\u201d and \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d\u2014in determining whether an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d exists. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>er, subdivision (c) specifically relates only to cases in which abuse of discretion is claimed to result from the fact that the administrator\u2019s \u201cfindings are not supported by the evidence....\u201d It does not purport to allude to situations, such as that before us, in which the abuse of discretion is claimed to result from an administrator\u2019s failure to proceed \u201cin the manner required by law.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) Nor should it.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The proper scope of a court\u2019s review is determined by the task before it.  Where a statute empowers an administrative agency to adopt regulations, such regulations \u201cmust be consistent, not in conflict with the statute, and reasonably necessary to effectuate its purpose.\u201d <em>(Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 669, 679 [94 Cal.Rptr. 279, 483 P.2d 1231]; Gov. Code, \u00a7 11342.2.) The task of the reviewing court in such a case \u201c\u2018is to decide whether the [agency] reasonably interpreted the legislative mandate.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Credit Ins. Gen. Agents Assn. </em>v. <em>Payne </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 651, 657 [128 Cal.Rptr. 881, 547 P.2d 993].) Such a limited scope of review constitutes no judicial interference with the administrative discretion in that aspect of the rulemaking function which requires a high degree of technical skill and expertise. (See <em>Ray </em>v. <em>Parker </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 275, 310-311 [101 P.2d 665].) Correspondingly, there is no agency discretion to promulgate a regulation which is inconsistent with the governing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We repeat our admonition expressed in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 737 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]: \u201cOur function is to inquire into the legality of the regulations, not their wisdom.... Administrative regulations that violate acts of the Legislature are void and no protestations that they are merely an exercise of administrative discretion can sanctify them.\u201d Acknowledging that the interpretation of a statute by one charged with its administration was entitled to great weight, we nonetheless affirmed: \u201c\u2018Whatever the force of administrative construction... final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.\u2019 [Citations.] Administrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may, but it is their obligation to [,] strike down such regulations.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Similarly, the limited challenge herein presented does not involve the adequacy of the administrative record. (See <em>Transcentury Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 835, 842 [116 Cal.Rptr. 487]; cf., <em>State of California </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Cal.3d at p. 256.) We do not suggest, of course, that augmentation of an administrative record would not be available under the Code of Civil Procedure in a case requiring it. (See Cal. Administrative Mandamus, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13.20, pp. 230-231; 5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Extraordinary Writs, \u00a7 213, p. 3969.) But ours is not such a case. Neither the state of the record nor the statutory scope of review is a legitimate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Petitioner contends that, because an administrative agency is compelled to enforce its own regulations, an attack on the validity of those regulations in a statutory \u201cfair hearing\u201d necessarily encourages a \u201cuseless act.\u201d But, on principle, an <em>invalid </em>regulation <em>should </em>be vulnerable to attack at the administrative level. This is consistent both with precedent and common sense. The legislative acceptance of this principle is clear. Government Code section 11342.2 declares: \u201cWhenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement, interpret, make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d Repeatedly, we have held that administrative regulations which exceed the scope of the enabling statute are invalid and have no force or life. (See <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 450, 459-464 [134 Cal.Rptr. 639, 556 P.2d 1090]; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 856, 864-865 [115 Cal.Rptr. 1, 524 P.2d 97]; <em>California Welfare Rights Organization </em>v. <em>Brian </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 237, 239, 242-243 [113 Cal.Rptr. 154, 520 P.2d 970]; <em>In re Jordan </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 930, 939 [103 Cal.Rptr. 849, 500 P.2d 873]; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Pickett, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 669, 675-676, 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The practical effect of prohibiting an administrator from nullifying an invalid regulation of his own making would be to require the invocation of a judicial remedy in all such cases. Such conceptual rigidity is ill-advised. The general principle that courts should not be burdened with matters which can be adequately resolved in administrative fori, frequently expressed in the rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies (see <em>Temescal Water Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. Public Works </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 90, 106 [280 P.2d 1]; <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 292 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715], and cases there cited), is founded at least in part on the wisdom of the efficient use of governmental resources. (See, e.g., <em>In re Serna </em>(1978) 76 Cal.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>App.3d 1010, 1016 [143 Cal.Rptr. 350].) Such use serves the twin goals of avoiding delay and unnecessary expense in vindication of legal rights. Permitting administrators an opportunity to construe challenged regulations in a manner to avoid their invalidation is preferable to requiring a court challenge. Moreover, in those cases in which the validity of such a regulation must be judicially resolved, the task of a reviewing court is simplified by a narrowing and clarification of the issues in an administrative hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Finally, petitioner objects to applicants\u2019 procedural route in this case because of the prospect that attorney\u2019s fees will be awarded if they are successful (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10962). Presumably more applicants will be encouraged thereby to seek section 1094.5 relief, rather than to pursue \u201cregular\u201d mandamus or declaratory remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Such a contention is not persuasive. Attorney\u2019s fees are not necessarily denied to litigants in applicants\u2019 position who pursue another procedural course. Such fees may well be available to successful litigants in \u201cordinary\u201d mandamus and declaratory relief proceedings. (See Gov. Code, \u00a7 800 [fees recoverable against public entity where its action is \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d]; and Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021.5 [similarly against public entity where \u201cimportant\u201d public interest right is vindicated].) Also, it would appear illogical to deny attorney\u2019s fees in cases involving an <em>invalid </em>regulation applied wrongfully, thereby preventing appropriate benefits to a litigant, but to award them when a <em>valid </em>regulation is wrongfully applied, causing the same adverse consequences to the litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Most significantly, of course, Welfare and Institutions Code section 10962 specifically provides for an award of appropriate counsel fees in a case such as this one. We have previously described the purpose of section 10962 as ensuring that aggrieved parties have access to the judicial system to establish their statutory rights. <em>(Tripp </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 671, 680-681 [131 Cal.Rptr. 789, 552 P.2d 749].) The statutory elimination of filing fees and bond requirements, the preference in setting hearing dates, and the authorization of attorney\u2019s fees and costs encourage such access. Because petitioner\u2019s arguments run counter to both the spirit and letter of this legislative purpose, such contentions should receive legislative not judicial attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The practical result of our disposition herein is reasonable.  Invalid regulations need not be applied or enforced in statutory \u201cfair hearings,\u201d and if they are, judicial review may be invoked by \u201cadministrative\u201d mandamus pursuant to section 1094.5. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 10962.) Furthermore, interested persons who are not entitled to such \u201cfair hearings\u201d because they are neither applicants for, nor recipients of, public social service benefits, and who otherwise have standing to complain, still may challenge invalid regulations by mandamus pursuant to section 1085 or by action for declaratory relief pursuant to section 1060. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">For the reasons given, the alternative writ is discharged and the peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Bird, C. J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
