(Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5000 et seq., 5350 et seq. Subsequent statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise indicated.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The conservatorship is based on findings that appellant is \u201cgravely disabled\u201d because he is an incompetent defendant charged with a violent felony. (\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(2).) We conclude that the judgment and order must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">After a September 1974 preliminary hearing appellant was charged with murder. In November 1974 he was found mentally incompetent to stand trial and was committed to the Department of Health for place<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ment in a state hospital (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368 et seq.). There he was entitled to periodic six-month review of his competence <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">In 1976 he was returned to the criminal court for the required 18-month hearing (\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(2)). Again he was found incompetent to stand trial and was recommitted to the state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In October 1977, because he had been confined for the maximum three-year period permitted by section 1370, subdivision (c)(1) and the Department of Health determined there was no substantial likelihood he would regain mental competence in the foreseeable future (\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1)), again he was returned to the criminal court (\u00a7 1370, subd. (c)(2)). In December 1977 a unanimous jury by a preponderance of the evidence found him incompetent to stand trial. Thereafter Judge Chernow, noting that appellant had been the subject of an earlier conservatorship which had terminated prior to the alleged murder, had admitted the killing (\u201cI just let him have it\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and had announced his aim to drive a stake through the heart of a relative, concluded that (1) he was incompetent to stand trial and \u201cwould constitute a danger to the safety of others if he were free of secure custody,\u201d and (2) he appeared to be \u201cgravely disabled\u201d within the meaning of section 5008, subdivision (h)(2). Accordingly, Judge Chernow directed the public guardian to initiate civil conservatorship proceedings under the LPS Act. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In the conservatorship proceedings Judge Ziskrout denied appellant\u2019s request for a second jury trial on the issue of mental competence and, at the guardian\u2019s request, took judicial notice of the December 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>competence hearing. On March 6, 1978, Judge Ziskrout found appellant \u201cgravely disabled.\u201d The guardian was appointed conservator of appellant\u2019s person and estate and was authorized to place him in a state hospital or other mental health facility. (\u00a7\u00a7 5350, 5358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Appellant asserts that (1) a person charged with a violent felony and found mentally incompetent to stand trial may not be civilly committed for reasons and under procedures that differ from those applicable to other mentally disordered persons, (2) to establish grave disability his incompetency must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and (3) his conservatorship violates the proscription of retroactive or ex post facto laws. We examine each contention separately.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Validity of Commitment Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Before 1974, California law provided that persons charged with criminal conduct but found incompetent to stand trial were committed to state hospitals until they became \u201csane\u201d (i.e., competent). Because attainment of competence was the sole standard for release the commitments were indefinite, even permanent, so long as incompetence persisted. (Former Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1368-1370; see Parker, <em>California's New Scheme for the Commitment of Individuals Found Incompetent to Stand Trial </em>(1975) 6 Pacific L.J. 484, 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 715 [32 L.Ed.2d 435, 92 S.Ct. 1845] the Supreme Court struck down similar provisions on grounds that they denied equal protection and due process. The equal protection ruling arose from the premise that persons could not, solely because of pending criminal charges against them, be subject to commitment standards more lenient or release standards more stringent than those applicable to persons not charged with criminal offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Under Indiana law, other mentally disordered persons could be committed and involuntarily confined only if dangerous or in need of custodial care or treatment. Mentally disordered criminal defendants, however, were committed and confined solely on the basis of inability to assist at trial. Their confinement continued as long as that condition persisted, regardless of whether confinement was necessary for treatment or for their or others\u2019 protection. Since pendency of unproved criminal charges was not a reasonable basis for distinction among mentally ill persons, <em>Jackson </em>reasoned, Indiana law denied incompetent criminal defendants equal protection. (P. 730 [32 L.Ed.2d p. 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><em>Jackson </em>held that the procedures also denied due process because, solely for incompetence, they permitted confinement beyond a period \u201creasonably related\u201d to the aims of commitment. The court reasoned as follows: Commitment solely for incompetence is intended to permit treatment to alleviate that condition. Hence, confinement on that ground may not continue beyond the time reasonably necessary to determine whether the purpose of treatment is being served.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Once there appears no substantial likelihood that defendant will regain competence, <em>Jackson </em>concluded, the state must justify further confinement by showing that it is necessary on some ground applicable to all mentally ill persons, such as dangerousness or need for custodial care. The court adopted a \u201crule of reason\u201d that, once hopeless incompetence appears, \u201cthe State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant.\u201d (P. 738 [32 L.Ed.2d p. 451]; cf. <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1956) 350 U.S. 366, 373-374 [100 L.Ed. 412, 418, 76 S.Ct. 410].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Following Jackson, this court invalidated indefinite commitments under California procedures for confinement of incompetent criminal defendants. <em>(In re Davis </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 798, 805-806 [106 Cal.Rptr. 178, 505 P.2d 1018], cert. den. <em>sub nom. Palma </em>v. <em>California, </em>414 U.S. 870 [38 L.Ed.2d 88, 94 S.Ct. 87].) <em>Davis </em>held that, once defendant\u2019s progress toward competence became unlikely, \u201cthe court should either order him released from confinement or initiate appropriate alternative commitment proceedings under the [EPS] Act....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 807.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>When <em>Davis </em>was decided those proceedings included (1) annually renewable conservatorships for \u201cgravely disabled\u201d persons\u2014those mentally unable to provide their \u201cbasic personal needs for food, clothing, or shelter.. .\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(1), 5350 et seq.), and (2) 90-day maximum confinements for \u201cimminently dangerous\u201d persons, renewable only for violence while confined. (\u00a7 5304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Adapting the LPS Act language in <em>Davis, </em>the Legislature in 1974 amended the statutes to bring California\u2019s scheme for confinement of incompetent criminal defendants within constitutional bounds. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1511, p. 3316 et seq.) Under current law a defendant confined for incompetence who has not regained competence must be returned to the superior court after (1) three years, or (2) the maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious underlying offense, whichever is shorter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370, subd. (c)(1)), or whenever the superintendent of the treatment facility sooner determines there is no substantial likelihood the defendant will attain competence (\u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court then must redetermine competence. If defendant is competent, criminal proceedings are resumed. If not the court must either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>release him or order that \u201cgravely disabled\u201d conservatorship proceedings be instituted under the LPS Act (\u00a7 1370, subd. (c)(2)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The Legislature also amended section 5008, subdivision (h), which defines grave disability. The revised section retains the traditional concept of helplessness (subd. (h)(1)) but adds an alternative definition based on criminal incompetence. A person now may be found \u201cgravely disabled\u201d on grounds that he (1) is charged by indictment or information with a felony involving death, great bodily harm, or a serious threat to the physical well-being of another, and (2) is incompetent to assist in his defense because of a mental disorder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His conservatorship may be renewed annually so long as those conditions persist.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Appellant argues that the new scheme is a transparent and unsuccessful evasion of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis. </em>Despite the law\u2019s attempt to make incompetents committable under the \u201ccustomary\u201d civil commitment law, he suggests, it still denies them equal protection because their incompetence bears no rational relationship to the \u201cgrave disability\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>provisions of the LPS Act. <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis, </em>he urges, make unproved criminal charges and a subsequent finding of incompetence insufficient grounds for any distinction, procedural or substantive, from other persons subject to civil commitment. Since he has been found hopelessly incompetent, he contends, he may now be civilly committed only under LPS Act provisions not dealing with criminal incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">He also asserts that the new scheme denies due process because it allows indefinite commitment of hopeless incompetents on that ground alone, without any new showing that they are dangerous, helpless, or otherwise in need of further confinement. Therefore, he concludes, he must be released unless his confinement can be justified under laws articulating one or more of those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The conservator responds that the new commitment procedures do meet constitutional standards because they follow a determination of probable cause to believe defendant committed a violent felony. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1368.1, subd. (a); \u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(2); <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 221, 226-228 [124 Cal.Rptr. 57, 539 P.2d 817].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Separate treatment and indefinite confinement of such a defendant, he contends, are justified on grounds of public safety because the probable criminal conduct evidences extraordinary dangerousness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">We agree that the rulings of <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis </em>are not satisfied by placing arbitrary and discriminatory confinement standards for criminal incompetents in the civil commitment statutes. However, we do not regard those cases as holding that the fact of criminal incompetency may never be a basis for involuntary confinement prescriptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The state has compelling interests in public safety and in humane treatment of the mentally disturbed. (Cf. Turnbull, <em>Law and the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>Mentally Retarded Citizen: American Responses to the Declarations of Rights of the United Nations and International League of Societies for the Mentally Handicapped\u2014Where We Have Been, Are, and Are Headed </em>(1979) 30 Syracuse L.Rev. 1093.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It may adopt more than one procedure for isolating, treating, and restraining dangerous persons; and differences will be upheld if justified. <em>(Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 107, 111 [15 L.Ed.2d 620, 623-624, 86 S.Ct. 760]; <em>In re Gary W., supra, </em>5 Cal. 3d 296, 304.) Variation of the length and conditions of confinement, depending on degrees of danger reasonably perceived as to special classes of persons, is a valid exercise of state power.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">California laws have long followed that premise. For certain purposes they properly classify, separately, those mentally ill persons against whom a judicial determination of criminal conduct has been made since such persons, at least initially, have demonstrated particular danger. (See <em>In re Moye, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d 457, 462; <em>In re Franklin </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 126, 146 [101 Cal.Rptr. 553, 496 P.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The California scheme permits long-term, renewable commitments of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026 et seq.), mentally disordered sex offenders (MDSO\u2019s) (\u00a7 6300 et seq.), and those committed to the Youth Authority (\u00a7 1800 et seq.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 313, 317 [96 Cal.Rptr. 13, 486 P.2d 1213])\u2014in each case on proof that they remain dangerously disturbed. On the other hand, violent persons not adjudicated under the criminal justice system are subject only to the short-term LPS Act procedure for \u201cimminently dangerous\u201d persons. They, unlike those criminally committed, may not be confined indefinitely on psychiatric opinion alone. (\u00a7\u00a7 5300, 5304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Those distinctions have two apparent bases. First, the Legislature apparently concluded that short-term civil confinement is preferable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>most violent incidents caused by mental disturbance and that only seriously dangerous persons should be subject to the trauma and stigma of longer-term confinement. (Parker, <em>supra, </em>6 Pacific L.J. at pp. 501-502.) On the other hand, it was considered that acts serious enough for criminal treatment justify a continuing special interest in a person\u2019s nonpenal confinement for purposes of public safety. (See <em>In re Moye, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 462; <em>In re Franklin, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 145-146; <em>In re Gary W., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d 296, 304.) Weighing the compelling interest in avoiding confinement whenever possible against the equal need to protect society from the seriously dangerous mentally ill, the Legislature has naturally concluded that statutory distinctions must be made on the basis of degree of danger presented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">For the same reasons, some separate treatment of permanently incompetent criminal defendants formally charged with violent felonies is justified. Allegedly they have engaged in violence so critical that serious criminal charges were believed appropriate. Magistrates or grand juries have found substantial evidence that the alleged conduct actually was committed as alleged. Those determinations of probable cause establish strong grounds to believe that, by concrete acts, the incompetent defendants already have seriously imperiled public safety and thus are particularly dangerous. Yet because of permanent incompetence they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>cannot be evaluated and confined for continuing dangerousness under the criminal processes usually applied to serious violent conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We do not gainsay society\u2019s interest in protection against violent, incompetent, criminal defendants. As with those finally adjudicated to be criminally disordered on the basis of prior conduct, that interest continues so long as continuing dangerousness can be shown. (Compare <em>Moye, </em>supra, 22 Cal. 3d at p. 462; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 145-146.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Legislature therefore may provide for the confinement of those persons, on grounds of violent dangerousness, under a scheme different from traditional, short-term, civil commitment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> An LPS conservatorship, with its multiple procedural safeguards and emphasis on treatment (see \u00a7 5352.6), is a proper means to achieve that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Accordingly we conclude that under a separate statutory scheme the state may confine incompetent criminal defendants, <em>on grounds that they remain violently dangerous, </em>when a magistrate or grand jury has found probable cause to believe that they have committed violent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The statutes, however, do not expressly require a showing of continuing dangerousness. They appear to permit indefinite maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>LPS conservatorships solely because the incompetence continues and the violent felony charges have not been dismissed. (\u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(2).) Thus, so that <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis </em>may be respected, the conservator requests that we read a \u201cdangerousness\u201d requirement into the new LPS Act provisions. In <em>Franklin, </em>analogously, we ruled that \u201crestoration to sanity,\u201d the standard for release of criminally insane persons (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.2, former \u00a7 1026a), was satisfied when they no longer represented a danger to health and safety. (7 Cal. 3d at p. 145.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">If feasible within bounds set by their words and purpose, statutes should be construed to preserve their constitutionality. <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253-254 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636]; <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727, 736-737 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406].)  Clearly the Legislature\u2019s focus on violent felony charges reflects a concern as to dangerousness in criminal incompetency cases similar to that previously evidenced in the criminal insanity provisions. Appellant rejects that inference and argues that the Legislature in 1974 intended to preclude dangerousness as a basis for confinement. The history he provides, though, contradicts his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In 1973 hearings on the <em>Jackson-Davis </em>problem (Assem. Select Com. on Mentally Disordered Criminal Offenders, Dec. 13-14, 1973) legislators, health professionals, and the Attorney General\u2019s representative contended that incompetents charged with violent felonies warranted special treatment precisely because their past conduct implied future danger. Participants in the hearings also feared that many of those persons, while delusional and potentially violent if released, would \u201cslip through the cracks\u201d if they neither behaved violently in short-term confinement (a requirement for renewal of 90-day \u201cimminent threat\u201d commitments under the LPS Act) nor could be proved unable to care for themselves (necessary for a traditional LPS Act \u201cgravely disabled\u201d conservatorship).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Appellant also argues that we may not prescribe a dangerousness requirement since we cannot identify which of the several \u201cdanger\u201d definitions appearing in California statutes the Legislature itself would apply to criminal incompetents. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1800 [extended commitment of Youth Authority inmate <em>\u201cphysically dangerous </em>to the public\u201d because of \u201cmental or physical deficiency, disorder, or abnormality\u201d]; \u00a7 5304 [90-day civil commitment of one who has attempted or inflicted physical harm \u201cand who, as a result of mental disorder, presents an <em>imminent threat </em>of substantial physical harm to others\u201d]; \u00a7 6300 [MDSO defined as one whose \u201cmental defect, disease, or disorder\u201d predisposes him to sexual offense \u201cto such a degree that he is dangerous to the health and safety of others\u201d]; \u00a7 6316.2 [extended commitment of MDSO whose mentally disordered propensity for sex offenses presents a \u201csubstantial danger of bodily harm to others\u201d]; \u00a7 6500 [commitment of mentally retarded person who is a \u201cdanger to himself or others\u201d]. Italics added; see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subdivision (b)(1) (fn. 14, <em>ante).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The distinctions among those definitions appear more form than substance. To the extent the words do differ materially we have little difficulty in choosing an appropriate standard. As with the criminally insane, the Legislature was concerned here about persons whose seriously dangerous propensities had apparently already surfaced in violent conduct of felonious magnitude and whose mental conditions created a substantial possibility that they might commit further violence if freed from extended supervision, confinement, and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The criminal insanity provisions thus seem to be the most closely analogous, and the Legislature recently has clarified the degree of \u201cdangerousness\u201d that in such cases justifies extended commitment. We conclude that we can best accommodate both the Constitution and the legislative intent by adapting that standard to the LPS Act provisions for criminal incompetence. (Cf. <em>In re Moye, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 467; <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d at pp. 736-737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We therefore hold that every judgment creating or renewing a conservatorship for an incompetent criminal defendant under section 5008, subdivision (h)(2) must reflect written findings that, by reason of a mental disease, defect, or disorder, the person represents a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>danger of physical harm to others. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(1).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We uphold the 1974 amendments as so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The conservator suggests that the requisite finding here is implicit in the initial probable cause determination of violent felonious conduct and that no supplementary finding or evidence is necessary. We disagree. We have indicated that the initial determination of probable cause, coupled with the defendant\u2019s continuing incompetence, permits separate legislative concern and treatment. For several reasons, however, it cannot give rise to a permanent, conclusive presumption of continuing dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">First, the homicide alleged here took place in 1974; and no court ever has found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed it. Nor has there been a determination that either the criminal act or any current dangerousness is the product of a mental disease, defect, or disorder. Even if he had a dangerous mental condition in 1974 the passage of time by itself diminishes the validity of an assumption that his dangerousness continues unabated.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Second, a conclusive presumption of current dangerousness would deny equal protection. The criminally insane\u2014against whom findings of criminal conduct produced by a mental condition have been made\u2014are conclusively presumed dangerous only until completion of trial and the subsequent, automatic, 90-day commitment for observation of their current mental conditions. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1026, subd. (a), 1026.2.) Thereafter, whenever they are no longer dangerous they must be released. (I<em>d., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1026.2, 1026.5; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 145.) No rational basis appears for conclusively presuming an unconvicted, incompetent defendant dangerous for a longer period than one found criminally insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Third, at the time of his 1978 conservatorship hearing appellant already had been confined in a hospital for the three-year treatment period provided by the Penal Code. Psychiatric impressions gained during such a period of observation obviously are relevant and important means of determining whether a person once violent remains so. A con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>elusive presumption of continuing dangerousness would be arbitrary if extended beyond the period reasonably necessary for hospital evaluation of a defendant\u2019s current propensity for violence. Under the existing scheme for incompetent criminal defendants, ample opportunity for evaluation exists during their confinement under the Penal Code. (Cf. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at p. 738 [32 L.Ed.2d at pp. 450-451]; <em>Davis, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at pp. 806-807.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Accordingly, an LPS Act determination that an incompetent criminal defendant is \u201cgravely disabled\u201d because he is currently dangerous as the result of a mental disease, defect, or disorder must follow a hearing addressed to that specific issue. (See <em>Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at pp. 737-738 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 450]; <em>Humphrey, supra, </em>405 U.S. at p. 511 [31 L.Ed.2d at pp. 403-404].) Since appellant apparently had no such hearing he was denied equal protection and due process. The conservatorship order thus must be reversed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Standard of Proof and Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Appellant further contends that his grave disability for LPS Act purposes must be established beyond a reasonable doubt and that he was entitled to a unanimous jury verdict on that issue. We agree that in any subsequent trial under section 5008, subdivision (h)(2) appellant\u2019s dangerous mental condition must be found beyond a reasonable doubt and, if appellant insists, by a unanimous jury. The law does not, though, require an equally stringent showing of incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Involuntary confinement for mental illness or dangerousness, whether civil or criminal, involves loss of liberty and substantial stigma. Fact-finding error must be minimized when such drastic consequences are at stake. Hence, the facts that trigger confinement must generally be proved to a unanimous jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Conservator-ship of Roulet </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 219, 229-230, 232-233 [152 Cal.Rptr. 425, 590 P.2d 1] [traditional \u201cgravely disabled\u201d conservatorship]; <em>Peo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>ple </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 633 [139 Cal.Rptr. 594, 566 P.2d 228]\" [narcotics addict]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 349-358 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373] [MDSO\u2014unanimous jury]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burnick </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 306, 322 [121 Cal.Rptr. 488, 535 P.2d 352] [MDSO\u2014reasonable doubt standard]; but cf. <em>In re Roger S. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 921, 938-939 [141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286] [parental commitment of minor\u2014no judicial hearing or jury trial].) Since a dangerous mental condition is the sole basis on which continued confinement of a permanent incompetent can be justified under the new \u201cgravely disabled\u201d provisions, that fact must be established under strictest standards.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">We do not, however, reach a parallel conclusion on the requirement of continuing incompetence. So long as a defendant is adjudged incompetent by a preponderance of evidence, the criminal trial and disposition of the charged offenses are impossible. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1369, 1370.) It is the preponderant judgment of incompetence that removes defendant from the criminal justice system and creates the need for non-penal protection against his continuing dangerousness. It would be anomalous if indefinitely he could avoid penal treatment by consecutive, preponderant judgments that he was incompetent and then, though dangerous, also avoid LPS Act confinement as a \u201cgravely disabled\u201d person because incompetence could not be established beyond a reasonable doubt. (Cf. <em>In re Franklin, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at pp. 146-147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">A preponderance standard for LPS Act incompetency will not increase the risk of error in determining material issues. It is the fact of a prior incompetence finding and the legal effect of that finding, rather than incompetence itself, that form the bases for civil commitment. No purpose seems served by requiring a more stringent proof of the underlying condition in order to establish an LPS Act conservatorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We hold therefore that incompetence for purposes of section 5008, subdivision (h)(2) may be established by a preponderance of evidence. If initial conservatorship proceedings follow within a reasonable time after defendant has been found incompetent in criminal court, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>servatorship adjudicators may by judicial notice rely on the prior finding. Any renewal of the conservatorship must, of course, be based on updated evidence of the conservatee\u2019s incompetence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Validity of Applying 1974 Amendments to Prior Homicide</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Finally appellant argues that to apply the 1974 amendments to him would violate constitutional limitations on retroactive and ex post facto laws, since the alleged homicide occurred before the amendments became effective. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The ex post facto clauses (U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9) apply only to penal statutes. They prohibit retrospective laws that (1) impose criminal liability for conduct innocent when it occurred, (2) increase the punishment prescribed for a crime at the time it was committed, or (3) by necessary operation and \u2018\u201cin [their] relation to the offense, or [their] consequences, alter the situation of the accused to his disadvantage. . . .\u201d\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 702, 707 [328 P.2d 777], cert. den.

He relies principally on <em>In re Valenzuela </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 483 [79 Cal.Rptr. 760]. There a minor had been committed without jury trial to the Youth Authority for a 1960 sex offense. Under statutes then in effect, that \u201ccriminal\u201d commitment would have expired when the minor turned 21 in 1966. In 1963, however, the Legislature amended the Welfare and Institutions Code to permit potentially unlimited two-year extensions of confinement for Youth Authority inmates deemed presently dangerous because of physical or mental deficiency. (\u00a7\u00a7 1800, 1802.) No jury trial was provided on dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The <em>Valenzuela </em>court rejected contentions that the new confinement provisions were not penal. It stressed that the aim of the new statute was protection of society and not rehabilitation, that defendant was confined at Deuel, a maximum security institution, and that he could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>transferred to state prison if necessary. The 1963 legislation, it said, \u201cviewed as a system,\u201d was therefore penal rather than civil. (P. 487.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The court also rejected arguments that the 1963 legislation was not ex post facto because it focused on current dangerousness rather than antecedent criminal conduct. But for the 1960 criminal commitment and the incarceration it produced, said the court, defendant in 1966 could only have been confined under civil statutes providing greater procedural protections, including jury trial. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see \u00a7 5000 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Appellant here argues that, when the homicide with which he is charged occurred, California statutes\u2014as limited by <em>Jackson </em>and Davis\u2014permitted confinement of criminal incompetents only for treatment or under then-existing civil commitment laws applicable to all other persons. They prescribed indefinite commitment only for helplessness, and sharply limited confinement for dangerousness. (\u00a7\u00a7 5300 et seq., 5350 et seq.) The 1974 amendments, however, subjected him to indefinite confinement for incompetence, regardless of whether he was helpless. As in <em>Valenzuela, </em>he urges, the potential for increased confinement, even if based on present incompetence or dangerousness, arose only because of the pre-amendment homicide. Therefore, he reasons, his \u201cpunishment\u201d for that \u201ccriminal conduct\u201d has been increased ex post facto.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Mr. Valenzuela\u2019s exposure to extended confinement, however, arose directly from his commitment to a penal institution, for a criminal offense. By extending, after the fact, the length of time he could be incarcerated as a result of his criminal commitment the Legislature effectively increased his potential punishment after the crime had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The 1974 LPS Act provisions, by contrast, have nothing to do with any punitive disability attached to the homicide charged against appellant at the time it occurred. They did not alter or affect the sentence for that crime. They did not extend, directly or indirectly, any incarceration that had been or could be imposed on appellant for criminal conduct. Indeed, because of appellant\u2019s potentially permanent incompetence, a criminal sentence or confinement probably will never be imposed. Unlike Mr. Valenzuela\u2019s, appellant\u2019s confinement arose not from criminal conduct but from his mental condition. He does not face incarceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>in a prison but must be placed in a state hospital or some other less restrictive setting. (\u00a7 5358.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">We conclude that the 1974 provisions, \u201cviewed as a system,\u201d are not penal for purposes of the ex post facto clauses and do not impose punishment for crime, in letter or in spirit. Valenzuela\u2019s holding that the increased confinement there was unconstitutional because triggered by pre-amendment criminal conduct must be read in the context of procedures that actually extended a period of commitment for criminal conduct. We do not interpret <em>Valenzuela </em>to mean that all laws which civilly confine dangerous persons for the protection of society are subject to the ex post facto clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Nor did the 1974 provisions \u201cdisadvantage\u201d appellant as an \u201caccused.\u201d That branch of ex post facto doctrine relates to circumstances under which a criminal defendant is forced to defend against a verdict of criminal guilt. <em>(Ward, supra, </em>50 Cal.2d at p. 707.) Here no criminal adjudication is involved, and we find no ex post facto violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Did the 1974 amendments nonetheless operate against appellant with illegal retroactivity? (See <em>In re Marriage of Bouquet </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 583 [128 Cal.Rptr. 427, 546 P.2d 1371].) We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Whether the new statutes have been applied retroactively depends on how they are characterized. If viewed as changing the legal consequences of homicide committed before their effective date they might be deemed retroactive as to appellant. Statutes that focus on a <em>continuing dangerous condition, </em>though, are not retroactive simply because they employ pre-statute conduct as evidence of the ongoing dangerousness. (See <em>DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 177-178 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865], and dis. opn. of Schauer, J. at pp. 181-185; cf. <em>Eichelberger </em>v. <em>City of Berkeley </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 182, 189 [293 P.2d 1]; <em>Record </em>v. <em>Indemnity Ins. Co. </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 434, 444 [229 P.2d 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">We need not decide whether the 1974 amendments are being applied retroactively to petitioner. However characterized, we think the Legislature intended them to apply, once effective, to all criminal incompetents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>who are a continuing public danger, whether the violent felony charges by which such persons are initially identified in the amendments occurred before or after the statutes took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The Legislature enacted the 1974 amendments as emergency measures, explicitly intended to fill the gap left by <em>Davis </em>in California\u2019s commitment scheme. Speedy implementation was declared necessary \u201cfor the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety\u201d and to eliminate uncertainty about proper court procedures. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1511, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 16, pp. 3323-3324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We have held that a legislative attempt to cure an unconstitutional statute may suggest an intent that the curative provision be applied retroactively. (In <em>re Marriage of Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 588; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Teron </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 103, 118, fn. 9 [151 Cal.Rptr. 633, 588 P.2d 773].<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>) Moreover, the 1974 amendments seek to protect against a particular class of <em>potentially </em>dangerous persons. In such cases, legislative expressions of urgency in the interest of public safety necessarily indicate an attempt to reach all persons in the class who represent the continuing danger even if they fall within the legislative purview partly by reason of prior conduct. <em>(DiGenova, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at p. 177.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Appellant\u2019s due process rights are not jeopardized by our interpretation. Protection of individuals against danger is among the most fundamental of state interests. Also, dangerous mentally ill persons gain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>no perpetual \u201cvested right\u201d in the commitment scheme extant when their illnesses first came to public attention. To say that they have \u201creasonably relied\u201d on that scheme in displaying their dangerous conditions is to indulge a patent fiction. Such a rule would severely hamper legislative efforts to respond to new knowledge about mental illness, correct perceived deficiencies in the statutory scheme, and refine the state\u2019s machinery for treatment and restraint of dangerously disturbed people. <em>(See Bouquet, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at pp. 592-593.)

As the majority opinion explains, any continued confinement of appellant must be supported by a finding that he remains dangerous to himself or others. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority\u2019s further holding that the fact of dangerousness must be established <em>beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>Although that strict standard of proof may be appropriate to justify the initial civil commitment of one merely suspected of being gravely disabled by virtue of a mental disorder <em>(Conservatorship of Roulet </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 219, 229-230 [152 Cal.Rptr. 425, 590 P.2d 1]), a lesser standard clearly is appropriate here, based upon a prior probable cause determination that appellant has committed a violent felony, namely, murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The majority candidly acknowledges that grounds exist for \u201csome separate treatment of permanently incompetent criminal defendants formally charged with violent felonies. . . . Allegedly they have engaged in violence so critical that serious criminal charges were believed appropriate.\u201d Judicial officers <em>\u201chave found substantial evidence that the alleged conduct actually was committed as alleged. </em>Those determinations of probable cause establish strong grounds to believe that, by concrete acts, the incompetent defendants already have seriously imperiled public safety and thus are particularly dangerous.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 173, italics added.) Our cases support the majority\u2019s thesis that separate legal treatment or classification is appropriate, for equal protection purposes, with respect to mentally ill persons whose criminal propensities have already been judicially determined. (See <em>In re Moye </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 457, 462 [149 Cal.Rptr. 491, 584 P.2d 1097]; <em>In re Franklin </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 126, 146 [101 Cal.Rptr. 553, 496 P.2d 465].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>The majority properly rejects the argument that a prior probable cause determination of violent, felonious conduct by a mentally incompetent person should give rise to a \u201cpermanent, <em>conclusive </em>presumption of continuing dangerousness.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p. 177, italics added.) A probable cause determination lacks that degree of certainty which would warrant such an extreme solution, allowing, as it would, a commitment of unlimited duration. Yet the majority\u2019s alternative, requiring proof of dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt, is equally extreme and unwarranted, ignoring equally grave considerations of public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Given appellant\u2019s conceded status as a mentally incompetent person who has previously been adjudged to have probably committed murder, his continued confinement should be upheld by a determination, based upon <em>the preponderance of the evidence, </em>that he remains dangerous to himself or others.

Explicit words\u2014not to mention fundamental premises\u2014of a United States Supreme Court decision are ignored, as if they do not exist. Firmly established methods of equal protection analysis are fleetingly alluded to and then forgotten. Plain truths that this court has heretofore openly embraced are now somehow repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The relevant legal history begins in 1966 with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 107 [15 L.Ed.2d 620, 86 S.Ct. 760]. Baxstrom was a prisoner serving a sentence for assault who was certified as insane and transferred to an institution for \u201cdangerously mentally ill\u201d persons. As Baxstrom\u2019s prison sentence was about to expire, the state sought to have him civilly committed to the same institution. By statute, a civil commitment at the end of a prisoner\u2019s term was permitted if the <em>court </em>found that the prisoner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>still insane. However, if the state sought to civilly commit any person other than a prisoner whose term was expiring, that person had the right to a <em>jury </em>determination of the question of his sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The Supreme Court found that the denial to Baxstrom of the right to jury review of the issue of insanity violated equal protection. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument that this disparity in procedure was justified because Baxtrom\u2019s conviction and sentence demonstrated his \u201cdangerous or criminal propensities,\u201d the high court stated that \u201cthere is no conceivable basis for distinguishing the commitment of a person who is nearing the end of a penal term from all other civil commitments.\u201d (383 U.S. at pp. 111-112 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 624].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Six years after <em>Baxstrom, </em>the Supreme Court handed down <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Indiana </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 715 [32 L.Ed.2d 435, 92 S.Ct. 1845], which is the benchmark decision in this area. There, petitioner Jackson stood accused of two robberies but was found incompetent to stand trial on the charges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to Indiana statute, Jackson was ordered confined in an \u201cappropriate psychiatric institution\u201d until he became \u201csane.\u201d Since the evidence adduced at Jackson\u2019s incompetency hearing established there was \u201clittle likelihood of improvement\u201d in his mental condition (see 406 U.S. at p. 723 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 442]), the incompetency commitment amounted to a confinement for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Indiana had two other laws providing for the involuntary commitment of persons on the basis of their mental deficiencies. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>the commitment and release standards under these provisions were \u201csubstantially different\u201d from those used in criminal incompetency proceedings. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 727 [32 L.Ed.2d at pp. 444-445].) For the \u201cfeeble-minded\u201d and the \u201cmentally ill,\u201d commitment was more difficult and release easier than for persons adjudged to be incompetent. <em>{Id., </em>at p. 730 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Jackson </em>that the state\u2019s use of more onerous commitment and release standards against incompetents alone violated equal protection principles. It found that this disparity could not be justified on the basis that alleged incompetents, unlike persons sought to be committed for feeble-mindedness or mental illness generally, were necessarily the subjects of formal criminal charges. \u201cIf [as <em>Baxstrom </em>had held] criminal conviction and imposition of sentence are insufficient to justify less procedural and substantive protection against indefinite commitment than that generally available to all others, the mere filing of criminal charges surely cannot suffice.\u201d (406 U.S. at p. 724 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 443].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The court discussed in detail the specific question of disparities in release standards for institutionalized persons who were mentally ill. It ruled that a state may not, \u201cwithout reasonable justification,.. . apply standards making [an individual\u2019s] commitment a permanent one when standards generally applicable to all others afford him a substantial opportunity for early release.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 729 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 446].) Neither a pending criminal charge nor, indeed, a final criminal conviction would, the court held, supply the \u201creasonable justification\u201d required by the Constitution for unequal release standards. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 729-730 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 446].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The Supreme Court also held that Jackson\u2019s indefinite commitment for incompetency violated due process. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 731 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 447].) \u201cAt the least, due process requires that the nature and duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is committed.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 738 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 451].) Jackson was committed for the purpose of enabling him to regain his competence to stand trial, yet the record established that this purpose was not being, and probably never would be, achieved. (See <em>In re Davis </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 798, 804 [106 Cal.Rptr. 178, 505 P.2d 1018].)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Accordingly, the court adopted a \u201crule of reasonableness.\u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at p. 733 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 448].) It held that \u201ca person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time necessary to determine whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. If it is determined that this is not the case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant. Furthermore, even if it is determined that the defendant probably soon will be able to stand trial, his continued commitment must be justified by progress toward that goal.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 738 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 451], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">At the time <em>Jackson </em>was decided, California, like Indiana, had standards for commitment and release of persons incompetent to stand trial which were \u201csignificantly different\u201d from those prescribed for all other persons sought to be civilly committed. <em>(In re Davis, supra, </em>8 Cal. 3d at p. 805.) California statutes also authorized the indefinite commitment of persons found to be incompetent. Thus, relying on <em>Jackson, </em>this court invalidated those California procedures. <em>(In re Davis, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d 798.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Legislature responded to <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis </em>by revising the incompetency laws of this state. (Stats. 1974, ch. 1511, p. 3316 et seq.) As amended, the laws still permit the lifelong institutionalization of an incurably incompetent person accused (but not convicted) of crime. However, the provisions authorizing such a commitment were moved from the Penal Code to the general civil commitment statutes. (The Lariterman-Petris-Short Act [hereinafter, the L.P.S. Act], Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5000 et seq.) Now, an indefinite commitment for incompetency is permitted only if the incompetent person has been indicted or held to answer for \u201ca felony involving death, great bodily harm, or a serious threat to the physical well-being of another person.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5008, subd. (h)(2).) Moreover, according to the majority, the incompetent accused person must be <em>presently </em>dangerous. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 174-177.) However, while these revisions may have addressed some of the due process problems identified in <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Davis, </em>they did not begin to overcome the equal protection deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">At the heart of this appeal lies appellant\u2019s claim that California law, providing for the indefinite commitment of certain incompetent persons accused of crime, denies him the equal protection of the law. The majority recognize that this contention involves a constitutionally fundamental interest and that \u201cstrict scrutiny is the correct standard of review.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 171, fn. 8.) This means that the state must (1) establish that it has a <em>compelling </em>interest which justifies the law and then (2) demonstrate that the distinctions drawn by the law are <em>necessary </em>to further that purpose. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Olivas </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 236, 251 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375].)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Two equal protection questions are posed by this appeal. The first involves the state\u2019s unequal statutory treatment of incompetent persons as compared to its provisions for other unconvicted persons who are dangerous as a result of mental disorder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5300-5306.) Whereas persons subject to the 90-day postcertification procedures may be committed only for \u201cintensive treatment,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an incompetent individual (appellant herein) may be committed even if no treatment for his condition is available. Moreover, the length of an incompetent\u2019s commitment is far greater than that permitted under the 90-day postcertification procedures. An incompetent person may be institutionalized for life; an imminently dangerous person may be committed for only 90 days and his commitment may not be renewed unless he has threatened, attempted, or engaged in violence during the prior 90 days\u2019 confinement. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5304.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">These vast differences in this state\u2019s handling of incompetent persons and imminently dangerous persons are upheld by the majority by means of a process of sophistical reasoning. The incompetency laws are said to serve a compelling state interest, i.e., protection of the public. Therefore, the majority assert, the disparities are justified on the basis that the Legislature could \u201creasonably\u201d conclude that incompetent persons are presently more dangerous than imminently dangerous persons since the former are \u201cformally charged with\u201d a violent crime and have previously been held to answer for that crime after a judicial determination of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The compelling nature of the state\u2019s interest in protection of the public may be conceded, but the majority\u2019s \u201clogic\u201d is fallacious at virtually every other step. At the outset, the mere \u201creasonableness\u201d of the legislative classification scheme is not the correct constitutional yardstick in this case. (Cf., maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 172.) \u201c[S]trict scrutiny is the correct standard of review\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 171, fn. 8), and under the second prong of the strict scrutiny test, this court is required to determine whether the statutory disparities are <em>necessary </em>to protect the public. (Cf., <em>ante, </em>at p. 189.) Obviously, it is not <em>necessary </em>for the protection of the public that nontreatable incompetents be institutionalized whereas imminently dangerous persons who are not treatable remain free; nor is it <em>necessary </em>that incompetents remain confined for life while imminently dangerous persons are released after 90 days. To avoid this ineluctable conclusion, the majority simply ignore this prong of the strict scrutiny test and apply the minimal scrutiny of the rational basis test.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Even viewing this case from the viewpoint of mere \u201creasonableness,\u201d the majority\u2019s conclusions do not withstand analysis. The reasoning that a judicial determination of probable cause justifies the unequal handling of incompetents is unpersuasive. It is <em>present </em>dangerousness that is relevant to the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the public. As the majority recognize, the validity of the assumption that one who has been charged with a violent felony is <em>currently </em>dangerous diminishes with the passage of time. (Cf., maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 177.) The parties to this appeal have informed us that proceedings to permanently commit an incompetent individual under the L.P.S. Act are normally brought at least three years after the commission of the crime charged. (Cf., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1370.) By this time, the validity of the state\u2019s assumption will have diminished to virtual insignificance. It surely cannot be said to justify the huge discrepancies which California law has created.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The validity of the state\u2019s assertion as to the present dangerousness of incompetents is also undermined by the exceptionally limited nature of the \u201cjudicial determination of criminal conduct\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from which that conclusion is drawn. A judicial determination that an accused should be held to answer for a violent crime is far less reliable as an indicator of his actual commission of that crime than is a conviction, since the state\u2019s burden at a preliminary examination is much easier to meet than at trial. This would be true even if the accused were <em>competent, </em>but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>when he is. <em>incompetent, </em>the judicial determination of probable cause is even less reliable as an indication that he <em>in fact </em>committed a criminal act. \u201cCounsel cannot effectively represent a defendant who is unable to understand the proceedings or to rationally assist him.\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 221, 228 [124 Cal.Rptr. 57, 539 P.2d 817].) Thus, when an accused is incompetent at the preliminary hearing, there is at best an extremely limited opportunity for effective cross-examination or presentation of the defense point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In sum, it is wholly unreasonable to conclude that because incompetent persons were held to answer for a violent crime committed some years in the past, they are currently more dangerous to the public than imminently dangerous persons. This profferred justification for the state\u2019s enormously disparate treatment of the two groups should be rejected. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has already explicitly done so. In <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Baxstrom, </em>it has held that neither the filing of criminal charges <em>nor the obtaining of a final conviction </em>are adequate \u201cto justify less procedural and substantive protection against indefinite commitment than that generally available to all others. . . . \u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at p. 724 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 443].) If a person\u2019s actual conviction is insufficient to justify \u201capplying] standards making his commitment a permanent one when standards generally applicable to all others afford him a substantial opportunity for early release\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 729 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 446]), a fortiori the fact that the person has been held to answer is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">One searches today\u2019s majority opinion in vain for some indication that they recognize the meaning of those words by the Supreme Court. The majority \u201cdo not regard <em>[Jackson] </em>as holding that the fact of criminal incompetency may never be a basis for involuntary confinement prescriptions.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>at p. 171.) But that statement is a truism. It does not, however, support the majority\u2019s conclusion that California procedures comport with equal protection despite the clear language of <em>Jackson. </em>The majority have apparently determined to deal with <em>Jackson </em>and <em>Baxstrom </em>in the same fashion as they dealt with the second prong of the strict scrutiny test. They treat it as if, having conceded its existence, they can then ignore it.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Even if I were to accept the majority\u2019s reasoning that a prior \u201cjudicial determination of criminal conduct\u201d is sufficient to uphold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>incompetency laws of this state against an equal protection challenge based on a comparison with the statutes relating to the 90-day postcertification procedures, it would be impossible to uphold the validity of the incompetency laws. It would then become necessary to compare the Legislature\u2019s treatment of incompetent persons with its treatment of other persons who have suffered a \u201cjudicial determination of criminal conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">The majority have identified three groups of such persons: (1) those found not guilty by reason of insanity (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026 et seq.); (2) those found to be mentally disordered sex offenders (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6300 et seq., hereinafter referred to as MDSO\u2019s); and (3) those committed to the California Youth Authority (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 1800 et seq.). Under current law, all of these persons may under specified circumstances be indefinitely confined in an institution as a result of a mental defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">However, the commitment and release standards for all three of these groups differ significantly from those provided for incompetents. No individual may be committed in the first instance under the procedures mentioned by the majority unless there has been a determination <em>beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that he or she is guilty of a crime. In addition, since the purpose of commitment under these three provisions is the <em>treatment </em>of the offender\u2019s mental condition,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the confinements thus authorized must be terminated if treatment is unfeasible or unavailable. (See <em>Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at pp. 731-738 [32 L.Ed.2d at pp. 447-451]; see also, <em>Gary W., supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Neither of these substantial protections is accorded to a person subjected to incompetency proceedings in this state. As already noted, incurably incompetent persons may be committed without any proof beyond a reasonable doubt that they committed a felonious act, and they will remain confined even when it is determined that the state cannot treat their mental disorder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>This discrimination against incompetents is clearly not \u201cnecessary\u201d to safeguard the public since the greater protections are afforded to equally dangerous persons such as MDSO\u2019s. The disparity is not even rational. And once again the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decisions speak directly to this sort of unequal protection of the laws. Here, just as in <em>Jackson, </em>the incompetent individual has been \u201csubjected] to a more lenient commitment standard and to a more stringent standard of release than those generally applicable\u201d to all others whom the majority deem to be similarly situated. (See <em>Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. at p. 730 [32 L.Ed.2d at p. 446].) \u201c[B]y thus condemning him in effect to permanent institutionalization without the showing required for commitment or the opportunity for release afforded by [the statutes dealing with other persons who have suffered a prior judicial determination of criminal conduct], [California] deprived [appellant] of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In addition to the equal protection problems discussed above, this case also presents another important but difficult question concerning a government\u2019s power to incarcerate its citizens. May an individual be institutionalized\u2014against his will and for the remainder of his life\u2014on the basis of his <em>status </em>of having a \u201cdangerous\u201d mental condition where (1) it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any violent act amounting to a crime and (2) the state cannot treat his mental condition?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">This question raises serious issues under our constitutional requirements of due process of law<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and our prohibitions against cruel and/or unusual punishments.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To the extent these issues are considered at all, the majority appear to uphold such involuntary lifetime commitments solely on the basis of the state\u2019s \u201ccompelling interest[] in public safety.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 171.) But the reasons underlying their conclusion are difficult to discern. No potentially counterbalancing considerations are even discussed. The state\u2019s interest in public safety would seem to be equally strong with respect to \u201cimminently dangerous\u201d persons, yet it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>is not suggested\u2014and I doubt every member of today\u2019s majority would accept\u2014that a person who has committed no crime may be \u201chospitalized\u201d for life on the basis that some authority thinks he has an incurable mental defect which will result in future harm to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Perhaps an understanding of the majority\u2019s conclusions can be gleaned from its discussion of the ex post facto question raised by appellant. There, the majority reveal that they regard appellant\u2019s confinement as \u201cnot penal\u201d in nature and as imposing no \u201cpunishment.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">These designations of appellant\u2019s confinement are incredible. Incurably incompetent persons such as appellant are generally kept in institutions like Patton or Atascadero State Hospitals. This court has repeatedly recognized that these institutions do not differ appreciably from prisons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Within those same walls are persons convicted of and serving sentences for crime. Moreover, appellant\u2019s commitment to these institutions is for the rest of his life. He is confined against his will. He is confined only because there has been a \u201cjudicial determination of criminal conduct.\u201d He receives no treatment. The sole justification for his confinement is the protection of society, which this court has explicitly declared is a \u201cwell-known purpose of <em>punishment.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Feagley </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 338, 376 [121 Cal.Rptr. 509, 535 P.2d 373], italics added.) Under these circumstances, to conclude, as the majority do, that appellant\u2019s extended confinement is not punishment is to exalt form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Since in my view the judgment against appellant was obtained in violation of the constitutional provisions regarding equal protection, due process, and cruel and/or unusual punishment, I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied October 15, 1980. Bird, C. J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The court also held that Baxstrom had been denied the equal protection of the law in another respect, i.e., \u201cby his civil commitment to an institution maintained by the Department of Correction beyond the expiration of his prison term without a judicial determination that he is <em>dangerously </em>mentally ill such as that afforded to all so committed except those, like Baxstrom, nearing the expiration of a penal sentence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 110 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 623], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u201cThe capriciousness of the classification employed by the State is thrown sharply into focus by the fact that the full benefit of a judicial hearing to determine dangerous tendencies is withheld only in the case of civil commitment of one awaiting expiration of penal sentence. A person with a past criminal record is presently entitled to a hearing on the question whether he is dangerously mentally ill so long as he is not in prison at the time civil commitment proceedings are instituted. Given this distinction, all semblance of rationality of the classification, purportedly based upon criminal propensities, disappears.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 115 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 626].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Under then-existing state law, an accused person was incompetent to stand trial if he \u201chas not comprehension sufficient to understand the proceedings and make his defense....\u201d (Former Ind.
