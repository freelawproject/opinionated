Code, \u00a7 602)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>committing her to the California Youth Authority (CYA), and from a subsequent order denying her petition to modify that commitment order (\u00a7 778).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The wardship was predicated on findings that she committed acts of attempted robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. On this appeal she does not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support those findings; nor does she complain of the conduct of the adjudication (jurisdictional) hearing. Accordingly, for present purposes it is enough to note that she was engaged in shoplifting in a clothing store when the owner became suspicious and investigated. She then attempted unsuccessfully to rob him with an empty handgun and, in the ensuing struggle, struck him on the head with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">On March 29, 1978, a disposition hearing was held before a juvenile court referee. He noted that he had read and considered the probation officer\u2019s report recommending commitment to the CYA. He declined, however, to adopt that disposition. After weighing the seriousness of the offenses against a number of mitigating circumstances<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he found that CYA commitment would be inappropriate and unwarranted. He ordered that the minor instead be taken from her parents and put in the custody of the probation department for \u201csuitable placement\u201d; i.e., in a county-operated juvenile facility rather than the CYA. There remained, however, some question as to whether a suitable placement could be found since the minor was believed at the time to be pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On April 11, 1978, Judge Smith, the presiding judge of the juvenile department of the superior court, acting assertedly on his own motion, ordered a rehearing on the referee\u2019s disposition. The matter was assigned to another superior court judge; a second disposition hearing was held; and the court considered evidence and arguments substantially similar to those previously presented to the referee. It was stipulated, however, that the minor was not pregnant; and there was undisputed testimony that Camp Holton, a juvenile facility operated by the county probation department, was likely to accept her. Nonetheless the court found that a local placement would not be adequate and therefore committed her to the CYA.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>She does not contend that the evidence at the second hearing was insufficient. Nor does she claim that Judge Smith lacked authority to order the rehearing. Rather she complains that the process via which rehearing was ordered violated her statutory and constitutional rights. The contentions focus on the fact that the judge\u2019s order came after the district attorney\u2019s office sent a letter urging that there be a rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The first contention is that the letter was improper because statutes prohibit the People from seeking rehearing. The argument proceeds as follows: The Welfare and Institutions Code permits rehearing of a referee\u2019s disposition only on (1) application by the minor or the parent or guardian (\u00a7 252), or (2) a juvenile judge\u2019s \u201cown motion\u201d (\u00a7 253).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter here was an application for rehearing by the People; yet the right to apply is not granted the People by statute and so does not exist. (Cf., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1238; <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 754 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622].) The order to rehear was not on the court\u2019s own motion because it was prompted by the letter. Hence, rehearing was granted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Section 252 does confer a right to \u201capply ... for a rehearing\u201d only on the minor or one acting on behalf of the minor. We see nothing in section 253, though, that prohibits the court from receiving outside communications before deciding to order rehearing on its own motion. (Cf., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1204; <em>In re Calhoun </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 75, 83-84 [130 Cal.Rptr. 139, 549 P.2d 1235].)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Regular procedures by which referees\u2019 decisions are screened for \u201cown motion\u201d rehearings are desirable. However, the law neither compels those procedures nor makes them exclusive means of deciding to rehear in the absence of a minor\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Indeed the 1961 revision of the law, seeking to reduce workload, eliminated the requirement that all referees\u2019 decisions be submitted to a judge for approval. Provisions for discretionary rehearing on the minor\u2019s or the court\u2019s motion, similar to those now in effect, were substituted; and no limitation was placed on considerations that might lead the judge to order rehearing. <em>(In re Bradley </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 253, 261 [65 Cal.Rptr. 570]; see Stats. 1937, ch. 369, \u00a7 576, p. 1022; Stats. 1961, ch. 1616, \u00a7 2, pp. 3466-3467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The workloads of the juvenile courts lead us to doubt that the Legislature intended to confine \u201cown motion\u201d rehearings to cases the judge has investigated on his own initiative. The impetus to action sometimes will come from others\u2014the referee or other interested observers such as the district attorney. The words and aims of section 253 do not support an inference that letters to the judge from a prosecutor or anyone else are proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">It is incorrect here to assume that the district attorney invoked a right to \u201capply ... for a rehearing.\u201d We agree that the People have no such right, but there is no indication that the trial court thought otherwise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">When on a minor\u2019s behalf rehearing is sought the application must be considered. It cannot be denied without review of the transcript and if not acted on within the specified time is deemed granted. (\u00a7 252; see <em>In re Edgar M. </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 727, 737 [122 Cal.Rptr. 574, 537 P.2d 406].) But a mere communication from the district attorney or other interested person has no official status, and the court is free to reject it informally. That the letter here may have influenced the judge does not make it a nonstatutory \u201capplication for rehearing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>We therefore conclude that the order for rehearing was not improper on the ground that it was preceded and may have been prompted by a letter from the district attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">It is next argued that the minor was denied due process because the judge ordered rehearing without giving her notice and an opportunity to respond to the letter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In <em>Donald L., supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 592, a referee found the minor fit for treatment as a juvenile. It was contended that an \u201cown motion\u201d rehearing of the referee\u2019s finding actually had been granted at the informal, ex parte request of the district attorney. That impropriety, it was urged, invalidated the judge\u2019s subsequent determination of unfitness. This court did not decide the issue because the factual basis for the minor\u2019s claim seemed unclear. The presiding judge of the juvenile court was criticized, however, for his \u201cstated policy\u201d of acting on informal requests for rehearing, \u201cwithout giving the parties an opportunity to be heard....\u201d Indeed, said <em>Donald L., </em>\u201c[s]uch action ... may well be of doubtful constitutionality\u201d because significant steps in the juvenile court process cannot be taken without affording the minor notice and opportunity for hearing. (P. 599, citing <em>In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1, 30 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 547-548, 87 S.Ct. 1428], and <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 541, 562 [16 L.Ed.2d 84, 97-98, 86 S.Ct. 1045].)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>We now endorse the rule that <em>Donald L. </em>suggests. A decision to order a rehearing not sought by the minor is a step affecting his substantial interests. It voids a favorable referee\u2019s decision already won, which would otherwise become final and binding. It subjects the minor to de novo reconsideration of the disposition and creates the risk of a harsher decision affecting his liberty. It is true that the law prescribes no limitations on the judge\u2019s discretion to order rehearing <em>sua sponte. </em>Nonetheless, due process means that decisions to deprive individuals of substantial interests should not be made arbitrarily or by unfair procedures. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 267-268 [158 Cal.Rptr. 316, 599 P.2d 622]; see Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Communications from the People made without formal opportunity for response by the minor raise the danger that inaccuracies may affect the decision to rehear.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The right to respond enables the minor to point up flaws in the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, emphasize favorable portions of the record, and suggest why discretion should be exercised in favor of leaving the referee\u2019s decision untouched. <em>(Ramirez, </em>supra, at pp. 273-274; cf., <em>In re Calhoun, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 75, 84; <em>In re Minnis </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 639, 650 [102 Cal.Rptr. 749, 498 P.2d 997].) Recognition of the right promotes an appearance of fairness and supports the \u201cimportant dignitary values that underly due process.... \u201d <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>at p. 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The state, on the other hand, has no legitimate interest in denying the minor a fair opportunity to respond to a request that the court order re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>hearing on its own motion. The state\u2019s concern is to find the disposition best suited to the minor\u2019s rehabilitation and welfare, insofar as consistent with public safety (\u00a7 202). One-sided attacks on the referee\u2019s conclusions increase the likelihood that accurate decisionmaking will not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We do not prescribe a full or formal hearing. The judge\u2019s decision whether to rehear is largely focused on a record already developed. It does not depend on resolution of facts but inherently is subjective. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>at pp. 273-276.) It does not decide the minor\u2019s fate (unless rehearing is denied) but is preliminary to reconsideration of that issue. Formality at this stage could add substantial burdens to the rehearing process but would not decrease appreciably the risk of an erroneous disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We think the minor\u2019s and the state\u2019s interests are best resolved, pending possible legislative study, by procedures parallel to those prescribed in <em>Ramirez </em>for persons facing exclusion from the state\u2019s narcotics-treatment program. When a juvenile judge has received an informal request for rehearing of a referee\u2019s decision not challenged by the minor, he may not on his own motion order rehearing until the minor has been notified of the request, supplied with a copy (including exhibits and other attachments), given access to all materials it brings to the court\u2019s attention other than those already in the record, advised he may reply in writing, and accorded a reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">We next consider what effect the denial of prerehearing rights in this case should have on its outcome. The People claim harmless error, relying on <em>Donald L., supra. </em>There, with no supporting citation or discussion, the court stated that, even if rehearing had been ordered on the basis of an improper, ex parte request from the district attorney, \u201cwe can find no prejudice to the minor since the issue of fitness was fully and fairly reheard de novo by a judge other than the one who ordered the rehearing.\u201d (7 Cal.3d at p. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Whether or not the referee\u2019s ruling was fully and fairly reheard de novo by another judge, however, two facts seem inescapable: (1) in all cases in which the minor has complained of the matter on review the result of the second hearing was less favorable to him than the first; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>(2) in each case that second hearing would not even have been held had the juvenile judge not ordered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Might a response from the minor have affected the decision to rehear this matter? The referee\u2019s discretionary disposition, carefully explained on the record, appears well within reason. But in important respects the letter from the office of the district attorney misstated both the evidence and the referee\u2019s views. (See fn. 7, <em>ante.) </em>\"Neither the transcript nor rebuttal from the minor was available to contradict the letter\u2019s suggestion that a violent and sophisticated criminal in effect had been turned loose on the community. <em>Sua sponte </em>the judge ordered rehearing within a week after the letter was sent. Though he gave no reasons, it seems fair to infer that the letter\u2014inaccurate and unchallenged\u2014had an intended effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Prejudice thus appears; and the appropriate remedy now is to hold the rehearing order void, invalidate the disposition that resulted from the rehearing, and reinstate the referee\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Moreover, we read the safeguards prescribed in this opinion into section 253 to save it from constitutional infirmity. <em>(In re Calhoun, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 84-85; <em>In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 727, 736-737.) Since the rehearing order did not comply with section 253, so interpreted, it is of no effect. Accordingly, because no valid, timely order for rehearing was made the referee\u2019s decision became final for all purposes 20 days after its issuance, as the statutes provide. (\u00a7\u00a7 252, 253; see <em>Calhoun, supra, </em>at p. 85.) Insofar as language in <em>Donald L., supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 592, seems inconsistent it is disapproved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In the companion appeal the minor seeks review of a subsequent order of the juvenile court denying her petition to modify its CYA commitment order because of an asserted change of circumstances. (\u00a7 778.) Because her sole complaint is that the court did not accord a hearing before denying that petition, the second appeal will be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">The order sustaining the petition and declaring the minor a ward of the court is affirmed. The order committing the minor to the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Youth Authority is reversed. The appeal from the order denying the minor\u2019s petition to modify the order of commitment is dismissed as moot. The cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Tobriner, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-12\">All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The referee stressed that the incident was not so much a planned, armed robbery as an aborted shoplifting in which the minor was caught and reacted to the situation. There was no documented history of violence; this was the first time she had been declared a ward; and she had never before been placed on- supervision or probation at the local level.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Section 252 provides: \u201cAt any time prior to the expiration of 10 days after service of a written copy of the order and findings of a referee, a minor or his parent or guardian may apply to the juvenile court for a rehearing. Such application may be directed to all or to any specified part of the order or findings, and shall contain a statement of the reasons such rehearing is requested. If all of the proceedings before the referee have been taken down by an official reporter, the judge of the juvenile court may, after reading the transcript of such proceedings, grant or deny such application. If proceedings before the referee have not been taken down by an official reporter, such application shall be granted as of right. If an application for rehearing is not granted, denied or extended within 20 days following the date of its receipt, it shall be deemed granted. However, the court, for good cause, may extend such period beyond 20 days, but not in any event beyond 45 days, following the date of receipt of the application, at which time the application for rehearing shall be deemed granted unless it is denied within such period. All decisions to grant or deny the application, or to extend the period, shall be expressly made in a written minute order with copies provided to the minor or his parent or guardian, and to the attorneys of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Section 253 provides: \u201cA judge of the juvenile court may, on his own motion made within 20 judicial days of the hearing before a referee, order a rehearing of any matter heard before a referee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Before the referee the deputy districy attorney declared, \u201cThe People... will be asking for a rehearing in this matter.\u201d The subsequent letter requested \u201cthat the court exercise its discretion pursuant to...Section 253 and grant a rehearing....\u201d Nothing implies that the prosecutor or the court thought the People had rights similar to those accorded the minor in section 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The statutes\u2019 failure to give the People a right to apply for rehearing does not violate the requirement that referees perform only \u201csubordinate judicial duties.\u201d (Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Const., art. VI, \u00a7 22.) A referee\u2019s decision is advisory only and on timely application must be reconsidered by a judge. <em>(In re Edgar M., supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 727, 735-736.) However, the Legislature has expressed a policy that the People not make such an application but instead accept the referee\u2019s decision unless a judge <em>sua sponte </em>orders rehearing. <em>Jesse W. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 893 [145 Cal.Rptr. 1, 576 P.2d 963] <em>(Jesse W. I), </em>which held that a referee\u2019s decision to acquit contravenes the subordinate-duties clause because double-jeopardy principles prevent its being reheard, is distinguishable. (P. 899, fn. 5; see also <em>Jesse W. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 26 Cal.3d 41, 47, fn. 5 [160 Cal.Rptr. 700, 603 P.2d 1296] <em>(Jesse W.

(See rule 7-108(B), Rules Prof. Conduct of State Bar; cf. <em>In re Calhoun, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 75, 79; <em>In re Jonathan S.(1979) </em>88 Cal.App.3d 468, 471 [151 Cal.Rptr. 810].) Rehearing was ordered on April 11, and there is no contention that the minor had a realistic opportunity to respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The district attorney letter, written in a tone of advocacy by a deputy other than the one who represented the People at the disposition hearing, contained several inaccuracies. It portrayed the minor as a sophisticated armed robber with a prior murder arrest \u201cnoted\u201d by the referee. It suggested that the referee rejected CYA placement only because he thought it legally precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The referee had emphasized that the minor did not intend an armed robbery but simply reacted when her shoplifting was discovered. The \u201cmurder\u201d incident appears only in the probation officer\u2019s report where the \u201cminor state [d]\u201d that, while in custody on a marijuana charge, she was accused of murder by the prime suspect in the killing. She was never prosecuted on either count. The referee gave no credence to the incident and stressed the absence of violence in the minor\u2019s past. He made clear that he rejected CYA not only on legal grounds but on the facts, including the minor\u2019s lack of sophistication and her nonviolent history.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The letter also erred in stating that the minor was pregnant (suggesting difficulty in non-CYA placement), that the referee had ordered placement in an open facility (noting the seriousness of the offense, he emphatically had directed closed placement), and that !,e knew no community agency would take her (juvenile officials had conceded that placements might be available if the minor were not pregnant or were deemed nonviolent).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b624-9\">In view of this disposition, we do not reach the minor\u2019s additional, belated argument that rehearing of a referee\u2019s disposition not challenged by the minor violates the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b625-6\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzM\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The majority do violence to an unambiguous legislative plan for the orderly disposition of juvenile matters, they condone a bizarre procedure that includes approval of an improper ex parte communication to a judge where none is permitted by law, and then having wreaked havoc on existing statutes, they invent yet another elaborate procedural mechanism to avoid constitutional infirmity. This is indeed error compounded, and for no purpose remotely associated with either justice or judicial efficiency. It manifestly is not error \u201cattributed to one of those failings which lean to virtue\u2019s side.\u201d <em>(The Washington University </em>v. <em>Rouse </em>(1869) 75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 439, 443 [19 L.Ed. 498, 500] (dis. opn. of Miller, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The Legislature has prescribed the procedure for requesting rehearing of a ruling by a juvenile court referee in Welfare and Institutions Code section 252. That section declares in relevant part that \u201cAt any time prior to the expiration of 10 days after service of a written copy of the order and findings of a referee, <em>a minor or his parent or guardian </em>may apply to the juvenile court for a rehearing.\u201d (Italics added.) No language could be plainer. Moreover, neither this section nor any other provision of law in this state authorizes the <em>prosecution </em>to seek such a rehearing. The meaning of such silence is equally plain: under the rule of construction <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>(see, e.g., <em>Southern Cal. Gas. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 653, 659 [156 Cal.Rptr. 733, 596 P.2d 1149]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 150, 161 [89 Cal.Rptr. 721, 474 P.2d 673]), a conclusion is inescapable that the omission is deliberate and the Legislature did not intend that the prosecution possess such a right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Despite this clear indication of legislative intent, the People in effect applied for a rehearing in the case at bar. The majority err in denying that \u201cthe district attorney invoked a right to \u2018apply ... for a rehearing.\u2019\u201d <em>{Ante, </em>p. 592.) That is exactly what the prosecution announced it would do at the conclusion of the first disposition hearing, when the following colloquy took place between the referee and the deputy district attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\">\u201cMr. Lowen: The People think the court has made a mistake, and in fact, we will be asking for a rehearing in the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-5\">\u201cThe Court: A rehearing as to the disposition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cMr. Lowen: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThe Court: That is your prerogative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">As I have just shown, however, the People did <em>not </em>have the \u201cprerogative\u201d of \u201casking for a rehearing\u201d in this matter. Yet that is precisely what happened. On April 5, 1978\u2014i.e., within the 10-day period prescribed by section 252 during which the minor or his parent or guardian may seek a rehearing\u2014the District Attorney of Los Angeles, acting through his head deputy, juvenile division, wrote a letter on official stationery to Judge Smith of the Los Angeles Superior Court, asserting that \u201cThe District Attorney appearing as counsel for the People in the above case requests that the Court exercise its discretion pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 253 and grant a rehearing on a disposition heard March 29, 1978 in Dept. 205 before Referee Howard Price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In the balance of the letter the district attorney presented his case for a rehearing. The majority concede, as they must, that the letter was written \u201cin a tone of advocacy\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 594, fn. 7) and \u201cmisstated both the evidence and the referee\u2019s views\u201d in important respects. <em>{Ante, </em>p. 596.) First, the letter purported to summarize both the evidence introduced at the adjudication hearing and the grounds upon which the referee acted at the disposition hearing, even though the writer of the letter had not been present at either proceeding. As to adjudication, the letter portrayed the minor as a traditional armed robber and omitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>mention the evidence relied on by the referee tending to show that the minor\u2019s primary intent had been simply to shoplift. As to disposition, the letter itemized in detail the probation officer\u2019s reasons for recommending commitment to the California Youth Authority (CYA); but gave only two reasons for the referee\u2019s order of suitable placement, viz., (1) because it was the first time the minor had been declared a ward, and (2) because the referee assertedly \u201cfelt\u201d that case law prohibited a CYA commitment when a minor had not previously been supervised at the local level. This recital was both incomplete and misleading: it omitted to state the several additional grounds on which the referee based his disposition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it exaggerated the significance of certain remarks by the referee on the relevant case law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">On another factual assertion\u2014particularly damaging to the minor\u2014the letter was flatly wrong: it claimed the referee \u201cnoted\u201d that the minor had previously been arrested, inter alia, for the crime of murder. A reading of the transcript demonstrates that no such statement was ever made at the disposition hearing, by the referee or anyone else. And a glance at the probation officer\u2019s report is enough to show that in making such a claim the district attorney once again grossly exaggerated the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The letter-writer then proceeded to argue the case, again as an advocate, stating that \u201cThe District Attorney contends that the Referee\u2019s ruling placing the minor in suitable placement is unwarranted by the facts and existing case law.\u201d The ensuing argument was predicated in part, however, on the erroneous belief that the minor was pregnant. It also asserted that \u201csuitable placement\u201d meant an \u201copen\u201d facility that would \u201cpermit the minor to roam freely in the community\u201d; again the record is to the contrary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the letter described the minor as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cvery mature and sophisticated,\u201d although the referee\u2014who observed the minor at the hearing while the letter-writer did not\u2014characterized her offense as \u201cvery stupid\u201d and repeatedly found her to be \u201cunsophisticated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Section 252 prescribes that a petition for rehearing shall contain \u201ca statement of the reasons such rehearing is requested.\u201d It is undeniable that the letter of the district attorney in this case contained just such a statement, and was sent pursuant to his declared intent of \u201casking for a rehearing.\u201d In short, although the letter purported to request the judge to exercise his discretion under section 253, in everything but name it amounted to an application for rehearing under section 252. It is wilfully naive for the majority to pretend otherwise. Indeed, the majority even concede that the scheme was successful: \u201cThough [Judge Smith] gave no reasons, it seems fair to infer that the letter\u2014inaccurate and unchallenged\u2014had an intended effect.\u201d <em>{Ante, </em>p. 596.) Such a conclusion is inevitable, for the judge acted prior to receiving a transcript of the proceedings before the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The majority admit <em>{ante, </em>p. 591) that section 252 confers the right to apply for a rehearing \u201conly on the minor\u201d or his parent or guardian, and they \u201cagree that the People have no such right\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 592). What then is their authority? They turn to section 253,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and build their entire holding on the slender reed that \u201cWe see nothing in section 253 ... that prohibits the court from receiving outside communications\u201d before ordering a rehearing on its own motion. <em>{Ante, </em>p. 591.) But even if such an \u201coutside communication\u201d were proper when made by a truly disinterested person\u2014a point I discuss next\u2014none is now before us. Here we are faced rather with an \u201cinside\u201d communication by the chief protagonist in the case, the district attorney; and as shown above, the document is nothing less than a de facto petition for rehearing. To hold such a communication impliedly permissible under section 253 is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>frustrate the legislative will so plainly expressed in section 252, i.e., that the minor but not the People have the right to petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">For different but equally compelling reasons the result should be the same even if the \u201coutside communication\u201d had come from someone other than the district attorney. The majority\u2019s condonation of unsolicited letters to a judge from \u201cother interested observers\u201d or \u201canyone else\u201d <em>{ante, </em>p. 592) adds an unprecedented and dangerous dimension to the judicial process. If such communications to a judge concerning a pending matter come from an attorney, they violate rule 7-108(B), Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And whether or not the \u201canyone else\u201d is an attorney, the judge is prohibited from considering his \u201cex parte or other communications concerning a pending or impending proceeding\u201d under canon 3A(4), California Code of Judicial Conduct. I can only conclude the majority have rewritten the rules that traditionally have governed our adversary judicial system. Henceforth judges may be persuaded to a conclusion not only in open court or by appropriate written briefs served on all parties, but also by unsolicited letters from casual observers or \u201canyone else.\u201d The potential for evil in this singular method of procedure should be disturbing to all members of the bench and bar devoted to the orderly resolution of disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Because the order granting a rehearing was invalid as a matter of statutory law, I find superfluous\u2014and do not join in\u2014the majority\u2019s discussion of its claimed constitutional defects. I note in passing, however, that the elaborate panoply of due process rights decreed by the majority on this point further supports the view I express in Part I of this opinion. The majority hold that when a judge receives \u201can informal request for rehearing\u201d he may not grant it \u201con his own motion\u201d until the minor has been (1) notified of the request, (2) supplied with a copy thereof and all attachments thereto, (3) given access to all materials dehors the record that it calls to the judge\u2019s attention, (4) advised that he may reply in writing, and (5) accorded a reasonable opportunity to do so. <em>{Ante, </em>p. 595.) Surely any communication that releases such a torrent of procedural formalities should be recognized for what it is: the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>functional equivalent of a formal application for rehearing by the People, an application for which no authority exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Bird, C. J., and Manuel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-10\">An analogy may be drawn to Penal Code section 1238, which lists eight categories of judgments or orders from which the People are entitled to appeal in adult criminal cases. It is settled that the list is exclusive and the prosecution has no right to appeal from any judgment or order not specified in the statute. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 754 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Court </em>(Howard) (1968) 69 Cal.2d 491, 497-498 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenti </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 199, 204-205 [316 P.2d 633], and cases cited.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The referee stressed that the incident was merely an aborted shoplifting in which the minor was caught and reacted, that she had no history of violence, that this was the first time she had been declared a ward, that she had never been placed on probation before.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Although the referee at first expressed some concern about his authority to order a CYA commitment of a first offender, he concluded rather that any magistrate had the power to do so upon making the appropriate record and that less drastic alternatives were not mandatory but merely preferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">The minor had never been arrested for murder.

She needs to be removed from the community and to be supervised in a closed setting at something less than Youth Authority.\u201d The referee then sought to implement this directive by imposing, as a condition of placement, a specific prohibition against the minor\u2019s leaving such facility without permission. Also contrary to the district attorney\u2019s assertion is the fact that at the second disposition hearing an intake officer at the proposed \u201csuitable placement\u201d operated by the county probation department (Camp Holton) testified that the facility was not an \u201copen\u201d but a \u201cclosed\u201d setting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Section 253 provides: \u201cA judge of the juvenile court may, <em>on his own motion </em>made within 20 judicial days of the hearing before a referee, order a rehearing of any matter heard before a referee.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\u201cA member of the State Bar shall not directly or indirectly in the absence of opposing counsel, communicate with or argue to a judge or judicial officer, upon the merits of a contested matter pending before such judge or judicial officer, except in open court;...\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
