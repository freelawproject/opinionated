G. Payne and that he be confined in the workhouse of Hamilton county, Tennessee, for a tejrm of eleven months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and twenty-nine days and that he pay the costs of this execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">\u201cEstile Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">\u201c0.

He thereupon instituted a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding, which came on to he heard before the regular criminal judge, who had presided at the trial in December, 1923, on October 26, 1925, and the minute entry of that date contains the following recitals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">\u201c. . . on inspection of the original record it appeared that on the 21st day of December, 1923, H. 0. Payne was tried in the criminal court of Hamilton county, Tennessee, on an indictment theretofore found against him for failure to provide for his minor children and there is spread on the minutes of the court what purports to be a verdict of the jury finding the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment but an inspection of the record shows that this alleged finding has never been verified by the signature of the trial judge the minutes of the court proceedings for the day being unsigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-9\">\u201cIt further appeared from an inspection of the trial docket of the judge that this entry is made thereon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-10\">\u201cThe .State )</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-11\">No. 46534 v. ) Failure to provide.

In consideration of the premises the court held that the defendant was illegally restrained of his liberty by being held under said workhouse <em>capias </em>in the Hamilton county jail and thereupon the petition for <em>habeas corpus </em>was sustained and the right of the defendant to be set at liberty under said proceedings was recognized by the court, but the court held that in view of the record as above set forth that the court had the authority to amend the record at this time and to enter its judgment on said verdict <em>mmc pro hmc </em>and without giving the defendant any previous notice the defendant being present in open court the court ordered that the defendant H. Gr. Payne for his offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>be confined in the workhouse of Hamilton county, Tennessee for the term of eleven months and twenty-nine days and that he pay the cost of-this prosecution for which execution may issue. And thereupon the court ordered a workhouse <em>capias </em>to issue and the defendant was taken into custody by the sheriff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">For a number of reasons the judgment of the trial court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">In the first place, the \u2022 inference seems to be that the trial court did not sign the minutes, because he disapproved of the verdict, and that his failure to sign was purposeful and not an omission. Hence, any judgment based thereon would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In the second place, if the minute entry of December 21,1921, was improperly entered, and the trial judge did not sign the minutes, then such entry does not constitute a part of the record, and the defendant has been sentenced without a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In the third place, the judgment is illegal because contrary to the statute under which the defendant was indicted, section 6888a22 of Shannon\u2019s Code, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201cUpon indictment and trial or upon arraignment if the defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty upon competent testimony, it shall be the duty of the judge of the criminal court to determine and fix the amount to be paid by the defendant as hereinbefore provided and to require the defendant to give security as provided in section 6888a22 or release said defendant on his own recognizance as therein provided, and if the undertaking as provided in said section be given the defendant must be released, but if not the court must sentence such de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>fendant to the county workhouse for a period not exceeding eleven months and twenty-nine days and to pay the costs of the cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-3\">In the fourth place, it makes no difference whether this he treated as a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order or as a deferred judgment on the verdict of the jury, the court was without power to enter same for the reason that he had no evidence upon which to base it. The <em>quantum </em>of payment and of punishment was discretionary with the trial court, based upon the facts appearing at the hearing. It would be all but impossible for a busy judge, trying hundreds of cases, to remember the testimony in an ordinary case after a lapse of nearly two years. Then, too, the condition and situation of the defendant may have changed in the meantime, and the punishment now imposed, although proper two years previous, might be grossly excessive. If he were tried now before a jury they might return a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In the ordinary criminal case, where the jury fixes the punishment, and, by oversight, no judgment is pronounced, the court, at a subsequent term, can pronounce judgment and have it recorded. Also where a judgment was pronounced, but the clerk failed to enter it on the minutes, a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order can be entered at a subsequent term.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">And under section 4597 of Shannon\u2019s Code any mistake or omission in a judgment can be corrected within a year if there is sufficient matter \u201capparent on the record, the papers in the cause, or entries of a presiding judge to amend by.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In Rush v. Rush, <em>97 </em>Tenn., 281, after stating that in order that the minutes speak the truth and disclose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>actual proceedings. of the court a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order might be made at a subsequent term, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">\u201cAnd the lapse of time between the announcement of judgment and the making of this motion is of no importance; that which is important is, that the proof he clear and convincing that the judgment which it is sought to have entered is the one pronounced in the cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The necessity for this rule is illustrated in the instant case, assuming that judgment was pronounced hut not entered. The recollection of the trial judge was that the punishment imposed was eleven months and twenty-: nine days imprisonment; while the recollection of the attorney general was that he pay $25 per month, in default of which he be imprisoned for eleven months and twenty-nine days.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The statute here involved is an exceptional one, and has for its object the support of dependents where the responsible party is physically and financially able; and the punishment prescribed is only a means to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">At this time the defendant, as previously stated, may not be able to support his children, and if not the policy of the statute would forbid his incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">It results that the case will be reversed; and since there is no legal judgment ordering the defendant imprisoned he will be discharged in accordance with the prayer of his petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
