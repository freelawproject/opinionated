The auditor based his refusal to sign and attest such bonds and coupons on the facts: (1), that the resolution and order of the Board of Trustees of said school district, calling an election to submit to the electors of the school district the question whether such bonds should be issued, failed to provide or specify the kind of money or currency in which said bonds should be paid, and that the hoard of supervisors of said county, in its resolution and order ordering the bonds issued, provided that they should be paid in United States gold coin; and (2), that the said order of the board of trustees of the school district and the notice of said election failed to provide when the interest on said bonds should be paid, whether annually, semi-annually, or otherwise, and that the said order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>the board of supervisors provided that the interest should be paid annually.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-5\">J, L.

If those are your two propositions, I speak for the Court in saying that where there is no specific requirement of the law declaring that money of a particular form or kind shall be designated, it is a good bond and it is in full compliance with the law, when it calls for \u201clawful money of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">And, second, it is clearly a power vested with the supervisors, after election, to determine whether the interest shall be paid semi-annually or annually. If those are your two propositions, they are resolved in favor of petitioner, and mandate will issue accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
