The paper sought to be filed here as a copy of the order granting a new trial is obviously merely a copy of the signed opinion filed in the lower court by the trial judge in determining the motion for a new trial. It states at considerable length the reasons of the learned judge for his conclusion that a new trial should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>granted and ends with the words \u201cThe motion for a new trial will be granted.\u201d It is admitted that subsequent to the making of the minute entry of the order granting a new trial, a motion was made in the lower court for the correction of the same so that it would show that the new trial was not granted on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, and that this motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">It is conceded, as it must be under the decisions, that a written opinion of the trial judge filed in determining a motion for a new trial constitutes no part of the record on appeal and cannot operate to limit the effect of the order as actually made. Any limitation of the grounds upon which the order is made must, to be effectual, be specified in the order itself. We are satisfied that it must be held, under the decisions, that the paper signed and filed by the trial judge was simply a written opinion, and in no sense an order granting a new trial. In both <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Overland Pac. Ry. Co., </em>132 Cal. 73, [64 Pac. 110], and <em>Ben Lomond Wine Co. </em>v. <em>Sladky, </em>141 Cal. 619, [75 Pac. 332], the paper signed and filed by the judge purported to order a new trial, the language in the former of these cases being \u201cThe motion for a new trial is granted.\u201d In such case it was held that where there is an order granting a new trial entered upon the minutes of the court, and also an opinion filed showing the reasons for the granting of the motion, and concluding with the words \u201cThe motion for a new trial is granted,\u201d the order entered in the minutes is the only record of the court\u2019s action, and is to be measured by its terms, and not by the reasons which the court may give for it. (See, also, <em>Weisser </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Ry. Co., </em>148 Cal. 426, 7 Ann. Cas. 636, 83 Pac. 439].)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Beatty, C. J., does not participate in the foregoing decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
