Then what is left I want to go to Thos. Glass my husband\u2019s father. If my dear husband Mack Glass is not living then I want my brother Dr. J. K. Miller to have $500.00 five hundred dollars. Also my two sisters Sarah Mawhinney and Dell Nesbit to have $500.00 five hundred dollars each. The balance to go to father Glass\u2019s estate. The old family dishes to be divided between my two sisters Sarah Mawhinney and Dell Nesbit. The dear old clock to go to my brother Dr. J. K. .Miller. My old watch I give to Rosa Nesbit and father Miller\u2019s watch to Bernell Miller my nephew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\">\u201cNellie Glass.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\">\u201cCorona, Cal., Oct. 10, 1901.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The construction of the will coming before the court under a petition for distribution, an appeal is taken from the decree by certain disaffected heirs of Thomas Glass. The controversy is over the sentence \u201cThe balance to go to father Glass\u2019s estate.\u201d The only facts pertinent to the consideration, besides those appearing upon the face of the will, are that at the date of the execution of the will Thomas Glass was living but died before the death of the testatrix. It is intimated, but not found, that the word \u201cestate\u201d was written by testatrix in the will after the death of Thomas Glass. It would seem to be not improbable that such is the case, but neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>less, the formalities attending the execution of a codicil were not observed and the legal result is that the will must be construed as a single instrument executed at the date it bears. <em>(In re Parsons, </em>99 Cal. 34, [33 Pac. 751].) The language of the testatrix thus being referred to the date of her will and not to the date of her death, by the plain terms of the will Nellie Glass attempted to leave the residue of her estate, not to Thomas Glass, but to Thomas Glass\u2019s estate. Thomas Glass\u2019s estate is not a person or entity which can take under the will. (Civ. Code, secs. 1275, 1313.) When used with reference to a living man \u201cestate\u201d may either mean all of his property and property interests, as colloquially, \u201cupon his death he will leave a large estate,\u201d or it may refer specifically to a particular property in land, as his \u201cestate in Sonoma County.\u201d But however used as to a living man no property can pass to it by descent, devise or bequest. The case of appellants is not bettered if the word \u201cestate\u201d were eliminated from the will, though, of course, this would not be permissible, for the result would be a devise or bequest to one who predeceased the testatrix, and no intent appearing to substitute another in his place, the disposition would fail. (Civ. Code, sec. 1343.) The construction contended for by appellants,\u2014namely, that the will is to be read as though it declared that the balance should go to Thomas Glass if alive, \u2022 and if not, then to his estate, by his estate meaning his legal heirs, or his devisees or legatees as the case may be, is too strained to be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The decree appealed from is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Melvin, J., and Lorigan, J,, concurred;</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
