The court is of opinion that the position mentioned is not well taken; that neither of the statutes in question are .in conflict with the sections of the Constitution of the State aforesaid, but that both of such statutes are constitutional and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The order of the court below under review will,, therefore, be reversed and annulled, and this court will enter such order as that court should have entered, namely, to the effect that the board of supervisors of Louisa county have the right to issue bonds under the aforesaid act approved March 16, 1920 (being chapter 213 of the Acts \u2022of 1920, pp. 308-9), and that the order of such board, aforesaid, of March 12, 1921, is in that and in all pther particulars drawn in question upon this appeal, legal and valid in .all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
