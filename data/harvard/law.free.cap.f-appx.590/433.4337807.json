He contends that the district court plainly erred when' it enhanced his sentence based on a finding that his prior Oklahoma conviction for aggravated assault and battery was a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Because Aluya did not object to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) enhancement in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (5th Cir.2005). To show plain error, Aluya must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The state court documents provide that on June 5, 2012, Aluya pleaded guilty to one count of \u201cAGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND BATTERY \"21 O.S. \u00a7 646(2), a FELONY.\u201d Relying on the citations to \u201c21 O.S. \u00a7 646(2),\u201d Aluya contends that he was convicted of aggravated assault and battery in violation of OKLA. STAT. ANN. tit. 21 \u00a7 646(A)(2). The Government contends that the citations were typographical errors and that the district court did not plainly err in determining that Aluya was convicted under \u00a7 646(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">As the Government notes, the language of the Second Amended Information tracks the elements of \u00a7 646(A)(1), i.e., that great bodily injury was inflicted upon the person assaulted. \u00a7 646(A)(1). This language was explicitly set forth in the presentence report, which the district court adopted. Although the state court documents identified the statute of conviction as \u201c21 O.S. \u00a7 646(2),\u201d there is no such subsection. <em>See </em>\u00a7 646. Further, \u00a7 646(A)(2) requires that the assault and battery be \u201ccommitted by a person of robust health or strength upon one who is aged, decrepit, or incapacitated,\u201d \u00a7 646(A)(2), elements that are not alleged in the Second Amended Information. Therefore, the district court did not plainly err in implicitly determining that Aluya was convicted under \u00a7 646(A)(1). Because Aluya\u2019s \u00a7 646(A)(1) conviction falls within the generic, contemporary meaning of aggravated assault, it qualifies as an enumerated crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See United States v. Mungiu-Portillo, </em>484 F.3d 813, 816-17 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Aluya cannot show error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
