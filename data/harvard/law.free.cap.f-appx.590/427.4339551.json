The district court denied the motion as unmeritorious and denied Martinez-Tello\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Martinez-Tello challenges the denial of his IFP motion and the certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">This court\u2019s inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Martinez-Tello\u2019s notice of appeal from the denial of his motion was untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4. His assertion that the district court failed to notify him of the denial of his motion is belied by the record. Accordingly, Martinez-Tello\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and the appeal is dismissed ,as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
