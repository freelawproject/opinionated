He reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment and the applicability of an exception to the felon-in-possession statute for those whose civil rights have been restored. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The restor\u00e1tion-of-rights exception exempts from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) \u201c[a]ny conviction ... for which a person ... has had civil rights restored ..., unless such ... restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). Rodriguez contends that his prior Texas felony conviction could not be used as a predicate conviction for purposes of section 922(g)(1), but he concedes that this argument is foreclosed by precedent of the Supreme Court and this circuit. <em>See Logan v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 23, 28, 128 S.Ct. 475, 169 L.Ed.2d 432 (2007); <em>Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 315-17, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998); <em>United States v. Huff, </em>370 F.3d 454, 459-60 (5th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 517-18 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>991 F.2d 206, 213-15 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, he contends that the cases should be revisited in view of more recent Supreme Court precedent regarding the individual right under the Second Amendment to possess firearms in one\u2019s home for purposes of self-defense. <em>See McDonald v. Chicago, </em>561 U.S. 742, 750, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010); <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 630, 635-36, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Although we are not bound by Rodriguez\u2019s concession, <em>see United States v. Hope, </em>545 F.3d 293, 295 (5th Cir.2008), we agree that his arguments are foreclosed. First, the parties do not dispute that Texas law had not restored to Rodriguez the right to serve on juries or hold public office; thus, section 921(a)(20) is unavailing because his civil rights were not sufficiently restored. <em>See Huff, </em>370 F.3d at 460-61; <em>Thomas, </em>991 F.2d at 213-15. Second, consistent with the \u201call-or-nothing approach\u201d adopted in <em>Caron, see </em>524 U.S. at 314-16, 118 S.Ct. 2007, this court has held that because the statute in question, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 46.04, \u201cprohibits felons from possessing firearms outside their homes ..., Texas statutory law activated the \u2018unless clause\u2019 in section 921(a)(20) and prevents [a convicted felon] from possessing a firearm.\u201d <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 517-18. Third, we find no basis in the recent Second Amendment caselaw to undermine the holdings in <em>Caron </em>or <em>Daugherty. </em>The <em>Heller </em>court stated that, \u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons_\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783. We remain bound by the cited precedent. <em>See Rodriguez de Quijos v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED. Its alternative motion for an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>tension of time within which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
