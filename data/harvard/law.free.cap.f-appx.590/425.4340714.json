Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 313 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Frye, </em>489 F.3d 201, 207 (5th Cir.2007). The pertinent inquiry for both of these claims is whether \u201c <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301 (5th Cir.) (en banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 170, 190 L.Ed.2d 121 (2014); <em>Girod, </em>646 F.3d at 313. When conducting this review we leave questions concerning the weight and credibility of evidence to the jury and will not second-guess its conclusions on these matters. <em>See United States v. Jefferson, </em>751 F.3d 314, 320-21 (5th Cir.2014); <em>Girod, </em>646 F.3d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Application of these standards to the instant case shows that Gomez\u2019s challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal are unavailing. When taken as a whole, the testimony offered by all of the trial witnesses shows the existence of a large alien-transporting operation carried out by numerous individuals including Gomez. These witnesses\u2019 testimony suffices to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that Gomez took part in the conspiracy by transporting at least two illegal aliens and by taking part in conversations concerning the running of the operation. <em>See United States v. Chon, </em>713 F.3d 812, 818 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 255, 187 L.Ed.2d 147 (2013); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(v)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">Insofar as Gomez argues that the evidence was insufficient due to violations of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(b), he is mistaken. The disputed items are summaries of interviews and thus do not qualify as Jencks Act material. <em>See Palermo v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 352, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">Gomez\u2019s argument that his right to cross-examination was infringed when he was forbidden from further questioning a witness about a conviction that was being appealed also fails. The record shows that Gomez was \u201callowed to expose the jury to facts from which the jury could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Heard, </em>709 F.3d 413, 432 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 470, 187 L.Ed.2d 317 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Gomez has shown no error with respect to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Similarly, he has not shown any error in connection with his sentence. Sentences, whether inside or outside the advisory guidelines range, are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When, as in this case, the district court has imposed a sentence that deviates from the guidelines range, reasonableness review requires that this court evaluate whether the sentence \u201cunreasonably fails to reflect the statutory sentencing factors\u201d set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>To the extent Gomez contends that the district court erred by denying him the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, he is mistaken. \u201cThis adjustment is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse.\u201d <em>United States v. Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d 310, 316 (5th Cir .2009) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.2)). This is exactly what happened in the instant case. Consequently, Gomez has not shown that the district court erred by denying him this adjustment. <em>See Rudzavice, </em>586 F.3d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Likewise unavailing are Gomez\u2019s arguments that the district court erred by not imposing a greater variance and by failing to give adequate reasons for its choice of sentence. The record shows that the district court considered Gomez\u2019s arguments in favor of a below-guidelines sentence, as well as the Government\u2019s position that a guidelines sentence was warranted. However, the district court disagreed with these positions and concluded that, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence imposed was appropriate. The district court also noted that its choice of sentence reflected its beliefs concerning Gomez\u2019s position in the conspiracy relative to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">When these portions of the record are considered, they evidence the district court\u2019s opinion that the facts of the instant offense and Gomez\u2019s history and characteristics warranted a 30-month sentence. There is nothing to indicate that the district court\u2019s choice of sentence was grounded in disregard for an important factor, a disproportionate weighing of a factor that was not germane, or a clearly erroneous weighing of the sentencing factors. <em>See Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 708. Rather, the record shows that the district court chose the sentence it felt most appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The fact that Gomez thinks his sentence should have been lower does not mean that it is unreasonable. <em>Cf. Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (holding that a sentence is not unreasonable simply because the appellate court would have chosen a different sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Finally, the record refutes Gomez\u2019s assertion that the district court did not give adequate reasons for its choice of sentence. The district court \u201cadequately explained] the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful' appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Gomez has shown no error in connection with his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
