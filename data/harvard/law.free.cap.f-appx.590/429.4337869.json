He appeals the district court\u2019s determination that his prior Texas conviction for possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance qualified as a drug trafficking offense warranting a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) and as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Garcia-Monroy argues that the Texas statute criminalizes the \u201cadministering\u201d of drugs, which is not covered by either sentencing provision. Because Garcia-Monroy preserved these arguments in the district court, our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 548 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Garcia-Monroy has failed to show that it is a realistic possibility that a person would be prosecuted for \u201cadministering\u201d cocaine as that term is defined under the Texas statute. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014). He specifically has set forth no prior Texas case applying the statute in an \u201cadministering\u201d situation. <em>See id. </em>at 460-61. A theoretical possibility that a statute might include types of conduct that would not qualify as a drug trafficking offense is insufficient. <em>See United States v. Carras-co-Tercero, </em>745 F.3d 192, 197-98 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Thus, the district court was correct in determining that Garcia-Monroy\u2019s conviction was a drug trafficking offense and an aggravated felony. <em>See Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 461-62 &amp; n. 5. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
