No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">Trifonov was allegedly injured while working as a crew member aboard the <em>MSC Magnifica, </em>a cruise ship owned by MSC and registered and flagged in Panama. Trifonov filed this civil action in state court, asserting claims under the Jones Act and general maritime law. MSC removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to compel arbitration based on a provision of the collective agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) it had entered into with Trifonov\u2019s seafarer\u2019s union, which was incorporated into Trifonov\u2019s employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">The Agreement provides that all claims by seafarers against MSC, including expressly the kinds of claims asserted in this case by Trifonov, \u201cmust be referred to arbitration to the exclusion of any other legal or court proceeding.\u201d According to the Agreement, arbitration shall take place in Panama and shall be governed by the \u201claw of the vessel\u2019s flag,\u201d which in this case is also Panama.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">The district court granted MSC\u2019s motion, dismissed Trifonov\u2019s complaint, and ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration in compliance with the Agreement. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">We review a district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration <em>de novo. Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">\u201cIn deciding a motion to compel arbitration under the [United Nations Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (\u201cConvention\u201d) ], a court conducts \u2018a very limited inquiry.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Convention, a district court must compel arbitration unless the court concludes either that (1) the Convention\u2019s \u201cfour jurisdictional prerequisites are not met\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or (2) that \u201cone of the Convention\u2019s affirmative defenses applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294-95. We are \u201cmindful that the Convention Act \u2018generally establishes a strong presumption in favor of arbitration of international commercial disputes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">On appeal, Trifonov argues that his agreement to arbitrate fails to satisfy one of the Convention\u2019s jurisdictional factors. He contends that, pursuant to section 1 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d)\u2014 which excludes expressly \u201ccontracts of employment of seamen\u201d from the definition of \u201ccommerce\u201d \u2014 his employment contract is no \u201ccommercial\u201d legal agreement for purposes of the Convention. Trifonov\u2019s argument is' foreclosed by our decision in <em>Bautista, </em>in which we concluded that the Convention recognizes no exception for seamen employment contracts. <em>See Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1295-1300. Because we conclude that each of the four jurisdictional prerequisites has been met, we now examine whether one of the Convention\u2019s affirmative defenses applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Trifonov contends that the Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause is void as against public policy, based on the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201ceffective vindication exception,\u201d arguing that enforcing the arbitration agreement would waive prospectively his rights secured under United States law. In support of his argument, Trifonov describes various ways in which he contends that application of Panamanian law will deprive him of his rights under United States law. In the light of our decision in <em>Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., </em>652 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2011), we reject Trifonov\u2019s arguments as \u201cpremature\u201d at this stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">In <em>Lindo, </em>we explained that a party seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement under the Convention had two avail-aisle causes of action: \u201c(1) an action to compel arbitration in accord -with the terms of the agreement ..., and (2) at a later stage, an action to confirm an arbitral award made pursuant to an arbitration agreement....\u201d 652 F.3d at 1262-63. And we concluded that a public-policy defense may be raised only at the award-enforcement stage, not at the arbitration-enforcement stage. <em>See id. </em>at 1280-82, 1284 (concluding, despite plaintiffs contentions that foreign law would provide an inadequate remedy, that plaintiffs public policy defense was \u201cpremature\u201d at the arbitration-enforcement stage).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Trifonov argues that <em>Lindo </em>is not good law. First, he contends that <em>Lindo </em>conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Am. Express Co. v. Italian Colors Rest., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2304, 186 L.Ed.2d 417 (2013), and <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). In <em>Italian Colors, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the \u201ceffective vindication\u201d doctrine, which the Court said \u201coriginated as dictum in <em>Mitsubishi Motors,\u201d </em>and which had been discussed (but not applied) in two other Supreme Court cases. <em>See </em>133 S.Ct. at 2310. But the Supreme Court still declined to apply the doctrine to invalidate the arbitration agreement at issue in that case. <em>Id. </em>Because the <em>Italian Colors </em>decision does not conflict with our decision in <em>Lindo </em>(which we determined was consistent with <em>Mitsubishi Motors), Lindo </em>remains good law.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Second, Trifonov argues that, under the prior-precedent rule, we are bound by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thomas v. Carnival, </em>573 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2009), instead of <em>Lindo. </em>But, as discussed at length in <em>Lindo, </em>to the extent that <em>Thomas </em>acknowledged the availability of a public-policy defense at the motion-to-compel stage, it conflicted with this Court\u2019s even earlier precedent in <em>Bautista </em>and, thus, itself violated the prior-precedent rule. <em>See Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1277-80; <em>see also Burke-Fowler v. Orange Cnty., Fla., </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]hen a later panel decision contradicts an earlier one, the earlier panel decision controls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Trifonov also contends that his Jones Act claim cannot, as a matter of law, be removed to federal court. We accept that Jones Act claims are not generally subject to removal. <em>See e.g., Am. Dredg</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>ing Co. v. Miller, </em>510 U.S. 443, 114 S.Ct. 981, 992, 127 L.Ed.2d 285 (1994) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(a) and noting that Congress \u201cappears to have withheld from Jones Act defendants the right of removal generally applicable to claims based on federal law\u201d). But that Jones Act claims may be subjected to arbitration under the Convention is clear. <em>See Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1286-87. And the Convention authorizes the removal to federal court of claims \u201cre-lat[ing] to an arbitration agreement or award falling under the Convention.\u201d <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Although we have not addressed the removal issue expressly, this Court has routinely compelled arbitration of Jones Act claims that had been removed under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205 when they relate to an arbitration agreement under the Convention. <em>See, e.g., Martinez v. Carnival Corp., </em>744 F.3d 1240 (11th Cir.2014); <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d 1257; <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d 1289. And the few other courts that have decided the issue have concluded that removal of Jones Act claims is proper under the Convention. <em>See, e.g. Pysarenko v. Carnival Corp., </em>2014 WL 1745048, *7, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59990, *20 (S.D.Fla.2014) (concluding that \u201cJones Act claims are removable under the Convention\u201d); <em>Allen v. Royal Caribbean Cruise, Ltd., </em>2008 WL 5095412, **3-4, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103783, *12 (S.D.Fla.2008), <em>aff'd, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 360 (11th Cir.2009) (same); <em>Amizola v. Dolphin Shipowner, S.A., </em>354 F.Supp.2d 689, 695 (E.D.La.2004) (\u201ca claim under the Jones Act does not defeat removal under the Convention Act\u201d); <em>Acosta v. Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., </em>303 F.Supp.2d 1327, 1331 (S.D.Fla.2003) (same). We are persuaded that Trifonov\u2019s Jones Act claim, which is governed by the Convention, was removed properly to federal court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">In the light of this Circuit\u2019s binding \u25a0 precedent, the district court correctly granted MSC\u2019s motion to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-11\">. An agreement to arbitrate is governed by the Convention if these four jurisdictional prerequisites are present: (1) the agreement is \"in writing within the meaning of the Convention;\u201d (2) the agreement provides for \"arbitration\" in the territory of a signatory of the Convention;\u201d (3) \"the agreement arises out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered commercial;\u201d and (4) one of the parties to the agreement is not an American citizen. <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294 n. 7. That conditions (1), (2), and (4) are satisfied in this case is undisputed. On appeal, Trifonov challenges only the third condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-6\">. We also reject Trifonov\u2019s argument that the Jones Act trumps the Convention based on the \"one last in date\u201d doctrine. <em>See Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1286-87 (rejecting plaintiffs argument that the 2008 amendments to the Jones Act rendered his. Jones Act claim arising under the Convention inarbitrable).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
