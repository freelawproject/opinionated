Brown appeals the revocation of his supervised release and the imposition of a within-guidelines sentence. Brown argues th\u00e1t the district court committed a host of procedural errors and, additionally, that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Because his general objection did not adequately preserve his arguments for appeal, review is for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir.1995). To show plain error, Brown must show that the error was clear or obvious and affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">Despite repeatedly admitting to the use of cocaine, in addition to his positive drug screens, Brown nevertheless contends that the district court erroneously found that he had committed a Grade B violation. Brown\u2019s admitted use of cocaine supports a finding that he possessed cocaine while under supervision for purposes of a revocation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g). <em>United States v. Smith, </em>978 F.2d 181, 182 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, because Brown possessed cocaine while under supervision, the district court had ample basis to conclude that he committed a Grade B violation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2). Because Brown committed a Grade B violation, it became the basis for determining the \u201cgrade of violation\u201d for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>revocation table. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(b) and 7B1.4(a) (table). Therefore, whether the district court was correct concerning the number of Grade C violations he committed was irrelevant, as they played no role in the determination of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Brown\u2019s argument that the district court procedurally erred by failing to consider the relevant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not supported by the record. The district court implicitly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it stated that it had considered the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, the statements of the district court reflected its consideration of Brown\u2019s history and characteristics and the circumstances of his violations of supervised release. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1); <em>United States v. Kippers, </em>685 F.3d 491, 499 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Insofar as Brown contends that the district court erroneously used the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors in imposing a sentence, because revocation of Brown\u2019s supervision was mandated under \u00a7 3583(g), consideration of those factors was not inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>37 F.3d 1091, 1095-97 (5th Cir. 1994). Brown\u2019s argument that the district court improperly considered his need for substance abuse treatment in violation of <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2385, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011), is not supported by the record, as the significant factors informing the imposition and length of his sentence did not include his need for drug rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Brown further contends that the district court procedurally erred by not adequately considering the alternatives to incarceration that he presented and by failing to explain why it rejected them. The district court\u2019s reasons for imposing a sentence, however, were legally sufficient. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 362 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Finally, Brown argues that his within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court did not consider a wide range of other conduct, including his compliance for the first two years of his supervised release. Brown\u2019s within-guidelines sentence, however, is presumptively substantively reasonable, and his argument that the district court should have given more consideration to his periods of good behavior amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the district court over how the \u00a7 3553(a) factors should have been balanced, which is insufficient to overcome the presumption. <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>691 F.3d 592, 597 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
