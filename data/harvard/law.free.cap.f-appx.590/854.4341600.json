The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We dismiss the appeal of Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership in part for lack of jurisdiction, and we affirm the dismissal of its complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Friendfinder made an initial public offering of five million shares of common stock. The prospectus provided that some Friendfinder stock was subject to a lockup agreement; that is, the prospectus stated that \u201c[hjolders of at least 20, 917, 936 of the other shares outstanding or converts ible into common stock have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions and extensions, not to dispose of any of their securities for a period of 180 days following the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of the underwriters.\u201d The prospectus also stated that Friendfinder \u201cw[ould] be required to establish and regularly evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting\u201d and that it \u201ch[ad] taken and w[ould] continue to take actions designed to enhance [its] disclosure controls and procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership, Greenfield Investment Services, LLC, and David Schwartz were among those who purchased Friendfinder common stock during the initial public offering. The price of the stock plummeted and continued to decline for several months. The plaintiffs suspected that their losses were attributable to insider trading, and a broker told Schwartz that \u201cinsiders are selling. At least 700,000 shares were sold immediately upon opening, and ... that number may be as high as 2,000,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership, Greenfield Investment, and Schwartz filed a second amended complaint on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated against Friendfinder, its underwriters, and its former officers and directors. Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership, Greenfield Investment, and Schwartz complained that all the defendants violated Section 11 of the Act because the registration statement included a prospectus that contained material misstatements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a), and that Marc H. Bell, Daniel C. Staton, and six other former officers and directors of Friendfinder were liable under Section 15 of the Act as \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d and \u201cpersons who aided and abetted\u201d in violating securities laws, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 770. Greenfield Investment and Schwartz also complained that Friendfinder and its underwriters, Ladenburg Thalman &amp; Co., Inc., and Imperial Capital, LLC, violated Section 12(a)(2) of the Act by offering or selling securities using a prospectus that con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>tained material misstatements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 771(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The complaint alleged that the prospectus was misleading because shares were sold in violation of the lock-up agreement and because Friendfinder, its underwriters, and its executives knew that the shares would be sold. The complaint alleged that, \u201c[ejontrary to the statements about the lock-up agreement and the implementation of internal controls, a material number of restricted shares were sold\u201d before expiration of the lock-up period. The complaint also alleged that a restricted share could not be sold until its holder obtained consent from its issuer and its broker to remove the restricted share legend; millions of shares were traded during the lock-up period; and \u201cit [was] simply not plausible\u201d that holders of restricted shares commenced the process to have the legends removed from the shares \u201cwithin minutes after the opening of the Offering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The district court dismissed for lack of standing the complaint of Greenfield Investment and Schwartz against Friendfin-der for its alleged violation of Section 12(a)(2), and the district court dismissed the remainder of the complaint for \u201cfailure] to adequately allege a prima fa-cie case under Sections 11, 12, or 15\u201d of the Securities Act. The district court ruled that Greenfield Investment and Schwartz had purchased their shares from the underwriters and lacked standing to complain that Friendfinder was a \u201cseller\u201d of the shares under Section 12(a)(2). The district court also ruled that the statements about the lock-up agreement and about the internal controls were not materially misleading. Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of its complaint, but neither Greenfield Investment nor Schwartz joined in that notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The complaint fails to allege facts to support a claim that the two statements in the prospectus contain \u201can untrue statement of material fact\u201d under Section 11. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). As explained by the district court, the statement about the lockup agreement \u201cmerely advise[d] potential investors that certain shareholders ha[d] agreed to retain their shares for a specific period of time,\u201d and the statement about internal controls \u201cmerely disclosed ... that there [were] disclosure controls and procedures in place.\u201d The prospectus did not address, much less guarantee, enforcement of the agreement. The prospectus also stated that the agreement was \u201csubject to certain exceptions and extensions,\u201d and the complaint fails to allege that the sales were not excepted from the agreement. Because the complaint fails to allege a plausible violation of Section 11, the complaint also fails to state a claim against the former officers and directors of Friendfinder under section 15. <em>See Ehlerb v. Singer, </em>245 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership lacks standing to contest the dismissal of the complaint that Friendfinder, Laden-burg, and Imperial violated Section 12(a)(2). Although the parties do not raise the issue of standing, we are obliged to do so <em>sua sponte. See Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 974 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cStanding is a threshold jurisdictional question which must be addressed prior to and independent of the merits of a party\u2019s claims.\u201d (alteration omitted)). \u201cLitigants must establish their standing not only to bring claims, but also to appeal judgments.\u201d <em>Wolff v. Cash 4 Titles, </em>351 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2003). Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership never alleged a violation of Section 12 because it lacked standing to do so. As explained by the district court, \u201cthe Section 12(a)(2) elaim[ ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>[was] alleged only by Plaintiffs [Greenfield Investment] and Schwartz[because they] ... purchased stock directly from the Underwriter[s],\u201d and the \u201cPlaintiffs concede^] that [Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership] lack[ed] standing to pursue a claim under Section 12, since it purchased its shares in the secondary market.\u201d And Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership lacks standing to contest the dismissal of the claim on behalf of Greenfield Investment and Schwartz. <em>See Wolff, </em>351 F.3d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">We DISMISS the appeal of the complaint of Greenfield Investment and Schwartz about a violation of Section 12(a)(2), and we AFFIRM the dismissal of the second amended complaint of Greenfield Children\u2019s Partnership.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
