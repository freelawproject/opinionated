The Lattimores, claiming that Wells Fargo\u2019s foreclosure constituted a \u201cfraudulent transfer\u201d under state law, sought injunc-tive relief under the Truth in Lending Act (\u201cTILA\u201d), the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d), and several other federal statutes, regulations, and \u201cother applicable laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The district court dismissed their amended complaint for failure to state a claim for relief, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and entered judgment for Wells Fargo. The Lattimores appeal the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They argue that the district court improperly dismissed their complaint because they were \u201cnot allowed to be heard.\u201d That issue aside, they argue that the court erred because the allegations of the amended complaint demonstrate that (1) Wells Fargo committed fraud in moving to foreclose on their property; (2) Wells Fargo committed state-law \u201cwrongful foreclosure\u201d; (3) Wells Fargo acted in bad faith by not providing them with the requested proof of its legal authority to foreclose, and violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d); (4) Wells Fargo and MERS engaged in a civil conspiracy to create a \u201cfictitious corporation\u201d designed to act as a strawman and to avoid paying local filing fees; (5) MERS and Wells Fargo fraudulently misrepresented themselves as secured creditors for undeserved gain; and (6) Wells Fargo violated the RESPA by not responding to their Qualified Written Request (\u201cQWR\u201d). We find no merit in the Lattimores\u2019 arguments and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to \u2018state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Chaparro v. Carnival Corp., </em>693 F.3d 1333, 1335 (11th Cir.2012). We accept the amended complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations need not be detailed, but must consist of more than \u201can unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). A complaint is insufficient if it \u201ctenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration omitted) (citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff must provide more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action is not sufficient. <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although ordinarily the district court may not consider matters outside the face of the complaint when evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, documents at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>tached to the motion to dismiss may be considered if they are central to the plaintiffs claim and their contents are undisputed. <em>Fin. Sec. Assurance, Inc. v. Stephens, Inc., </em>500 F.3d 1276, 1284 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Also, we will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Georgia law authorizes the transfer of deeds to secure debt, O.G.C.A. \u00a7 44-14-64, such as the one the Lattimores executed in this case. To foreclose on a property, Georgia law requires the foreclosing party to hold only the security deed, not the promissory note. <em>See You v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, </em>293 Ga. 67, 743 S.E.2d 428, 433 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">A plaintiff may state a claim under the RESPA for a mortgage-loan servicer\u2019s failure to respond to a QWR and recover any actual damages suffered as a result of this failure and additional damages if there is a pattern or practice of noncompliance. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(f)(1). The RESPA provides that the maker of a federally related mortgage loan must disclose to each loan applicant whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred while the loan is outstanding. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(a). The RESPA also provides that the servicer of a federally related mortgage loan must notify the borrower in writing of any assignment, sale, or transfer of the servicing of th.e loan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(b)(1). This notice of transfer of servicing must be made not more than 15 days after the effective date of the transfer of the servicing of the mortgage loan. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(b)(2)(a). The RESPA does not require notice when the underlying note or mortgage is transferred. <em>See generally id. </em>\u00a7 2605.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">Under the RESPA, borrowers may send loan servicers a QWR for information related to the \u201cservicing\u201d of their loans. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A). Servicing is defined as \u201creceiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any loan ... and making the payments of principal and interest and such other payments with respect to the amounts received from the borrower as may be required pursuant to the terms of the loan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(i)(3). A QWR is defined as a written correspondence, \u201cother than notice on a payment coupon or other payment medium supplied by the servicer,\u201d that: (1) enables the servicer to identify the name and account of the borrower, and (2) includes a statement of the reason for the belief of the borrower that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail regarding other information sought by the borrower. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Under the RESPA, as amended on July 21, 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a servicer must respond and acknowledge receipt of the QWR within five business days of its receipt. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2605(e)(1)(A); Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 111-203, \u00a7 1463, 124 Stat. 1376, 2184 (2010). A servicer must also, no later than 30 business days after receipt of the QWR, (1) make appropriate corrections in the account of the borrower and send the borrower written notification of the corrections; (2) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation or clarification including, to the extent applicable, a statement of the reasons for which the servicer believes the account of the borrower is correct, and the name and telephone number of a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>son who can provide assistance; or (3) after conducting an investigation, provide the borrower with a written explanation or clarification including information requested by the borrower, or an explanation of why the information requested is unavailable or cannot be obtained by the servicer, and the name and telephone number of a person who can provide assistance. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">As a preliminary matter, the Lattimores\u2019 brief on appeal presents only one argument: Wells Fargo committed \u201cfraudulent transfer\u201d and violated the RESPA. We therefore deem their other arguments abandoned. Because the Latti-mores\u2019 amended complaint contains only conclusory statements and does not allege facts sufficient to state a plausible claim of \u201cfraudulent transfer\u201d or a claim under the RESPA, the district court did not err in dismissing such claims under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-6\">.
