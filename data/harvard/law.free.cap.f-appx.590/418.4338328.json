He contends that the sentence imposed was greater than necessary to fulfill the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was, therefore, unreasonable. He asserts that the district court improperly considered factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and that the sentence was unreasonably harsh under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">Ordinarily, revocation sentences are reviewed under a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011). However, because no objection was made at the revocation hearing, this court\u2019s review of Seg-retto\u2019s revocation sentence is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, Segretto must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">The district court may impose any sentence that falls within the statutory maximum term of imprisonment allowed for the revocation sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). However, the court is directed to consider the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a), including the nonbinding policy statements found in Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Mathena, </em>23 F.3d 87, 90-93 (5th Cir.1994). Because \u00a7 3583(e) omits from its directive the sentencing factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), which include the need for the sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), \u201cit is improper for a district court to rely on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) for the modification or revocation of a supervised release term.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>634 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Any error in the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) factors did not affect Segretto\u2019s substantial rights because the district court also relied on other, permissible factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (2)(C) &amp; (4)(B). The district court\u2019s comments were made in the context of Segretto\u2019s failure to comply with his obligations under the terms and conditions of his supervised release term and not in connection with the underlying offense. <em>See United States v. Ellsworth, </em>490 Fed.Appx. 663, 664 (5th Cir.2012); see <em>also </em>5th CiR. R. 47.5.4. Segretto does not dispute that the district court imposed a statutory maximum sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3). In imposing the sentence, the court considered the guidelines policy statements and appropriate statutory sentencing factors. <em>See Mathena, </em>23 F.3d at 90-93. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
