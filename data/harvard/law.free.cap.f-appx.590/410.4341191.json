We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-25\">Castro challenges the 16-level enhancement imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) based on his Texas conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, for which he received a sentence longer than 13 months. In his view, the Texas conviction did not qualify as a drug trafficking offense because Texas defines <em>delivery </em>more broadly than \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s drug trafficking offense, given that the Texas offense of delivery may be committed by administering a controlled substance, an act not within the purview of \u00a7 2L1.2. He contends further that, for the same reasons, the Texas offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-26\">Castro\u2019s claims are foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 460-62 (5th Cir.2014). In <em>Teran-Sa-las, </em>we concluded that there is no \u201crealistic probability that Texas would prosecute [the] crime under an \u2018administering\u2019 theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>in a way that does not also constitute either \u2018dispensing\u2019 or \u2018distributing\u2019 under the federal sentencing guidelines.\u201d 767 F.3d at 460; <em>see id. </em>at 458-62. Further, \u201c[e]ven without considering the drug type or quantity, conviction under the administer prong is not a realistic probability because no previous Texas case has involved a conviction under this prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461. Therefore, we held that the Texas offense of possession with intent to deliver cocaine was a drug trafficking offense under the Guidelines and an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b). <em>Id. </em>at 461-62 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
