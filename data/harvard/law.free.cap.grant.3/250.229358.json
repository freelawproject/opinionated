Jones, in his own right, as husband of testator\u2019s daughter. Jane W. claims one-third of the principal sum of the annuity bequeathed by the testator to his daughter, Hetty Maria, that is, one-third of $6,660, on the ground that the decedent, as regards this sum, died intestate. There is no specific bequest of this sum in the seventh item of the will in the event of Hetty Maria dying without issue, and thq residuary bequests in the eighteenth item, Mr. Eush contends, are exclusive of the special bequests to the daughter; and there being nowhere in the will any disposition made of this principal sum of $6,660, in the event of Hetty Maria dying without issue, the testator, as regards this sum, has died intestate, and that W. H. Jones, as the husband of Jane W., upon taking out the letters of administration on her estate, is entitled to one-third of the said sum, subject to the debts of his wife <em>dum sola. </em>To sustain this position, Mr. Eush referred the auditor to the seventh, eighteenth, and twenty-second clauses of the will, and cited Eoper on Legacies, 321, 4 Ves. 59, <em>Phillips </em>v. Chamberlain, 5 Madd. 412; <em>Bland </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>2 Ves. Sen. 285.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-13\">The fact that Hetty Maria died without issue is conceded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The auditor is of opinion that the residuary bequest is not exclusive of the bequest to Hetty Maria in the seventh item, and this is also the construction put upon that clause, in the opinion of the court, by Mr. Justice Woodward (ante, page 169). It is there shown why the bequest to Jane was, and that to Hetty Maria was not, exempted from the operation of the eighteenth clause. \u201c Hetty Maria dying without issue,\u201d says the learned judge, \u201c the devise over of the principal of her annuity never took effect. But in Jones\u2019 case there was a devise over of the principal and a birth of issue to take.\u201d The bequest to Hetty Maria, therefore, upon her death without issue fell into and formed part of the residuum bequeathed to Allen Armstrong in the eighteenth clause. The auditor therefore reports that the said W. H. Jones is entitled to no part of the bequest made by the testator to his daughter Hetty Maria.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-6\">2. The claim of W. H.

H. Jones and the daughter of the testator, died on the 15th May, 1837, in giving birth to her daughter, the said Jane W. A. Jones. Mrs. Jones, during her life, was entitled to an annuity of $400. By the decision of the Supreme Court in this case, her daughter is entitled to the principal sum of that annuity, $6,660 (which has been paid), with interest thereon from the mother\u2019s death. But the estate was not competent to pay the legacy of Miss Jones and the interest thereon in full, and the annuities of the widow and Allen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-11\">The honorable court, in their opinion, delivered by Mr. Justice Woodward, concur with the former auditor in the opinion that it would \u201c now be a hopeless task to review the whole estate to ascertain from time to time with any precision what periodical abatement should have been made from Allen\u2019s annuities,\u201d and say \u201c that although they will not overhaul the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>estate so far as it has been administered for the purpose of giving her her interest, she has a right to be first served out of the funds on hand, and as far as they will go towards satisfying her just claim to interest on her legacy, they should be so applied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">The auditor has not the wish, nor, under the opinion of the court, has he the power to overhaul the administration of the estate, but he does not think that he is precluded from an examination of the face of the accounts of the executors and trustees, given in evidence before him. The auditor cannot hold the executors or trustees responsible for over payments to Allen, or disturb a single item either on the debit or credit side of their accounts, but if he can he thinks he may ascertain the amount of Miss Jones\u2019 interest from the face of these accounts. There is a mode of calculation which the auditor thinks ascertains the just claim to interest on her legacy and does not disturb the past administration of the estate. This calculation was suggested and made by the learned counsel for the appellant. It meets the approval of the auditor, and has served much to lighten the labor of investigating the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\">The accounts which were put in evidence before the auditor, are the third and fourth of the executors, and the first, second, and third of the trustees.

But the rule is not without exception. The testator may in his will, by express directions, order a different disposition of the rents, issues and profits of his real estate. So he may by implication, as when he places such real estate under the control of his executors for the purpose of paying debts or satisfying legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">It is evident that the testator in the will before us supposed it possible that his personal property might prove insufficient to pay his debts. He therefore gave to the executrix and ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ecutor control over his real estate, directing that they should prevent any sale thereof until his youngest child should attain the age of twenty-one years, unless necessary to pay his lawful debts, and in that case only so much as should suffice for that purpose. His intention seems to have been not alone to give a power to sell, but also the power to control and manage the real estate with reference to his first object, which was the payment of his debts. The executors, therefore, under the peculiar phraseology of this will, may properly be regarded as trustees of the realty, first, for the payment of debts, and then for the discharge of legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The balance in the administration account was then properly applied in the first instance to the payment of the sum due the estate of Mrs. Jones, as settled by his account as executor.. That balance arose from her having paid debts of the testator to an amount greater than the personalty which came to her hands. By such payments she became a creditor of the estate, being subrogated to the position of the creditor whom she had paid. <em>McCurdy's </em>Appeal, 5 W. &amp; S. 397; <em>Wallace's </em>Appeal, 5 Barr, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is perhaps not very material to inquire whether the interest given to the widow was a devise of lands as such, or a legacy of $3,500 00, charged upon all the testator\u2019s real estate, so far as the personalty was inadequate to pay it. In either case the result seems to be the same, so far as regards the rights to the remainder of the money in the accountant\u2019s hands. If it be a legacy, then it is not questioned that it draws interest, and that the balance in the hands of the administrator with the will annexed should be applied to the payment of the interest. If it be a devise of land, as in terms it appears to be, then the devisee is entitled to the cents, issues, and profits; and, the debts of the testator having been paid, the fund for distribution is composed of rents. Under the will, no portion of the widow\u2019s $3,500 00 is to be applied to the discharge of debts until all the remainder of the real estate be exhausted. She is not a tenant in common with the residuary devisees. She takes by superior right, and they can claim nothing until she is satisfied. This view of the case justifies the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
