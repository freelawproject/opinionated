Marshall, administrators of the estate of Thomas Sharp, deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-12\">The administrators, supposing the estate to be solvent, paid off many of the debts in full before the expiration of a year from the decedent\u2019s death, and supposed all were paid. After the expiration of a year, while the accounts were before an auditor, and after it was made out, but before it was filed, two new creditors, John Hertzel and James Smith, appeared with an aggregate amount of claims of about $700. Before their presentation the administrators had exhausted the estate by the payment of other claims in'full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-13\">After the auditor closed his report and had given notice to file exceptions, the counsel for administrators filed exceptions and demanded an issue before a jury as to several items, but mainly as to the two items of Hertzler and Smith. It is the refusal of the court to grant this issue which constitutes the principal ground of objection to its decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-14\"><em>D.

There is no law that we know of that requires the Orphans\u2019 Court to order an issue to try facts in the settlement of an administrator\u2019s account, and if there were it was too late to ask for it after the auditor had made out his report.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u2022Usually administrators have no interest in a question of distribution, and have no right to appeal for anything decided in that part of the process. In it the creditors and distributees are alone interested. We do not see that this case is exceptional, for the estate is insolvent. If the administrators have lost by the mismanagement of the estate, that gives them no right to appeal as against the claims of creditors who are let in for distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellan' nd records remitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
