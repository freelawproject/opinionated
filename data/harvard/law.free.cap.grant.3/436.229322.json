The prosecution has not been commenced in the State court. A warrant has been issued by a justice of the peace, and the defendants have been arrested preparatory to the commencement of a prosecution in the State court, but the attorney for the commonwealth has not sent a bill to the grand jury. We do not know, therefore, whether the commonwealth of Pennsylvania intends to prosecute the defendants for the alleged offence, or whether the grand jury will find a bill, without which the prosecution cannot be said to be \u201c commenced in the State court.\u201d The act conteinplates the removal of a prosecution \u201c pending\u201d that a \u201c trial\u201d may be had in the Circuit Court. If the attorney of the United States were required to send a bill of indictment before a grand jury of the United States cqjrt for a breach of the peace of the State, it would present a truly anomalous^-oceeding. Yet without it there would be no case to try in the Circuit Court. If a bill of indictment had been foun.d in the State court it would have presented such a case \u2014 but until this is done there is no case pending in the court of Bucks County, which can be removed to this court for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
