The whole of the annual income arising from the said personal estate constitutes a part, and the principal part, of the salary of the pastor of the said Presbyterian church in the township of Abington, and no part of the said income is appropriated to or used for any other purpose.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ATIa\">February 4,1858,</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">\u201c The whole of the said personal estate of said corporation has been assessed, returned and taxed for state and county purposes, as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">\u201c Eor state tax, sixty dollars <em>; for comity tax, </em>sixty dollars.

If of opinion that no part of it is taxable for either of said purposes, then judgment to be entered for the defendants. If of opinion that a part is taxable for either or both purposes, then judgment to be entered for such sum as the court may find the defendants are legally liable to pay, at the rate of thirty cents to the hun- \u25a0 dred dollars, for state purposes, and thirty cents to the hundred dollars for county purposes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-9\">The court, Smyzer J., entered judgment for plaintiff for the sum of $108 75, and this is the error complained of.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-10\"><em>G.

R. 51.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\">The opinion of the court was delivered</p>\n<author id=\"AIu\">by Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7r\">The plaintiffs in error contend that the personal property owned by them and invested in bonds and mortgages is not subject to taxation, because it is held in trust for religious purposes, and is therefore exempt under the first section of the act of April 22d, 1845. Whatever may be the true construetion of this section it is useless to inquire. A subsequent act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>passed April 14th, 1851, P. L. 625, enacts that <em>\u201c </em>All property, real or personal, belonging to any association or incorporated company which is now by law exempt from taxation, other than that which is in the actual use and occupation of such association or incorporated company, and from which an income or revenue is derived by the owners thereof, shall hereafter be subject to taxation in the same manner and for the same purposes as other property is now by law taxable, and so much of any law as is hereby altered and supplied be and the same is hereby repealed.\u201d Under this act the only property exempt from taxation is that real estate, notr exceeding five acres in actual use or occupation, which under previous tax laws had been relieved from liability to taxation. 12 Har. 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">It is assigned, as a further reason for holding that the personal property of the plaintiffs in error is not taxable, that the interest is applied to the payment of the salary of the minister of the congregation \u2014 that a tax upon it is a tax upon such salary, and we are referred to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuyler, 5 W. </em>&amp; S. 275. It might perhaps be sufficient to remark that that case was only a construction of the ninth section of the act of assembly of April 30th, 1841, which enacted that there should be assessed and collected a tax \u201c on all salaries and <em>emoluments </em>of office creat\u00e9d or,held by or under the constitution and laws of this commonwealth, and by or under any corporate institution or company incorporated by the said commonwealth,\u201d and the ruling of this court was that under that act of assembly the minister\u2019s salary was not taxable. It was held that the office of a minister was not one of the offices contemplated by the legislature, and therefore that the salary of such minister was not within the purview of the act. But the property of the plaintiffs in error is not any more the salary than is the land out of which a ground rent issues, the rent. The case cited has therefore no application to the question now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
