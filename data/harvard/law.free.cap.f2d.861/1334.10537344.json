Giardi-na been \u201ccommitted to a mental institution,\u201d as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), prior to his purchase of a pistol? Concluding that he had not been, we reverse the district court and vacate his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-21\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-22\">On May 14, 1984, Giardina was examined by Dr. Sank Nguyen, a staff psychiatrist at the New Orleans Mental Health Clinic. Perceiving an emergency, Dr. Nguyen signed a Physician\u2019s Emergency Certificate pursuant to which the police took Giardina to Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Upon arrival at \u201cBig Charity,\u201d Giardina was examined by Dr. Dennie E. Franklin, a deputy coroner of Orleans Parish, who executed a Coroner\u2019s Emergency Certificate. Giar-dina was detained at the hospital for treatment for two weeks, the maximum period permitted by Louisiana law under the two certificates. Giardina was then released. No further hospitalization or legal proceedings resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-23\">In March of 1987 Giardina purchased a .38 caliber derringer from Sea Star Pawn Shop in Harvey, Louisiana. In conjunction with this purchase Giardina signed the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Form 4473, declaring that he had never been committed to a mental institution. In July 1987, Giardina again purchased the same pistol from The Pawn Shop in Marrero, Louisiana. He again completed Form 4473, stating that he had never been committed to a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-24\">Giardina was indicted on two counts of making false statements to a federally-licensed firearms dealer, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(6), and two counts of receiving and possessing a firearm after having been committed to a mental institution, 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(4). The government dismissed the false statement counts and moved <em>in li-mine </em>for a judicial determination that Giar-dina had been committed to a mental institution. The district court granted the motion, ruling that Giardina had been so committed. Giardina then entered a conditional plea of guilty under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2), reserving his right to a review of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the <em>in limine </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">The sole issue is whether Giardina\u2019s involuntary hospitalization constituted a commitment to a mental institution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4). Giardina maintains that he was not committed and that Charity Hospital of New Orleans does not qualify as a mental institution. We find merit in the first contention; we do not reach the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">The criminal statute at issue, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(4), prescribes that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-7\">It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (4) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1419-13\">The statute does not define \u201ccommitted,\u201d and there is no dispositive jurisprudence. There are, however, analogous cases which focus on the meaning of conviction under \u00a7 922, and which reflect the dynamics of state and federal law interaction inherent in that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-14\">In <em>Dickerson v. New Banner Institute, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 111-12, 103 S.Ct. 986, 991, 74 L.Ed.2d 845 (1983), the Supreme Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-15\">Whether one has been \u201cconvicted\u201d within the language of the gun control statute is necessarily ... a question of federal, not state, law, despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvW6\">Similarly, whether Giardina was committed to a mental institution is a question of federal law, but in making that determination we may seek guidance from state law. Was Giardina committed under Louisiana law? If he was not, is that answer consistent with federal policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">An understanding of Louisiana\u2019s present Mental Health Law may best be achieved by reviewing its prior statutory scheme which provided for a \u201ccoroner\u2019s commitment.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prior statute, La.R.S. 28:52, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>repeatedly used the word \u201ccommitment.\u201d In applying the statute in <em>Burns v. Genovese, </em>211 So.2d 336, 337 (La.App.1968), <em>rev\u2019d, on other grounds, </em>254 La. 237, 223 So.2d 160 (1969), the court concluded that the detention did not constitute a commitment until the court formally acted. The intermediate appellate court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-4\">Under the provisions of LSA-R.S. 28:52 et seq., <em>the actual commitment of the subject person is under an order of the district judge </em>after the accomplishment of certain procedural requirement as detailed in the cited sections of the revised statutes. Even under the provisions of the coroner\u2019s commitment on order of the district court, the coroner is authorized to and may retain the patient by confining him in any state hospital or parish jail or private mental hospital for a period not to exceed thirty days or until <em>he is actually committed or ordered released by the district court </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">As revised and reenacted, the Louisiana Mental Health Law reflected the reasoning of the <em>Bums </em>court and conspicuously avoided use of the words \u201ccommitment\u201d and \u201ccommitted.\u201d In lieu thereof La.R.S. 28:53 uses the terms \u201cadmission\u201d and \u201cdetained.\u201d With one exception,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the amended statute reserves the use of the word commitment for R.S. 28:54 which details the procedure for the formal judicial commitment. The provision formerly entitled \u201cCoroner\u2019s Commitment\u201d is now entitled \u201cAdmission by Emergency Certificate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-6\">In its present form, R.S. 28:53 provides that \u201c[a] mentally ill person or a person suffering from substance abuse may be <em>admitted </em>and <em>detained </em>at a treatment facility for observation, diagnosis, and treatment for a period not to exceed fifteen days under an emergency certificate.\u201d La. R.S. 28:53(A)(1) (emphasis added). This emergency certificate may be issued by a physician, but only after an actual examination and a determination that the person is dangerous to himself or others. \u00a7 28:53(B). The examining physician is required to issue a physician\u2019s emergency certificate within 72 hours of the initial examination, detailing the objective findings that lead to the conclusion that detention is necessary. \u00a7 28:53(B)(2). For the physician\u2019s emergency certificate to be effective, it must demonstrate that \u201cthe person is unwilling or unable to seek voluntary admission.\u201d \u00a7 28:53(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">The physician\u2019s emergency certificate provides \u201clegal authority to transport a patient to a legal treatment facility and shall permit the director of such treatment facility to detain the patient....\u201d \u00a7 28:53(F). Within 72 hours of this initial admission, however, a second examination by the coroner is a \u201cnecessary precondition to the person\u2019s continued confinement.\u201d \u00a7 28:53(G)(2). A patient may be \u201cdetained at a treatment facility for observation, diagnosis, and treatment for a period not to exceed 15 days_\u201d \u00a7 28:53(A)(1). Patients confined by an emergency certificate may be subjected to \u201cmedication and treatment without their consent....\u201d \u00a7 28:53(K). It is significant to note that to extend this involuntary detention beyond 15 days there must be a judicial commitment pursuant to La.R.S. 28:54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-12\">A review of Louisiana\u2019s admission by emergency certificate procedure reflects its magnitude, but it also clearly reflects that this procedure does not constitute a commitment under Louisiana law. Therefore, unless this conclusion is inconsistent with federal policy, there has been no violation of \u00a7 922(g) by Giardina.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>This leads to an examination of relevant federal rubrics and policy. This being a criminal statute, we \u201cfollow the familiar rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed and give to \u2018[committed]\u2019 its narrow meaning....\u201d <em>Yates v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 310, 77 S.Ct. 1064, 1072, 1 L.Ed.2d 1356 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\">The congressional intent in enacting the federal gun control law was noted in <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 824, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1268-69, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974), wherein the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvD\">The principal purpose of the federal gun control legislation ... was to curb crime by keeping \u201cfirearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">We agree with our colleagues of the Eighth Circuit, however, that \u201c[tjhere is nothing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(h) [now \u00a7 922(g) ] which indicates an intent to prohibit the possession of firearms by persons who had been hospitalized for observation and examination, where they were found not to be mentally ill. The statute makes it clear that a commitment is required.\u201d <em>United States v. Hansel, </em>474 F.2d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">In <em>Hansel, </em>the court observed that the government was correct to concede on appeal that the defendant was not committed for purposes of \u00a7 922 inasmuch as there had been no commitment under state law. The <em>Hansel </em>court noted that \u201cthe scope of the Mental Health Board\u2019s order hospitalizing the defendant was limited to \u2018authorizing the superintendent of the hospital to receive and keep the person as a patient for a period of observation, not to exceed sixty days_\u201d <em>Hansel, </em>474 F.2d at 1123 (emphasis in original and citation omitted). The state statute did not characterize the involuntary detainment as a commitment, thus the court found no commitment for purposes of a \u00a7 922 violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">In <em>Dickerson </em>the Supreme Court at least indicated the need for a formal, unequivocal action of commitment. Temporary, emergency detentions for treatment of mental disorders or difficulties, which do not lead to formal commitments under state law, do not constitute the commitment envisioned by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. An essential element of that federal offense is either a formal adjudication that a person suffers a mental defect, or a formal commitment, which latter, in the instance of Louisiana, requires formal action by the state district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-10\">There being no judicial commitment in the case at bar, there is no violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. Accordingly, Giardina\u2019s conviction and sentence are VACATED and the indictment is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">.

Prior to its revision and reenactment, Louisiana\u2019s Mental Health Law provided for a coroner's commitment under R.S. 28:52 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-10\">Any near relative, or in the absence of relatives, a near friend, curator, or other responsible person shall apply to the coroner to have a patient <em>committed </em>to an institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-11\">The application shall be in writing on the form prescribed by the department and shall give the name, sex, and residence of the patient, the reason why institutional care is needed, and any other information the department deems necessary. It shall be accompanied by a certificate of the coroner and one other qualified physician stating that they have examined the patient within three days of the application and that he is in need of observation or care in an institution. The certificate shall state the facts and sources of information and personal observations upon which opinion is based. The coroner and the physician shall certify that they are not related by blood or marriage to the patient or to the applicant and that they are not connected, except in a professional capacity, with the institution to which the patient is to be <em>committed. </em>The examination of the patient shall be held at a place not likely to have a harmful effect upon his condition. After complying with the above provisions the application for <em>commitment </em>shall be presented to the judge of the judicial district court or the civil district court for the parish from which the patient is to be <em>committed, </em>for his approval or disapproval. The application for <em>commitment </em>can be acted upon by the judge in open court or in chambers, in term time or in vacation, without the necessity formally docketing and allotting said application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1419-18\">The superintendent may admit the patient to the institution within fourteen days of the examination by the coroner and the physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>After fourteen days the certificate of examination of the coroner and the physician is invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1420-8\">Any detentions, confinements of <em>commitments made by the coroner </em>under the above recited circumstances are hereby declared to be administrative acts attached to the functions of his office as required by law and for which acts he is specifically granted personal immunity, but not relieved of his official responsibility in his capacity as coroner (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1420-14\">. The one exception is the reference in R.S. 28:53 to the initial physician\u2019s emergency certificate as \"the first emergency commitment certificate,\u201d R.S. 28:53(G)(3).
