He was sentenced to a term of five years. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">I. Evidence of a Prior Felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">Title 18, section 922(g)(1) prohibits a person \u201cconvicted ... of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a period exceeding one year\u201d from possessing a firearm. Whether prior criminal proceedings resulted in a \u201cconviction\u201d depends on the law of the jurisdiction that conducted them. 18 U.S. C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). Here, in related arguments, Dancy contends that (1) the Government offered no evidence to explain the meaning of \u201cconviction\u201d under California law; and (2) the district court erred in admitting his California \u201cpen packet\u201d to evidence a prior conviction. The latter argument is addressed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">The Government offered Dancy\u2019s California pen (penitentiary) packet, a file prepared by the California Department of Corrections (CDC) that includes copies of a criminal judgment and Dancy\u2019s CDC fingerprint card. A CDC official certified the documents to be copies of originals in her legal custody; a judge certified that the official had legal custody of the documents. On appeal Dancy raises authentication and hearsay objections to the pen packet documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">Under Rule 902(4), Fed.R.Evid., a \u201ccopy of an official record or report ... or of a document authorized by law to be recorded or filed and actually recorded or filed in a public office\u201d is self-authenticating if certified by the legal custodian of the record. Fed.R.Evid. 902(4) (emphasis added). Dancy apparently does not dispute that the pen packet documents are copies of CDC \u201cofficial records\u201d; rather, he argues that there is \u201cno showing ... that the records were actually recorded or filed <em>in a public office.\u201d </em>This argument is meritless; Rule 902(4) does not contemplate that \u201cofficial records\u201d must be filed or recorded in a public office to be self-authenticating. See <em>United States v. Darveaux, </em>880 F.2d 124, 126 (8th Cir.1987) (Texas Department of Corrections records self-authenticating under Rule 902(4)); <em>United States v. Stone, </em>604 F.2d 922, 924-25 (5th Cir.1979) (Treasury Department disbursement record self-authenticating under Rule 902(4)). The pen packet documents, therefore, were properly authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-15\">Dancy additionally argues, however, that both the judgment and fingerprint card were inadmissible because neither fit within the public records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 802, 803(8). As to the judgment, Dancy\u2019s argument is irrelevant; evidence of a criminal judgment is independently admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 803(22). As to the fingerprint card, Dancy\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Cain, </em>615 F.2d 380, 381-82 (5th Cir.1980), is misplaced. <em>Cain </em>does not hold, as Dancy implies, that Rule 803(8)(B) bars admission of all law enforcement agency records. <em>See United States v. Quezada, </em>754 F.2d 1190, 1193-94 and n. 9 (5th Cir.1985). Rather, the rule excludes records that report the observation or investigation of crimes, not records that merely document routine, unambiguous factual matters. <em>Id. </em>at 1194. In this case, the fingerprint card, which contains Dancy\u2019s prints, physical description, sentence, and CDC reporting date, is unrelated to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>criminal investigation and admissible under Rule 803\u00cd8).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Dancy also contends that the record is silent as to what constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d under California law. This argument is based on his belief that the judgment introduced as part of the pen packet (1) is not \u201cfinal\u201d; and (2) fails to evidence that Dan-cy\u2019s sentence could exceed one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The March 15, 1977, judgment recites that in Case A555608 Dancy pleaded guilty to first degree robbery \u201cin violation of Section 211, Penal Code, a felony.\u201d It recites further that Dancy was to be \u201cpunished by imprisonment in the State Prison for Men for the term prescribed by law pursuant to Section 1168 P.C.\u201d Dancy assumes that the judgment is not final because it fixes no determinate sentence but instead orders \u201c[t]he Director of Department of Corrections ... to file a report within 120 days.\u201d This assumption is incorrect. Under then-applicable law, a trial court could order a defendant to prison, but it could not fix a definite term. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1168 (Deering 1977). A judgment was valid if it, like Dancy\u2019s, ordered imprisonment \u201cfor the term prescribed by law.\u201d <em>See People v. Bruce, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 854, 857, 297 P.2d 437 (1956). Section 1168 did permit the trial court, on the recommendation of the CDC Director, to recall its judgment <em>sua sponte </em>within 120 days and re-sentence the defendant. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1168; see also CaLPenal Code \u00a7 5079 (Deering 1977). This latter provision of \u00a7 1168 explains the report referred to in the Dancy judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Dancy\u2019s additional assertion that the judgment does not demonstrate that his prior conviction was punishable by more than a year in jail, although correct, is irrelevant. Dancy\u2019s CDC fingerprint card recites that he entered prison seven days after the date of judgment to begin serving a \u201c5-Life\u201d sentence for \u201cRobb 1st (211 PC)\u201d in Case \u201c#A-555608.\u201d The jury therefore had sufficient evidence that the offense carried a potential term in excess of one year.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">II. Jury Instructions on Voluntary Consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Although his precise contentions are unclear, Dancy argues that <em>Miranda </em>warnings should be required to validate in-custody consent searches. This Court disagrees. <em>United States v. D\u2019Allerman, </em>712 F.2d 100, 104 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 899, 104 S.Ct. 254, 78 L.Ed.2d 240 (1983); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>496 F.2d 670, 673-75 (5th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 960, 95 S.Ct. 1347, 43 L.Ed.2d 436 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">III. Jury Instructions on Knowledge Element.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">Title 18, \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful for a felon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">Section 922(g) is a consolidation of former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(d), 922(g), 922(h), and 1202 (18 U.S.C. App.). See Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 99-308, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00a7 102(6)(D), 100 Stat. 449, 452 (1986), and H.R.Rep. No. 99-495, 99 Cong., 2d Sess. 23, reprinted in 1986 U.S.Code Cong, and Ad. News 1327, 1349. Like the provisions it supersedes, \u00a7 922(g) contains no element of <em>mens rea. </em>Courts instead interpreted its predecessors to require for conviction proof that the defendant knowingly received, transported, or possessed a firearm; the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the weapon\u2019s interstate nexus or of his felon status was irrelevant. <em>E.g., United States v. Schmitt, </em>748 F.2d 249, 252 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1104, 105 S.Ct. 2333, 85 L.Ed.2d 850 (1985); <em>United States v. Thrasher, </em>569 F.2d 894, 895 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 840, 99 S.Ct. 128, 58 L.Ed. 2d 137 (1978); <em>United States v. Goodie, </em>524 F.2d 515, 517-18 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 905, 96 S.Ct. 1497, 47 L.Ed.2d 755 (1976); <em>United States v. Lupino, </em>480 F.2d 720, 723-24 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 924, 94 S.Ct. 257, 38 L.Ed. 2d 159 (1973). Following this settled law, the district court instructed the jury that it should convict Dancy if it found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\">[ 1] That [he] was convicted of a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">[ 2] That thereafter he <em>knowingly </em>received or possessed or transported a firearm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">[ 3] That his receipt or possession or transportation of the firearm was in or affecting commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">However, when Congress amended \u00a7 922 in 1986, it also amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924, the penalty provision applicable to \u00a7 922. See Firearms Owners\u2019 Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 99-308, \u00a7 104, 100 Stat. 449, 456 (1986). Unlike pre-1986 law, amended \u00a7 924 expressly provides that whoever \u201cknowingly\u201d violates \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a fine and imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(1)(B). On appeal Dancy first argues, citing <em>Liparota v. United States, </em>471 U.S. 419, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985), that, because of the amendment to \u00a7 924, a conviction under \u00a7 922(g) now requires proof that the defendant knew not only that he possessed a firearm but that it had an interstate nexus and that he was a felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In <em>Liparota </em>the Supreme Court addressed the mental state necessary to violate 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2204(b)(1), which provides that \u201cwhoever <em>knowingly </em>uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses [food stamps] or authorization cards <em>in any manner not authorized </em>by [the Food Stamp Act] or the regulations issued pursuant to the [Act]\u201d is subject to a fine and imprisonment. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2024(b)(1) (emphasis added). In holding that \u00a7 2024(b)(1) requires proof that the defendant specifically knew that his conduct was unauthorized, the Court reasoned that \u201c[a]bsent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative history of the statute,\u201d it must interpret the ambiguous statute in favor of lenity. 471 U.S. at 423-27, 105 S.Ct. at 2086-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">Rather than being helpful to Dancy, <em>Li-parota </em>forecloses the result he argues for in this case. It is clear from the legislative history of amended \u00a7 924(a)(1)(B) that Congress intended to incorporate former law when it expressly introduced the knowledge element. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-495, 99 Cong., 2d Sess. 25-26, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.Code Cong, and Ad.News 1327, 1351-52 (\u201cCase law interpreting the criminal provisions of the Gun Control Act have required that the government prove that the defendant\u2019s conduct was knowing, but not that the defendant knew that his conduct was in violation of law_It is the Committee\u2019s intent, that unless otherwise specified, the knowing state of mind shall apply to circumstances and results.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, because the legislative history of amended \u00a7 924(a)(1)(B) resolves any ambiguity in its text, the rule of lenity held controlling in <em>Liparota </em>has no application here. Accordingly, the district court correctly instructed on the knowledge element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of \u00a7 922(g). Dancy\u2019s first objection to the court\u2019s charge is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In his second attack on the district court\u2019s charge, Dancy contends that it was error to instruct that ignorance of \u00a7 922(g) did not excuse its violation. The court charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">The crime charged in the indictment does not require proof that the Defendant knew he was violating the law. Ignorance of the law is not a defense to the violations alleged in the indictment. What is required before the defendant can be convicted of this violation is proof that the Defendant knowingly received, transported or possessed the firearm as alleged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In Dancy\u2019s view this instruction \u201ccreated a conclusive presumption and amounted to a comment on the weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Dancy\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Golitschek, </em>808 F.2d 195, 203 (2d Cir.1986), is misplaced. In <em>Golitschek, </em>the Second Circuit held that it was error to give a similar instruction in a prosecution for conspiracy and wire fraud, both specific intent crimes when tied to the export of American arms without proper government documentation. <em>Id. </em>at 201-03. The court noted that under the government\u2019s theory of the case, knowledge of a legal obligation was an element of both offenses; therefore, it was \u201ctotally incorrect to say that ignorance of such law is no excuse or that everyone is presumed to know such law. Establishing an element of an offense concerning a requisite state of mind by a presumption relieves the prosecution of its burden of proof, contrary to the requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. Unlike the crimes charged in <em>Golitschek, </em>however, knowledge of a legal obligation is not an element of \u00a7 922(g). See H.R.Rep. No. 99-495, 99 Cong., 2d Sess. 26, <em>reprinted </em>in 1986 U.S. Code Cong, and Ad.News 1327, 1352 (rejecting Senate proposal that in \u00a7 922 eases the government be required to prove that defendant knew that his conduct was in violation of law). <em>Golitschek </em>is thus inap-posite.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">IV. Extraneous Offense Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Along with the shotgun, officers found six Darvon capsules in Dancy\u2019s trunk; Dancy consequently was charged under Texas law with possession of a controlled substance. Before trial he filed a motion in limine asking that extraneous offense evidence not be elicited without a prior non-jury hearing to determine its relevancy. The court granted the motion. At trial, however, the Government, without the court\u2019s approval and over Dancy\u2019s objection, elicited testimony that a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d was found in the trunk. The court denied Dancy\u2019s motion for a mistrial and refused his request for a curative instruction. On appeal Dancy argues that the court should have sustained his objection to the \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d testimony or granted a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The Government makes a strained argument that the \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d found in the trunk was inextricably intertwined with Dancy\u2019s shotgun and was therefore admissible. The trial court, having granted Dancy\u2019s motion in limine, would seem to disagree. We need not pass on the issue of admissibility, however, because the error, if any, in admitting two perfunctory testimonial references to a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d was harmless. The jury members were not asked to focus on this evidence in closing argument, and the court instructed them to consider only the specific offense alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-6\">. Dancy also asserts that the judgment is \"unreliable.\u201d Citing <em>Mullican v. United States, </em>252 F.2d 398 (5th Cir.1958), he argues that the only reliable record of his prior conviction is the original state court judgment, which he assumes is in the court files. We reject this contention. First, if the judgment is self-authenticating, it logically cannot be \"unreliable.\u201d Second, Dancy presupposes that there is but one original and that it is in the court files. In fact, four carbons of the judgment were made, and at least three were circulated to state agencies. All are \"originals.\u201d See Fed.R.Evid. 1001(3) and Notes of Advisory Committee on Proposed Rules. In this case the CDC records custodian certified that she had originals of the documents submitted; nothing in the records suggests that she did not. This latter fact distinguishes <em>Mullican: </em>there, the Bureau of Prisons official who certified the challenged exhibits did not have custody over the originals, and he failed to certify that the copies he possessed were themselves official records or otherwise true copies of the originals. <em>Mullican, </em>252 F.2d at 401-02.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b178-15\">.

House Report No. 99-945 accompanied the original version of H.R. 4332, the text of which can be found at 132 Cong.Rec. H1672-74 (daily ed. April 9, 1986). Although this first draft of H.R. 4332 varies significantly from the adopted version, <em>compare </em>132 Cong.Rec. H1753-57 (daily ed. April 10, 1986), the pertinent sections of each are analogous. <em>Compare </em>original H.R. 4332, \u00a7 8(2), 132 Cong.R. H1673 (daily ed. April 9, 1986), with final H.R. 4332, \u00a7 104(a)(1)(B), 132 Cong.Rec. H1756 (daily ed. April 10, 1986). The analysis of original H.R. 4332 contained in H.R.Rep. 99-945 is therefore instructive in interpreting amended \u00a7 924.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
