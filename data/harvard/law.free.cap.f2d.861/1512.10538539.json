McClendon is entitled to benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-945. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-19\">T.J. McClendon, respondent\u2019s deceased husband, worked for Drummond Coal for seventeen years. He spent seven of those years working in underground mines, and the remainder working above ground. After experiencing two to three years of respiratory difficulty, Mr. McClendon died on November 15, 1980. His death certificate listed the cause of death as \u201cprobable myocardial infarction.\u201d The autopsy physician reported findings of anthracosis, fibrosis, central lobular emphysema, and moderate hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-20\">Mrs. McClendon filed a claim with the Department of Labor seeking black lung benefits on December 18, 1980. Her claim was awarded on June 26, 1981. Upon Drummond\u2019s appeal of the award, an Administrative Law Judge conducted a hearing on July 24, 1985, and found that Mrs. McClendon was entitled to benefits. Drummond appealed to the Board, which affirmed the decision of the AU on March 6, 1986. Drummond now appeals the Board\u2019s decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-21\">Our review of the Board\u2019s determination is limited to the question of whether it erred in upholding the ALJ\u2019s decision. The Board is required to uphold the AU\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3); <em>Stomps v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Pro</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number><em>grams, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>816 F.2d 1533, 1534 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">Drummond first challenges the AU\u2019s finding that McClendon had pneumoconiosis. The Act defines pneumoconiosis as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory and pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment.\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(b). The Code of Federal Regulations provides further elaboration of the Act\u2019s definition of pneumoconiosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-5\">[The Act\u2019s definition of pneumoconiosis] includes, but is not limited to, coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, anthracosilicosis, anthracosis, anthrosilicosis, massive pulmonary fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis, silicosis or silicotuberculosis, arising out of coal mine employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1598-6\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. The AU\u2019s determination was based in part on McClendon\u2019s autopsy report which indicated findings of nodules of anthracosis and fibrosis. These findings clearly constitute substantial evidence and are alone sufficient to support the AU\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-7\">The AU also relied on the opinion of McClendon\u2019s treating physician that McClendon\u2019s respiratory problems were caused in part by pneumoconiosis. Under the Act, the AU may determine the existence of pneumoconiosis by relying on the finding of a physician, who in exercising sound medical judgment, makes the finding based on \u201cobjective medical evidence such as blood-gas studies, electrocardiograms, pulmonary function studies, physical performance tests, physical examination, and medical and work histories\u201d that the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). Dr. Brasfield, McClendon\u2019s physician, relied on qualifying blood-gas studies in concluding that McClendon had black lung. The AU was entitled to accord greater significance to Dr. Bras-field\u2019s opinion, as the miner\u2019s examining physician, than to that of Dr. Hamilton, who only reviewed McClendon\u2019s records after his death. \u201cAn unequivocal diagnosis by an examining physician familiar with the claimant\u2019s medical history is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>Hamrick v. Schweiker, </em>679 F.2d 1078, 1082 (4th Cir.1982). <em>See also Smith v. Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>843 F.2d 1053, 1057 (7th Cir.1988); <em>Caraway v. Califano, </em>623 F.2d 7, 11 (6th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-9\">Drummond next contends that the AU erred in finding that McClendon\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. section 718.303. That section entitles a claimant to a rebut-table presumption that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis when he was employed in the mines for ten or more years and died of a respirable disease. \u00a7 718.303(a). The section further provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1598-10\">[ u]nder this presumption, death shall be due to a respirable disease in any case in which the evidence establishes that death was due to multiple causes, including a respirable disease, and it is not medically feasible to distinguish which disease caused death or the extent to which the respirable disease contributed to the cause of death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1598-11\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.303(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-12\">Drummond argues that the cause of death indicated on the death certificate is sufficiently unambiguous and that therefore the AU\u2019s invocation of the presumption was erroneous. This assertion ignores the autopsy findings as well as the fact that McClendon had been treated for respiratory problems for several months before his death. We therefore find that the presumption was properly invoked, and that the cause of death recorded on the death certificate is insufficient to rebut the presumption. <em>See Smith, </em>843 F.2d at 1057 n. 8 (\u201cThe fact that the term \u2018pneumoconiosis\u2019 is not mentioned in the death certificate is ... of little import. A death certificate records only information about the immediate cause of death.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-13\">Drummond\u2019s final contention is that McClendon\u2019s alleged pneumoconiosis was unrelated to his coal mine employment. The Act, however, provides for a rebuttable presumption that the miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis arose from such employment if he worked for ten or more years in the coal mines. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.203(b). Because McClendon worked for seventeen years in the mines, the AU did not err in invoking this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>The only evidence Drummond offered to rebut the presumption was Dr. Hamilton\u2019s opinion that McClendon\u2019s respiratory condition was not the result of exposure to coal dust, but rather was due to his history of cigarette smoking. The regulations state clearly that the claimant only need demonstrate that the miner\u2019s condition arose \u201cat least in part\u201d from coal mine employment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.203(a). Both Dr. Bras-field\u2019s report and the autopsy results establish a relationship between McClendon\u2019s condition and his employment in the mines. His history of tobacco use does not affect this relationship. <em>See Stomps, </em>816 F.2d at 1536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-4\">We have reviewed the record and conclude that Mrs. McClendon has offered sufficient evidence to demonstrate that her husband suffered from pneumoconiosis as a result of his coal mine employment. The AU\u2019s determination is therefore supported by substantial evidence, and accordingly we affirm the Board\u2019s decision upholding his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
