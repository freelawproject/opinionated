We agree with the reasoning of its opinion, however; and its findings of fact are not shown to be clearly erroneous \u2014 a demonstration not attempted by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\"><em>Drachenberg v. Canal Barge Co., Inc., </em>571 F.2d 912 (5th Cir.1978), does not support appellant\u2019s contention that a mooring cleat which was part of another\u2019s dock should be considered part of ROMANDA SUE, where these were connected by a line only. The marine arm in <em>Drachenberg </em>was firmly affixed to the vessel to such a degree as to have become an integral part of it, and was under common ownership with the vessel. Indeed, <em>Drachenberg </em>itself cites <em>Davis v. W. Bruns &amp; Co., </em>476 F.2d 246 (5th Cir.1973), holding that a connection by guy wires was insufficient for such purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
