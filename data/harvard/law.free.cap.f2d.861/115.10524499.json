SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The Orleans Parish School Board (\u201cSchool Board\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Duane M., incurred in his successful efforts to pursue administrative remedies with the School Board under the Education of the Handicapped Act. The School Board charges that, because this suit was brought solely for the purpose of obtaining attorneys\u2019 fees, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that hence Duane\u2019s suit fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Agreeing with the district court that the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act mandates an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, and authorizes a separate suit to be brought for these fees when they are incurred in the successful pursuit of administrative remedies, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">I. <em>Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">In the spring of 1985, the School Board evaluated Duane as an autistic child. The School Board\u2019s evaluating team recommended that Duane receive twenty-four-hour supervision, because the great discrepancy between his physical development and low level of functioning made him a danger to himself and others. During the summer of 1985, the School Board held an Individualized Education Program (\u201cIEP\u201d) meeting, attended by school officials, evaluation team members, and Duane\u2019s parents. The result of the meeting was a decision to place Duane in a special residential school within the next thirty days. However, while Duane attended special summer programs, school officials delayed his placement into a residential school; the School Board had not yet placed Duane even as the new 1985-86 school year began.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">In October 1985, Duane\u2019s parents requested a due process hearing pursuant to the provisions of the Education of the Handicapped Act. Prior to that hearing, an additional IEP conference was held in which several school officials disputed Duane\u2019s earlier classification as an autistic child. They concluded Duane\u2019s needs would be better served if he were placed in a program for non-aggressive, emotionally disturbed children in Southeast Louisiana State Hospital. After initially refusing to admit Duane into their program because of his autism, the Hospital capitulated to the School Board\u2019s requests and notified Duane\u2019s parents on October 22, 1985, that it would admit Duane.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">Duane\u2019s parents disagreed with the School Board\u2019s reappraisal of Duane\u2019s needs and went forward with the due process hearing. When the hearing commenced on October 24, 1985, the School Board argued that Duane\u2019s classification as autistic was in error, and that he should be placed in a class for emotionally disturbed children. Duane\u2019s parents, represented by an attorney from the Advocacy Center for the Elderly and Disabled, argued that Duane properly had been classified as autistic and that the program offered at Southeast Louisiana State Hospital was inappropriate for his needs. In addition, the parents contended that the original recommendation for Duane was best; he would do better in a residential program for high-functioning autistic children.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">On February 20, 1986, the hearing officer issued his decision accepting Duane\u2019s parents\u2019 contentions regarding Duane\u2019s status. Nevertheless, the officer concluded that placement in the Hospital\u2019s program would serve Duane\u2019s needs adequately. Duane\u2019s parents appealed the placement decision to the state-level review panel. That panel overruled the hearing officer\u2019s placement decision and held that Duane should be placed in a residential program for autistic children.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">In September 1986, the parties signed a settlement agreement. The School Board agreed to place Duane in a Jefferson Parish class for high-functioning autistic children. The settlement was silent with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees. Duane\u2019s parents then filed the instant suit, seeking only attorneys\u2019 fees as provided under the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>II. <em>The Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">The Education of the Handicapped Act (\u201cEHA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> guarantees to all handicapped children a free, appropriate public education. In <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), the Court held that the EHA was the exclusive statutory remedy for deprivations of educational rights which that act creates. The Court further held that because the statute contained no provision for attorneys\u2019 fees, fees were not available in suits brought to enforce those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Congress disapproved of the decision in <em>Smith v. Robinson </em>and acted \u201cswiftly, decisively, and with uncharacteristic clarity to correct what it viewed as a judicial misinterpretation of its intent.\u201d <em>Fontenot v. Louisiana Bd. of Elementary &amp; Secondary Educ., </em>805 F.2d 1222, 1223 (5th Cir.1986). Congress amended the EHA through the Handicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (codified in scattered sections at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq.) (1982 &amp; Supp. 1988) (\u201cHCPA\u201d), whose application Congress made retroactive to the day before the Court announced its decision in <em>Smith v. Robinson. See </em>Pub.L. No. 99-372, \u00a7 5. The HCPA, adding \u00a7 1415(e)(4)(B), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">In any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs to the parents or guardian of a handicapped child or youth who is the prevailing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The School Board contends that the phrase \u201caction or proceeding\u201d refers only to suits in the district court to enforce the provisions of the EHA. Under this reading of the HCPA, attorneys\u2019 fees would be available only when one party has brought suit after losing at the administrative level. No fees would be available to parents who, like Duane\u2019s parents, prevailed at the administrative level and therefore have nothing to appeal. Absent a continuing dispute between the parties, the parents of a child who prevailed at the due process hearings then could not bring a separate suit for fees in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Duane\u2019s parents contend that the HCPA\u2019s legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to allow separate suits for attorneys\u2019 fees. They contend that the School Board\u2019s interpretation of the Act would thwart Congress\u2019 intent. They cite ten recent district court opinions considering the question, all but one having decided that parents may bring a separate suit for attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">The district court decided this question of first impression in our circuit in favor of Duane\u2019s parents. The court granted summary judgment, holding that the EHA authorizes a separate action solely for attorneys\u2019 fees and that Duane was the prevailing party below.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">We review de novo the summary judgment in favor of Duane\u2019s parents. The School Board admits that Duane is properly characterized as a prevailing party and hence, the disposition of this summary judgment ruling turns solely on questions of law concerning the proper interpretation of the HCPA\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">III. <em>Interpreting the HCPA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">The School Board contends that because the language of section 1415(e)(4)(B) is unambiguous, and because it appears in a section entitled \u201cCivil action; jurisdiction; attorney fees,\u201d we need not look to the legislative history of the HCPA in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>decide that a separate action for attorneys\u2019 fees alone cannot be brought by a prevailing party. <em>See Caminetti v. United States, </em>242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917); <em>Johnson v. Department of the Treasury, I.R.S., </em>700 F.2d 971, 974 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The School Board\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. The HCPA does not expressly confer upon prevailing parties at the administrative level a right to bring a separate action solely in order to recover attorneys\u2019 fees, nor does it forbid such an action. The statute is simply silent on the question which we address here. In such cases, we must turn to the legislative history-</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The School Board also argues that we should give the phrase \u201caction or proceeding\u201d an interpretation consistent with other interpretations of the same phrase in other statutes. Specifically, the School Board contends that the language of section 1415(e)(4)(B) of the HCPA is similar to that of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Section 1988 provides that in \u201cany action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title ... or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d the district court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party. In a recent case, <em>North Carolina Dept. of Pub. Transp. v. Crest Street Community Council, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 6, 107 S.Ct. 336, 93 L.Ed.2d 188 (1986), the Court held that no separate federal action could be brought to recover attorneys\u2019 fees under section 1988. The Court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">The plain language of section 1988 suggests the answer to the question whether attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded in an independent action which is not to enforce any of the civil rights laws listed in section 1988. The section states that <em>in the action or proceeding to enforce </em>the civil rights laws listed ... <em>the court </em>may award attorney\u2019s fees. The case before us is not, and was never, an action to enforce any of these laws. On its face, section 1988 does not authorize a court to award attorney\u2019s fees except in an action to enforce the listed civil rights laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARK_\">479 U.S. at 12,107 S.Ct. at 340 (emphasis in original). Relying on this language, the School Board contends that because Duane\u2019s parents did not bring an action to enforce any of the educational rights which the EHA creates, the district court lacks authority to adjudicate their separate suit for fees alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">However, <em>Crest Street </em>is distinguishable on several grounds. First, the respondent, the Crest Street Community Council, sought attorneys\u2019 fees for legal work performed in administrative proceedings unconnected with the suit that was the basis of its appeal. In its administrative action, the Community Council had brought a civil rights complaint against the North Carolina Department of Transportation, alleging that the Department\u2019s plans for an expressway unfairly placed the burden of displacement upon a predominantly black neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">However, the litigation underlying the Council\u2019s appeal in <em>Crest Street </em>involved a separate action for injunctive relief brought against the Department of Transportation for violations of environmental protection statutes, statutes not within the sphere of section 1988. The Community Council had attempted to intervene in that action and also file a separate title VI complaint. Before the district court ruled on the intervention motion and complaint, however, it dismissed the entire suit on the condition that the Department of Transportation adhere to a proposed settlement involving all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The instant suit is much simpler. Here, Duane\u2019s parents premise their claim for fees on the administrative victory they achieved below. Accordingly, they seek fees for legal representation undertaken in the mandatory administrative proceedings held in connection with their son\u2019s educational evaluation. The instant suit involves no \u201ccollateral\u201d attempts to gain a fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Second, the Court in <em>Crest Street </em>examined the language and legislative history of section 1988 and found it different from that of other statutes, most notably the attorneys\u2019 fee provision of title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). It stated, \u201cWe recognize that dicta in opinions of this Court suggest that authorization of attorney\u2019s fee awards only by a court in an action to enforce the listed civil rights laws would be anomalous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13, 107 S.Ct. at 341 (citing <em>New York Gas Light Club, Inc. v. Carey, </em>447 U.S. 54, 65-66, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 2031-2032, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980) (mandatory state employment discrimination proceedings are proceedings to enforce title VII)). Despite the anomaly, the Court held that section 1988\u2019s language and legislative history dictated the result it reached. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>citation to <em>Carey </em>refers to dictum in that opinion that provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">It would be anomalous to award fees to the complainant who is unsuccessful or only partially successful in obtaining state or local remedies, but to deny an award to the complainant who is successful in fulfilling Congress\u2019 plan that federal policies be vindicated at the state or local level. Since it is clear that Congress intended to authorize fee awards for work done in administrative proceedings, we must conclude that \u00a7 706(f)(l)\u2019s authorization of a civil suit in federal court authorizes a suit solely to obtain an award of attorney\u2019s fees for legal work done in state and local proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acs\"><em>Carey, </em>447 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2032.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The instant suit is much more akin to the situation in <em>Carey </em>than to that in <em>Crest Street. </em>Section 1415 itself, unlike section 1988, does not refer only to <em>suits </em>brought to enforce EHA created rights. It also refers to potential restrictions on attorney fee awards for work done in <em>administrative proceedings. </em>Section 1415(e)(4)(D) precludes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in an \u201caction or proceeding\u201d when, in the case of an <em>administrative proceeding, </em>the local educational authority made an offer of settlement, more favorable than the final ruling, within ten days of that proceeding\u2019s commencement. <em>See Kristi W. v. Graham Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>663 F.Supp. at 88 (relying upon the language of section 1415(e)(4)(D) to hold that the phrase \u201caction or proceeding\u201d denotes administrative hearings as well as lawsuits).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The legislative history of section 1415 also evinces Congress\u2019 intent to provide attorneys\u2019 fees for parents who are successful at the mandatory administrative hearing. For example, the Report of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources on S. 415, the bill that eventually became the HCPA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">The committee also intends that [the fee provisions] should be interpreted consistent with fee provisions of statutes such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which authorizes courts to award fees for time spent by counsel in mandatory administrative proceedings under those statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">S.Rep. No. 99-112, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess. 14, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1798, 1804. The committee cited <em>Carey </em>and also expressed its intent that a court, rather than a hearing officer, award fees for time spent in mandatory EHA administrative proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">In addition, the report of the House of Representatives Committee on Labor on H.R. 1523, the House version of the HCPA, expresses an intent to allow parents to bring a separate suit for attorneys\u2019 fees alone. The report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">[ I]f a parent prevails on the merits ... at an administrative proceeding (and the agency does not appeal the decision), the parent may be awarded reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses incurred in such administrative proceeding. Usually, the amount of such fees, costs, and expenses will be agreed to by the public agency. If no agreement is possible, the parent may file a law suit for the limited purpose of receiving an award of reasonable fees, costs, and expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_h\">H.R.Rep. No. 99-296, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Members of both houses of Congress expressed similar reasons for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees for legal representation at the administrative level. At the floor debates during the Senate\u2019s deliberation on S. 415, Senator Simon succinctly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-14\">The mandated proceedings are quasi-judicial, and intimidating to many parents. School districts often employ attorneys to consult and prepare and/or present the district\u2019s position in due process hearings. The parent\u2019s tax dollars are helping to pay for that attorney and for any witnesses the school district may call in opposition to the parent. For even the most well-educated and most self-confident parent, representing oneself on a matter as vital as the education of one\u2019s child, and having to be examined and cross-examine witnesses, is an overwhelming prospect. When a parent is poor, of a minority group, or not well-versed in the intricacies of the law and regulations, the inequities of the situation are greatly increased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">131 Cong.Rec. S10,400-01 (daily ed. July 30, 1985). <em>See also </em>similar remarks made by Rep. Biaggi, 131 Cong.Rec. H9969 (daily ed. Nov. 12, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">Finally, the legislative history of the HCPA also indicates that the conference committee rejected a \u201csunset provision\u201d on awards of attorneys\u2019 fees for work done at the administrative level. <em>See Joint Explanatory Statement of the Conference Committee, </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-687, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 7, <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1798, 1807, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>1809. That provision would have ended such awards four years after Congress enacted the legislation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">IY. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We hold that the attorneys\u2019 fee provisions of the HCPA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(4), are sufficiently different from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 in both language and legislative history that the dictum in <em>Carey, </em>rather than the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Crest Street, </em>controls the case before us. In so holding, we are in accord with the Sixth Circuit\u2019s thorough opinion in <em>Eggers v. Bullitt County Sch. Dist., </em>854 F.2d 892, 894-98 (6th Cir.1988). The legislative history of section 1415(e)(4) reflects Congress\u2019 unequivocal intent to award attorneys\u2019 fees to parents for legal representation at due process hearings which the EHA requires. To hold that prevailing parties in these hearings cannot bring a separate suit for attorneys\u2019 fees would defeat that intent as well as ignore Congress\u2019 obvious preference that the parties resolve these disputes outside the courtroom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The district court\u2019s ruling is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">.

The School Board also contends that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees is unjust because special circumstances obtain in this case. Specifically, the School Board complains that at the time it approved the settlement it had negotiated with Duane\u2019s parents, <em>Smith v. Robinson </em>controlled, and attorneys\u2019 fees were not an issue. However, the School Board fails to demonstrate that the settlement somehow would have been different had it been aware of its potential liability for attorneys\u2019 fees. The settlement was non-monetary; it concerned the type of educational program in which Duane would participate. A showing of only speculative harm, or a potential effect on negotiating strategy, will not suffice to make an award of attorneys\u2019 fees unjust.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">On Rehearing</p>\n<author id=\"A9U\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The successful plaintiff-appellee has filed, out of time, a \u201cMotion To Extend the Time Period for Petitioning for Rehearing.\u201d In the motion, the plaintiff calls our attention to the fact that our opinion was silent as to the plaintiff\u2019s prayer for attorneys\u2019 fees for time spent litigating this action before this court.

Accordingly, we treat the plaintiff's motion as a motion for leave to file out-of-time petition for rehearing and as a petition for rehearing on the question of attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal. We grant the motion and the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The successful plaintiff here is entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for defending, in this court, the judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees obtained in the district court. <em>See Fontenot v.

In his brief on appeal, the plaintiff requested $100 for 33 hours\u2019 work, for a total of $3,300 in attorneys\u2019 fees. We find 33 hours to be a reasonable expenditure of effort for litigating, on appeal, this question of first impression in this court. However, in the district court, the parties stipulated, and the district court agreed, that $90 per hour was a reasonable fee for litigating the issue in that court. We find that rate to be reasonable in this court as well and award it instead of the requested rate of $100. Consequently, the plaintiff shall recover, in addition to the usual taxable cost, attorneys\u2019 fees for 33 hours at $90, or $2,970.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">In all other respects, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
