Carter,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from the trial\n   court's judgment of strict foreclosure rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC. On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the foreclosure action due to the plaintiff's failure to comply with a standing order of the Superior Court, (2) improperly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to liability, (3) improperly determined that the defendants' special defenses were legally insufficient, and (4) improperly denied Carter's petition to participate in the foreclosure mediation program. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On August 13, 2004, Park City, through its manager, Carter, executed a promissory note, pursuant to which it promised to pay to the order of InterBay Funding, LLC (InterBay), the principal sum of $390,000. The note was secured by a mortgage on 1382-1386 Park Avenue in Bridgeport in favor of InterBay. There are four units in the building located on the property: a four bedroom residential apartment and three commercial storefronts. Carter, in his individual capacity, executed a guarantee agreement for the note in favor of InterBay. Thereafter, InterBay assigned the mortgage on the subject property, and endorsed the note, to the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beginning on December 1, 2012, and every month thereafter, Park City failed to make monthly payments due pursuant to the note. As a result, the plaintiff commenced this foreclosure action in November, 2013. The defendants filed an answer in April, 2014. On January 21, 2015, the plaintiff filed the operative revised complaint seeking foreclosure of the mortgage on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 24, 2015, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment as to liability only. Subsequently, on April 15, 2015, the defendants filed an amended answer and special defenses, alleging, inter alia, that the plaintiff had (1) failed to credit the defendants' payments properly, (2) submitted an inaccurate affidavit regarding the defendants' eligibility for federal loss mitigation programs (federal loss affidavit), and (3) violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   that same day, the defendants filed an objection to the motion for summary judgment and an accompanying memorandum of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In their memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment, the defendants challenged whether the plaintiff had standing to bring this action. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff had failed to establish the chain of endorsements of the note that was made payable to the original lender, InterBay. In support of their opposition, the defendants submitted Carter's affidavit that essentially recited the allegations in their special defenses, but they did not submit any documentary evidence to support the conclusory statements in Carter's affidavit. The affidavit also stated that the subject property is Carter's principal residence, which the plaintiff, in its federal loss affidavit, had denied. Following a hearing on April 20, 2015, the plaintiff filed a supplemental affidavit and accompanying exhibits establishing the chain of endorsements for the note. In their supplemental memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment, the defendants asserted various\n   issues with regard to the plaintiff's supplemental affidavit and accompanying exhibits, but they did not submit any counteraffidavits or accompanying documentation in support of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Alfred J. Jennings, Jr.\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted the motion for summary judgment. In its order, the court concluded that the plaintiff had established a prima facie case for its foreclosure action. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiff's affidavit and accompanying exhibits established that the plaintiff was the owner of the note and mortgage at the time that the action was commenced, that Park City had defaulted on the note beginning on December 1, 2012, and that the plaintiff had sent the required notice of default before commencing the foreclosure action. The court further concluded that the defendants failed to establish that there were any issues of material fact concerning their special defenses. Although the court determined that there was an issue of fact as to the accuracy of the plaintiff's federal loss affidavit because the affidavit provided that the subject property is not \"owner-occupied,\" the court concluded that the plaintiff could correct this error prior to obtaining a judgment of strict foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the court's order granting the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff filed a new federal loss affidavit on September 30, 2015. On October 28, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, which the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Richard P. Gilardi\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, granted on November 16, 2015. The court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure with the law days commencing on March 15, 2016. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendants claim that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's foreclosure action due to the plaintiff's alleged failure to comply with the standing order of the Superior Court that required that the plaintiff file a fully executed copy of the Judicial Branch form entitled \"AFFIDAVIT Federal Loss Mitigation Programs,\" form JD-CL-114, with its foreclosure complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See Mortgage Foreclosure Standing Order Federal Loss Mitigation Programs, form JD-CV-117.

Our resolution of the defendants' claim does not require us to consider whether the plaintiff's federal loss affidavit was accurate because, even assuming that the plaintiff's federal loss affidavit did not comply with the standing order of the Superior Court, the defendants' jurisdictional claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the standing order specifically provides that if the plaintiff fails to comply with the order, \"a motion for default or motion for judgment filed by the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   not be granted until the affidavit is filed\n   <em>\n    or upon order of the court\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)

The plaintiff, therefore, established its prima facie case. Accordingly, the defendants then were required to present evidence that demonstrated the existence of some disputed factual issue. We conclude, as did the trial court, that the defendants failed to meet their burden. We address each of the defendants' claims seriatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, the defendants' claim that there are factual issues concerning the plaintiff's misapplication of payments is unsupported by the record. The defendants failed to produce competent evidence that would support their vague allegation in Carter's affidavit that \"the plaintiff has miscalculated and overcharged me escrow amounts which were too high and which were paid by the defendant borrowers thereby preventing them from making the proper lower payments under this loan which would have prevented default on the part of the defendants ....\" In particular, the defendants did not submit documentary\n   evidence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   payments, nor did they specify how the \"proper lower payments\" should have been calculated. As a result, the defendants failed to demonstrate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact with regard to the miscalculation and/ or misapplication of payments by the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the defendants' claim that there are factual issues concerning when Park City defaulted on the loan and whether the plaintiff's notice of default was proper is also unsupported by the record. The defendants claim\n   that there are \"issues concerning the precise date of the alleged default by the defendants and whether the plaintiff issued a proper notice of the default setting forth the specific date of default and the amount of default ....\" Nevertheless, the defendants did not address the propriety of the notice of default or the accuracy of the specific date of default. In addition, aside from the vague allegation in Carter's affidavit regarding the miscalculation of escrow payments, the defendants did not address the accuracy of the amount that was claimed to be in default in the default notice. Simply put, there is nothing in the defendants' memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment to demonstrate an issue of fact with regard to the propriety of the plaintiff's default notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, the defendants claim that there are \"issues concerning the limited power of attorney used to endorse the mortgage note and assignment of the mortgage\" to the plaintiff. Again, the defendants failed to recite specific facts, or submit documentary evidence, to demonstrate that there is an issue of fact with regard to the endorsements of the note or the assignment of the mortgage. Although the defendants made claims regarding the limited power of attorney in their supplemental memorandum of law in opposition to summary judgment, they did not attach any accompanying counteraffidavits that recited specific facts to rebut the plaintiff's affidavit and documentary evidence regarding the assignment of the note and mortgage. See\n   <em>\n    GMAC Mortgage, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415848\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/144/165/#p178\">\n    144 Conn.

After concluding that the plaintiff had \"supplied evidence of the authority for the signature in the form of a copy of the Limited Power of Attorney and a Supporting Affidavit,\" the court stated that the defendants had \"submitted no contrary evidence.\" Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the endorsement of the note or assignment of the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the defendants' claim that there are \"issues concerning the validity of the [federal loss affidavit] filed at the commencement of this action\" is without merit. The court concluded that any issue of fact with regard to the plaintiff's federal loss affidavit did not need to be resolved prior to the granting of the motion for summary judgment as to liability. We similarly conclude that any issue regarding the validity of that affidavit is not an issue of material fact. Prior to filing the motion for a judgment of strict foreclosure, the plaintiff filed\n   a new federal loss affidavit asserting that the loan was ineligible for any loss mitigation programs. The court accepted the new federal loss affidavit prior to rendering judgment. Therefore, whether the original federal loss affidavit was deficient is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For those reasons, we conclude that the court did not err in granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, after concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defendants next claim that the trial court erred in determining that their special defenses were legally insufficient. Specifically, the defendants claim that they\n   raised two legally sufficient special defenses: (1) that the loan was not in default because of \"the plaintiff's misapplication of escrow and other payments made by [the defendants] in connection with this mortgage,\" and (2) that the plaintiff's conduct violated CUTPA. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendants' special defenses are dependent upon their claim that the plaintiff incorrectly applied escrow payments or miscalculated the payments that were due pursuant to the note. The court concluded that the defendants failed to establish that the plaintiff misapplied or miscalculated payments due under the loan, and, therefore, their special defense related to a violation of CUTPA failed. Although we agree with the defendants that a claim that the loan is not in default is a valid special defense, we conclude that the court properly found that the defendants failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to their special defenses. As previously discussed in this opinion, the defendants failed to provide the court with any evidence related to the plaintiff's alleged misapplication or miscalculation of their payments.

On October 12, 2017, after briefs had been submitted to this court, the defendants filed an amended appeal to challenge the trial court's September 25, 2017 order resetting the law day.
