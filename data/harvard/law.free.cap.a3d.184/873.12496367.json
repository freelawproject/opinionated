Plante has brought this direct appeal from a sentence requiring him to pay $7,500 in restitution based on his involvement in extensively damaging rental property from which he was evicted. The sentence, entered by the court (York County,\n   <em>\n    Douglas, J.\n   </em>\n   ) upon Plante's nolo\n   contendere plea to criminal mischief (Class D), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A), (2) (2017), required only the payment of restitution and a mandatory payment to the Victims' Compensation Fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 3360-I (2017). Aside from those requirements, Plante was unconditionally discharged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1346 (2017). Because Plante does not properly assert that there is any illegality apparent on the record but instead challenges the factual and discretionary determinations of the court-decisions that we do not review in a direct appeal of a sentence-we dismiss his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] In April 2015, Plante was charged by indictment with aggravated criminal mischief (Class C), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 805(1)(A), (2) (2017). He initially pleaded not guilty, but in May 2016, he entered a plea of nolo contendere to criminal mischief (Class D), 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 806(1)(A), (2), and the State dismissed the count of aggravated criminal mischief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The State sought a judgment imposing restitution but no jail time or probation. After an evidentiary hearing regarding the amount of the victim's loss and Plante's capacity to pay restitution, the court found that, although Plante lacked the present capacity to pay restitution, he failed to prove that he lacked the future capacity to pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1325(1)(C), (2)(D), (4) (2017). The resulting judgment, entered in May 2017, required Plante to begin paying a $7,500 restitution obligation at a rate of $25 per month. The judgment required Plante to begin making payments in June 2018, a full year after sentencing. The court expressly stated that, if Plante remained unable to begin paying by June 2018, he could move to modify the restitution order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1328-A (2017). The court also ordered Plante to pay $20 to the Victims' Compensation Fund and sentenced him to an unconditional discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 3360-I ; 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1346. The court denied Plante's subsequent motion for correction or reduction of his sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Plante did not petition for a discretionary review of that denial. M.R. App. P. 19(a)(2)(A), (c) (Tower 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He appealed the sentence to us directly, arguing that the court erred in its factual findings or abused its discretion in determining his capacity to pay restitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 2 (Tower 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In a direct appeal, we do not review the propriety of a sentencing court's factual findings or discretionary determinations.\n   <em>\n    State v. Davenport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    2016 ME 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    138 A.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To obtain review of those aspects of a sentence, a defendant must have been \"sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year or more,\" 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151, and must have applied for sentence review, \"with an appeal following only if the Sentence Review Panel authorizes the appeal in its discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Davenport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    2016 ME 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    138 A.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 20 (Tower 2016); M.R. App. P. 20 (restyled). Because Plante was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least one year, he could not pursue such sentence review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20ME%2046\">\n    2015 ME 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-11,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20994\">\n    114 A.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 6] A direct appeal of a sentence, including a sentence to pay restitution,\n   is properly before us only if a defendant identifies an illegality, such as a constitutional or statutory violation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that is apparent from the record.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Plante has attempted to argue that we must consider his direct appeal to protect his rights of equal protection and due process. He presented these constitutional arguments only in his reply brief, however, and then in an undeveloped manner, without citation to supporting legal authority that would make an illegality apparent on the face of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lincoln v. Burbank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12197123\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1165/\">\n    2016 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 41,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12197123\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/1165/\">\n    147 A.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Davenport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    2016 ME 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803033\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/1205/\">\n    138 A.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we dismiss Plante's appeal.

The restitution statute has since been amended, however, to (1) authorize a sentencing court to consider an offender's\n    <em>\n     future\n    </em>\n    capacity to pay when determining whether, in what amount, and by what method an offender should be required to pay restitution; and (2) place on the offender the burden of proving a present or future incapacity to pay.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    P.L. 1997, ch. 413, \u00a7\u00a7 1-3 (effective Sept. 19, 1997) (codified at 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1325(1)(C), (2)(D), (4) );\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
