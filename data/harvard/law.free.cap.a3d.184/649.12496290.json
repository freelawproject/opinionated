The plaintiff, Karen Dent (plaintiff or Dent), appeals from a final judgment granting the motion of the defendant, PRRC, Inc. d/b/a Price Rite (defendant or Price Rite), for summary judgment on count one of the plaintiff's complaint, and also granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the remaining four counts. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 22, 2012, plaintiff was shopping with her husband at the Price Rite store located at 325 Valley Street in Providence. The plaintiff's husband placed two bottles of a beverage identified as Sunny Delight\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   into their shopping cart. The product was displayed in aisle six of the store, and plaintiff then separated from her husband to locate a restroom. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff returned to aisle six in search of her husband, but she slipped on a \"brownish oily substance\" and was immobilized. Meanwhile, a porter\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was mopping up liquid in an adjacent aisle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Coincidentally, plaintiff's husband noted that one of the bottles of Sunny Delight in his shopping cart had been leaking, and that some of the contents of the bottle had spilled out as he continued to shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   David Walmsley (Walmsley), a store manager at Price Rite, testified at a deposition that the Sunny Delight bottles arrive at the store in boxes and are then transported on pallets to the area of the store where they will be displayed. Also, Jeffrey Sparfven (Sparfven), a former Price Rite manager, testified at his deposition that the boxes arrive from the warehouse shrink-wrapped in cellophane and are unwrapped and inspected by a manager to verify that the quantity and quality of the items are correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Sparfven, the receiving manager then shrink-wraps the boxes and places them in storage until they are needed, at which point a store employee once again removes the shrink-wrap with a box cutter. Walmsley also testified that, typically, fifty boxes of Sunny Delight, with eight bottles in each box, are stacked on top of each other on the wooden pallet. According to Walmsley, none of the Price Rite employees are\n   asked to inspect products for defects before they are sold in the store. Finally, Walmsley explained that the store's protocol for spills is: \"If [an employee] see[s] something on the floor, the protocol is for them to stand at that spot until they can get [the] attention of a porter, and they stay there until the porter arrives.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 20, 2013, plaintiff filed a three-count complaint against defendant; she subsequently amended that complaint in February 2016. The amended complaint consisted of five counts: negligence; breach of contract; \"mode of operation\"; failure to warn; and breach of the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for use, and fitness for a particular purpose. Prior to the filing of plaintiff's amended complaint, defendant had moved for summary judgment on the negligence claim, arguing that Price Rite could only be liable under a theory of negligence if it knew or should have known that the dangerous condition existed for a sufficient period of time within which to remedy the dangerous condition, and that not enough time had elapsed such that defendant could be liable under the theory of constructive notice. The plaintiff objected to the motion for summary judgment, arguing that defendant had to have known of the dangerous condition because a porter was cleaning up the spill, and that there was no question that the bottle was defective. After a hearing, the trial justice granted defendant's motion with respect to the negligence count, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[A] plaintiff who has fallen must present evidence to prevail against the owner of the premises showing that he or she fell because of an unsafe condition on the premises of which the defendant was or should have been aware and that the condition existed for a long enough period of time so the owner or occupier of the premises should have taken steps to correct the condition * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Dent has failed to show that there was any notice given to the defendant. * * *\n   <em>\n    [O]bviously it wasn't so obvious that it would call attention to somebody\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After plaintiff was granted leave to file an amended complaint, defendant moved to dismiss the remaining counts under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In its motion, defendant argued that: (1) because the parties were not in a contractual relationship, the breach-of-contract claim should be dismissed; (2) mode of operation is not a cause of action, but merely a means of proving notice with respect to negligence, a count which had already been dismissed; (3) the duty-to-warn claim should fail because the court had already decided that Price Rite did not have notice of the leaking bottle; and (4) the breach-of-warranty claims should be dismissed because no sale had occurred. In response to defendant's motion, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and also moved for summary judgment under a theory of strict product liability. A hearing was held in March 2016 on defendant's motion to dismiss the remaining counts, plaintiff's Rule 60 motion, and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial justice granted defendant's motion to dismiss counts 2 through 5 of plaintiff's complaint, and accordingly denied both of plaintiff's motions. The plaintiff timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, plaintiff argues that the question of whether defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition from the broken bottle is a disputed issue of material fact, and therefore summary judgment should not have been granted. As to her breach-of-contract claim, plaintiff argues that defendant has a responsibility to maintain the property in a safe manner for its intended business invitee guests. Turning to the mode-of-operation count, plaintiff argues that this Court should adopt mode of operation as a distinct cause of action. As to her failure-to-warn claim, plaintiff argues that a retailer has a duty to warn consumers of dangerous or defective conditions that it knows of, or reasonably should have known of, and therefore the trial justice erred in dismissing this claim. Finally, plaintiff contends that her breach-of-warranty claims were properly pled; she therefore asks this Court to reverse the trial justice and enter summary judgment in her favor on this count.

The defendant cites to\n   <em>\n    Barone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Massart\n   </em>\n   , both cited\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , to support its position that plaintiff was required to present evidence showing that she fell because of an unsafe condition on the premises, of which defendant was aware or should have been aware, and that the condition existed for a long enough period of time that defendant should have corrected it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121913\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/767/66/#p68\">\n    767 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 ;\n   <em>\n    Massart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11808559\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/187/#p189\">\n    708 A.2d at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Barone\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Massart\n   </em>\n   is misplaced and is of no moment to the case at bar, because those cases were decided at trial, in the context of motions for judgment as a matter of law. There is no requirement at the summary-judgment stage for a plaintiff to produce direct evidence of how long a spill has existed on a floor, because this fact is capable of circumstantial proof. We have never required a plaintiff to produce direct evidence, and we do not require that now. The temporal aspect of a slip-and-fall case can be proven by circumstantial evidence, which is presented to the factfinder. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment granting summary judgment for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Breach of Contract, Failure to Warn, and Breach of Implied Warranty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We now turn to plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, failure to warn, and breach of warranty. On appeal, plaintiff alleges that she entered defendant's store as a business invitee, in anticipation of paying adequate consideration for its products, and that defendant breached this contract by failing to maintain the property in a safe manner. It appears that plaintiff is attempting to shoehorn a straightforward premises-liability claim into a breach-of-contract claim. The basis of plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim is that defendant failed to maintain its property in a safe condition. As previously noted, common law premises liability imposes a duty on landowners to \"exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons reasonably expected to be on the premises * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322393\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/300/#p304\">\n    160 A.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kurczy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313550\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/820/929/#p935\">\n    820 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   935 ). Having already addressed plaintiff's negligence claim, we need not delve any further into the mischaracterized breach-of-contract claim; a dismissal was proper. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the judgment dismissing plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Similarly, plaintiff's failure-to-warn claim is simply another inaccurately articulated negligence claim. A duty to warn arises when a defendant has notice of the dangerous propensities of a product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas v. Amway Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7962822\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/488/716/#p721\">\n    488 A.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (R.I. 1985) ;\n   <em>\n    Scittarelli v.

Having already determined that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to whether defendant had notice of the spill, we need not address this duplicitous claim. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiff's failure-to-warn claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Lastly, plaintiff's breach-of-warranty claims are without merit because there was not a sale under the facts before us. A claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability requires a plaintiff to \"prove that the product is defective, that it was in a defective condition at the time it left the hands of the seller, and that said defect is the proximate cause of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Lariviere v.

Moreover, G.L. 1956 \u00a7 6A-2-314 provides that \"a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in\n   <em>\n    a contract for their sale\n   </em>\n   if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.\" (Emphasis added.) It is inconceivable that plaintiff could succeed on a claim of breach\n   of implied warranty of merchantability when a contract for sale was never realized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Likewise, a breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose \"arises when the seller has reason to know the buyer's particular purpose and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to furnish appropriate goods and the buyer relies on the seller's skill or judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lariviere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7890351\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/525/892/#p896\">\n    525 A.2d at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A claim of breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is meritorious only if a sale has actually occurred.

The plaintiff contends that mode of operation is not a form of negligence, but rather modifies how the notice requirement of premises liability is met; she cites to Massachusetts common law in support of her position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheehan v.

After my thorough perusal of the record in this case and viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, I am unable to conclude that she produced any such evidence, either direct or circumstantial. The majority relies on the following evidence as predicates for its conclusion that plaintiff satisfied her burden of production as the non-moving party under Rule 56 : a \"video taken by defendant's security camera * * * depict[ing] plaintiff slipping and falling in an aisle of defendant's store\" and \"deposition testimony from defendant's employees * * *.\" The video in question shows what happened at the moment that plaintiff slipped.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority opinion correctly states that the\n   video did not record continuously and was triggered by movement. That fact alone, however, does not create, as the majority seems to contend, an issue of material fact. I agree with the majority that it is unclear from the video how long the liquid on which plaintiff slipped had been present on the floor. However, it was not plaintiff's burden to point to evidence only to show that it was not clear how long the spill was present on the floor; rather, she was required to point to competent evidence based on which one could infer that the spill existed, at the location in question, for such a duration as to amount to constructive notice. The video in question does not in any way support an inference that the spill existed for a long enough time to amount to constructive notice; and, for that matter, it does not establish a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Pimentel v.

However, rarely does not mean never.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    I consider it important to clarify certain statements made in the Facts and Travel portion of the majority opinion with respect to the videotape evidence at issue. The following are the statements in that opinion to which I am referring:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    \"[P]laintiff returned to aisle six in search of her husband, but she slipped on a 'brownish oily substance' and was immobilized. Meanwhile, a porter[ ] was mopping up liquid in an adjacent aisle.\n    <sup>\n     3\n    </sup>\n    \"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Footnote 3 that relates to the just-quoted sentences reads as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    \"A video, taken on Price Rite's security camera, captures the porter mopping the aisle adjacent to aisle six and plaintiff's slip-and-fall accident. However, the video is not time-stamped and is not continuously streaming, because the camera records only if it is triggered by movement in the aisle.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In my judgment, neither of those statements is wholly accurate. When one reviews the video footage in this case, it is clear that, of the many videos contained in the record, no single video shows both plaintiff's slip and fall as well as a porter mopping in an adjacent aisle. In actuality, there is a video of aisle six, which shows plaintiff's slip and fall, and another video of an adjacent aisle, which shows a porter mopping. However, as the majority candidly notes, these videos are not time-stamped, nor are they continuous streaming videos. As such, we have no way of knowing that plaintiff slipped and fell\n    <em>\n     while\n    </em>\n    (the majority says \"[m]eanwhile\") a porter was mopping in an adjacent aisle. We know only that those two events happened, but there is no evidence in the record that they happened contemporaneously. Indeed, plaintiff's counsel conceded as much to the hearing justice, stating that \"[t]here is no absolute way to absolutely determine that because of timestamps.\" (It is clear from the record that, in referencing time stamps, plaintiff's counsel was referring to the lack of time stamps on the surveillance videos.) Additionally, in the bench decision that he rendered just after viewing the videos which plaintiff asserted were relevant to her case, the hearing justice made the following statement with respect to the evidence of the porter mopping in an adjacent aisle: \"Although Dent has argued that a porter had noticed the drops, whatever the substance was, and began cleaning them on a different aisle before Dent fell, this is not established in the record.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    I would add as well that, even if I were to accept the facts exactly as set forth by the majority, it would not alter my belief that Ms. Dent failed to produce competent evidence to survive summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
