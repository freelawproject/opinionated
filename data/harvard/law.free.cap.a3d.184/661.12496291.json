Hawes, appeals from a May 4, 2015 final judgment entered in the Newport County Superior Court. That judgment was entered to reflect an April 27, 2015 written decision in which the hearing justice quashed an execution previously issued by the Rhode Island Superior Court on a State of Utah District Court judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's petition to enforce the Utah judgment, on the grounds that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, Daniel P. Reilly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred in refusing to grant full faith and credit to the order of the Utah District Court with respect to personal jurisdiction. He further avers that the hearing justice erred in determining that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over Daniel. Lastly, he posits that Daniel \"forfeited the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts of the case before this Court are somewhat complicated but are not materially in dispute. In relating those facts in this opinion, we rely primarily on the March 16, 2010 complaint filed in state court in Utah, the April 27, 2015 decision of the Rhode Island Superior Court in the instant case, and other documents in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A company named InnerLight Holdings, Inc. (InnerLight), with its principal place of business in Utah, hired William Reilly (Daniel's father) to act as their corporate counsel for the purpose of obtaining authorization from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to publicly trade InnerLight stock. Ultimately, however, InnerLight did not receive final authorization from the SEC to trade its shares publicly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its March 16, 2010 First Amended Complaint filed in the State of Utah District Court, InnerLight represented that it had agreed to pay William with 650,000 shares of InnerLight stock and had agreed to let him hold an additional 600,000 shares, to be transferred after InnerLight became a public company. InnerLight further\n   alleged that William, in the process of acting as InnerLight's corporate counsel, transferred 700,000 shares without permission through several corporate entities-Ashworth Development, LLC (Ashworth); Doylestown Partners, Inc. (Doylestown); Shamrock Equities, Inc. (Shamrock); and Beachview Associates, Inc. (Beachview) (collectively, the corporate entities). Of significance is the fact that, according to his affidavit filed in Rhode Island Superior Court, Daniel was a minority shareholder in Doylestown, Shamrock, and Beachview, as well as being the secretary of Doylestown and Beachview and the Vice President of Shamrock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hawes ultimately purchased shares of InnerLight stock that had purportedly been transferred by William to the corporate entities. Mr. Hawes also purchased warrants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   InnerLight then rescinded the stock offerings, but Mr. Hawes did not receive a refund for the shares he had purchased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 16, 2010, InnerLight filed its previously mentioned First Amended Complaint in state court in Utah against William, Daniel, Shannon, the corporate entities, Mr. Hawes, and other investors who had purchased shares of InnerLight stock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Mr. Hawes answered the complaint. Included in his answer was a cross-claim against William, Daniel, Shannon, and the corporate entities, as well as other parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 29, 2010, Daniel, Shannon, and the corporate entities filed a motion to dismiss InnerLight's First Amended Complaint in state court in Utah on the ground that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over them;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   in addition, both sides filed memoranda of law with respect to that motion. Daniel's Utah counsel subsequently withdrew, and neither Daniel nor counsel representing him were present at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. The Utah District Court then denied the motion to dismiss in a brief order which stated that \"Innerlight made a prima facie showing by pleading sufficient facts to establish that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over each of the non-resident Defendants.\" They then continued not to appear in the state court, and they did not engage new counsel. Accordingly, on May 11, 2012, an amended default judgment on Mr. Hawes's cross-claim was entered against Daniel, William, Shannon, and the corporate entities in the amount of $775,000, plus \"reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 21, 2014, Mr. Hawes filed a \"Petition to Enforce a Foreign Judgment\" in the Rhode Island Superior Court, seeking enforcement in this jurisdiction of the default judgment from Utah against Daniel. On June 20, 2014, an execution was issued in the amount of $971,351.78. On\n   October 30, 2014, Daniel filed a motion to quash the execution and dismiss the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction in the foreign action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The hearing justice, after considering the briefings of the parties and after hearing argument, issued a written decision on April 27, 2015. In his written decision, the hearing justice first addressed whether or not he needed to give full faith and credit to the order of the state court in Utah that denied Daniel's motion to dismiss. After a thorough and commendable discussion of the facts and applicable precedent, the hearing justice determined that he would not be obligated to give full faith and credit to the denial of the motion to dismiss because that order was \"vague\" and did not include any \"underlying reasoning.\" He added that \"[i]n this case, it does not seem that a final determination of personal jurisdiction had [been] reached;\" and he expressly noted that \"[t]he order only states a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of personal jurisdiction ha[d] been made.\" The hearing justice then reviewed Daniel's contacts with Utah and the applicable Utah law and came to the conclusion that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over Daniel. For that reason, he quashed the execution and dismissed Mr. Hawes's petition. Final judgment subsequently entered on May 4, 2015. Mr. Hawes filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a case which similarly involved the doctrine of full faith and credit, we stated, with respect to the standard of review to be applied, that \"this Court will apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review to questions of law that may implicate a constitutional right.\"\n   <em>\n    Goetz v.

However, we went on in\n   <em>\n    Cassidy\n   </em>\n   to clarify that \"when deciding mixed questions of law and fact that involve constitutional issues, our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8322407\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/920/228/#p232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we concluded that \"[o]ur review of a challenge to\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8322407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/920/228/#p232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cerberus Partners, L.P. v.

In this case, Daniel did not simply fail to appear in Utah with a default judgment subsequently being entered against him in that state. Rather, he initially elected to submit to the limited jurisdiction of Utah for the sole purpose of determining personal jurisdiction by filing the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. However, and importantly, his motion to dismiss was denied in a rather brief order issued after he did not appear at the hearing on the motion. He later had a default judgment entered against him on the cross-claim. We are left, therefore, to answer the question of whether, under controlling precedent, the Utah order denying Daniel's motion to dismiss on the ground that a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing of sufficient facts to establish the Utah court's personal jurisdiction over Daniel had been met should be accorded full faith and credit and, accordingly,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Full Faith and Credit Clause set forth in Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In accordance with the Full Faith and Credit Clause, G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-32-2 provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with the act of congress or the statutes of this state may be filed in the office of the clerk of the appropriate superior or district court. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of the superior or district court. A judgment so filed has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses, and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying as a judgment of the court and may be enforced or satisfied in like manner to any Rhode Island state court judgment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 9-32-1 defines a foreign judgment as \"any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Baldwin v.

We look then to Daniel's contacts with Utah and whether the claims against him arose out of the particular activities of Daniel in Utah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The claims against Daniel that are set forth in InnerLight's First Amended Complaint and in Mr. Hawes's cross-claim arise out of the same set of operative facts. William was hired by InnerLight, in Utah, as corporate counsel. InnerLight contended that, thereafter, William \"and his Children\" transferred shares of InnerLight without permission through the corporate entities. The allegations in Mr. Hawes's cross-claim with respect to Daniel are limited to his role in the corporate entities and an allegation that William was acting as Daniel's agent. As such, a review of InnerLight's First Amended Complaint and Mr. Hawes's cross-claim clearly reveals that the only, very limited, role Daniel played (even accepting as true the allegations which lie at the heart of this case) was as a shareholder and officer of three of the corporate entities and as the son of William Reilly. It is clear from the record that Daniel himself had no relevant contact with Utah. Additionally, Daniel submitted an affidavit to the Rhode Island Superior Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that Doylestown, Shamrock, and Beachview are all Florida corporations with their principal places of business in Rhode Island and Florida. Thus, the corporate entities did not operate in Utah and had no connection with Utah beyond their purportedly having been used to convey InnerLight stock. While it is true that InnerLight's principal place of business is in Utah, minimum contacts cannot be based solely on the fact that the plaintiff is located in the forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701990\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/277/#p284\">\n    571 U.S. at 284-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1122 ;\n   <em>\n    ClearOne, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6816059\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/369/1269/#p1281\">\n    369 P.3d at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, Daniel's affidavit stated that he is a resident of Rhode Island and that he had been to Utah only \"once\"-\"on a ski trip in approximately 2007.\" He went on to state that he had never \"conducted business\" in Utah or \"authorized any agent to act on [his] behalf in the state of Utah.\" Daniel also stated that he did not participate in his father's work for InnerLight, was never aware of any deposit of stock or options in any of the accounts owned by Doylestown, Shamrock, and Beachview, and did not know about or participate in the transfer of shares of InnerLight stock from the corporate entities to Mr. Hawes.

For that reason, we articulated a rule to the effect that a defense of lack of personal jurisdiction could be forfeited \"when the defendant, through delay or conduct, give[s] a plaintiff a reasonable expectation that it will defend the suit on the merits or * * * cause[s] the court to go to some effort that would be wasted if personal jurisdiction is later found lacking.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187783\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In our opinion, those reasons are not sufficient to establish a forfeiture of Daniel's right to contest personal jurisdiction. Filing a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction certainly does not give the plaintiff a reasonable expectation that the suit will be defended on the merits-nor does an attempt to remove the case to federal court. The instant case involves a radically different factual scenario from that which was present in\n   <em>\n    Pullar\n   </em>\n   . Here, we do not have any facts which are even remotely similar to a party's waiting three years to actively contest personal jurisdiction while voluntarily engaging in the state's discovery and arbitration processes. As such, Mr. Hawes's attempt to equate this case with\n   <em>\n    Pullar\n   </em>\n   is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In conclusion, it is our judgment that: (1) the Utah order denying the motion to dismiss was not entitled to full faith and credit; (2) Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over Daniel; and (3) Daniel did not forfeit his defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

However, we are unable to apply that principle in a blunt and un-nuanced manner in this case because we have to contend with the fact that Daniel did file a motion to dismiss in Utah contesting personal jurisdiction and then failed to appear for a hearing on that motion, resulting in the issuance of an order denying his motion to dismiss.
