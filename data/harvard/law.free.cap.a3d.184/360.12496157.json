We discern no error in the court's rulings on either the motion to suppress or the motion for a judgment of acquittal, but we remand for the court to examine some or all of the requested mental health records\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b6 2] Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the jury could rationally have found the following facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Cummings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320433\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/996/\">\n    2017 ME 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320433\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/166/996/\">\n    166 A.3d 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the autumn of 2003, Olah's friend's six-year-old daughter was sleeping in her bedroom in Presque Isle. She awoke to find that Olah had undressed her and was touching her genitals with his mouth. Later that day, Olah took her to play at a local park. Olah then took her to another friend's nearby home, where he bathed her and briefly rubbed a towel between her legs. After the bath, the two were in the living room when Olah removed his erect penis from his pants, had the girl come to him, grabbed her hand, and made her touch his penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b6 3] In early 2014, the girl, who was still a minor, told her counselor what had happened. The counselor reported the information to state authorities as a mandatory reporter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 4011-A(1)(A)(22), (2) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 4] In September 2014, Olah was charged by criminal complaint with gross sexual assault (Class A), 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 253(1)(B), and unlawful sexual contact (Class C), 17-A M.R.S.A. \u00a7 255(1)(C), (2). An indictment for the same charges was filed that November. The indictment alleged-based on the available evidence-that Olah had committed the crimes \"[o]n or about between July 1, 2001 and September 30, 2001.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 5] In June 2015, Olah moved to suppress incriminating statements he had\n   made during a police interview. The court (\n   <em>\n    Hunter, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a hearing and denied the motion to suppress, determining that Olah had not been in custody when he made the statements and that he had spoken to the police voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 6] Before trial, Olah moved for the production of the child's mental health records from the Aroostook Mental Health Center (AMHC) and the child's counselor, who was an employee of AMHC. He asserted in that motion that the records were not confidential or privileged because the child waived any privilege by voluntarily disclosing the contents of her counseling when she spoke with law enforcement officers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. Evid. 510(a) (\"A person who has a privilege under these rules waives the privilege if the person ... while holding the privilege voluntarily discloses or consents to the disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter.\"). He also asserted that the contents of the records would likely be admissible for impeachment purposes. The proposed subpoenas requested \"[a]ll counseling records of [the child] and [the counselor] involving any discussion of sexual abuse.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The court entered an order on January 27, 2016, in which it determined that Olah had met the threshold requirements of relevancy, admissibility, and specificity to authorize the issuance of subpoenas and directed that subpoenas be served.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 17A(f). After being served with a notice to produce records, AMHC and the counselor objected to the production of documents and moved to quash the subpoenas, asserting that the documents requested were, despite the mandatory report of child abuse, confidential by statute and could not be disclosed even for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   22 M.R.S. \u00a7 1711-C (2017) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   34-B M.R.S. \u00a7 1207 (2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Olah argued in opposition that the child had waived the confidentiality of the records through her own statements to law enforcement, that Rule 17A(f) allows the court to require the production of otherwise confidential material for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review and possible disclosure to the defendant, and that the materials can be used for impeachment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 8] The court granted the motion to quash without having viewed the records\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   . It concluded that the child had not voluntarily waived confidentiality, either through her statements to law enforcement or through the mandated report of her counselor. The court distinguished the confidential records of the counselor from the child's statements to law enforcement, which were properly the subject of discovery and, to the extent appropriate pursuant to the Rules of Evidence, could be used at trial. It further stated that it was \"not persuaded that its preliminary conclusion that the Defendant had met his threshold obligation to demonstrate relevance, admissibility and specificity necessarily leads to an obligation to produce the [counseling] records for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\" The court reasoned that Rule 17A anticipates objections to the subpoena and that the court must then consider \"whether the claimed privilege should be honored\n   or not.\" Upon considering that question, the court quashed the subpoenas as mere \"fishing expeditions,\" citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    1999 ME 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    726 A.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    State v. Dube\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    2014 ME 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 8-10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    87 A.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 9] In November 2016, almost two years after the indictment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court (\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) held a two-day jury trial. The evidence was conflicting regarding the date when Olah had been present at the girl's home. At the close of evidence, Olah moved for a judgment of acquittal on the gross sexual assault charge because the alleged victim had testified that her eyes were closed when she felt the mouth on her genitals, and she therefore could not sufficiently identify Olah as the person who had committed that crime. The court denied the motion. Olah did not testify and offered no additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b6 10] In its closing argument, the State argued that the events probably happened when the alleged victim was six years old in fall 2003. Olah argued that the indictment's allegation of events in 2001 could not be proved and that the discrepancies cast reasonable doubt on whether the events happened at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b6 11] The court gave its final instructions to the jury, which returned guilty verdicts on both counts. Olah then moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the evidence could not establish the identity of the person who committed the assault in the bedroom and that the evidence presented and argued by the State was outside the scope of the indictment, which prejudiced his ability to prepare a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b6 12] The court heard arguments on Olah's motion for a judgment of acquittal on December 2, 2016, and denied the motion with respect to identification because the girl testified about identifying features of her assailant, including the description of his facial hair, that were consistent with only one person who was in the house at the time-Olah. The court further concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support each element of each count. The court also denied the motion as to the date discrepancy because Olah, without objecting, used that discrepancy during his closing argument to try to discredit the State's case and undermine witness credibility; the date discrepancy did not affect the statute of limitations or any elements of the crime, including the element of the age range of the victim; and there was no demonstration of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 13] The court then held a sentencing hearing. On the gross sexual assault count, the court sentenced Olah to fourteen years in prison, all but seven years suspended, and six years of probation with conditions limiting his contact with children. For the unlawful sexual contact, the court sentenced Olah to forty-two months of incarceration to be served concurrently with the sentence for the gross sexual assault. The court also ordered Olah to pay $50 to the Victims' Compensation Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 14] Olah timely appealed and applied for review of his sentence. 15 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2115, 2151 (2017) ; M.R. App. P. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sentence Review Panel denied Olah leave to appeal from his sentence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2152 (2017), and the appeal from the judgment of conviction is now before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Olah\n   </em>\n   , No. SRP-16-568 (Me. Sent. Rev. Panel Feb. 27, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b6 15] On the entire record presented, we conclude, without further discussion, that (1) the court (\n   <em>\n    Hunter, J.\n   </em>\n   ) did not err in its findings or in its application of the law in denying Olah's motion to suppress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the court (\n   <em>\n    Stewart, J.\n   </em>\n   ) did not err in denying Olah's motion for a judgment of acquittal on the record before it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We write to address the court's (\n   <em>\n    Hunter, J.\n   </em>\n   ) application of Rule 17A of the Maine Rules of Unified Criminal Procedure and its decision to quash the subpoenas of the child's mental health records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Olah first contends that those mental health records are not confidential because the child waived their confidentiality by speaking about the content of her counseling sessions with law enforcement present. Olah further argues that the court should have reviewed the records from AMHC\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   both to protect Olah's constitutional right to present a complete defense and to be consistent with the court's earlier determination that Olah had made a preliminary showing that the records could be subpoenaed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 17A(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Standards of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 17] We review a ruling on a motion to quash a subpoena for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Marroquin-Aldana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959061\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/519/\">\n    2014 ME 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959061\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/519/\">\n    89 A.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The decision to exclude testimony based on the assertion of confidentiality or a privilege rests in the sound discretion of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    1999 ME 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    726 A.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Waiver of Confidentiality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 19] The court correctly determined that neither the mandated report to law enforcement by the counselor nor the alleged victim's answers to questions posed by law enforcement constituted a waiver of the confidentiality of the victim's counseling records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 20] A mandated report of suspected abuse by a provider does not create a waiver of the confidentiality of records by a patient.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311125\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/55/432/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1711-C(14) (prohibiting as void against public policy any agreement to waive the provisions of section 1711-C ).

Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that, when speaking with police after her counselor made the report, the alleged victim executed any written consent for the records' disclosure, either on her own or through her parents acting on her behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   34-B M.R.S \u00a7 1207(1)(A) (\"A client, his legal guardian, if any, or, if he is a minor, his parent or legal guardian may give his informed written consent to the disclosure of information.\").

Although those records are almost certain to contain inculpatory information that led to the report of suspected child abuse, they may also contain exculpatory information about, for instance, the child's level of certainty in identifying the person who touched her with his mouth in her bedroom. Because information about the specific charged crimes likely exists in the specified records, the circumstances differ from the situation in\n   <em>\n    Marroquin-Aldana\n   </em>\n   , where the subpoena sought from the attorney of the victim's mother the mother's entire immigration file, particularly her U visa application, but did not state what specific information the application would contain that would be relevant to Marroquin-Aldana's defense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959061\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/519/\">\n    2014 ME 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2, 36, 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6959061\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/89/519/\">\n    89 A.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, although the exact contents of the records subpoenaed here are not known, this matter is unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Dube\n   </em>\n   , where the counseling records predated the charged crimes and the defendant conceded that it was impossible to know what was in the records.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    2014 ME 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10 &amp; n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    87 A.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b6 35] Because the review must by definition be focused on the specific charges against the defendant and the potential for exculpatory information, a court is not required to review all counseling records ever created with respect to an alleged victim; a broad \"fishing expedition\" will not be allowed because an alleged victim has a strong privacy interest in the confidentiality of records that do not pertain to the allegations against the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    1999 ME 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587752\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/214/\">\n    726 A.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dube\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    2014 ME 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10 &amp; n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954967\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/87/1219/\">\n    87 A.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b6 36] In the matter before us, however, it is relatively certain that the records contain some evidence concerning the exact crimes charged, and the identity of the alleged perpetrator was directly at issue at trial.
