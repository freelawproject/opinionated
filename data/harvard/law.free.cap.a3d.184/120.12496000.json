However, the court may consider her performance while on probation as one factor in deciding whether to grant the petition. The trial court erred in holding that E.C. was barred from applying for expungement because she had been discharged from probation without improvement. We reverse the order on appeal and remand this matter to the trial court for further consideration on an expedited basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 31, 2002, E.C. was arrested on drug charges that were later resolved through a plea bargain. On December 13, 2002, she pled guilty to one count of third-degree possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-5(a)(1), and was sentenced to three years of probation, conditioned on serving six days in jail and paying $1205 in fines and fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the plea agreement, the court also dismissed charges that had been filed against E.C. after an arrest on June 14, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Almost three years later, on November 18, 2005, E.C. pled guilty to violating probation, due to her failure to report to her probation officer on several occasions in 2005, failure to advise the probation officer that she had moved, and failure to pay the fines. She was discharged from probation \"without improvement,\" and\n   all fines remained in effect. However, by February 8, 2010, she had paid off all the fines. In support of her expungement petition, E.C. submitted an October 29, 2013 letter issued by the Essex Vicinage Probation Services, advising: \"All fines have been paid in full. On 2/08/2010 this case was discharged as a completed term.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 9, 2015, E.C. filed a petition pursuant to the \"early pathway\" section of the expungement statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2(a)(2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to expunge the 2002 arrest and conviction, and to expunge the charges that had been dismissed as part of the 2002 plea bargain. She also sought to expunge the June 14, 2002 arrest on charges that were later dismissed, and a 2012 arrest that the State admitted was an error. Other than motor vehicle violations, and the mistaken 2012 arrest, she had no brushes with the law since 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   E.C.'s petition explained that she was nineteen years old at the time of her May 2002 arrest. As a result of the 2002 conviction, she lost her public housing and was forced to drop out of college because she lost her federal aid. Her petition, which was supported by extensive documentation, also described her years-long efforts to complete her education in the health care field, while caring for her two children. By 2015, she had graduated from a business college with a 4.0 GPA and hoped to become a certified phlebotomist and medical assistant. However, her 2002 conviction hindered her ability to obtain the certification and obtain a full-time position in a hospital. Letters of support attached to her petition attested to E.C.'s good character. In summary, E.C. appeared well qualified for expungement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   However, other than agreeing to expungement of the mistaken 2012 arrest, the Union County Prosecutor's Office opposed the application. The prosecutor argued that E.C. had not \"satisfactorily completed\" her term of probation, within the meaning of the expungement statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2, because she had been discharged from probation without improvement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court agreed with that argument. Based on the trial court's construction of the statute, E.C. would be permanently unable to apply for and obtain expungement of her criminal record, due to her imperfect performance while on probation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2(a) ; N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2(a)(2). By contrast, persons convicted of the same crime as E.C., who were sentenced to prison instead of probation and completed their sentences, would be able to apply for expungement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Our review of the trial court's statutory interpretation is de novo.\n   <em>\n    In re Expungement Petition of J.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363432\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/223/54/#p72\">\n    223 N.J. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363432\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/223/54/#p72\">\n    121 A.3d 322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Kollman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154819\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/210/557/#p577\">\n    210 N.J. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577-78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154819,4154132\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/46/1247/\">\n    46 A.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

The statute sets forth the criteria as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   at least five years has expired from the date of his [or her] conviction, payment of fine,\n   <em>\n    satisfactory completion of probation\n   </em>\n   or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later; the person has not been convicted of a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense since the time of the conviction; and the court finds in its discretion that expungement is in the public interest, giving due consideration to the nature of the offense, and the applicant's character and conduct since conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ordinary pathway section of the statute, N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2(a), under which an offender must wait longer before applying, contains the same language concerning satisfactory completion of probation.

The expungement statute \"shall be construed with the primary objective of providing relief to the one-time offender who has led a life of rectitude and disassociated himself [or herself] with unlawful activity....\" N.J.S.A. 2C:52-32.

As part of a probationary sentence, a court may require a defendant to satisfy certain conditions, including paying a fine. N.J.S.A. 2C:45-1(b)(11). The court may sentence a defendant to a term of probation of up to five years. N.J.S.A. 2C:45-2(a). However, \"[t]he court, on application of a probation officer or of the defendant, or on its own motion, may\n   <em>\n    discharge\n   </em>\n   the defendant at any time.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:45-2(a) (emphasis added). Upon the termination of the probationary period, \"or the earlier discharge of the defendant,\" the defendant \"shall have satisfied his sentence for the offense\" unless the defendant has failed to pay any fines imposed, in which case the probationary period may be extended. N.J.S.A. 2C:45-2(c)(1). On the other hand, the court may revoke probation and resentence the defendant if she has failed to comply with a \"substantial requirement\" imposed as a condition of probation or has been convicted of another offense. N.J.S.A. 2C:45-3(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the statute indicates, a defendant who has been discharged from probation, has \"satisfied his [or her] sentence,\" so long as he or she has paid all fines imposed. The language of the probation statute suggests that a defendant who has been discharged from\n   probation and has later paid any outstanding fines, has satisfactorily completed probation, even if his or her performance while on probation has not been perfect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Kollman\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    LoBasso\n   </em>\n   also support that view.

The Court also noted a similar discussion in\n   <em>\n    LoBasso\n   </em>\n   , \"contrasting early discharge from probation with [a] history of probation violations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154819,4154132\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/46/1247/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    LoBasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3924759\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/423/475/#p496\">\n    423 N.J.

From that language, we infer that probation violations are not an absolute bar to applying for expungement. Otherwise, there would be no need for a trial court to consider probation violations as one factor in the public interest calculus, because the petitioner would be statutorily unable to apply in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We hold that an individual who has been discharged from probation, albeit with an imperfect record, and has paid all outstanding fines, has satisfactorily completed probation within the meaning of the expungement statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, E.C. not only obtained a discharge from probation but she satisfied the only remaining condition she could complete, when she paid off all of her fines. As a result, according to Probation Services, her case was \"discharged.\" Under those circumstances, we conclude that E.C. satisfactorily completed her probationary term for purposes of the statute. She completed the term in a sufficiently acceptable manner that her probation was not revoked, she paid all of the required fines, and she was\n   discharged from probation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, under N.J.S.A. 2C:52-2(a)(2), she was entitled to apply for expungement five years after she paid off the fines, and she may obtain expungement if she persuades the trial court that expungement is in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because the trial court viewed E.C. as barred from applying for expungement under the early pathway provision, it did not consider any of the other factors pertaining to her petition in order to determine whether expungement was in the public interest. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the trial court to complete its consideration of the petition. On remand, the trial court shall take into consideration the fact that, under the 2017 amendment to the expungement statute, E.C. would soon be entitled to apply for expungement under the ordinary pathway, because eight years have now elapsed since she finished paying her fines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LoBasso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3924759\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/423/475/#p496\">\n    423 N.J.
