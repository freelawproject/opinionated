(Petitioner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 29, 2017, Petitioner filed a petition for review, stylized as a \"Petition for Declaratory Judgment\" (Petition), averring as follows. Petitioner is certified in Pennsylvania as a professional educator. He was indicated as a perpetrator of child abuse in two separate reports filed by the County Children and Youth Services (CYS) and placed on the Childline Registry. Petitioner then filed petitions to expunge the indicated reports and, on appeal, the BHA sustained one indicated report and dismissed the other as unfounded. Both cases are currently pending before this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Petition, \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Meanwhile, the Department of Education, Professional Standards and Practices Commission (Commission), commenced a disciplinary proceeding against Petitioner's professional license. Based upon pre-hearing statements filed with the Commission, Petitioner discovered that \"persons who testified in the two separate child abuse expunction proceedings before the [BHA] are expected to testify.\" (Petition, \u00b6 9.) In filing the Petition, Petitioner desires \"to use the transcripts of the prior testimony taken from such persons in the child abuse expunction proceeding in cross-examining them at the upcoming hearing on the action before the ... Commission.\" (Petition, \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Petitioner, the transcripts are designated as confidential information under statutory law and counsel for the Commission objects to their disclosure during the licensing matter. Petitioner seeks a declaration authorizing him to utilize the transcripts for the stated purpose, asserting that the theory of fundamental fairness inherent in the Due Process Clause\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   mandates this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the BHA filed preliminary objections, contending that the Petition failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The BHA further asserts that the Petition does not conform to law or rule of court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, Petitioner filed an answer and, in proper course, both parties submitted briefs in support of their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Failure to State a Claim (Demurrer)\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BHA contends that the transcripts of the witnesses' testimony in the expungement proceedings are confidential material under the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and supersede any due process rights that Petitioner may have.

With the same exception, disclosure of all confidential information is allowed under section 6340(5.1) in \"any matter involving custody of a child\" and particularly when the case involves an allegation of child abuse. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6340(5.1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, section 6339, working in tandem with a Rule of Juvenile Court Procedure, permits disclosure of confidential information related to child abuse when the county agency intends to submit that evidence in a dependency hearing as proof that the child is not receiving proper parental care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6339 ; Pa.R.J.C.P. 1800(8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these three proceedings, by virtue of the disclosure, the \"defendant\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   can use the information once protected by the CPSL as rebuttal evidence, assuming it meets any other requirements for admissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the parties agree that the transcripts fall within the scope of\n   section 6339 as \"any other information obtained\" by the county agency and constitute confidential information. Facially, there is no readily discernable exception in section 6340 that would enable Petitioner to use and disclose the content of the transcripts in the licensing matter.

Petitioner seeks to utilize the transcripts of witnesses who have testified under oath in the prior expungement proceedings against him-not statements that individuals made to CYS in reporting or relaying that the abuse had occurred or information contained in investigative reports-and, ostensibly, he is aware of and knows the witnesses' identities. The transcripts of the expungement proceedings memorialize sworn testimony taken in an adversarial setting and, as such, the purpose for confidentiality in section 6339 does not appear to be frustrated in any palpable manner, and the Commonwealth's interest in cloaking the information must lie somewhere near the nadir. Pursuant to the constraints of PEDA, proceedings before the Commission are closed to the public, and the transcripts of the expungement proceedings, if made part of the record, cannot ever be\n   disclosed to the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In these circumstances, it is difficult to grasp how the use of the transcripts by Petitioner on cross-examination would compromise the CPSL's confidential reporting system or the privacy interests of the parties involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is beyond cavil that all legislative acts have to abide by the constitution, and a statutory privilege may have to be narrowed or yielded if it unreasonably interferes with the guarantee of due process and the right to impeach a witness with prior inconsistent statements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Linder v.
