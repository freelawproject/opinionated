There are four issues before this Court: (1) whether the Board-imposed conditions exceed the Board's authority under the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Township's Unified Development Ordinance (UDO)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, thus, violate this Court's September 26, 2014 order;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) whether the Board is authorized to impose standards separate and apart from the UDO regarding where a particular use may be located; (3) whether the Board's conditions are unduly restrictive and result in disparate treatment of MarkWest's proposed use without a reasonable basis; and, (4) whether certain of the Board's conditions are preempted by Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) statutes and regulations. Upon review, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MarkWest is a limited liability corporation that owns and operates midstream facilities which transport, compress and process oil, gas and other substances extracted from oil and gas wells. MarkWest operates gas compressor stations in Washington County, Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 2 of Township Ordinance No. 2-2010 permits natural gas compressor stations that operate\n   as midstream facilities, so long as they are consistent with the Township's UDO which allows them by special exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 460a-467a. On September 20, 2010, MarkWest executed an agreement to purchase a 71.5-acre undeveloped parcel of land (Property) from Richard Caruso located in the Township's I-1 Light Industrial District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 29, 2010, MarkWest applied to the Board for a special exception under Section 911.D.1 of the Township's UDO to construct and operate a natural gas compressor station roughly in the center 15 acres of the Property. The proposed facility would consist of up to 8 compressor engines and surrounding sound structures, dehydration facilities, tanks, a vapor recovery unit, a flare and associated piping (Proposed Facility). The Property is adjacent to R-1 Low Density and R-2 Medium Density Residential Districts, but no residence would be closer than 1,000 feet from the Proposed Facility. Board hearings were held on January 17, January 31 and February 21, 2011. MarkWest submitted to the Board Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 468a-482a. Thereafter, the Township issued 37 then-proposed conditions to which MarkWest responded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.R. at 468a-494a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 31, 2011, the Board denied MarkWest's special exception application on the basis that MarkWest failed to satisfy the UDO's requirements that the Proposed Facility would be of the same general character as other uses permitted in the I-1 Light Industrial District, and that its impact would be equal to or less than other permitted uses. On April 21, 2011, MarkWest appealed to the trial court from the Board's special exception application denial and exclusionary zoning challenge which was deemed denied. On May 20, 2011, Range Resources intervened as an owner or tenant of the Property on which the Proposed Facility would be constructed. The Township intervened on June 13, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 21, 2013, the trial court, without taking additional evidence, affirmed the Board's decision. MarkWest (No. 223 C.D. 2013) and Range Resources (No. 232 C.D. 2013) appealed to this Court. By August 14, 2013 order, this Court consolidated the appeals. On September 26, 2014, this Court reversed the trial court's order and remanded the matter to the trial court to remand to the Board with the direction to grant MarkWest's special exception application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MarkWest Liberty Midstream &amp; Res., LLC v.

MarkWest generally asserts that since this Court declared that it had \"fully satisfied\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the applicable objective requirements of the UDO[,] ... no conditions are necessary to ensure compliance with the MPC or the UDO.\" MarkWest Br. at 11. In the alternative, MarkWest avers that the Conditions are unreasonable, unsupported by the record and contrary to law. MarkWest more specifically contends that, with the exception of the first sentence of Condition 2, the Board's Conditions exceed the Board's authority under the MPC because they regulate the\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   of MarkWest's proposed use, rather than the\n   <em>\n    where\n   </em>\n   ; MarkWest's proposed use has been legislatively determined not to materially affect the public interest; and, the Conditions are unduly restrictive and result in arbitrary and unreasonable discriminatory and unequal\n   treatment of MarkWest's proposed use as compared to other such uses in the Township.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MarkWest Br. at 15-49;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MarkWest Reply Br. at 3-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The law is clear that \"[the Board's] authority is defined by the MPC and the [UDO].\"\n   <em>\n    HHI Trucking &amp; Supply, Inc. v.

For instance, by requiring the gas company to test water samples prior to drilling, it would enhance the respective company's or property owners' assertion that the drilling did or did not have a negative impact on same and the degree to which it did or did not. Currently, this type of litigation involves a morasse of expert opinions and testing \"after the fact.\" Rather than conjecture as to how, whether or to what extent the property was negatively impacted, the parties and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) would have concrete information\n   which could minimize the often-protracted litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Thus, while I concur with the well-written Majority in its affirmance of the first sentence of Condition 2 and Conditions 4, 5, 7, 11, a portion of 21, and 24, I agree with the trial court, for the reasons set forth in its opinion, that the remaining Conditions, or parts thereof, imposed by the Board are a reasonable means to mitigate potential adverse impacts arising from the operation of the compressor station and are not an abuse of discretion. Based on this record, the Conditions imposed by the Board meet the express requirements of the MPC and the Township's UDO as expressly noted by the Board in its decision.

Section 4 of the APCA, 35 P.S. \u00a7 4004, expressly authorizes DEP to implement federal clean air laws, and to monitor, test, investigate and ensure compliance and abatement by air contamination sources in the Commonwealth. This Court has held:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n    The Commonwealth is committed to the conservation and maintenance of clean air by Art[icle] I, [Section] 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. To that effect, through Section [ ]2 of the [APCA], the legislature has declared as policy the protection of air resources to the degree necessary for the protection of the health, safety and well-being of the citizens; the prevention of injury to plant and animal life and property; the protection of public comfort and convenience and Commonwealth recreational resources; and the development, attraction and expansion of industry, commerce, and agriculture. In sum, protection of air resources is a matter of highest priority in the Commonwealth.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-272\">\n    <em>\n     Dep't of Envtl. Res. v.
