Bean applied for leave to appeal from a sentence entered in the Unified Criminal Docket (Oxford County,\n   <em>\n    Clifford, J.\n   </em>\n   ) following his guilty plea, entered upon an agreement that his sentence would not exceed an agreed upon \"cap.\" The Sentence Review Panel granted his application for sentence review. Bean contends that, notwithstanding the cap agreement with the State, through which he pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated criminal operating under the influence (Class B), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2) (2017), and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person (Class C), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 393(1)(A-1) (2017), the sentencing court was required to explain its selection of the basic, maximum, and final periods of incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252-C (2017) ; M.R.U. Crim. P. 32(a)(3). The State argues that any error in the court's articulation of the sentence was harmless. We agree that the error was harmless, and we affirm the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b6 2] When Bean appeared in court on November 29, 2016, he pleaded guilty to what would become his tenth and eleventh convictions for operating under the influence. He entered those guilty pleas with the advice of counsel and pursuant to an agreement that the State would dismiss certain other charges against him and would recommend concurrent sentences of ten years in prison, with all but five years suspended and three years of probation, for the aggravated OUI convictions. If the court rejected the State's recommendation as too low, Bean would be allowed to withdraw his pleas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(d)-(e). With the State's agreement, Bean also reserved the right to argue that the court should exercise its discretion to sentence him to less time in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court declined Bean's request for a lower sentence and accepted the recommendation of the State. Arguing that the court did not sufficiently articulate its reasons for accepting the State's recommendation, and that the court failed to separately state basic, maximum, and suspended portions of each sentence pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252-C, Bean seeks a remand for a new sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b6 3] The details are these, taken from the record and the transcript of the sentencing. On November 21, 2015, Maine game wardens arrested Bean after he drove his truck to a hunting camp where the game wardens were present to monitor a dispute. Bean was \"very obviously intoxicated.\" The wardens conducted a series of field sobriety tests, which Bean failed. Bean then submitted to a blood alcohol test using an Intoxilyzer, and he registered a 0.21 blood alcohol content. Beside him in the passenger compartment of his truck was a rifle, which Bean was prohibited\n   from possessing because of his criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b6 4] Very shortly thereafter, on December 17, 2015, Bean was charged by indictment with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person (Class C), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 393(1)(A-1), criminal OUI (Class C), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(B)(2), and fraudulently obtaining a license or permit (Class E), 12 M.R.S. \u00a7 10757 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b6 5] On December 20, 2015-three days after his indictment for the first arrest and only one month after that arrest-Bean was arrested again. This time, a Paris police officer observed Bean driving well under the speed limit and weaving back and forth over the road. When the police officer pulled him over, Bean stated, \"I'm caught, I confess, I'm drunk, just take me to jail.\" He submitted to an Intoxilyzer test and registered a 0.29 blood alcohol content. Bean was later charged by indictment with criminal OUI (Class C), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(B)(2), attaching false plates (Class E), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2104(1) (2017), and violating a condition of release (Class E), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 1092(1)(A) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b6 6] A year after the first of the two stops, on November 29, 2016, Bean entered his pleas of guilty. He was represented by counsel. The court held a Rule 11 hearing on both indictments to determine whether to accept the plea agreement that Bean had reached with the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11. Pursuant to the agreement between Bean and the State, the State would dismiss the charges of fraudulently obtaining a license or permit, attaching false plates, and violating a condition of release. It would also dismiss the two charges of Class C criminal OUI and charge Bean by information with two counts of aggravated OUI (Class B), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2). Thus, conditioned upon the court's acceptance of the agreement, Bean entered a plea of guilty to two counts of aggravated OUI (Class B) and one count of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person (Class C). Bean waived all rights related to trial, including his right to appeal from the convictions. After accepting Bean's guilty pleas, the court proceeded immediately to the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b6 7] The State made the following recommendation to the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: [I]s the State recommending a cap on this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE STATE: Yes we are, Your Honor. On the two OUI counts, we are recommending sentences of ten years, all suspended but five years; there are minimum fines of I believe $2,100 each, as well as a six-year license suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As a rationale for this recommendation, the State pointed to Bean's high blood alcohol content and the proximity in time between the two arrests. The State also emphasized Bean's extensive history of operating under the influence, including his nine prior convictions for operating under the influence and five convictions for operating after suspension. The State contended that a more lenient sentence would fail to meet the statutory sentencing objective of restraining convicted persons in the interest of public safety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1151(1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b6 8] Bean's counsel then argued for a sentence of five years of imprisonment, with all but twenty-one months suspended, and two years of probation. In so doing, he emphasized Bean's cooperation with the arresting officers and the fact that Bean had not harmed anyone in either incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b6 9] The court accepted the State's recommendation regarding the sentences for the OUI convictions and declined to accept Bean's request for the more favorable sentence. It sentenced Bean to ten years' imprisonment, all but five years suspended,\n   with three years of probation for each count of aggravated OUI, to be served concurrently with one another. In addition, the court sentenced Bean to twenty-one months' imprisonment for the possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, also to be served concurrently with the other sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b6 10] In announcing the sentence, the court expressly acknowledged the legislatively established goals of sentencing, noting that \"the prevention of crime through the deterrent effect of sentences, the rehabilitation of convicted persons, and the restraint of convicted persons when required in the interest of public safety, all apply to this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1151 (2017). The court also stated, \"To minimize correctional sentence experiences which serve to promote further criminality also applies to every ... substantial sentence that we're talking about. And to give fair warning of the nature of the sentences that may be imposed on the conviction of a crime, to encourage differentiation among defendants with a view to [a just] individual sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The court did not specifically articulate a basic and maximum period of incarceration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252-C ; nor did the court describe its rationale for suspending a portion of the sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b6 11] Bean timely applied for leave to appeal from his sentence, and the Sentence Review Panel granted the application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R. App. P. 20(b) (Tower 2016);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2152 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b6 12] Bean contends that the sentencing court erred by failing to conduct the sentencing procedure that the Legislature has codified at 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1252-C, which was enacted following our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hewey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7360492\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/622/1151/#p1154\">\n    622 A.2d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1154-55 (Me. 1993). The State argues that any error in the court's sentencing procedure was harmless. We address each of these arguments in turn below. We also discuss the availability of a discretionary appeal where, as here, a defendant enters a plea pursuant to an agreement that the State will recommend a particular sentence as a \"cap,\" and the court imposes a sentence that does not exceed the sentence recommended by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Plea Terminology and Availability of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b6 13] The availability of a sentence appeal differs depending on the context of the sentencing. Because there are several types of potential plea circumstances and agreements, because the parties may each interpret a discussion or agreement differently, and because the language used to describe the context and any agreement will be critical to determining the availability of an appeal from the sentence, we begin by summarizing the availability of sentencing appeals in each of the various circumstances in which a defendant enters a plea of guilty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1. Open Plea\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b6 14] When a defendant enters a plea of guilty without any agreement or arrangement with the State as to the sentence that the court will be asked to impose, we refer to that as an \"open\" plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316334\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/131/\">\n    2017 ME 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316334\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/131/\">\n    156 A.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both the State and the defendant are free to present arguments on any aspect of the sentence that could be imposed. In an open plea, the parties may argue for, and the court may enter, any sentence authorized by law. The court's authority to exercise its full discretion within the law is identical to its sentencing authority following a verdict of guilty after a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b6 15] Once the defendant has pleaded guilty in an open plea, following a colloquy between the defendant and the court to assure that the defendant understands the many rights that are waived by entering the plea,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11, the court may, within the limits of the law, impose whatever sentence it determines to be justified and supported by the facts of the case. When the plea is an open plea, the defendant does not retain the right to withdraw the guilty plea after sentencing in the event that he disagrees with the final sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b6 16] Unless there has been a waiver of appeal, a defendant who enters an open plea does retain the right to file an application for review of any sentence longer than a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151 (2017). The Sentence Review Panel of the Supreme Judicial Court then has the discretion to decide whether to grant that application and allow an appeal to proceed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12316334\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/156/131/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2152. The defendant also has the right to file a direct appeal of the sentence when the constitutionality or legality of the sentence can legitimately be challenged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Hoover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328362\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/904/\">\n    2017 ME 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18, 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328362\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/169/904/\">\n    169 A.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b6 17] As with a sentence imposed by the court following a trial, the sentencing judge's full analysis of the factors outlined in section 1252-C is at its most critical in the context of an open plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Prewara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7357976\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/687/951/#p955\">\n    687 A.2d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 955 (Me. 1996) (emphasizing the need for a full analysis in the context of an open plea).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Plea Upon Joint Recommendation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b6 18] At the other end of the spectrum of possible plea agreements is a fully agreed upon plea, which we refer to as a plea upon joint recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the context of a joint recommendation plea, the defendant enters a plea of guilty, again following a thorough colloquy with the court to\n   assure that the defendant understands the rights that he is forever waiving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11(b)-(c). A plea entered upon the joint recommendation of the parties will become operative only if the court accepts the joint recommendation or imposes a sentence that is more favorable to the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(d)-(e). If the court decides that it would impose a sentence that is\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   favorable to the defendant than what the parties have jointly recommended, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, and all of his rights, including the right to trial, remain intact.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7357976\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/687/951/#p955\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b6 19] Before the court determines whether it will accept and impose the jointly recommended sentence, it will hear from the State and the defendant, and in certain circumstances, the victim, regarding the facts of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11(b), (e). The court will then undertake an analysis to assure that the sentence meets the statutory framework and sentencing goals. In many instances, the court's analysis will not be extensive because both the State and the defendant have agreed that the proposed sentence is appropriate. However, the court must assure itself and the public, among other things, that the sentence is legal, that the proposal falls within the range of the court's discretion, and that the sentence meets the sentencing goals established by the Legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b6 20] In contrast to the defendant's appellate options following an open plea, the defendant\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   have the right to file an application for discretionary review of an agreed-upon sentence when the court accepts the recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151(2) (excluding from our discretionary review sentences imposed as a result of the court accepting a plea with an agreed-upon sentence pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(a)(2) and (4) ). A defendant's application for review of a sentence entered upon joint recommendation will therefore be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b6 21] In addition, when the joint recommendation is fully accepted by the court, the defendant will be deemed to have waived any claim of constitutional disproportionality or cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Chavarria\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243581\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/251/\">\n    146 N.M. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4243581\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/146/251/\">\n    208 P.3d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900-01 (2009) (holding that a defendant who pleads guilty and understands the maximum potential sentence waives his right to appeal on grounds of cruel and unusual punishment). Moreover, any later discovered illegality in the sentence should be addressed through a motion to correct the sentence pursuant to M.R.U. Crim. P. 35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, although there may be instances in which a direct appeal may be taken to address an illegality following a plea upon joint recommendation, those instances will be rare, and a direct appeal that does not clearly assert such an illegality will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   3. Cap Plea\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b6 22] In some circumstances, as in this case, the State and the defendant may agree that the defendant will enter a guilty plea and the State will recommend a particular sentence, but the State agrees that the defendant may reserve the right to argue for a more favorable sentence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280043\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/834/\">\n    2011 ME 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280043\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/834/\">\n    26 A.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is often referred to as a \"cap plea\" because the State's recommendation becomes the harshest sentence-the cap-that the court can impose while accepting\n   the plea agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b6 23] When the sentence falls within those that are subject to an application for discretionary appellate review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151, and when the defendant has not explicitly waived the right to file such an application, the defendant may file an application for leave to appeal that part of the sentence for which the defendant reserved the right to argue to the sentencing court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b6 24] A defendant may explicitly waive his right to appeal the sentence pursuant to a plea agreement that also allows him to argue for a sentence more favorable than the State's recommendation. To accomplish such a waiver, however, the defendant must clearly and unambiguously state an intent to waive the right to appeal, and the waiver must be made on the record at the Rule 11 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b6 25] As with other types of pleas, the defendant in a cap plea may file a direct appeal of a sentence if there is a legitimate claim of illegality, including any constitutional violation. As always, however, a direct appeal that does not support a claim of actual illegality will be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Ricker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105740\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/770/1021/\">\n    2001 ME 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105740\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/770/1021/\">\n    770 A.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   B. Bean's Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b6 26] The sentence imposed on Bean followed a cap plea. At the sentencing, Bean agreed to plead guilty, knowing what sentence the State would recommend, and knowing that he would not have the right to withdraw the plea if the court accepted the State's recommendation. He did, however, reserve the right to argue for a shorter underlying sentence, for a shorter unsuspended portion of the sentence, and for a shorter term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b6 27] Bean did not explicitly waive his right to apply for a discretionary review of the sentence imposed. Accordingly, as explained above, on this cap plea Bean retained the right to apply for leave to appeal the sentence through the discretionary sentence review process set forth in 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2151.

Although he could legally have received consecutive unsuspended terms that totaled twenty years, pursuant to the State's recommended sentence cap, he did not. The sentencing court made it clear in imposing the sentence that \"the restraint of convicted persons when required in the interest of public safety\" was very much a part of the court's analysis. On this record, there can be little question that public safety demanded a substantial sentence. The court would have acted well within its discretion to have rejected the plea agreement entirely as insufficiently protective of public safety.

RELEVANT CASE HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b6 36] Before the events which gave rise to the charges leading to the sentences at issue on this appeal, Bean had a serious criminal record. That record included at least\n   <em>\n    nine\n   </em>\n   prior operating under the influence convictions, most of which were felonies. His prior record caused Bean to be designated a felon prohibited from possessing firearms by operation of 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 393(1)(A-1) (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b6 37] On November 21, 2015, Bean, \"very obviously intoxicated,\" was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants. 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A) (2017). His Intoxilyzer test registered a 0.21 blood alcohol content. Because Bean had a firearm beside him in his vehicle, he was also charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person (Class C), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 393(1)(A-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b6 38] One month later, on December 20, 2015-three days after his indictment for the charges arising from the first arrest-Bean was again arrested for operating under the influence. When stopped, Bean confessed \"I'm drunk, just take me to jail.\" This time his Intoxilyzer test registered a 0.29 blood alcohol content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b6 39] In November 2016, Bean reached an agreement with the prosecutor to plead guilty to two counts of aggravated operating under the influence (Class B), 29-A M.R.S. \u00a7 2411(1-A)(D)(2), and one count\n   of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person (Class C), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 393(1)(A-1). As part of the plea negotiations, the prosecutor agreed to recommend a sentencing cap of ten years, all but five years suspended, legislatively mandated minimum fines, and a six-year suspension of his right to operate. Bean was free to argue for a lesser sentence on the two Class B aggravated operating under the influence charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [\u00b6 40] After a sentencing hearing at which Bean argued for a lesser sentence, the court imposed a sentence on the two Class B aggravated operating under the influence charges of ten years' imprisonment with all but five years suspended and three years' probation, the sentences to be served concurrently. The court also imposed a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months on the Class C possession of a firearm by a prohibited person charge.

Because those crimes constituted separate and serious criminal actions, the court had the capacity to make those sentences consecutive, totaling twenty years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1256(2)(A), (D) (2017) (addressing consecutive sentencing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b6 43] No precedent of this Court, no reports, no body of data are available to provide the sentencing court or counsel any idea as to what the \"basic\" sentence for tenth and eleventh felony OUI convictions, for offenses committed a month apart, should be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   All the sentencing judge\n   would have, all any sentencing judge would have, would be that judge's knowledge and experience with regard to similar situations-two felony OUIs committed within a short time period and presented to the court, together, for sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b6 44] While sentencing for tenth and eleventh felony OUI convictions appears virtually unprecedented, most judges would have had some experience with sentencing for two felony OUIs, usually Class C felonies, committed, as in this case, fairly close together in time. At the time of sentencings involving the sixth and seventh, or seventh and eighth OUI convictions, being sentenced together, experience indicates that common practice in such sentencings is to impose \"consecutive maxes\"-that is, two five-year terms of incarceration imposed consecutively with no part of the sentence suspended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Horr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088937\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/407/\">\n    2003 ME 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 1-5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088937\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/407/\">\n    831 A.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming imposition of \"consecutive maxes\" for Class C OUI and habitual offender violations, plus two lesser offenses in a case involving a single driving event by an individual with a very serious prior criminal record).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b6 45] \"Consecutive maxes\" are supported by experience that repeat offenders, at this level, have demonstrated that, for them, rehabilitation efforts and driving prohibitions, enforced through probation, are a useless exercise. Removal from society, for as long as possible, has become the only alternative available to protect the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [\u00b6 46] The resulting ten-year sentence of incarceration arising from experience-based practice in multiple repeat offender OUI sentencing would have been double the five years of incarceration sentence recommended by the State, as the cap, in this case. Accordingly, had the sentencing judge properly considered and articulated the \"basic\" sentence for these crimes, based on the limited information and experience available, the court may have been required to reject the plea agreement with the five-year cap as too lenient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(d)-(e). Instead, respecting and deferring to the prosecutor's and defense counsel's experience and understanding of the case, the court appropriately went along with the plea arrangement and accepted the recommended cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b6 47] Beyond the difficulty of articulating the \"basic\" sentence and in so doing perhaps embarrassing the prosecutor and defense counsel, there is another difficulty with applying the section 1252-C standards here. Subsection (2) of section 1252-C requires that after the \"basic\" sentence is identified, a sentencing court must then \"determine the maximum period of imprisonment to be imposed by considering all other relevant sentencing factors, both aggravating and mitigating, appropriate to that case.\" Those standards require articulation of a \"maximum\" sentence that the court would set after considering aggravating and mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\u00b6 48] Like the \"basic\" sentence, the court could not have properly articulated the maximum sentence it might set because, here, that \"maximum\" sentence was established by the sentencing cap. That \"maximum\" sentence set by the cap (ten years total, five years of incarceration) was only one-quarter of the sentence of incarceration that could have been imposed had the maximum sentences on each of the Class B OUIs been imposed and had the sentences been made consecutive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b6 49] Thus, the court could not have forthrightly applied two of the three criteria articulated in section 1252-C. Because of the unique nature of the crimes-tenth and eleventh OUI offenses-in all likelihood the court would have imposed a much higher sentence, had it been considering sentencing as part of an open plea or post-trial, after conviction, without the restriction of the cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b6 50] The Court holds that the sentencing court erred in failing to articulate the court's view of the \"basic\" sentence and the \"maximum\" sentence. Court's Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. That holding, in essence, requires judges, faced with pleas to serious felonies with a cap sentencing recommendation, to sometimes embarrass the parties by criticizing a recommendation as too low and reject the plea agreement. The sentencing judge here did not do that, recognizing that a sentencing agreement may be important for the prosecution, the defense, and crime victims\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   who want to resolve the case, sometimes for reasons not apparent to the court, and avoid the tensions, rigors and uncertainty of a trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b6 51] We have faced similar situations of inadequate articulation of statutory factors, including section 1252-C factors, in sentencing, but without holding that the sentencing court erred. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Barnard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    2003 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    828 A.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defense, on a sentence review appeal, asserted that the sentencing court had considered the sentencing factors in the wrong order in its sentencing discussion. Without addressing the alleged misstatements in sentencing, we found no error, holding that \"the resulting sentence, slightly above the mandatory minimum, demonstrates no misapplication of principle.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The sentencing court's action here, stating its reasoning for its sentence and imposing a sentence that was only one-quarter of the prison term that might have been imposed, was not error and deserves similar treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   [\u00b6 52] In another analogous case, when a sentencing court did not make a statutorily required finding regarding a sentencing factor, and, as here, counsel did not request that the court address the required finding, we affirmed, holding that the sentencing court committed no error.\n   <em>\n    State v.

During sentencing, the court did not address a finding required for consecutive sentencing by 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1256(3)(B) (2017)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   that one crime was not committed to facilitate the other crime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.

We should do the same here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   III. POTENTIAL UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b6 55] The defendant's tactical decision to accept the plea arrangement with the sentencing cap and then appeal when the cap was imposed, arguing failure to articulate the criteria stated in section 1252-C, presents a considerable risk of unanticipated consequences. Had the defendant succeeded in convincing the Court that the sentencing court's failure to articulate the \"basic\" and the \"maximum\" sentences was error and that the error was not harmless, the matter would have been remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b6 56] The defendant is correct that on a sentence review, neither we nor the trial court can, on remand, increase a sentence that is subject to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2156(1-A) (2017). However, on a vacate and remand, if the sentencing court is required to articulate its determination regarding the \"basic\" sentence and the \"maximum\" sentence, the court could and perhaps would determine that the recommended cap sentences were unacceptably low. With the determination that the recommended sentence was too low, the court could reject the plea arrangement, allow Bean to withdraw his pleas, and set the matter for trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.U. Crim. P. 11A(d). After trial, a new, higher sentence likely would be imposed should Bean be found guilty-a virtual certainty considering his own admissions to operating while seriously under the influence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b6 57] The defendant, in his arguments, cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Palmer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8022920\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/468/985/#p987\">\n    468 A.2d 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987-988 (Me. 1983), to support the proposition that the sentencing court cannot increase a sentence once that sentence has been imposed.\n   <em>\n    Palmer,\n   </em>\n   which relied on United States Supreme Court precedent, was decided a quarter century before the United States Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Padilla v.

In rejecting \"opening the floodgates\" arguments apparently advanced by those concerned about the adoption of new grounds to challenge guilty pleas, the\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   Court observed that most post-conviction challenges address convictions after trial, not after plea.\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then, addressing post-conviction challenges to pleas, the Court observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The nature of relief secured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty plea-an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to trial-imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of the bargain obtained as a result of the plea. Thus, a different calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately, the challenge may result in a\n   <em>\n    less favorable\n   </em>\n   outcome for the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a conviction obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside potential.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 372-373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [\u00b6 59] The Court's warning must be taken soberly by one invoking a post-conviction challenge to a plea, or as here, seeking to undo, post-conviction, an agreement for a plea and a sentencing cap. In essence,\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   warns that a successful post-conviction challenge to a plea takes the case back to where it was before the plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the plea resulted in a felony being reduced to a misdemeanor, the felony charge may be reinstated and prosecuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   If charges were dismissed in exchange for the plea, the dismissed charges may be reinstated and prosecuted. If the charge was amended to eliminate an aggravating factor or a mandatory minimum sentence requirement, those enhancements may be reinstated and prosecuted. If the plea resulted in a lighter sentence, a more severe sentence may be imposed if there is a conviction after trial. And if the case reverts to pre-plea status, bail requirements may again be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b6 60] Thus, Bean's appeal taken here was not without considerable long-term risk if, in the short-term, he had prevailed. Because the sentencing court properly and appropriately respected the plea agreement reached by the prosecution and the defense and elected not to embarrass them by an honest articulation of the factors stated in section 1252-C, the trial court committed no error in its sentencing statement. I concur in affirming the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The lack of data to support identification of the \"basic\" sentence that could be appropriate for these crimes may-looking at the big picture-be a positive. We are probably fortunate that prosecutions and combined sentencings for OUI convictions involving the tenth and eleventh OUIs, or the ninth and tenth OUIs, or the eighth and ninth OUIs, are few and far between, making identification of the \"basic\" sentence for such offenses nearly impossible to determine with any precision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    One relevant precedent might be\n    <em>\n     State v.
