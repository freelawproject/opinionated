As the common pleas court had not originally granted Petitioner\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   (IFP) status, the Commonwealth Court's reference to Rule of Appellate Procedure 551 in its defect correction notice was in error. Instead, Rule of Appellate Procedure 552, which Petitioner followed, controlled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.A.P. 552. Because Petitioner's post-appeal IFP application was pending before the common pleas court, the Commonwealth Court should not have dismissed Petitioner's appeal for failing to comply with the defect correction notice. Furthermore, since the Commonwealth Court subsequently granted IFP status to Petitioner, no filing fee shall be required for the appeal before that court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
