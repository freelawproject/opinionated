In 2013, the victim commenced an action against the defendant seeking a dissolution of their marriage. On December 25, 2014, a dispute between the victim and the defendant escalated to the point where the defendant pushed the victim to the ground. The victim contacted the police, and the defendant was arrested for disorderly conduct. At the defendant's December 26, 2014 arraignment, the court,\n   <em>\n    Devlin, J.,\n   </em>\n   issued a protective order as a condition of the defendant's release on bail. The protective order permitted the defendant to live in the family residence, but required\n   him to surrender all firearms and provided that he could not \"assault, threaten, abuse, harass, follow, interfere with or stalk\" the victim.\n   The defendant continued to reside in the family home with the victim and their son. On January 4, 2015, the defendant pushed the victim into a safe room in the basement and closed the vault door until she pleaded to be released. In February, 2015, the victim and the couple's son moved into the home of the victim's brother. On March 17, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Doyle, J.,\n   </em>\n   issued a protective order that included the same terms as the December 26, 2014 protective order and permitted the defendant to return to the family residence one time with police to retrieve his belongings, but ordered him to otherwise stay away from that residence or wherever the victim lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 18, 2015, the victim and the couple's son moved back into the family residence. That night, the defendant telephoned the victim and threatened to take his own life and the life of the family dog if she did not cease all legal proceedings. The following day, the victim had a security company assess the family residence to install security cameras in the home. On March 19, 2015, the defendant telephoned the victim and threatened to break the security cameras. The victim informed the police, and a warrant was issued for the defendant's arrest. The defendant was arrested and charged in docket number CR-15-0283581-S with violating the March 17, 2015 protective order that prohibited him from harassing the victim. On March 30, 2015, the court,\n   <em>\n    Pavia, J.,\n   </em>\n   issued a third protective order that the defendant not contact the victim in any manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 5, 2015, the defendant had his sister, who lived in the same duplex as the victim and his son, deliver an Easter basket to his son. The defendant's sister placed the basket in the foyer of the duplex. The\n   victim noticed that the defendant had addressed an Easter card to her. The victim notified the police, and the defendant was arrested and charged in docket number CR-15-0284214-S with a violation of the March 30, 2015 protective order that prohibited him from having contact with the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 23, 2015, the victim hired a locksmith to open the vault door of the safe room in the basement. Inside the safe room was a .22 caliber Ruger pistol along with rifle and pistol ammunition. The victim informed the police. The victim also found a .25 caliber Beretta handgun in the safe room and informed the police again. The Ruger and the Beretta were both registered to a friend of the defendant, to whom he had transferred registration of the Beretta and the Ruger years earlier when he was not permitted to possess firearms. The defendant was arrested on November 29, 2015, and was charged, by way of substitute long form information in docket number CR-15-0287545-S, with criminal possession of a firearm, and a violation of the December 26, 2014 protective order requiring him to surrender all firearms and ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before trial commenced, the state moved for a consolidated trial on the charges in the three informations. The defendant filed a motion for severance arguing that the joinder of the three cases would prejudice him severely. Following a hearing, the court,\n   <em>\n    Holden, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the state's motion to consolidate. The state then filed a consolidated long form information charging the defendant with one count of criminal possession of a firearm and three counts of criminal violation of a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of one count of criminal possession of a firearm and three counts of violation of a protective order. The defendant was sentenced to seven years incarceration,\n   execution suspended after three and one-half years, with five years probation.\n   This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly consolidated the three informations for trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[I]n deciding whether to [join informations] for trial, the trial court enjoys broad discretion, which, in the absence of manifest abuse, an appellate court may not disturb.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20115\">\n    307 Conn. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). \"At trial, the burden rests with the state to prove that joinder will not substantially prejudice a defendant.

The defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the court's joinder of the three informations on the basis of the first and third\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factors only\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the prejudice could not be\n   cured by the trial court's instructions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the defendant\n   argues that \"[g]iven the inflammatory nature of the three separate cases, both alleging [the defendant's] abuse as a husband and repeated violations of criminal protective orders, the improper joinder instilled the presumption that [the defendant] had a bad character and a propensity for criminal behavior. It increased the risk that the jury simply obtained the view that [the defendant] was just another abusive husband that this state is so accustomed to of late.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the first\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factor, the defendant's three informations involved discrete, factually distinguishable scenarios.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argues that his behavior in each case involved \"several months of overlapping conduct\" wherein the violation of a protective order \"was at the core of each case.\" Although all three charges for violation of a protective order alleged violations of increasingly restrictive protective orders with different conditions, the defendant's behavior underlying each violation was not so similar so as to substantially prejudice him. One information alleged the\n   defendant violated the March 17, 2015 protective order by making a telephone call to the victim on March 18, 2015, threatening the family dog, and making a telephone call on March 19, 2015, threatening to break security cameras at the family residence. Another information stemmed from the defendant's addressing an Easter card to the victim in violation of the no contact provision of the third protective order. A third information alleged that the defendant possessed firearms in violation of the December 26, 2014 protective order. Each information alleged easily distinguishable factual scenarios. In fact, the defendant acknowledges that \"the factual scenarios for each separate offense were drastically different from one another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With respect to the third\n   <em>\n    Boscarino\n   </em>\n   factor, the trial was not particularly lengthy or complex. \"The factor, at its core, is a question of whether the jury will\n   confuse the evidence as a result of a long, complicated trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415256\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/147/53/#p100\">\n    147 Conn.

The joinder of the three informations, which alleged three separate violations of protective order counts, did not result in a trial that was long; the presentation of evidence lasted four days and thirteen witnesses were called. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    David P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1274574\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/70/462/#p469\">\n    70 Conn.

Furthermore, given the \"drastically different\" factual scenarios underlying the charges, there was little chance that the jury would confuse the evidence as to each charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court further reduced any possibility of confusion by instructing the jury that it had consolidated separate cases to be tried together and that the jury was to consider each separately. This instruction minimized any risk of prejudice that might have resulted from the\n   joinder of the three cases. \"[W]e presume, absent a fair indication to the contrary, that the jury followed the instruction of the court as to the law.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lasky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"792161\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/43/619/#p629\">\n    43 Conn.

We conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that the joinder of the informations caused him substantial or unfair prejudice.

Judge Holden denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The standard of appellate review of a denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal has been settled by judicial decision....

Section 53a-217 (a) provides in part: \"A person is guilty of criminal possession of a firearm [or] ammunition ... when such person possesses a firearm [or] ammunition ... and ... (4) knows that such person is subject to (A) a ... protective order of a court of this state that has been issued against such person, after\n   <em>\n    notice and an opportunity to be heard\n   </em>\n   has been provided to such person in a case involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendant argues that the state presented no evidence as to the element of \"notice and an opportunity to be heard\" on the charge of criminal possession of a firearm. He argues that \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (4) (A) required the court, prior to issuing the December 26, 2014 protective\n   order, to hold a hearing at which the defendant could contest the necessity of a protective order. The defendant argues that, at the December 26, 2014 arraignment, the court did not even inform him that he had a right to such a hearing. The state contends that the arraignment itself provided the defendant with the required notice and opportunity to be heard. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The text of \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (4) (A) provides that the defendant be given \"notice and an opportunity to be heard....\" The meaning of this statutory phrase may be clarified by looking at the words with which it is associated in the statute.

The notice and opportunity to be heard is to be provided to the defendant prior to the issuance of a protective order. Although \u00a7 53a-217 is a firearms statute located in the \"Miscellaneous Offenses\" chapter of the Penal Code, subsection (a) (4) (A) clearly references protective orders. Section 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute and its relationship to other statutes before consulting other sources.

For example, General Statutes \u00a7 54-82r (a), which concerns protective orders prohibiting the harassment of a witness, provides for a \"hearing at which hearsay evidence shall be admissible\" after which the court must find by a preponderance of the evidence the necessity of issuing such an order. The legislature did not include similar language in \u00a7 53a-217.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that, when interpreting the terms of one statute, we are guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law .... Legislation never is written on a clean slate, nor is it ever read in isolation or applied in a vacuum. Every new act takes its place as a component of an extensive and elaborate system of written laws.... Construing statutes by reference to others advances [the values of harmony and consistency within the law]. In fact, courts have been said to be under a duty to construe statutes harmoniously where that can reasonably be done.... Moreover, statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Agron\n   </em>\n   , supra, 323 Conn. at 638,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487868\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/148/1052/#p633\">\n    148 A.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying this principle to the terms of \u00a7 53a-217 (a) (4) (A), we conclude that the plain language of the statute, as read in connection with other statutes, demonstrates that an arraignment satisfies the requirement of \"notice and an opportunity to be heard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At trial, the state admitted as a full exhibit the transcript of the defendant's December 26, 2014 arraignment. The transcript reveals that the court informed the defendant that a protective order was being issued against him and that he was prohibited from possessing firearms. The defendant indicated that he understood that he could not possess firearms, and he inquired as to whether he was allowed to go home, to which question the court responded affirmatively. Accordingly, this transcript reveals that defendant was provided with an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the protective order. If the defendant desired an evidentiary hearing on the matter, he could have requested such a hearing at the arraignment. In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the issuance of the December 26, 2014 protective order. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not err in denying the defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In this opinion the other judges occurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    All references to \u00a7 53a-217 are to the 2014 supplement to the General Statutes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Accordingly, we do not analyze the second\n    <em>\n     Boscarino\n    </em>\n    factor, i.e., whether the crimes were of a violent nature or concerned brutal or shocking conduct on the defendant's part.
