T.C., who was seventeen at the time of the offense, acknowledged his responsibility for actions that would constitute second-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a)(1), if committed by an adult. He admitted participating with two other juveniles in the unarmed forcible theft of marijuana from the backpack of a fourth juvenile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Juvenile Pre-dispositional Report stated T.C. was originally classified as \"[m]ultiply disabled and on the [a]utistic spectrum\" beginning \"around the age of [four].\" A 2006 psychiatric evaluation stated T.C. would \"continue to have a significant amount of autistic qualities and manifested symptoms in the Pervasive Developmental Disorder spectrum.\" T.C. moved through school with the designation of developmentally disabled, although at the time of sentencing, T.C. attended school regularly, worked a part-time job, and was not taking any prescribed medications. T.C.'s developmental\n   disability was disputed by the State, but tacitly accepted by the judge without a specific ruling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In exchange for the guilty plea, the State agreed to recommend a two-year probationary term, conditioned on sixty days confinement in the Ocean County Juvenile Detention Center (OCJDC). T.C. reserved the right to argue instead for sixty days of electronic monitoring rather than custody in the detention facility, and to make the legal argument at the time of disposition that he should not receive a custodial sentence because of his developmental disability. Accepting that T.C. was developmentally disabled, the court nonetheless imposed a two-year probationary term conditioned on thirty days incarceration in the OCJDC, followed by thirty days of electronic monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because T.C. has completed the custodial term, the State argues this appeal is moot.

Under the statute's plain language as interpreted by the State, therefore, a developmentally disabled juvenile residing in a county that either has a juvenile detention facility, or has contracted with another county for the use of their juvenile commitment program, faces the risk of short-term detention following adjudication. If a developmentally disabled juvenile resides in a county that lacks a juvenile detention facility and has no contractual relationship to utilize another county's program, he or she faces no risk of short-term detention following an adjudication.
