The motion judge determined defendants could not be held liable because they did not control the radiator and therefore owed no duty of care to Jimmy. Because we conclude that, under common law and N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d), the radiator was part of the apartment's heating system subject to defendants' control, we reverse to allow a jury to determine whether defendants breached their duty owed to Jimmy, and if so, whether plaintiffs are entitled to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In reviewing a ruling on a summary judgment motion, we do so de novo under the same\n   <em>\n    Brill\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard applied by the motion judge.\n   <em>\n    Townsend v.

(Vera), staying in an apartment rented by L.C. (Linda), Vera's sister. At some point in the early morning hours, Jimmy had awakened while sleeping in a car seat, so his father took him to the bedroom and placed him in a bed to sleep with his ten-year-old step-sister, after swaddling him in blankets to prevent him from falling off the bed. The bed was adjacent to a steam-heated iron radiator. The next morning, Jimmy's step-sister discovered Jimmy lying on the floor with his head pressed against the hot radiator. After being freed, Jimmy was rushed to the\n   hospital where it was determined he had third-degree burns over three percent of his body surface-head, right cheek and left arm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the motion, over five years later, the burns had resulted in permanent scarring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Due to the seriousness of Jimmy's injury, the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office's (HCPO) investigated. Their investigation revealed that the steam heat flowing into the radiator was turned on and off from a shut-off valve at its base, and that within approximately two minutes of opening the valve, the cool radiator became so hot that it was unbearable to touch. The heat flowing to the radiator could only be manually turned on or off at the shut-off valve; there was no thermostat control in the apartment or\n   bedroom to stop or regulate the heat into the radiator when the room reached a set temperature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jimmy's mother, A.R., filed suit against defendants alleging their negligence was responsible for his injuries. In turn, a third-party complaint was filed against James, Vera and Linda contending they were in control of the apartment's heating system and failed to protect Jimmy. During the ensuing discovery, the apartment building's superintendent testified at deposition that the boiler, which supplies heat to the apartments' radiators, was located in a locked room in the building's basement under defendants' exclusive control and was not accessible by the tenants. He noted that some tenants had covers on their radiators when he started working in the building fifteen years ago. Robert Tagliareni, a stakeholder in both R &amp; M Tagliareni, LLC and Robert &amp; Maria Tagliareni, II, LLC, stated in his deposition that defendants did not provide covers for the apartments' radiators nor were they ever asked to do so. An inspector with the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) testified the apartment building's radiators were not in violation of any state law; he was never trained that N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d), which governs heating systems in multi-family dwellings, required radiators be protected with covers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following discovery, defendants were granted summary judgment dismissing all claims against them based upon their argument that they could not be held liable for Jimmy's injuries because they owed him no duty under common law or state regulation governing multi-family dwellings to cover the apartment's radiator that caused his burns. The judge denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration finding there was no demonstration that the grant of summary judgment was based upon a palpably incorrect or irrational grounds or did not appreciate the significance of probative, competent evidence.\n   <em>\n    Palombi v.

In granting defendants' summary judgment, the motion judge rejected plaintiffs' argument that defendants had a duty of care under\n   common law and N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d), to ensure that the radiator could be operated in a safe manner, and to cover it in order to protect tenants and their guests from its heat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In her common law analysis, the judge's oral opinion provided that \"defendants[ ] did not have either actual or constructive notice of the condition[, of the extremely hot radiator,] that caused [Jimmy's] injury, and as such, do not owe ... a common law duty of care to [Jimmy].\" In citing defendants' arguments, it appears the judge relied upon their assertions that there were no complaints about the radiator getting too hot; that the radiator was not cited for any code violation by state inspectors; that the radiator heat was controlled by the apartment occupants through the shut-off valve; and that they were not aware that children were staying in Linda's apartment. The judge added that Jimmy was not a tenant, and that the shut-off valve to the radiator's heat was controllable by the tenants. Consequently, the judge did not reach the issue of whether there were superceding causes of Jimmy's injury. We disagree with these legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is well-settled that a landlord has a common law duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the premises in a reasonably safe condition to guard against foreseeable dangers arising from the use of the premises.\n   <em>\n    Scully v.

We add that since the dangerous condition existed at the time of the letting, to the landlords' knowledge, actual or constructive, the duty to remedy came into being at the inception of the tenancy. Their liability did not depend upon receipt thereafter of further notice of the hazard in sufficient time prior to the child's injury to rectify it. The dangerous condition, if found to be such by the jury, being in existence at the time of the letting and the landlords having retained control of the heating system, they were under a continuing duty throughout the tenancy of using reasonable care to eliminate it.

In this case, since the apartment unit lacks a thermostat, the radiator's temperature remains within defendants' control because the temperature of the heat in a tenant's apartment is regulated at the sole discretion of the defendants. For example, plaintiffs' expert reported the apartment building's boiler heats \"steam at atmospheric temperature ... [of] 212 [degrees].\" As a result, tenants have no access to, and in turn, no ability to adjust the temperature of the heat entering their apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We believe that the shut-off valve and the lack of a thermostat in the apartment, in reality, results in an ineffective or illusory transfer of the temperature control of the heating system. The shut-off valve only allows the flow of heat to the radiator to be manually turned on or off. Meaning that when the apartment's occupants are sleeping and the heat makes the radiator extremely hot, as was the case here, someone would have to wake up and shut off the valve to prevent the hazardous condition of an unbearable-to-touch radiator. Thus, Linda and her guests had an ineffective or unrealistic way to control the apartment's heat. Similarly, their inability to control the heat emanating from the radiator through a thermostat, makes them vulnerable to the radiator's extreme heat because defendants remain in \"control\" of the temperature of the heat stemming from the boiler and going into the radiator. Indeed, the absence of a thermostat makes it highly impractical for an occupant to maintain control of the heat coming from the radiator. Nevertheless, as plaintiffs argue, a cover on the radiator would have guarded against burns from contact with the hot radiator. In fact, defendants were aware\n   through the building superintendent that some apartments' radiators were protected with covers. And as was the situation in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , there is nothing in the record to suggest it was unreasonably burdensome for defendants to cover the radiators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We do not agree with the motion judge's suggestion that the absence of prior injury or complaints concerning the uncovered radiator is dispositive of defendant's lack of actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition, thereby justifying dismissal of the action. First,\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   stated that if the jury finds there was a dangerous condition in existence at the time the apartment was leased and the landlord retains control over it, the landlord still has a duty to eliminate the condition. Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that they do not have to show defendants had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition where the condition was created by defendants and existed at the time the apartment was leased to Linda.

The same can be said for the lack of any violations issued by DCA. Finally, because a landlord's duty to protect a tenant extends to his or her guests, we find it of no import that defendants were not aware that James was visiting or staying in Linda's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based upon the circumstances here, we conclude that under common law, defendants had sufficient control over the heating system that extended a duty of care to Jimmy as a guest staying\n   in the apartment.

The judge determined that since the phrase \"heating system\" is immediately followed in the regulation by the phrase \"including such parts as heating risers, ducts and hot water lines,\" and does not mention radiators, the regulation does not define radiators as part of the heating system.

Including a radiator as part of the apartment's heating system is a logical and sensible interpretation of the regulation's fundamental purpose. The regulation clearly seeks to protect tenants and their guests from being burned from \"chance contact\" with parts of the heating system. We can think of no part of an apartment's heating system that individuals are more likely to be in contact with than the radiator, which is in the room to provide heat. We would not reach this conclusion if the regulation plainly stated radiators are \"excluded as\" or \"are not\" part of the heating system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As for the deposition testimony of the DCA inspector that based upon his training he does not believe that radiators must be covered as part of N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d), it bears no significance in aiding our interpretation of the regulation. His comment cannot be regarded as DCA's official position interpreting the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   And based upon the limited record before us, we cannot say that the lack of any state-issued violations for uncovered radiators is determinative of DCA's interpretation. Given our plain meaning interpretation of N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d), we see no purpose in seeking guidance from a court outside our jurisdiction as the motion judge did in finding persuasive a New York state court decision that a radiator is not part of the heating system under their state regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We therefore conclude, as a matter of law, plaintiffs can argue at trial that the regulation imposes a duty of care upon defendants to guard the radiator to prevent it from burning Jimmy, and that the duty was breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lastly, while we rely upon\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   in determining defendants had a common law duty of care towards Jimmy, we find no merit in plaintiffs' argument that\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   also requires us to conclude that a duty of care existed under N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d). Although the same regulatory language existed when the accident occurred in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , the regulation was not applied because the accident happened in a two-family house that was not covered by the regulation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1934705\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/54/58/#p63\">\n    54 N.J. at 64-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=253%20A.2d%20167\">\n    253 A.2d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's mention of the regulation was merely to support its position that the up-pipe was part of the heating system in dwellings under the regulation's jurisdiction. We do not construe the Court's remark \"that a protective covering or shield is readily available for the unit of pipe\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    radiator\n   </em>\n   at modest cost[,]\" as the Court's definitive ruling that a radiator is part of the heating system under the regulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=253%20A.2d%20167\">\n    253 A.2d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Given that the injury in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   was not caused by a radiator, coupled with the non-applicability of the regulation then in effect, we find no basis that our interpretation of N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d) should be guided by the comment in\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , which is essentially dicta. Nonetheless, for the different reasons noted above, we conclude the regulation includes a radiator as part of the heating system under defendants' control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, we conclude a jury should be able to consider whether defendants breached their duty of care to Jimmy under common law and N.J.A.C. 5:10-14.3(d).
