Lagano (Estate). We agree with the trial court that disclosure for use in civil litigation is permissible \"upon a showing of good cause\" under N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-17(c). We disapprove the contrary ruling in\n   <em>\n    In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Spinelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878547\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/212/526/\">\n    212 N.J.

We also affirm the court's finding of good cause for disclosure in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   However, we vacate the orders to the extent they allowed the disclosure of information revealing the roles of confidential informants. We remand for the trial court to consider whether disclosure will reveal a person was a confidential informant for a particular agency, in a particular investigation, during a particular period, or in a particular way, and to consider whether disclosure of such particular information was justified by the Estate's showing. We also remand for entry of a broader protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal relates to \"Operation Jersey Boyz,\" an extensive joint investigation by the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office (BCPO) and the New Jersey State Police. Between August and November 2004, a Passaic County Law Division judge (original judge) issued wiretap orders and communication data warrants. In December 2004, officers under the command of Michael Mordaga, then the BCPO Chief of Detectives, conducted a series of raids which were the culmination of the \"Jersey Boyz\" investigation. Over forty people were arrested during the raids, including Frank P. Lagano. Lagano was charged\n   with racketeering, promoting gambling, conspiracy to promote gambling, and two counts of criminal usury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In January 2005, the BCPO initiated a civil forfeiture action in Bergen County against monies seized in the \"Jersey Boyz\" raids.\n   <em>\n    State v. $1,297,522.20\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. L-0311-05. That included $264,428 in cash seized from the residence of Lagano and his wife and from their safety deposit boxes at two banks. Lagano filed an answer asserting that the seized funds were not connected to any criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a December 14, 2006 order and sealed opinion, the original judge suppressed the \"Jersey Boyz\" wiretaps, communication data warrants, and search warrants, and \"the fruits thereof.\" The record of these proceedings were sealed. The BCPO appealed and we reversed as to seven warrants, remanded three warrants for further hearings, and affirmed the suppression of sixteen warrants, including each of the three wiretaps that captured or referenced Lagano. We impounded our opinion, as well as the appellate briefs and appendices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 12, 2007, Lagano was fatally shot in East Brunswick. The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office (MCPO) commenced a still-open investigation into his death. Thereafter, the Estate asserted its interest in the seized $264,428 in the forfeiture action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The forfeiture action was stayed for six years during the suppression proceedings and subsequent ex parte litigation before the original judge by the BCPO and the Office of the Attorney General (the State) regarding legal issues stemming from the \"Jersey Boyz\" wiretaps and warrants. After the stay was lifted, the Estate sought discovery. However, the State refused to produce the documentation sought on the grounds it was under seal by the prior orders of the Law Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2012, the Estate filed a motion to unseal and compel the production of all relevant discovery. Another Law Division judge denied the motion and a motion to reconsider. On June 26, 2013, that judge granted summary judgment to the BCPO. However, we reversed and remanded, ruling the Estate's submissions created a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    State v. $1,297,522.20\n   </em>\n   , No. A-0208-13 (App. Div. Dec. 7, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Meanwhile, in August 2012, the Estate filed a civil complaint against the BCPO and Mordaga in federal district court, Docket No. 12-CV-0441. The majority of its factual averments were based on allegations made by James Sweeney, a now-deceased former investigator, in a 2010 complaint he filed following his termination by the Division of Criminal Justice (DCJ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Lagano v.

The federal district court dismissed the Estate's claims on the grounds that the defendants were acting on behalf of the State, that the BCPO had sovereign immunity, that Mordaga had qualified immunity, and that count three was barred by the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 853-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We disagree for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, \u00a7 2517(3)'s counterpart in the Wiretap Act is not section 17(c) but section 17(b), which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Any person who, by any means authorized by this act, has obtained any information concerning any wire, electronic or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this act, may disclose the contents of such communications or derivative evidence while giving testimony under oath or affirmation\n   <em>\n    in any criminal proceeding\n   </em>\n   in any court of this or another state or of the United States\n   <em>\n    or before any\n   </em>\n   federal or State\n   <em>\n    grand jury\n   </em>\n   [.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [ N.J.S.A. 2A:156A-17(b) (emphasis added).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Unlike \u00a7 2517(3), section 17(b) was never amended to broaden \"any criminal proceeding\" to \"any proceeding.\" Nonetheless, that is irrelevant here because the Estate does not seek disclosure under section 17(b), but under section 17(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As New Jersey's counterpart to \u00a7 2517(3) is section 17(b), there is no reason why we should seek guidance on section 17(c) from \u00a7 2517(3), let alone from an amendment Congress adopted years after our Legislature enacted section 17, or from federal cases interpreting that amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, section 17(c) is not derived from Title III at all. That is clear from review of the Wiretap Act's legislative history.

On appeal, the State has not provided us with any of those items. Nor has the State argued that a showing of good cause was not made as to those items. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's finding of good cause for disclosure of these items in general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Nonetheless, the trial court applied the wrong standard in ruling on disclosures concerning confidential informants. The court examined whether it was publicly known if a person had ever been a confidential informant for any agency. The court's focus was too general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In considering whether to disclose wiretap information that may reveal a confidential informant provided particular information or cooperation, it is insufficient to consider merely whether it has been publicly known that a person cooperated with any law enforcement agency, in any investigation, at any time, in any way. Even if it is publicly known that a person cooperated with a law enforcement agency in an investigation, at some time, in some way, the danger to that person may increase greatly if a court allows the disclosure of his cooperation with a different agency, in a different investigation, at a different time, or in a different way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It may be that the level of danger to the person from her publicly-known cooperation will not be increased by disclosure of her cooperation with another agency, in another investigation, in another way, or at another time. However, the court must make that assessment and must determine if any increased risk precludes disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The State does argue that if the suppressed wiretaps and related evidence are unsealed, the disclosure and use of the materials should be subject to tighter restrictions than those contained in the trial court's protective order. We agree and remand for purposes of modifying the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The trial court's December 1, 2016 order ordered disclosure of the wiretap and other information to the Estate, but did not restrict the Estate's revelation of that information. The State filed a motion seeking reconsideration or, \"in the alternative, that the content of the decision and sealed materials be released 'only to the attorneys involved in the civil litigation and [that the court] prohibit further disclosure or use' \" without court approval. The court's December 15, 2016 amended order added that \"the electronic\n   communications ... in which Frank P. Lagano was referenced/captured\" would be disclosed to the Estate \"with a protective order for use only as permitted in the civil litigation.\" No protective order was issued covering the remaining wiretap materials and other materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Estate cites a federal magistrate judge's November 7, 2016 order that provided \"any documents that have been withheld due to confidentiality concerns and the lack of an effective Discovery Confidentiality Order in this matter shall be produced immediately under an 'Attorneys' Eyes Only' designation.\" However, the magistrate judge's April 20, 2017 \"Discovery Confidentiality Order\" permitted disclosure to the parties. It also provided that \"[i]f the Superior Court of New Jersey releases any materials to the parties in this matter without specific instructions as to restrictions of confidentiality or disclosure, counsel shall meet and confer ... in a good faith effort to agree on any proposed [confidential] designation and restrictions applicable to such materials.\" In any event, the magistrate judge's order applies only in the federal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Estate made a showing of need only to use the wiretap materials in the forfeiture and civil litigation, not to use them in any other way or reveal them publicly. Moreover, the State alleged Lagano and others were members of organized crime, and the Estate alleged revelation to members of organized crime of Lagano's role as a confidential informant led to his murder. Those allegations, though not yet proven, caution against any wider disclosure than necessary, particularly concerning confidential informants. Given those factors, additional protections are necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Our concern is particularly heightened by the potential disclosure of persons who cooperated as confidential informants. \"While [appellate courts] normally defer to a trial court's ... formulation of protective orders, unless the court has abused its discretion, deference is inappropriate if the court's determination in drafting its order is based on a mistaken understanding of the\n   applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    Payton v.
