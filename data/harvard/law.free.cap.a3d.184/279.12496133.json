On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that her complaint failed, as a matter of law, to allege facts that would bring it within the intentional tort exception to the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 et seq., as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff's third revised complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   contains two counts, one against each defendant, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress. Both counts allege identical facts. The plaintiff's claims arise out of a work\n   related incident that occurred on February 26, 2014. At that time, the plaintiff was a tenured teacher in the New Haven public school system at Lincoln-Bassett Elementary School (school) in New Haven. Jones-Generette was the principal, and O'Brien was the assistant principal, for the school during the 2013-2014 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the summer of 2013, the defendants instituted a policy for the school regarding student discipline. The policy established that the administrators of the school would not be involved in any issues related to student discipline. In accordance with the policy, the defendants \"refused to allow classroom teachers to send disruptive students out of the classroom to a different environment, refused to intervene in any disrupted classroom, refused to discipline disruptive or violent students or to permit classroom teachers to discipline disruptive or violent students, refused to allow help to be summoned from outside of the school under any circumstances, and refused to provide any protection whatsoever to teachers confronted with disruptive or violent students.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the 2013-2014 school year, violence at the school escalated. On February 26, 2014, two students assaulted the plaintiff in her classroom, knocking her to the floor. As a result of the assault, the plaintiff severely sprained her left ankle and knee. The plaintiff was unable to stand, so she called out for help. Adrianna Petrucci, the teacher in the classroom across the hall, responded to the plaintiff's call for help. The plaintiff was in pain, lying on the floor, and Petrucci immediately called the school's main office for assistance. Petrucci \"also sent a text message to ... O'Brien, stating: '[The plaintiff] is on the floor in her room from being shoved out of the way.' \" After receiving the text message, O'Brien told Petrucci to send a student to the office. Petrucci repeated that the plaintiff \"is on the floor\" in\n   her classroom, and O'Brien responded that she did not know what that meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although O'Brien did not send security to assist the plaintiff or go to the classroom herself, she sent the school nurse to help the plaintiff. While the nurse and another teacher helped place the plaintiff in a wheelchair, some students began fighting in the classroom; the defendants still had not gone to the plaintiff's classroom. The plaintiff alleged that \"Jones-Generette was standing down at the end of the hallway doing nothing. At no point was 911 called, and at no point was any outside assistance summoned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff alleged that the defendants' conduct was \"wilful and malicious. It was carried out for the conscious purpose of\n   causing physical and emotional injury to the plaintiff and other teachers and to cause conditions in the school to deteriorate so badly that the state of Connecticut would offer special financial assistance to the school, which otherwise would not have been available. The said conduct was carried out in conscious disregard of the injuries it would cause to the plaintiff, to other teachers, and to the students in the school.\" The plaintiff further alleged that the defendants' conduct \"was extreme and outrageous and was carried out with the knowledge that it would cause the plaintiff to suffer severe emotional distress.\" The plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that she suffered physical injuries and emotional distress as the result of the defendants' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's third revised complaint. They argued that the plaintiff's claims are barred by the exclusivity provision of the act because the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to support the claim that the defendants' conduct was wilful or malicious. Following a hearing on June\n   22, 2015, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Nazzaro, J.\n   </em>\n   , issued a memorandum of decision granting the defendants' motion to strike. The court concluded that there was \"nothing in the complaint to suggest that there was intent on the part of the defendants to cause the plaintiff's particular injuries.\" Specifically, the court held that \"the defendants' failure to take action does not demonstrate that they intended to cause the harmful situation under which the plaintiff suffered injury, and therefore their actions do not fall within an exception [to] the exclusivity provision of the [a]ct. Accordingly, the plaintiff has not set forth a legally sufficient cause of action.\" The plaintiff filed a notice of intent to appeal on October 9, 2015, and, thereafter, the trial court,\n   <em>\n    Blue, J.\n   </em>\n   , granted the defendants' motion for judgment and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review and legal principles that govern our resolution of this appeal. \"The standard of review on an appeal challenging the granting of a motion to strike is well established. A motion to strike challenges the legal sufficiency of a pleading, and, consequently, requires no factual findings by the trial court. As a result, our review of the court's ruling is plenary.... We take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint that has been stricken and we construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.... Thus, [i]f facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied.... [W]e assume the truth of both the specific factual allegations and any facts fairly provable thereunder.... A [motion to strike] admits all facts well pleaded; it does not admit legal conclusions or the truth or accuracy of opinions stated in the pleadings.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mercer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Champion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778510\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/139/216/#p223\">\n    139 Conn.

According to the plaintiff, this policy of inaction, and the defendants' failure to take action once the plaintiff had been injured, were \"carried out for the conscious purpose of causing physical and emotional injury to the plaintiff and other teachers\" in order to receive financial assistance from the state of Connecticut.

As in\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   , there is no allegation that the defendants directed or authorized the students to assault the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's factual allegations do not support the conclusory allegation that the defendants intended to cause the plaintiff's injuries. In fact, the complaint contains factual allegations that undermine the plaintiff's claim that the defendants intended to cause her to suffer physical and emotional injuries. For example, the complaint alleges that O'Brien sent a nurse to assist the\n   plaintiff, which is inconsistent with an intent to cause the plaintiff any type of harm. Additionally, the complaint alleges that Jones-Generette stood at the end of the hallway doing nothing during the incident, but there is no allegation that Jones-Generette even knew what had happened to the plaintiff. Accordingly, the plaintiff's complaint is devoid of any factual allegations that would support her conclusory allegation that the defendants actually intended to injure the plaintiff. At best, the plaintiff's complaint alleges that the defendants condoned violence in the school, which is insufficient to establish that the defendants actually intended to injure the plaintiff. See\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New Haven\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3409752\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/92/558/#p560\">\n    92 Conn.

The plaintiff argues that the factual allegations establish that her \"injuries were known to the defendants to be a substantially certain consequence of their actions.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Although it is less demanding than the actual intent standard, the substantial certainty standard is, nonetheless, an intentional tort claim requiring an appropriate showing of intent to injure on the part of the defendant....

To satisfy the\n   substantial certainty standard, a plaintiff must show more than that [a] defendant exhibited a lackadaisical or even cavalier attitude toward worker safety ....

On appeal, this court noted that such allegations \"address negligence rather than intentional misconduct.\" Id., at 689,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20A.2d%20764\">\n    767 A.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants affirmatively failed to take certain actions and that they knew the plaintiff's injuries would occur as the result of their policy of inaction. Although the plaintiff has framed the defendants' failure to take action as \"intentional conduct,\" the plaintiff's claim is indistinguishable from the plaintiff's claim in\n   <em>\n    Melanson\n   </em>\n   . At best, the defendants' conduct, as alleged in the complaint, establishes a \"lackadaisical or even cavalier attitude towards worker safety ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lake Compounce Theme Park, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5749551\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/277/113/#p118\">\n    277 Conn. at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20A.2d%20810\">\n    889 A.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants' allegedly wrongful conduct \"is not the equivalent of ordering [a] soldier to walk through a mine field all by himself just to see if it was working.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Melanson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    West Hartford\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1158565\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/61/683/\">\n    61 Conn. App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   689 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=767%20A.2d%20764\">\n    767 A.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the plaintiff has alleged that the defendants implemented a policy denying assistance to teachers with the intent to cause her physical and emotional injury, she has failed to allege sufficient facts that would establish that the defendants intentionally created a situation that they believed was substantially certain to cause\n   the plaintiff's injuries. Accordingly, the plaintiff's\n   complaint fails to state a cause of action under the substantial certainty prong of\n   <em>\n    Suarez II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the plaintiff failed to allege facts that, if proven, would be sufficient to allow recovery under either the actual intent standard or the substantial certainty standard. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The plaintiff initially filed her complaint against the Board of Education of the city of New Haven (board), Jones-Generette, and O'Brien. Following the trial court's granting of the defendants' first motion to strike, the plaintiff withdrew the action as to the board. All references to the defendants in this opinion are to Jones-Generette and O'Brien.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The defendants filed a request to revise the original complaint on December 4, 2014, and the plaintiff then filed a revised complaint on December 5, 2014. Thereafter, the defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiff's revised complaint on December 22, 2014, which the trial court granted on February 23, 2015. The plaintiff then filed the operative complaint on April 13, 2015.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
