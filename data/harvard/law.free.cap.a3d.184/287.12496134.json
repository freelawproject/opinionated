In its complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the commission, \"as a matter of practice,\" assumes and retains jurisdiction over complaints without conducting a proper merit assessment review and makes improper reasonable cause determinations, in contravention of its statutory and regulatory obligations. More specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the commission routinely fails to comply with the strictures of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-83 and \u00a7\u00a7 46a-54 -42a (a) and 46a-54 -49a (b) of\n   the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   By\n   so doing, the commission allegedly has engaged in improper rulemaking and has violated the plaintiff's due process rights, as secured by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the commission has engaged in improper rulemaking by engaging in certain \"routine practices\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and has \"violated the procedural and substantive due process rights of the [plaintiff] by engaging in [those] practices.\" The complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment \"that General Statutes \u00a7 46a-71\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not\n   apply to the [plaintiff], and that the [commission] does not have jurisdiction over complaints filed by independent contractors against the [plaintiff].\" (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Apart from such declaratory relief, the complaint requests a permanent injunction \"enjoining the [commission] from engaging in improper rulemaking ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   and requiring [it] to follow its statutory mandate to engage in proper merit assessment reviews, to dismiss complaints during the merit assessment review process where no reasonable cause exists, to engage in proper substantive review during the early legal intervention process, and to refrain from attempting to assume jurisdiction over matters outside the jurisdiction of the agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint further requests a writ of mandamus ordering the commission \"to review all of its files regarding complaints of discriminatory employment practices since 2011\" to determine whether the commission engaged in any of the routine practices enumerated in its complaint. See footnote 4 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the commission filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the plaintiff's failure to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the filing of memoranda\n   of law by the parties, the court heard argument on the motion.

As our Supreme Court has explained, \"separation of powers principles [underlie] the exhaustion doctrine, namely, to foster an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review, offering a reviewing court the benefit of the agency's findings and conclusions. It relieves courts of the burden of prematurely deciding questions that, entrusted to an agency, may receive a satisfactory administrative disposition and avoid the need for judicial review.... Moreover, the exhaustion doctrine recognizes the notion, grounded in deference to [the legislature's] delegation of authority to coordinate branches of [g]overnment, that\n   <em>\n    agencies, not the courts, ought to have primary responsibility for the programs that\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    the legislature\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    has charged them to administer\n   </em>\n   ....
