She was found guilty of the lesser-included offense of second-degree vehicular homicide, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5(a), third-degree assault by auto, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(2), and related motor vehicle offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because of errors in the sentence, however, we remanded the matter. Contrary to our decision, the trial judge on January 13, 2017, imposed the same terms of imprisonment, employing virtually the same analysis of statutory aggravating and mitigating factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1. We again vacate and remand, this time directing that a different judge resentence defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The circumstances of the offenses found in the trial record are fully described in our earlier unpublished opinion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. Div. July 22, 2016). We provide new factual circumstances developed during the second sentence hearing in the relevant sections of our discussion. By way of introduction, it is necessary only to reiterate that the\n   State's forensic psychopharmacologist testified at the trial that when defendant crashed into the victims' car, her blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was likely .23 percent. She was driving at approximately fifty-three miles per hour in a thirty-five mile per hour zone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The driver of the car she struck, Fred Seeman (Seeman),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was severely injured. He had been turning into his driveway at the moment of impact. Seeman's wife, Helene, died from her injuries at the scene. Her death was witnessed by the Seemans' youngest son, then a teenager, who ran out\n   of the house when he heard the sound of the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    First Sentence and Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant was first sentenced on February 14, 2013. The trial judge then downgraded the lesser-included second-degree conviction for vehicular homicide to a third-degree crime. He imposed a term of three years' imprisonment on that offense, but did not include the three-year parole bar mandated by N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5(b)(1). The judge sentenced defendant to a concurrent three-year term of imprisonment on the assault by auto conviction. The State appealed the sentence; defendant cross-appealed the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to the sentence date, defendant voluntarily reported to the county jail and was therefore in custody when sentenced. She was released from prison on June 12, 2015, after serving eighty-five percent of her three-year sentence as called for by the No Early Release Act (NERA), N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2. She is presently serving her parole supervision term as required by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Significant time passed between the conviction and the direct appellate review that followed because, after being represented by private counsel during the trial, defendant sought the services of\n   the Public Defender's Office, a request initially opposed by the prosecutor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial judge justified the downgrade primarily because of the impact that defendant's imprisonment would have on her children, and her successful efforts at controlling her alcoholism. We reiterated black-letter law that the focus of the downgrade decision must be the severity of the crime, not defendant's personal circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Out of an abundance of respect for that significant and noteworthy accomplishment, we couched reversal of the sentencing decision in neutral terms. But we clearly explained\n   that the sentence was erroneous, beginning with the failure to impose the mandated parole bar, followed by the failure to adhere to the statutory analysis on the downgrade of the second-degree\n   conviction to a third, and ending with the failure to impose consecutive sentences for the grave harm inflicted on two separate victims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court held that a mandatory minimum sentence,\n   when based on a judicial finding of fact, \"cannot survive constitutional scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081737\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/317/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The indictment in this case, which charged first-degree aggravated manslaughter, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-4(a)(1), made no mention of defendant's intoxication. Neither did the verdict sheet submitted to the jury, which included the option of the lesser-included second-degree vehicular homicide offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5(a) states that \"[p]roof that the defendant was driving while intoxicated in violation of R.S. 39:4-50... shall give rise to an inference that the defendant was driving recklessly.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5(b)(1) then goes on to state that when a defendant operates a motor vehicle\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   with a blood alcohol concentration at or above the prohibited level as prescribed in R.S. 39:4-50, ... the defendant shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment by the court. The term of imprisonment shall include the imposition of a minimum term. The minimum term shall be fixed at or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by the court or three years, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lastly, N.J.S.A. 2C:11-5b(2) provides \"[t]he court shall not impose a mandatory sentence pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the grounds therefor have been established at a hearing.\" The hearing can take place \"at the time of sentencing,\" and requires that the prosecutor establish by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant's BAC was at or above the .08 level found in N.J.S.A. 39:4-50. This procedure, as the trial judge found during the remand sentence hearing,\n   was unconstitutional after the\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   decision. The doctrine clearly applies to cases, such as this one, that were in the pipeline after the date of decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grate\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081737\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/317/\">\n    220 N.J. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081737\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/220/317/\">\n    106 A.3d 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   issue was not raised on appeal. We should have, but did not, sua sponte consider the effect of\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Grate\n   </em>\n   on our remand decision. At the remand sentence proceeding, the trial judge correctly concluded that he could not impose the three-year minimum parole bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial judge also downgraded the third-degree offense of assault by auto related to Seeman's injuries to a fourth-degree offense. N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(2) states that \"assault by auto ... is a crime of the third degree if the person drives the vehicle while [intoxicated] in violation of R.S. 39:4-50... and serious bodily injury results.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(1) makes a person guilty of assault by auto when a \"person drives a vehicle ... recklessly and causes either serious bodily injury or bodily injury to another. Assault by auto ... is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Since the jury made no findings as to defendant's intoxication, grading the crime as a third-degree offense was no longer constitutional. The conviction could survive only if molded to the fourth-degree crime defined in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    The Remand Sentence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial judge understood the remand as requiring him only to more fully explain his reasons for the sentence. He supported this view by citing to the portion of our decision in which we said, as appellate courts often do, that we took no position with regard to any new sentence he might impose. In reiterating the same perspective he expressed during the first sentencing proceeding, the judge disregarded our extensive discussion regarding the legal standard for a downgrade. As he did at the initial sentencing hearing, the judge on remand focused on the personal circumstances particular to this defendant and not the severity of the crimes she had committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After explaining that\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   prevented the imposition of a parole bar on the second-degree offense and mandated the reduction of the third-degree assault to a fourth-degree offense, the judge added \"[t]he purpose of sentencing law starts with the proposition that our [s]tatutes address correction and rehabilitation of offenders, differentiation among offenders, with a view toward individualization, and justness in their treatment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judge again gave slight weight to aggravating factor nine. N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(9). He found in mitigation factors two, four, six, eight, nine, and eleven. N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(2), (4), (6), (8), (9), (11). The judge again downgraded the vehicular homicide from a second-degree offense to a third-degree crime, imposing the lowest possible term of imprisonment within that range. He sentenced defendant to\n   <em>\n    precisely\n   </em>\n   the same term on the vehicular homicide-a three-year term of imprisonment-with an eighteen-month sentence on the now fourth-degree assault by auto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because the trial judge was presented with evidence that defendant had been sober since the conviction, he opined that aggravating factor nine had slight weight, and he found that there was no need to deter her from future acts of drunken driving. The judge gave no weight to the need for general deterrence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In 2017, the judge focused, as he did in 2013, on mitigating factor eleven, the potential harm incarceration would inflict on defendant's children. He was presented with a psychological report stating that defendant's reincarceration would traumatize her children and potentially have lifelong\n   consequences. At the time of the second sentence, defendant was divorced, the children were in the sole custody of their father, and they saw their mother every other weekend and one evening a week. The youngest child, who suffers from Crohn's Disease, had physically stabilized, and was no longer dependent upon her mother for basic nutrition, as was alleged during the first sentence hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As to the downgrade, the judge stated that there was \"no compelling, or persuasive reason to return this [d]efendant to prison.\" He added, \"[a]lthough the degree of crime is the focus of the sentence, facts personal to the [d]efendant may be considered in the sentencing process.\" Since he viewed defendant's offense as unlikely to recur, he considered it unnecessary to impose even a five-year sentence, the lowest in the second-degree range for vehicular homicide. He calculated that a five-year sentence would require defendant to return to prison for a minimum of 20.4\n   months under NERA, while serving \"no legitimate sentencing purpose, other than retribution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   That defendant killed one person and significantly injured another, the judge opined, did not \"rule the day.\" He added that in viewing \"the fairness of the overall sentence,\" \"[d]efendant's conduct may constitute multiple offenses, [but] the sentencing phase concerns the disposition of a single, not a multiple human being.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The judge described\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   as a guideline which left a \"fair degree of discretion with the sentencing court.\" Although two victims might seem to require a consecutive sentence, \"[a] qualitative analysis [rendered] a different result.\" Focusing on his favorable view of defendant's rehabilitative efforts after the accident, he considered a concurrent sentence to be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judgment of conviction states that the court found aggravating factor nine, and mitigating factors six, seven, eight, nine, and eleven.

He added, among other things, that the sentence did not send any message to the public that drunk drivers should be stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The State requested the judge find aggravating factor one because the offense circumstances went far beyond reckless driving and causing death, the two elements of vehicular homicide.

That person realized defendant was drunk and attempted to stop her from driving. Defendant left the scene of that accident, and before colliding with the Seemans' vehicle, passed cars in a no-pass zone, knocked over a mailbox, ran a red light, and tailgated other drivers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Despite this additional driving behavior, which jeopardized others on the roadway, the trial judge did not find aggravating factor one, concerned that to do so would be to impermissibly \"double count.\" We agree that a court may not double count a fact that establishes an element of the offense as a basis to support an aggravating or mitigating factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Factor two, also requested by the State, only requires harm greater than that necessary to satisfy the statutory elements of the crime. N.J.S.A. 2C:12-1(c)(1) states that a person \"is guilty of assault by auto ... when the person drives a vehicle ... recklessly and causes [ ] serious bodily injury.\" The extent of the harm done to Seeman exceeded that required to satisfy the element of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The State also argued at the resentence hearing that the record supported aggravating factor three, the risk of re-offense.

Payments by insurance companies do not advance the rehabilitation goals found in the restitution statutes. Thus, it is not clear to us on this record that the factor should have been accorded any weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   We also question the judge's findings regarding mitigating factors eight and nine, that defendant's conduct is unlikely to recur, and that she is unlikely to reoffend. In 2001, this defendant was granted a conditional discharge in municipal court for marijuana possession. Although far from a conviction, and occurring years before, this contact with the system went\n   unmentioned. It undermines the judge's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Mitigating factors eight and nine are not intended to trigger predictions that lack anchors in the record. Driving and consuming alcohol are not uncommon experiences. This was not defendant's first brush with the system. The judge did not focus on the nature of the crime and defendant's past history. Her sobriety alone, no matter how laudable, is not adequate support for those mitigating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The trial judge on remand, like at the first sentence proceeding, also attributed significant weight to mitigating factor eleven, which calls upon a court to consider the hardships inflicted on children from the incarceration of their parents. He concluded, based on the therapist's letter to the court, that they would suffer hardship \"well beyond that encountered and suffered by everyone whose kids are subjected to parental imprisonment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The judge's statement unwittingly minimizes the harm done to the children of all incarcerated defendants. That minimization was unsupported in the record. We are not so certain that these children's suffering and trauma, short- and long-term, is any different in nature than the suffering unfortunately inflicted upon all young children whose parents are incarcerated. The suffering of this defendant's children is better documented, but there is no\n   evidence that their experience is different in quality from that of others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In fact, these children will continue to live with their custodial parent regardless of their mother's incarceration, and have the benefit of loving grandparents and other caretakers. These children will enjoy a relatively stable and comfortable life, financially and otherwise, even if their mother is re-incarcerated. They have strong support from defendant and others who love them, as well as therapeutic resources. We agree with the judge's conclusion that mitigating factor eleven was supported by the record, but not with the weight it was given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The first prong of the downgrade analysis requires the mitigating factors to substantially outweigh the aggravating factors.

Although we consider it important to briefly explain our disagreement with the judge's application of the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   guidelines, at this point it is no more than an academic exercise albeit one we believe is important.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Our colleagues in\n   <em>\n    State v. Liepe\n   </em>\n   , 2018 N.J. Super. Lexis 18, question the meaning of the Court's language in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   that when a drunken driver's use of a motor vehicle results in multiple victims, \"ordinarily\" the sentence should be at least two consecutive\n   terms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285075\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/413/#p428\">\n    168 N.J. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In their view, the language should not raise \"a presumption in favor of consecutive terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 12. We respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , the Court prefaced its discussion by stating that it did not adopt a per se rule requiring consecutive sentences.\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285075\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/168/413/#p428\">\n    168 N.J. at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A per se rule, however, is entirely different from a rebuttable presumption. The Court at some length explained the importance of careful application of the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factors in order to avoid \"investing unbridled discretion in sentencing judges lead[ing] to a lack of sentencing uniformity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In passing, the Court noted that shortly before the accident, the Legislature had increased the severity of the crime, amending the law from a third-degree to a second-degree offense, thus making aggravating factor nine, the need to deter, more consequential as \"part of a legislative plan to reduce the slaughter and mayhem that occurs on our roads at the hands of drunken drivers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 426,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Court carefully reviewed the\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factors, as well as carefully applied them to the circumstances in that case. This included a discussion of the effect of the crash on the victims and their families.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 428,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court identified the third\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   guideline, which focuses on the \" 'facts relating to the crimes[,]' \" as the most significant because it focuses on the nature and number of offenses, whether the crimes occurred at different times or places, and the number of affected victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 423,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This factor alone, the Court said, can justify a consecutive sentence even if all others weigh in favor of a concurrent sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 427-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Crimes involving multiple deaths or victims who have sustained serious bodily injuries represent especially suitable circumstances for the imposition of consecutive\n   sentences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 428,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That consideration, of course, did not mean a trial judge must impose \" 'the longest sentence possible.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court concluded that \"in order to facilitate sentencing under\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   in vehicular homicide cases, the multiple victims factor is entitled to great weight and should ordinarily result in the imposition of at least two consecutive terms when multiple deaths or serious bodily injuries have been inflicted upon multiple victims by defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In other words, because of the very nature of a drunken driving collision that results in multiple victims, and the analytical structure of\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   , which heavily weighs the circumstances of an offense, such as multiple victims, a rebuttable presumption is created. Where there are multiple victims, the starting point of the sentence calculus is consecutive sentences. Only after close examination of other circumstances or the other\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factors, and a knowing decision on that basis, should a sentence be imposed on a concurrent basis. There will always be exceptions. The starting point, however, is that where a crash results in multiple victims, a judge begins from consecutive sentences and works down from there. This manner of adjusting for the inherently heavily weighted third\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factor includes, for example, reducing the individual terms of years downward to take into account the real time consequences of the sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , the virtual life sentence imposed on the sixty-one-year-old defendant, thirty-two years subject to NERA, shocked the conscience. We expect our colleagues will agree that the sentence in this case, a hair's breath away from illegal, shocks the conscience, albeit for completely different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Here, the jury found defendant guilty of a lesser-included second-degree offense, despite her .23 BAC at the point of impact. The judge then further reduced the lesser conviction from second-degree to third-degree. And when he sentenced, he imposed the least amount of time possible within the third-degree range. These steps are in no way equivalent to the careful adjustment of term length that\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   describes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   This defendant, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   , but unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , had been speeding and engaging in other risky driving maneuvers. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Carey\n   </em>\n   killed two persons and severely injured two others, and received two consecutive terms for an aggregate sentence of fourteen years-which the Court left intact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 422,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n    775 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , the defendant received three consecutive terms for killing a child and severely injuring two other persons, which sentence we vacated and remanded.\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , (slip op. at 21). While Liepe was under the influence of alcohol when he caused the accident, the facts tended to show that the collision was the result of brief inattentiveness, which may not have been related to impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The thrust of all the opinions included in this discussion is that \"[e]very case requires its own\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1285066,1285075\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/775/495/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at slip op. at 17. Furthermore, when a person drives while drunk, he or she always poses a risk to many- and for that reason alone, the third\n   <em>\n    Yarbough\n   </em>\n   factor must always be given great weight. To get behind the wheel and drive while under the influence, in today's world, is to knowingly jeopardize many.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In this case, the concurrent sentences resulted in a free crime. Defendant went unpunished for the injuries inflicted upon Seeman, despite the fact she could have easily made alternative arrangements the night of the accident and could have easily avoided driving, was extremely intoxicated, and was engaging in risky maneuvers before the crash. That is an error we cannot correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In the beginning of this opinion, we referred to the statements made by the victims during the State's presentation, pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Crime Victim's Bill of Rights\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 52:4B-36 [n]. Their comments dovetailed the sentencing goals embodied in the Code, which in this case were not met. In\n   <em>\n    Liepe\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was sentenced to, in real time, life. In this case, defendant was\n   sentenced to a NERA term of three years. The lack of uniformity is striking and in derogation of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Vacated and remanded for resentencing in accord with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    For the sake of clarity, with the exception of Seeman, we refer to members of the family by their first names.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    Imposition of NERA's eighty-five percent parole disqualifier occurs whenever a defendant is found guilty of vehicular homicide without regard to intoxication when the incident occurred.
