On appeal, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion. Specifically, the defendant claims that his sentence violates his fifth amendment protection against double jeopardy, which is applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.

We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court's memorandum of decision sets out the relevant facts and procedural history. \"The defendant ... was charged in a six count information dated July 9, 2001, with capital felony ... in violation of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54b (5) ], murder in violation of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54a], felony murder in violation of [General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) ] \u00a7 53a-54c, [two counts of] kidnapping in the first degree ... in violation of [ General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 53a-92(a)(2)(A) [and (B) ] and robbery in the first degree in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-134(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On August 18, 2005, after a jury trial before the\n   <em>\n    Hon.

The total effective sentence was eighty-five years to serve.\" (Footnotes added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 6, 2015, the defendant, representing himself,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22, and filed an amended motion on November 10, 2015. In his motions, the defendant made the following claims to support his double jeopardy argument: (1) he was unconstitutionally charged with three homicide offenses for a single act of homicide; (2) his acquittal on the capital felony charge barred prosecution on the kidnapping charges because the capital felony incorporated the kidnapping counts; (3) he was unlawfully convicted of felony murder as well as the underlying predicate offenses of kidnapping and robbery; (4) he was unlawfully convicted of two counts of kidnapping for a single act of kidnapping;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   and (5) the court's merger of the felony murder and manslaughter convictions was improper under\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , and the court instead should have vacated the manslaughter conviction. For relief, the defendant requested that the court vacate the conviction as to the offenses that he alleged violated double jeopardy and release him on the basis of time served on the robbery conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court denied the defendant's motion on June 27, 2016. In its decision, the court stated: \"The defendant believes that the [s]tate cannot charge him with multiple counts of murder and/or kidnapping. This is erroneous. The information in a criminal prosecution may charge various aspects of the crimes alleged. The jury, after hearing the evidence and the instructions to the jury by the judge may find a defendant guilty or not guilty on any or all of the charges. Here, the jury found the defendant guilty of felony murder, manslaughter, robbery and two counts of kidnapping. The jury did not find the defendant guilty of capital felony and murder. The defendant erroneously believes [that] an acquittal on capital felony murder should exonerate him on all counts of murder. The elements of the charges for which the defendant was found guilty were met and the judge sentenced him accordingly.\" The court also determined that, based on principles of retroactivity, \"the 2013 decision in\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and 2015 decision in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , which were based on our Supreme Court's supervisory authority, do not apply retroactively to the defendant's case.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"We review claims that the court improperly denied the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence under an abuse of discretion standard....

This conclusion relieves us of the need to apply the\n   <em>\n    Blockburger\n   </em>\n   test to this aspect of the defendant's claim. See id. at 292-93,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20A.2d%2084\">\n    579 A.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the defendant's kidnapping and robbery convictions do not violate double jeopardy even though they are the predicate offenses for the defendant's felony murder conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defendant's alleged double jeopardy violations regarding his remaining convictions lack merit because each crime with which the defendant was charged and of which he was convicted requires proof of a fact that the others do not. For example, the capital felony count pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54b (5) requires proof of an intent to kill. In contrast, a conviction for manslaughter in the first degree and felony murder, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55 and 53a-54c, respectively, does not require proof of such an intent and, instead, requires proof that the defendant caused the victim's death. It goes without saying that the kidnapping and robbery counts neither\n   require proof of an intent to kill nor proof that the defendant caused the victim's death. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-92 (a)(2)(A) and (B) (kidnapping in first degree) and 53a-134 (a) (1) (robbery in first degree).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, we reject the defendant's claim that his convictions for two counts of kidnapping of a single victim violate double jeopardy. The defendant was convicted of one count under \u00a7 53a-92 (a)(2)(A), and one count under \u00a7 53a-92 (a)(2)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Supreme Court has held that subdivisions (A) and (B) are separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tweedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"523905\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/219/489/#p496\">\n    219 Conn. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=594%20A.2d%20906\">\n    594 A.2d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991) (\"the charged crimes of kidnapping in the first degree under subdivisions [A] and [B] of \u00a7 53a-92 [a] [2] are separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes\" because each requires proof of element that other does not). Accordingly, the defendant's claim of a double jeopardy violation is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant also claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence because during\n   the sentencing phase, the court merged his convictions for felony murder and manslaughter in the first degree. The defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   require vacatur, not merger, when sentencing a defendant for cumulative homicide convictions. The state responds that, because our Supreme Court acted pursuant to its supervisory authority when it established the rules of\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , the guidance of these cases does not apply retroactively to the defendant's case. Although our\n   Supreme Court has not addressed the issue of whether\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   apply retroactively, we conclude that, on the basis of well established principles of retroactivity,\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   do not apply retroactively and, accordingly, they provide no relief to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"It is well settled that [a]ppellate courts possess an inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice....

There is nothing in the record showing that the defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, and pursuant to rule 13 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States, such a petition must be filed within ninety days after entry of the judgment by our Supreme Court. Accordingly, when the rules in\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   were established in 2013 and 2015 respectively, the defendant's 2005 conviction had long been final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%20242\">\n    308 Conn. at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20A.3d%201084\">\n    61 A.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , our Supreme Court exercised its supervisory authority to establish that the proper remedy for a defendant convicted of greater and lesser included offenses in violation of double jeopardy was vacatur and not merger. The court concluded that \"[i]n the present case ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   we are not inclined to express an opinion on the constitutionality of the merger of convictions approach, specifically, whether after\n   <em>\n    Rutledge\n   </em>\n   [v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744570\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/292/\">\n    517 U.S. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744570\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/292/\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11744570\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/292/\">\n    134 L.Ed. 2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996) ], that approach remains a constitutionally permissible alternative to vacatur....

Later, in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , supra, 317 Conn. at 751,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20490\">\n    120 A.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court extended the rule of\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   to cases involving cumulative homicide convictions arising from the killing of a single victim. In so doing, the court cited the same policy considerations\n   that bore on its decision in\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   . See id. at 750-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20490\">\n    120 A.3d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   expressly declined to opine on the constitutional aspect of the merger of convictions approach. Instead, the court made clear that it was for policy reasons that vacatur was preferred over merger in a situation involving multiple homicide convictions. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   , the court ruled on the basis of policy, not constitutional considerations. In order to avoid \"undermin[ing] the rule of law\";\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 317 Conn. at 802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Zarella, J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring in part and dissenting in part); and because our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   on the basis of policy considerations, we decline to apply\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   retroactively in this case. Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to correct and concluding that the sentencing court did not improperly merge the defendant's\n   convictions for felony murder and manslaughter in the first degree instead of vacating the manslaughter conviction as\n   <em>\n    Polanco\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   now require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, all references to \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a, 53a-54b, and 53a-54c are to the 1997 revision of the statutes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Although acquitted on the murder charge, the defendant was convicted of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    On November 10, 2015, the Public Defender's Office filed an\n    <em>\n     Anders\n    </em>\n    brief, moving to withdraw from representing the defendant on his motion to correct an illegal sentence, concluding that the motion was without merit.
