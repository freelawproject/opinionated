One might wonder why a person would appeal such an apparently favorable finding, but the meaning of \"not established\" is not what it seems. As we discuss, it still permanently tars a parent with a finding that there was something to the allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The allegations pertained to an incident in which R.R. tried to stop his daughter from throwing a tantrum. He grabbed her by the arms. She broke free, struck a bed or a wall, and fell to the floor, without injury. The finding was set forth in a letter signed\n   by the Division's intake worker, who conducted the field investigation, and the worker's field office supervisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having considered defendant's arguments in light of the factual record and the governing legal standard, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We first review the legal nature of a \"not established\" finding.

The Division undertook its investigation at the request of the Family Part judge presiding over the pending divorce action involving R.R. and his wife, L.R., with whom he still resided. Three days after the incident, L.R. filed an\n   order to\n   show cause (OSC), which temporarily removed R.R. from the home. Although L.R.'s submissions are not before us, we presume L.R. recounted details of the incident in an appropriate certification or affidavit. On the return date, the court entered an order vacating the OSC and permitting R.R. to return to the home. The court ordered the Division to \"immediately investigate [the] family to determine whether: 1) child abuse exists, and 2) the children's safety and well-being [is] jeopardized\n   <em>\n    by either parent or both parents.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added). The Division was required to provide the court with its findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As best we can tell from the screening summary that the Division thereafter prepared, a court staff member called the Division to refer the matter. There is no indication that the referent provided, or the Division requested: the OSC; L.R.'s submission; R.R.'s response, if any; a transcript of the hearing on the return date; or the court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As recorded by the screening worker, the court's concerns were inaccurately conveyed as pertaining only to R.R. The screening summary also inaccurately identified the child involved, referring to E.R.'s then ten-year-old sister, Le.R. The screening summary stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The mother appeared in court today on an \"Order to Show Cause\" that she filed to have the father removed from the home. The mother states that ... the father pushed [Le.R.] and she hit her head on the bed. The father denies pushing [Le.R.] and states that he grabbed [Le.R.] because she was having a tantrum and when he let her go she fell backwards. Reportedly, [Le.R.] was throwing things at the father and her younger siblings, which appears to be a common occurrence at the home. The mother states that she and the younger siblings were in the room during the incident and the mother observed the father push [Le.R.]. Reporter denied [Le.R.] being injured or needing medical attention at the time. The siblings were not injured during the incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [The judge] is requesting that [the Division] investigate these concerns today because [Le.R.] is leaving for summer camp in Pennsylvania tomorrow morning and will be away for the entire summer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The worker then followed up at the home and interviewed the parents, Le.R., and E.R. A third child was too shy to speak to the worker. Le.R. told the worker that her parents often argued, but they never hit each other, and they never hit her or her sisters. Le.R. made it clear to the worker that she was not the child who was throwing things, and who was grabbed by the arm by her father. She reported that E.R. threw a temper tantrum \"a few weeks ago,\" which varied in key details from the one her parents later described to the worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   E.R. recalled the incident in response to the worker's inquiry. She admitted that she was throwing things around the house and her father grabbed her. She said her father did not hit her, and she could not remember if he pushed her into the wall. She could not recall what happened after that because she passed out. Asked more\n   generally if her father ever hit her, E.R. said he had, but could not remember when. She said she never saw her father hit her other sisters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   L.R. did not hide her motivation to remove R.R. from the home. She complained that tension between the two of them had risen, and sought the worker's assistance in securing R.R.'s removal. She said that the judge thought she was making things up to hinder R.R. in court, but denied she had done so. She disabused the worker of the notion that the incident involved Le.R. She stated that R.R. did not push Le.R. or anyone else into the wall. She also admitted that R.R. never hit the children, or her, but that he had often raised his voice to the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the investigation summary, L.R. explained that the incident occurred when \"[E.R.] was having an episode and her father was trying to take control of the situation and couldn't.... [H]e grabbed [E.R.] by the hands/wrist and [E.R.] was flailing her arms and body and the next thing you know she fell into the wall\n   and hit her head.\" L.R. alleged that while R.R. did not push E.R., \"his aggressive behavior caused her to fall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   R.R. explained the incident occurred when he returned home with Le.R., after taking her out for ice cream. Apparently jealous of her sister, E.R. threw a tantrum. She hurled things around the home. As R.R. tried to calm her, she threw a shoe at him and Le.R., and continued to scream and yell. Rather than assist R.R., L.R. video-recorded the incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. grabbed E.R.'s hands to prevent her from throwing anything else. She broke free and fell. R.R. said she was nowhere near the wall. Rather, she fell into the side of a bed. She then passed out for about a minute, because she was so overheated. She suffered no injuries. L.R. called the police, who assessed the situation, and left without any arrests and without calling for any medical assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The worker also obtained reports from the children's pediatrician, who reported they were in good health and expressed no concerns about their safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The findings set forth in the investigation summary stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   There is not a preponderance of evidence indicating that minor child [E.R.] is physically abused, but evidence indicates that minor child was placed at risk of harm. [R.R.] admitted to grabbing [E.R.] in order to prevent her from throwing things at him and her sister. He stated that she did fall down and hit the side of the bed, although she didn't obtain any marks or bruises, child [E.R.] was placed at risk of harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The letter informing R.R. of the \"not established\" finding followed about two months later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Notwithstanding our deferential standard of review, we are constrained to reverse. The Division's finding was arbitrary and unreasonable, because the Division failed to consider essential documents and relevant facts. The finding also lacked \"fair support\" of the record the Division did compile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no evidence the Division obtained and reviewed the submissions to the court on the OSC; any testimony presented at the hearing on the return date; the court's order requesting the Division investigate both parents; or the video of\n   the incident. Although the record does not include these documents, it was incumbent upon the Division in this case to consider them as part of a reliable investigation. We are also concerned that the Division's worker and supervisor apparently gave no weight to L.R.'s admitted motivation to secure her husband's removal from the home. We recognize that the Division's regulation governing \"requirements for an investigation,\" N.J.A.C. 3A:10-3.1, does not require review of relevant court documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   N.J.A.C. 3A:10-2.4 (evidence needed to support a finding). However, we cannot have confidence in an investigation-nor are we obliged to defer to the resulting finding-where the Division overlooked such relevant information under the circumstances of this case.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Proposed Quest Acad.

[E.R.] was placed at risk of harm\" by R.R. also lacks fair support in the investigatory record that the Division compiled. The key question was whether there was any evidence that R.R., by any affirmative act or failure to act, \"placed [E.R.] at risk of harm.\" No evidence established that he did. Rather, he did nothing more than attempt\n   to control the situation that E.R. created. When he was unable to calm E.R. with words, and E.R.'s behaviors escalated, he did not resort to corporal punishment, nor is there evidence he used excessive force in attempting to restrain E.R. L.R.'s decision to video-record the incident likely did not help the situation. R.R. held his daughter by the arm, wrist or hand; E.R. broke free, and fell. No doubt, E.R. could have hurt herself as she flailed about in the throes of her tantrum. She also could have hurt another family member, as she hurled shoes and other items around the home. But, R.R. did not create the risk of harm to E.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As we find that the Division erred in finding the allegation was \"not established,\" the Division shall deem the allegation to be \"unfounded\" and treat the records accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The agency's letter referred to N.J.A.C. 10:129-7.3(c)(3), which was later recodified to title 3A of the N.J.A.C.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    49 N.J.R. 98(a) (Jan. 3, 2017).
