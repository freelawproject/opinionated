The defendant, Kingstone Insurance Company, a company domiciled in New York, contractually agreed to defend and indemnify its insured nationwide. After a vehicle driven by the insured collided in Connecticut with a vehicle driven by the plaintiffs, Jerzy and Sylvia\n   Samelko, however, the defendant failed to defend its insured and failed to provide indemnity after a judgment was rendered against the insured for damages resulting from the collision. The plaintiffs were subrogated to the rights of the insured under the policy issued by the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and brought this action directly against the defendant to recover damages.\n   The trial court dismissed the action on the ground that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. We conclude, however, that exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant insurer is permitted by our corporate long arm statute, General Statutes \u00a7 33-929(f)(1), and comports with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United Statutes Constitution. See U.S. Const., amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, we disagree with the trial court's contrary conclusion and, therefore, reverse and remand the case with direction to deny the defendant's motion to dismiss and for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which were alleged in the complaint or which the trial court found were not genuinely in dispute, are relevant to this appeal. The defendant issued a business automobile insurance policy covering a vehicle driven by Geraldo A. Cardozo (insured). The policy was written in New York at the defendant's principal place of business, and the vehicle was garaged in New York at that time. The defendant does not maintain any offices in Connecticut, was not licensed, at the time\n   it issued the policy, to provide insurance in Connecticut, and did not direct or participate in any business transactions in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In consideration for paid premiums and adherence to the terms of the policy, the defendant agreed to provide its insured $100,000 of liability insurance for any one accident or loss. To be covered by the policy, however, the accident or loss must occur within the designated coverage territory of \"[t]he United States of America ....\" The policy obligates the defendant to indemnify its insured by \"pay[ing] all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage ... caused by an accident ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) It also requires the defendant to defend its insured, stating that \"[the defendant has] the right and duty to defend any insured against [an action] asking for such damages ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While this policy with nationwide coverage was in effect, the insured's vehicle collided with a vehicle occupied by the plaintiffs in Stamford, Connecticut. The plaintiffs each sustained bodily injury as a result of the collision, and the defendant's insured was found legally responsible after a default judgment was rendered against him.\n   <em>\n    Samelko\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cardozo\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-09-5024762-S (March 14, 2013). The judgment was rendered against the insured for $126,839.93 in favor of Jerzy Samelko and for $10,852 in favor of Sylvia Samelko. Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant received notice of the accident and the action brought against its insured, but the defendant failed to defend the insured and failed to indemnify him for the judgment rendered against him. The plaintiffs then brought this action against the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   claiming\n   breach\n   of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, conversion, unfair claims settlement practices in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6), unfair trade practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the plaintiffs are not parties to the insurance contract between the insured and the defendant, they brought this action under Connecticut's insurance subrogation statute, \u00a7 38a-321, which allows a party who has an unsatisfied judgment against an insured for bodily injury to step into the shoes of the insured and bring a claim under the insured's policy directly against the insurer.

The principal basis of the defendant's motion was that the defendant did not do business in Connecticut, and, thus, it would not be subject to the long arm statute and requiring it to defend this action in Connecticut would not comport with due process. Both parties undertook jurisdictional discovery, and the plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs responded in relevant part that there was personal jurisdiction over the defendant because their claims \"[arose] out of a contract to\n   be performed in this state\" pursuant to \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1) and (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, reasoning that \"there is no evidence\" and \"no authority is provided\" to support the plaintiffs' claims. Specifically, the court found that the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of providing evidence that the cause of action arose out of a contract to be performed in Connecticut. Instead, the trial court was persuaded by the fact that the insured resided in New York, \"the vehicle ... was registered and garaged in New York,\" the insured \"maintained his driver's license in New York,\" and \"[t]he policy was sold, paid for and written in New York ....\" In short, the court found that \"there is no evidence the defendant ever had notice, or even an inkling, that its insured was living in Connecticut\" for purposes of the due process analysis. The plaintiffs moved for reargument and reconsideration, which the trial court denied. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and this court transferred the appeal to itself. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) ; Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The outcome of this appeal turns on whether the trial court had personal\n   jurisdiction over the defendant, an out-of-state (foreign) corporation. \"[A] court cannot render a judgment without first obtaining personal jurisdiction over the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Argent Mortgage Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Huertas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714054\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/568/#p576\">\n    288 Conn. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=953%20A.2d%20868\">\n    953 A.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). \"When\n   a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light....

Because the defendant is a foreign corporation that, at the time of the creation of the contract, had no formal presence\n   in Connecticut, a Connecticut court may obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant only if our long arm statute permits it. See\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3964346\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/529/#p533\">\n    289 Conn. at 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=958%20A.2d%20750\">\n    958 A.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 33-929 (f) (1) provides in relevant part that \"[e]very foreign corporation shall be subject to suit in this state, by a resident of this state\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... on any cause of action arising ... [o]ut of any contract made in this state or to be performed in this state ....\" (Footnote added.) The only portion of this statute that the parties\n   have a dispute over is whether the insurance contract was \"to be performed\" in Connecticut; more specifically, they disagree about the statutory meaning of \"to be performed.\" General Statutes \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1). The plaintiffs assert that this statute confers jurisdiction as long as the contract calls for a performance in Connecticut. The defendant contends that, even though it agreed to defend and indemnify its insured throughout the United States, \"there is nothing on the face of the insurance policy from which it can be concluded that the policy is a contract to be performed in Connecticut,\" essentially claiming that personal jurisdiction is conferred in the present case only if the defendant has actually performed under the contract in this state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We conclude that the phrase \"to be performed\" as used in \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1) refers to the performance that the parties contemplated in the contract, without regard to whether it has actually been performed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In interpreting the meaning of the statute at issue, we give its text its ordinary meaning. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (a) and 1-2z. The legislature's inclusion of \"to be\" before \"performed\" naturally suggests that the legislature intended for the statute to apply to contractual performance that the parties intended, whether it has occurred or not. See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2011) p. 105 (\"be ... used with the infinitive with to to express futurity, arrangement in advance, or obligation ... [for example] I am to interview him today\" [emphasis altered] ). As such, in the present case,\n   whether the defendant had already performed in this forum is irrelevant. Similarly, even though the contract is contingent on a collision-which may never actually occur-that contingency does not negate the contemplation of the defendant's performance in this forum. Indeed, by the very nature of breach of contract actions, many of those actions involve performance that is required under the contract but that never in fact occurred. We doubt the legislature intended to exclude these types of breach of contract actions from the scope of \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1) by limiting its scope to only cases in which contract performance was actually rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, because the plain language of the statute does not specify which party's performance must be considered, it makes no difference whether the insured, the defendant, or another party to the\n   contract was required to perform in this state. Indeed, our case law and the decisions of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut reflect that either the insured's or the defendant insurer's conduct can satisfy \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1).\n   <em>\n    Bowman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Grolsche Bierbrouwerij B.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087542\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/474/725/#p731\">\n    474 F.Supp. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 731-32 (D.

The outer boundaries of what qualifies as a contemplated performance are broad.

In addition, the defendant must \"pay all sums\" arising from a settlement or verdict that the \" 'insured' legally must pay\" as a result of an injury to which the policy applies. These promises apply to any location within the coverage territory, which spans the United States. By requiring the defendant to provide a defense and indemnify the insured nationwide, the contract expressly contemplated the defendant's performance in Connecticut if its insured was involved in an accident here. The duty to provide a defense requires the engagement of counsel to undertake such tasks as interviewing and deposing Connecticut witnesses, meeting with opposing Connecticut counsel, and appearing in a Connecticut court-room.

Even though the defendant's duty to defend and indemnify was intended for the insured's benefit, it is worth noting again that the plaintiffs ultimately suffered the actual harm and are thus subrogated to all the rights of the insured. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321. Given that the defendant's contemplated obligations are such an intrinsic premise of its insurance contract, we conclude that these contractual promises were \"to be performed\" in Connecticut within the meaning of \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our analysis is consistent with the conclusions of other jurisdictions with similar statutory language. For example, in South Carolina, \" 'to be performed,' \" as used in that state's long arm statute, means all parties knew that at least part of the performance was to take place in the state.\n   <em>\n    Colite Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    G.W.

Here, similarly, because the contract expressly included Connecticut in its coverage territory, the parties knew that, if the insured had an accident in Connecticut, the most fundamental part of the defendant's performance-defense and indemnification-was to take place in Connecticut. In Mississippi, \" 'to be performed' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   in that state's long arm statute means that the defendant had at least some duties that had to be performed\n   in the forum.\n   <em>\n    J.

In the present case, not only were some of the defendant's duties contemplated as being performed in this forum, but, after the accident, the defendant's primary obligations under the contract to defend and indemnify were required to be performed here. In North Carolina, \" 'to be performed,' \" as used in its long arm statute, is construed broadly and liberally in favor of establishing the existence of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Williamson Produce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Satcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11918770\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/122/589/#p592\">\n    122 N.C.

Tellingly, the defendant cites primarily to only one case to support his assertion,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Casualty Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-98-0415999-S (November 13, 1998) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20367\">\n    23 Conn. L. Rptr. 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367), which involved uninsured motorist coverage. The defendant then goes on to cite other cases involving uninsured and underinsured motorist disputes, using them by analogy to support its contention that our long arm statute does not apply. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bogen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bonanno\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. CV-06-5001344-S (April 13, 2006) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20219\">\n    41 Conn. L. Rptr. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219). Those cases, however, are inapposite as to whether, in the present case, the defendant's contractual obligations to defend and indemnify the insured were \"to be performed\" in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is fundamentally different from liability coverage because of the location of the performance due under the contract. We agree with the defendant that, most likely, an insurer's promise under an uninsured motorist policy\n   is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"to be performed\" under \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1) in the state where an accident occurs because that type of policy promises only to make the insured whole. Therefore, it does not necessarily require the insurer to perform in the foreign jurisdiction; performance can take place where the insured resides or where the insurer is domiciled. Put another way, the nature of an uninsured motorist claim eliminates much, if not all, of the contemplated activities the insurer otherwise would have to perform in the forum where the collision occurred. By contrast, a liability claim requires the insurer to provide a defense for its insured, in addition to its indemnification obligation, unavoidably compelling performance in the jurisdiction in which the collision occurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court in the present case improperly determined it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant under \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1) because it largely focused its inquiry on facts relevant to the\n   <em>\n    formation\n   </em>\n   of the contract and not where the contract was to be performed. In analyzing the defendant's performance, the court considered that the insured \"reside[d] within the state of New York,\" the policy \"was secured through a New York broker ... the vehicle ... was registered and garaged in New York,\" the insured \"maintained his driver's license in New York ... [t]he policy was sold, paid for and written in New York,\" and the insured \"was using a New York address ....\" These facts do not help demonstrate whether the defendant's obligations-nationwide defense and indemnification-were \"to be performed\" in Connecticut for purposes of \u00a7 33-929 (f) (1). Instead, these facts connect more closely to the formation of the contract. For example, the location of the insured's residence and the state in which the insured maintained his driver's license have no bearing on where an accident or an injury requiring defense and indemnification was contractually contemplated to take place. Therefore, the trial court improperly\n   determined\n   that the defendant was not subject to personal jurisdiction under the corporate long arm statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We next consider whether exercising personal jurisdiction over the defendant is proper under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the federal constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of state courts to render judgments against a nonresident defendant.\n   <em>\n    Kulko\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Superior Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p91\">\n    436 U.S. 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p91\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490667\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/84/#p91\">\n    56 L.

Given that the defendant drafted an insurance policy expressly covering\n   <em>\n    nationwide\n   </em>\n   travel, it should have foreseen the need to defend and indemnify its insured as a result of collisions during\n   <em>\n    nationwide\n   </em>\n   travel. The fact that the defendant anticipated such travel essentially encourages it, predictably resulting in the potential for claims arising out of injuries\n   occurring coast-to-coast and legal disputes over coverage. Because the defendant obligated itself to provide a legal defense in Connecticut, it should have reasonably anticipated being haled into a Connecticut court when a dispute arose over the performance or nonperformance of its obligations. The defendant's promise to provide a defense-entailing\n   acts such as interviewing witnesses, taking depositions, meeting with opposing counsel, and litigating in court-purposefully availed it of the privilege of conducting activities within this forum. The insurance policy was a substantial, self-drafted connection to Connecticut. That connection was not random, fortuitous, or attenuated, but, rather, it was a significant, profit driven effort to provide services in this forum in exchange for compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our analysis comports with the consensus of other jurisdictions that have similarly examined exerting personal jurisdiction over nationwide insurers that do not otherwise do any business in the forum.

The second factor, \" 'the forum [s]tate's interest in adjudicating the dispute' \";\n   <em>\n    Burger King\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rudzewicz\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p477\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; weighs heavily in favor of the plaintiffs because Connecticut has a strong interest in resolving a dispute involving Connecticut residents in a collision that occurred in Connecticut and arising from an unsatisfied Connecticut judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is possible to view the third factor, which is \" 'the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief' \";\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p477\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; as perhaps weighing against exercising jurisdiction in Connecticut because, in this particular case, it is only slightly more inconvenient to require the plaintiffs to bring their action just over the state border in New York. The burden, therefore, is minimal, and the plaintiffs' opportunity to vindicate their rights\n   is not diminished. However, given that the collision took place in Connecticut and involved Connecticut residents, and because witnesses and evidence are likely to be located in Connecticut, the fourth factor, \" 'the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,' \" in our view, weighs heavily in favor of Connecticut courts exercising jurisdiction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p477\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, conducting the litigation in New York is not likely to be more convenient and could very well be less convenient. The final factor, \"the 'shared interest of the several [s]tates in furthering fundamental substantive social policies,' \" weighs most heavily in favor of personal jurisdiction in Connecticut.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p477\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We agree with the plaintiffs that Connecticut has the greatest interest in ensuring the safety of its roads and encouraging the satisfaction of its judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In short, requiring the defendant to defend itself in Connecticut comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. We therefore join other jurisdictions, cited previously, in concluding that an insurer that promises to defend and indemnify its insured in this forum\n   cannot then claim there is no jurisdiction over it in that same forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The defendant points to\n   <em>\n    Cogswell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    American Transit Ins.

Instead, it involved the Insurance Commissioner's action to enforce a subpoena against an insurer that was not licensed in Connecticut.

Thus, the only contacts with this forum that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Cogswell\n   </em>\n   had were the mailing of at least one letter and the making of at least one telephone call to Connecticut.

But this emphasis on the lack of certain Connecticut contacts misses the point of a minimum contacts analysis. The defendant might very well have more contacts with New York. But its agreement to defend and indemnify its insured for collisions in Connecticut satisfies the minimum contacts requirement and does not offend traditional notions of fair play under a due process analysis. The defendant cannot dissolve its contractually created minimum contacts with this forum by listing the ways in which it does not otherwise have a presence in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the\n   defendant's motion to dismiss and for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321 provides in relevant part: \"Upon the recovery of a final judgment against any person ... for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death or damage to property, if the defendant in such action was insured against such loss or damage at the time when the right of action arose and if such judgment was not satisfied ... such judgment creditor shall be subrogated to all rights of the defendant and shall have a right of action against the insurer to the same extent that the defendant in such action could have enforced his claim against such insurer had such defendant paid such judgment.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    After the plaintiffs brought the present action, the insured also brought a separate action in Connecticut against the defendant for failure to defend and indemnify him in the original action brought by the plaintiffs.
