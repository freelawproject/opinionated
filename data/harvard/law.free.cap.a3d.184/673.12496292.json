Its problems all came to a breaking point in 2009, at the depth of the recession, at which time government officials realized they needed to address the depletion of funding in the state and municipal employee retirement systems.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, in 2009 and 2010, the\n   General Assembly amended the statutes governing the pension system, changing the retirement age and reducing the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2009, ch. 68, art. 7; P.L. 2010, ch. 23, art. 16;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   G.L. 1956 chapters 8, 9, 10, and 10.1 of title 36; G.L. 1956 chapter 21 of title 45. In 2011, the General Assembly took more drastic action and passed the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act of 2011 (RIRSA), which abridged the retirement benefits of state and municipal employees even further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2011, chs. 408 and 409. In response, a number of lawsuits were filed by various state and municipal unions on behalf of their affected members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In these appeals, we are asked to review a class-action settlement that was approved by a Superior Court trial justice in 2015. That class action was filed in April 2015 for settlement purposes only by the following parties: the Rhode Island Public Employees' Retiree Coalition (RIPERC); the Rhode Island American Federation of Teachers/Retirees, Local 8037 (AFT/R); Roger Boudreau; Michael Connolly; Kevin Schnell; the Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO; the National Education Association-Rhode Island (NEARI); John Lavery; Michael McDonald; Jason Kane; Amy Mullen; Susan Verdon; the Rhode Island State Association of Firefighters; Raymond Furtado; and James Richards (collectively, the Union plaintiffs). The class action was filed against both state and municipal defendants. The state defendants are the following: Gina M. Raimondo, in her capacity as Governor of the State of Rhode Island; Seth Magaziner, in his capacity as General Treasurer of the State of Rhode Island; and the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island, by and through the Rhode Island Retirement Board, by and through Magaziner, in his capacity as Chairman of the Retirement Board; and Frank J. Karpinski, in his capacity as Secretary of the Retirement Board (collectively, the state defendants). The municipal defendants are the towns of Barrington, Middletown, and South Kingstown (collectively, the municipal defendants). While the Union plaintiffs approved of the settlement, filing briefs in this appeal in support of the state defendants, two groups of class-member plaintiffs appealed the trial justice's approval of the settlement in two separate actions, now consolidated on appeal. Those opponents are \"the Clifford plaintiffs\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"the Retiree plaintiffs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    The State Employees' Retirement System\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Rhode Island, the state retirement board administers the state employees' retirement system-the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI)-and the municipal employees' retirement system-the Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   G.L. 1956 \u00a7\u00a7 36-8-2 and 36-8-4(a).

The following year, the General Assembly made further amendments, curtailing the COLA to \"the first * * * $35,000 * * * of retirement allowance,\" and requiring that it not \"commence [until] the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of retirement or when the retiree reaches age sixty-five (65), whichever is later.\" P.L. 2010, ch. 23, art. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2011, as part of its legislative findings in passing RIRSA, the General Assembly explained its reasons for adopting the act as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"(1) The State of Rhode Island has one of the lowest funded and most vulnerable statewide pension systems in the country.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(4) The state retirement system's unfunded liability exceeds $7 billion as measured by well-established and accepted public accounting standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(6) Annual government contributions to ERSRI more than doubled between fiscal years 2005 and 2011 and those contributions are estimated to double again in fiscal year 2013 to exceed over $600 million.

P.L. 2011, ch. 408, \u00a7 7. Specifically, and at issue in this appeal, RIRSA stopped paying annual COLAs \"until the state's pension plans [were] 80% funded overall[,]\" which, as expressed by both sets of plaintiffs at oral argument in this appeal, is indefinite.

This led to the filing of a number of lawsuits commencing in 2010 that challenged the enactment of the 2009 and 2010 amendments and RIRSA, which came to be known as \"the pension cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The first lawsuit was filed in 2010 by a number of unions representing state employees and teachers, alleging that the 2009 and 2010 amendments violated the Contract, Takings, and Due Process Clauses of the Rhode Island Constitution. Then, in 2012, five lawsuits were brought on behalf of various unions and retirement associations challenging RIRSA, alleging the same constitutional claims as alleged in the 2010 lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2013, all parties involved in both the 2010 and 2012 cases were ordered to attend mediation. After months of mediation, the parties reached a proposed settlement in February 2014, subject to approval by all members of the unions. The parties, however, failed to secure the necessary vote from the members, and so the litigation continued. In 2014, three more cases alleging similar claims were filed, one of which was the so-called \"Clifford\" case, by a group of individual retirees. The lawsuits were eventually consolidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties engaged in extensive discovery-defendants produced more than 700 gigabytes of electronic documents and over four million pages of documents. The parties began preparation for a trial scheduled on April 20, 2015. In March 2015, the trial justice assigned a special master to oversee any remaining discovery issues; after the special master had worked with the parties, he announced that all parties except one group of plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   had reached a settlement approved by a majority of the group members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Subsequently, on April 13, 2015, the parties filed a class-action lawsuit to implement the settlement, move for class certification, and appoint class representatives and class counsel. The parties also sought initial approval of the settlement terms and approval of notice procedures of the settlement to all members of the class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 16, 2015, after hearing argument on the motions, the trial justice issued a written decision granting the Union plaintiffs' motion for class certification in accordance with Rule 23(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, designating the class representatives and appointing class counsel for plaintiffs and defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The plaintiff class was defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"All persons (and/or their beneficiaries) who, on or before July 1, 2015, are receiving benefits or are participating in the State Employees, Teachers, or Municipal Employees' retirement systems administered by ERSRI and all future employees, excepting only those individuals who on July 1, 2015, are participating in a municipal retirement system administered by ERSRI for municipal police officers in any municipality and/or for fire personnel of the City of Cranston[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, the trial justice certified a number of plaintiff subclasses, described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"State Employees and Teachers: Participants in the Teachers and State Employees Retirement System (ERS) who are employed on or before July 1, 2015, but who have not retired as of June 30, 2015 and all future employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Participants in the Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS), other than police or fire units: Participants in MERS, other than police or fire units, employed on or before July 1, 2015, but who have not retired as of June 30, 2015 and all future employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Participants in all fire MERS units, except for fire personnel of Cranston: Participants in all fire MERS units, except for fire personnel of Cranston, employed on or before July 1, 2015, but who have not retired as of June 30, 2015 and all future employees;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Retirees: All retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who retired on or before June 30, 2015, who are receiving a retirement benefit under ERS or any MERS unit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial justice also certified the following defendant class: \"All municipal entities that participate in MERS and all municipal entities that employ teachers who participate in the state employees and teachers' ERS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As part of her decision, the trial justice summarized the terms of the proposed settlement as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"A one-time COLA payment of 2% applied to the first $25,000 of the pension benefit and that amount added to the base benefit will be paid to retirees (or their beneficiaries) who participate in a COLA program and who retired on or before June 30, 2012 as soon as administratively reasonable following the passage of the legislation based on the amount of benefit payable on the effective date of the legislation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"For funds that are not already funded, the settlement shortens the time intervals between suspended COLA payments from once every five years to once every four years. The settlement also improves the COLA limitation for current retirees whose COLA is suspended. The settlement also requires a more favorable indexing of COLA Cap for all current and future retirees. The settlement also changes the COLA calculation to one more likely to produce a positive number and dictates that the COLA formula will be calculated annually, regardless of funding level, and when paid, the COLA will be compounded for all receiving a COLA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"Current retirees (or their beneficiaries) who have or will have retired on or before June 30, 2015 will receive two payments: (1) a one-time $500.00 stipend (not added to the COLA base) within sixty days of the enactment of the legislation approving the terms of the settlement and (2) a one-time $500 stipend payable one year later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"For State Workers, Teachers, and General MERS, the settlement (1) adds another calculation to reduce the minimum retirement age; (2) improves the available accrual rate for employees with twenty years or more of service as of June 30, 2012; (3) requires increased contributions by the employer to the Defined Contribution Plan for employees with ten or more years of service (but less than twenty) as of June 30, 2012; (4) waives the administration fee for any employees participating in the Defined Contribution Plan who make $35,000 or less; and (5) adds another calculation designed to limit the impact of the 'anti-spiking' rule imposed by the RIRSA on part-time employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"For MERS Firefighters (excluding Cranston Firefighters), the settlement (1) lowers the age and service requirements for retirement; (2) increases the accrual rate for Firefighters who retire at age fifty-seven with thirty years of service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"For State Correctional Officers, the settlement increases the accrual rate for correctional officers with fewer than twenty-five years of service as of June 30, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The settlement reduces the impact of an early retirement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"The settlement allows Municipalities to 're-amortize'; that is, partially refinance,\n   to be able to pay for the increased cost of the settlement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"Otherwise, the terms of the RIRSA remain the same.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial justice found that the class settlement agreement warranted \"an initial presumption of fairness,\" and concluded that it was \"within the range of reasonableness.\" Accordingly, she granted the parties' joint motion for preliminary approval of the class settlement. She also approved the parties' proposed method of notifying class members by mail, newspaper publication, and posting the settlement information on the ERSRI website. Additionally, the trial justice scheduled a fairness hearing for May 20, 2015, for the purpose of final approval of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Objections to the Proposed Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In response to the notices that were mailed and published for the benefit of class members, the Superior Court received approximately 400 objections to the settlement agreement, which raised a number of procedural and substantive concerns. Sixty-nine class members requested an opportunity to be heard at the fairness hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   There were a number of general objections, including that (1) the settlement was unfair because members have contractual rights to pension benefits; (2) the settlement negotiations and voter approval process were unfairly orchestrated; (3) the state's financial crisis was not so dire as to necessitate the drastic changes to the pension system; (4) the settlement affected certain groups disproportionately; and (5) certain class members were not part of the underlying cases or settlement discussions and wished to \"opt out\" of the settlement to pursue their individual claims. Some other specific objections were offered by certain groups of objectors. Specifically, a number of retirees contended that the settlement's reduction of their COLA would drastically affect their financial situations. In addition, Woonsocket police retirees in particular argued that the settlement was unfair because active police members were continuing to pursue their claims, and, if they were successful, the retirement fund would be diminished, making it less likely that the retirees would receive their promised COLA. The Clifford plaintiffs also objected, arguing that the state failed to explicitly define the amount of compensation retirees would lose under the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    May 2015 Fairness Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the fairness hearing, which spanned five days, the trial justice heard from the parties' counsel and from six witnesses. The Union plaintiffs also filed affidavits of class representatives who attested that they thought the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate to resolve their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Joseph Newton, a principal actuary with Gabriel, Roeder, Smith &amp; Company, testified for defendants. Newton testified that he provided actuarial services for ERSRI throughout the litigation of the pension cases. He testified that his analysis had demonstrated that the cost of the settlement would be about $30.8 million, not including re-amortization. During cross-examination, Newton explained that the settlement would cost the state more than RIRSA would have cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Robert A. Walsh, Jr., the executive director of NEARI, testified that the settlement was \"a fair and adequate and reasonable solution[.]\" Walsh testified that the Union plaintiffs had already invested approximately $1 million in legal costs in the\n   litigation. Walsh also said that his members were cognizant of the risks involved in a jury trial with a high burden of proof for the Union plaintiffs on their claims. On cross-examination, Walsh acknowledged that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, retiree members would not receive \"the future earnings of COLA[ ]s.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Roger P. Boudreau also testified as a class representative of the retiree subclass and the then-president of RIPERC and AFT/R. Boudreau explained that RIPERC filed its own lawsuit and had sustained more than $400,000 in legal fees at the time of the hearing. He also described the efforts the organization made to notify its more than 5,000 members that the lawsuit was being filed, including publishing newspaper advertisements. With respect to the 2015 settlement discussions, Boudreau testified that his organization had concerns about succeeding at a jury trial with such a high burden of proof, which affected RIPERC's choice to join in the settlement agreement of March 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Boudreau highlighted what he perceived as the benefits of the 2015 settlement, which he said were greater than the first proposed settlement. He also testified that the vote, which recommended presenting the settlement to their members by the leadership groups of the RIPERC organizations, was \"virtually unanimous.\" According to Boudreau, RIPERC held a meeting to conduct an in-person vote on the settlement, which passed with about a seventy-five percent approval by the approximately 2,500 members who attended. On cross-examination, Boudreau testified that the 2,500 members who voted were out of a group of 27,000 retirees who would be affected by the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mark A. Dingley also testified in his capacity as special counsel for the Governor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified regarding the history of the legislative amendments to the pension system, describing the \"underfunded\" pension plans in 2011, when the state's \"contribution levels were practically doubling.\" Dingley also explained that, while prior to RIRSA's enactment the state's \"unfunded liability was $7.3 billion[,]\" after its enactment, the liability was reduced to $4.286 billion. He also agreed that the 2015 settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. Dingley was also extensively cross-examined by counsel and by class members over three hearing days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Next, Stephen Alfred, the town manager for South Kingstown and a class representative for the municipal defendants, testified. He stated that he was in favor of the settlement because, if the Union plaintiffs were to succeed at trial, \"cities and towns would not be able to deal with the type of pension payments that would be required * * *.\" He also testified that, as of the date of the hearing, no municipality had objected to the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Patrick Marr, the deputy treasurer and chief operating officer from the Office of the General Treasurer, also testified. He explained that he assisted in coordinating the notification of the settlement to class members through mail, newspaper advertisements, and postings to the retirement website. He pointed out that the notices outlined the method by which class members could object to the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After the witnesses testified, the trial justice heard from class members who had timely requested to address the court. While sixty-nine class members submitted requests to address the court, only thirty-five members actually expressed their\n   views during the fairness hearing. The trial justice reserved decision at the hearing and issued a written decision on June 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    E\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial Justice's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In her written decision, the trial justice reaffirmed her certification of the settlement classes in accordance with Rule 23(b)(2), consistent with her April 16, 2015 decision. She also determined that the class members had received adequate notice. Finally, in reviewing the terms of the settlement, the trial justice found that it was both procedurally and substantively fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   After the trial justice's decision, the legislature enacted the 2015 amendments to RIRSA, implementing the terms of the settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 2015, ch. 141, art. 21.

First, the trial justice found that the numerosity factor was satisfied because the proposed class contained more than 60,000 people and defendants included \"113 municipal entities which participate in MERS[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Next, the trial justice considered whether there were questions of law or fact common to the class. She determined that all Union plaintiffs made constitutional challenges to the 2009 and 2010 Acts and to RIRSA, including allegations that the legislation violated the Contract, Takings, and Due Process Clauses of the Rhode Island Constitution. The trial justice found that all Union plaintiffs were either active or retired employees of municipalities or the state, and that all their claims were based upon the contention that RIRSA impaired their contractual rights to retirement benefits. Additionally, the trial justice concluded that all the state and municipal defendants also shared common questions of law and fact, and that they shared the same defenses to plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   With respect to the third requirement of Rule 23(a) -typicality-the trial justice found that the claims of the class representatives were typical of the claims of the whole class because the proposed representatives were \"either current or former state employees, public school teachers, or municipal employees\" who were either members of the state or municipal retirement systems or already receiving pension benefits from those systems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover, the trial justice found that the legal theories and evidence used by the representatives would be the same for the other class members. She also found that the defenses of the defendants' representatives were typical of those of the whole. Finally, the trial justice determined that there was adequate representation, based on her findings that the attorneys were qualified and experienced and that no conflicts existed between the class representatives and the other class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Having found that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) were met, the trial justice next analyzed whether the class could be certified under any of the three methods provided for in Rule 23(b). The trial justice concluded that both the plaintiff class and the defendant class qualified to be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). With respect to the Union plaintiffs' claims, the trial justice found that they all challenged the state defendants' enactment of RIRSA, which affected all Union plaintiffs' entitlement to retirement benefits. Moreover, the trial justice highlighted that the claims of the Union plaintiffs were equitable in nature-they sought \"the restoration of their retirement benefits prior to the passage of the 2009 and 2010 Acts and the RIRSA.\" She also found that all defendants would be affected because all of the municipalities involved participated in MERS, indicating that the outcome of the settlement would affect the funding requirements for all defendant class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In her June 9, 2015 decision, the trial justice revisited the certification issue, and she reaffirmed the certification of the settlement classes. In doing so, the trial justice scrutinized a number of factors in determining whether there was \"adequate protection for absent class members[.]\" She recognized the need to generally apply a higher scrutiny to class-action settlements. Still, she highlighted that this case did not present any danger of collusion between opposing counsel, there had been extensive discovery in the case, and the settlement had been overseen by a special master chosen by the court. The trial justice also analyzed whether the Union plaintiffs' attorneys were qualified and whether there were any conflicts of interest between the class representatives and the class members, concluding that the attorneys were well qualified and that no conflicts existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, the trial justice found that the class members received adequate notice in accordance with Rule 23(e). She determined that the notice informed the class members of the action, summarized the essential terms of the settlement agreement, and described how members could object to the settlement terms by appearing at the fairness hearing. Moreover, she noted that the bulk of the objections to the settlement agreement had to do with its fairness, rather than lack of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   At the outset, we recognize that the review of class actions for settlement purposes requires heightened review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amchem Products, Inc. v.

As such, we proceed to determine whether the trial justice abused her discretion in finding that the remaining prerequisites were met. The Clifford plaintiffs' claims were the same as the Union plaintiffs: that RIRSA's elimination of the COLAs amounted to a breach of contract, was in violation of the Contract, Takings, and Due Process Clauses, and constituted conversion and unjust enrichment. The second prerequisite of Rule 23(a) has been described to require that the commonality \"be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution-which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\"\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Similarly, the Retiree plaintiffs' contention that outside litigation might affect the ability of their respective municipalities to afford their pension benefits in the future is not the proper inquiry for purposes of class certification. Indeed, whether the damages to individual plaintiffs differed among categories of active employees and retirees does not affect a determination under Rule 23(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7851030\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/157/354/#p366\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in ruling that there were factual and legal questions common to the entire class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Turning to the third requirement, we are also satisfied that the claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the entire class. \"When it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Robidoux v.

In her June 9, 2015 written decision, the trial justice first addressed the procedural fairness of the settlement. She found that the presumption of fairness applied to the settlement, as there was no indication of collusion. She also concluded that the settlement was \"the result of well-informed and arm's-length negotiations by competent and dedicated counsel who provided loyal and effective representation to all parties.\" Additionally, the trial justice highlighted that the settlement was the result of earlier settlement attempts by the parties and, as such, was not entered into immediately prior to trial; in other words, the settlement had been under consideration for quite some time, and it was no \"eve of trial\" settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Moreover, after her initial decision on April 16, 2015, finding that the settlement appeared fair and reasonable, the trial justice required the parties to notify class members by mail, newspaper publication, and through the ERSRI website. The trial justice also held five days of testimony at a fairness hearing, wherein the parties and objectors could be heard on the fairness of the settlement terms; those who testified included thirty-five of the sixty-nine class members who had originally requested to be heard. All class members received notification of the fairness hearing, and all were given ample opportunity to object in writing or to testify at the hearing. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that the settlement was procedurally fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   We now address the substantive fairness of the settlement terms. In her decision, the trial justice thoroughly analyzed the\n   <em>\n    Grinnell\n   </em>\n   factors, ultimately concluding that the settlement was \"fair, adequate, and reasonable.\" With respect to the first factor, the trial justice stated that \"the complexity of the underlying pension cases\" could not be \"overstate[d.]\" We agree that the complexity of the pension cases and the duration of the controversy certainly weigh in favor of settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tyco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3605354\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/535/249/#p259\">\n    535 F.Supp.2d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The settlement involved nine consolidated cases, and the majority of the lawsuits had been pending for three years at the time of settlement. The Union plaintiffs were expending substantial costs, and there was testimony at the fairness hearing that they had already invested approximately $1 million in legal costs and could be expected to spend up to $100,000 per week leading up\n   to the trial. We agree with the trial justice that these factors and the complex nature of the constitutional claims alleged weighed in favor of the proposed settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The trial justice next scrutinized the reaction of the class, noting that more than 60,000 notices were sent to class members regarding the settlement, but she received only 400 written objections.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TBK Partners, Ltd. v.

Nevertheless, the trial justice considered many of the objectors' concerns. For example, she contemplated the argument that the objectors had a constitutional right to a three percent COLA, and determined that the caselaw was unclear regarding whether the objectors would succeed on that argument, citing\n   <em>\n    Arena v. City of Providence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8326317\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/379/#p393\">\n    919 A.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (R.I. 2007), but that these specific concerns were voiced by two class representatives of the retiree subclass during negotiations. The trial justice finally concluded that, although the objectors' concerns had some merit, they still were in a very small minority of the group and, in fact, the settlement could be-as Walsh testified at the fairness hearing-\"heartbreaking\" but fair at the same time. We cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion in considering this factor and determining that it weighed in favor of a fair settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The third factor involves the stage of the litigation and the discovery conducted by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Tyco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3605354\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/535/249/#p259\">\n    535 F.Supp.2d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In concluding that this factor weighed in favor of a finding of a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement, the trial justice commented on the extensive discovery in the cases and the multiple dispositive motions that had been filed. We agree that the discovery in these consolidated cases was more than adequate-it included production of more than 700 gigabytes of electronic documents and over four million pages of documents. As such, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in ruling as she did with respect to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Regarding the fourth and fifth\n   <em>\n    Grinnell\n   </em>\n   factors, the trial justice found that the risk of failure to establish liability and prove damages was high, relying on the testimony to that effect by both parties at the fairness hearing. She referenced nine pending dispositive motions, which the Union plaintiffs would first need to overcome to reach trial, ultimately determining that these factors weighed in favor of the settlement being fair, reasonable, and adequate. In addition, she noted that the Union plaintiffs recognized the risks of a jury trial, which would have required them to surmount a high burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716207\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/273/#p322\">\n    667 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"[T]his inquiry attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action rather than settling it at the current time.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Cendant Corp.

Consequently, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion when she weighed these factors in favor of approving the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The trial justice gave little weight to the sixth and seventh factors-the risks of maintaining the class action through trial and the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment. The trial justice found the latter factor to be neutral because the relief sought was equitable, not monetary. That scrutiny involves \"whether the defendants could withstand a\n   judgment for an amount significantly greater than the settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716207\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/273/#p322\">\n    667 F.3d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140790\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/516/#p537\">\n    391 F.3d 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537-38 (3d Cir. 2004) ). There was testimony at the fairness hearing that the state and municipal defendants might not be able to bear the cost of the restoration of the pension benefits. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in affording less weight to these factors because, we agree, in the event that the Union plaintiffs succeeded on their claims at trial, the judgment against defendants would remain principally equitable in nature-namely, a requirement that RIRSA be repealed and pension benefits restored. While we recognize that such an outcome would require the state to pay more money to the Union plaintiffs, such an order would not amount to relief in the form of compensatory damages, such as damages for injuries sought in asbestos litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amchem Products, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    521 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915571\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/591/#p620\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, the trial justice turned to the last\n   <em>\n    Grinnell\n   </em>\n   factors, contemplating the \"range of reasonableness\" of the settlement. She addressed the merits of the constitutional claims in light of pension cases in other jurisdictions, ultimately determining that the combination of the low likelihood of success and the length of time the cases had been pending weighed in favor of a finding that the settlement is reasonable. These two factors inquire as to \"whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Insurance Co. of America Sales Practice Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"288661\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/283/#p322\">\n    148 F.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (3d Cir. 1998).

The trial justice also outlined decisions in other jurisdictions relating to the constitutionality of various pension reforms, finding that the majority of jurisdictions had found that no constitutional right existed to a specific COLA formula.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Maine Association of Retirees v.

Indeed, we agree with the trial justice that the Union plaintiffs received \"concrete and immediate benefits\" from the settlement, including a more favorable COLA formula, two $500 stipends paid to retirees, and a calculation that would reduce the minimum retirement age for employees.
