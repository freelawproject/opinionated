For others, it is not entirely a thing of the past. The physical mail delivery system provides an important avenue of access to the courts for those who do not or cannot, for one reason or another, use electronic mail, electronic filing systems, or the Internet at large.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, Thoyt Hackney, Petitioner here and unrepresented at the time of the events in question, testified that he delivered a petition for post-conviction relief to prison authorities three days before a statutory ten-year filing deadline. Two days later, prison authorities mailed the petition to the circuit court. It arrived and was date-stamped by the clerk one day\n   after the deadline. The circuit court rejected the petition as untimely, finding that the relevant rule of procedure, Maryland Rule 1-322, required that the petition be \"filed\" with-i.e., received by-the Clerk of the Circuit Court prior to the deadline. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner urges this Court to adopt the \"prison mailbox rule,\" under which the papers or pleadings of unrepresented, incarcerated litigants are deemed to be \"filed\" when formally delivered to prison authorities for mailing to the circuit court. For the reasons that follow, we adopt the prison mailbox rule in the post-conviction context and apply it to the case at bar. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals with the direction that it remand the matter to the circuit court for that court to accept the petition as timely filed and proceed to consider the merits of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Underlying Conviction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1998, Petitioner was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of two counts each of second-degree\n   murder; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; and wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. He was sentenced to a total term of sixty years' imprisonment. The Court of Special Appeals issued an unreported opinion affirming Petitioner's convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    Hackney &amp; Thompson v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1676, Sept. Term, 1998 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. June 16, 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Post-Conviction Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nearly ten years later, Petitioner, incarcerated and proceeding without the assistance of counsel, endeavored to file a post-conviction petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Such petitions are governed by the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, codified at Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\") of the Maryland Code. Absent\n   extraordinary cause, post-conviction petitions are subject to a ten-year statute of limitations, CP \u00a7 7-103(b), and petitions are adjudged timely according to the dictates of Maryland Rule 1-322(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner submitted to the prison mailroom an envelope containing his petition and a certificate of service to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office bearing the date of October 20, 2008. There are two date stamps on the envelope. One stamp is on the back and appears to reflect that, on October 22, 2008, the mailroom date-stamped the envelope containing the petition and certificate of service. The other stamp, also dated October 22, 2008, is on the front of the envelope and appears to be the postmark, evidencing that prison authorities forwarded the envelope to the United States Post Office on that date. The Clerk of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City received and docketed the petition on October 24, 2008, one day after the statute of limitations had expired. On October 28, 2008, the Baltimore City State's Attorney filed a motion to dismiss the petition or, alternatively, a response to it. The motion to dismiss did not raise the statute of limitations issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, counsel from the Public Defender's office entered an appearance and filed two supplemental petitions on Petitioner's behalf. In a footnote in the first supplemental petition, Petitioner's counsel argued that Petitioner's original petition had been timely filed. On September 10, 2010, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City held a hearing on the post-conviction petition. The court heard abbreviated argument on the statute of limitations issue, accepted into evidence various documents offered by the Public Defender, and heard testimony from Petitioner regarding dates relevant to the statute of limitations. Specifically, Petitioner testified that on October 20, 2008, he signed a certificate of service at the end of his petition, put it in an envelope with postage affixed, and mailed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The circuit court decided to reserve judgment on both the statute of limitations issue and the merits of the petition. For\n   reasons not apparent in the record, the court delayed for five years before issuing an order dated November 19, 2015, dismissing Petitioner's petition as untimely under CP \u00a7 7-103(b) because it was \"filed\" on October 24, 2008, one day after the deadline. Although the court made no specific finding, it was-and remains-undisputed that Petitioner delivered his petition to prison authorities no later than October 22, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioner filed an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court granted the application, transferred the case to the regular appeals docket, and in an unreported opinion affirmed the judgment of\n   the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Hackney v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 2513, Sept. Term, 2015 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. July 18, 2017). The Court of Special Appeals began by analyzing the relevant statute and rule. At the time Petitioner filed his petition, CP \u00a7 7-103(b)(1) provided the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Unless extraordinary cause is shown, in a case in which a sentence of death has not been imposed, a petition under this subtitle may not be filed more than 10 years after the sentence was imposed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CP \u00a7 7-103(b)(1) (2001).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maryland Rule 1-322(a) governs the filing of pleadings and other papers in circuit court. When Petitioner filed his petition, Rule 1-322(a) provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) Generally\n   </strong>\n   . The filing of pleadings and other papers with the court as required by these rules shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court, except that a judge of that court may accept the filing, in which event the judge\n   shall note on the papers the filing date and forthwith transmit them to the office of the clerk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Md. Rule 1-322(a) (2008).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Special Appeals then reviewed\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9 v. Jutton\n   </em>\n   , a case involving claims for negligence and battery. The plaintiff, who did not prevail on one of her claims in the circuit court, sought appellate review on that issue and mailed a notice of appeal to the clerk's post office box rather than directly to the courthouse.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    381 Md. 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In that context, we had this to say about Rule 1-322(a) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A pleading or paper is filed by actual delivery to the clerk. This may be accomplished in person or by mail. However,\n   <em>\n    the date of filing is the date the clerk receives the pleading, not the date when the pleading was mailed\n   </em>\n   . Filing therefore differs from service of a pleading or paper by mail, which is, in fact, complete upon mailing[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    381 Md. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Rules Commentary\n   </em>\n   35 (2d ed. 1984) ). The\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   Court deemed the clerk to have received the appellant's notice of appeal when it arrived at the post office box because the clerk's office had set up the post office box for its own convenience.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals held that Petitioner's petition for post-conviction relief was untimely under Rule 1-322(a) and\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   because it was received by the clerk one day after the expiration of the statute of limitations set forth in CP \u00a7 7-103(b). The court further held that Petitioner failed to show \"extraordinary cause\" under the statute. The court found nothing extraordinary about the filing of a petition by an unrepresented prisoner. Nor did the court lend any weight to Petitioner's arguments that his constitutional rights were violated\n   because, first, those arguments did not appear to be preserved and, second, even if they were, the statute \"provide[s] an extremely long time to file a\n   petition\" and has an extraordinary cause \"safety valve.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, the Court of Special Appeals declined Petitioner's invitation to adopt the prison mailbox rule. The court reasoned that it lacked the authority to do so, concluding that this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   controls the date of filing. We issued a writ of certiorari to determine whether the prison mailbox rule should be the law in Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On appeal, we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law.\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

The Supreme Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   that the \"situation of prisoners seeking to appeal without the aid of counsel is unique.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, an\n   unrepresented prisoner is deemed to have filed his or her petition when the prisoner delivers it to prison authorities to be mailed to the court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Petitioner acknowledges that\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   concerned the timeliness of an appeal from the dismissal of a petition for writ of habeas corpus, but he argues that the statute and rule at issue here- CP \u00a7 7-103 and Maryland Rule 1-322 -are sufficiently parallel to those considered in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   . Petitioner asserts that this Court should have little trouble embracing the Supreme Court's reasoning and applying it to this case. Petitioner notes that, in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court amended the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to reflect the Court's holding, and federal and various state courts have adopted the prison mailbox rule for appeals, petitions for post-conviction relief, and petitions for federal habeas corpus relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Petitioner also maintains that several Maryland cases, decided both before and after\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , set the stage for applying the prison mailbox rule in the post-conviction context. Petitioner challenges, in particular, the Court of Special Appeals' reading of\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   . As noted earlier, in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , we interpreted Rule 1-322(a) to determine that a notice of appeal, though it arrived in the clerk's post office box on time but did not physically reach the clerk until after the filing deadline, was timely filed. In Petitioner's view, the Court of Special Appeals read\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   too narrowly, foreclosing the possibility that an unrepresented prisoner, who is situated differently than the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , might have uniquely compelling circumstances that warrant a more lenient standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, Petitioner argues that, per the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , adopting the prison mailbox rule avoids\n   concerns about due process and equal protection violations. Other courts, Petitioner says, have implicated these constitutional concerns in adopting the rule. Moreover, Petitioner asserts that adopting the rule improves access to the courts for unrepresented litigants who are incarcerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   If this Court decides not to adopt the prison mailbox rule, Petitioner would have us clarify to what extent the \"extraordinary\n   cause\" provision of CP \u00a7 7-103(b) applies in a situation such as Petitioner's-where an unrepresented inmate delivers to prison authorities a post-conviction petition before the ten-year time limit has expired, but the court does not receive it until the deadline has passed. Petitioner argues that the \"extraordinary cause\" language \"naturally extends to a recognition of the extraordinary position of the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner\" and the adoption of \"a version of the prison mailbox rule whereby the ten-year deadline for filing a petition is tolled or extended.\" Consequently, if the Court either adopts the prison mailbox rule or deems Petitioner's position to constitute \"extraordinary cause,\" Petitioner asks us to hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing his petition as untimely, and the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Following the reasoning of the Court of Special Appeals, the State's argument begins with an analysis of the language of the post-conviction statute, CP \u00a7 7-103. The statute provides that unless extraordinary cause is shown, the filing deadline for a petition is ten years. Under Rule 1-322(a), a petition is deemed filed based on \"the date noted by the clerk [of the court] on the item.\" As this Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , the State observes, \"[a] pleading or paper is filed by actual delivery to the clerk.... [T]he date of filing is the date the clerk receives the pleading, not the date when the pleading was mailed.\"\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    381 Md. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Niemeyer &amp; Schuett,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Rules Commentary\n   </em>\n   35). The\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   Court added that Rule 1-322(a) is \"so clear and unambiguous in this regard that it does not require construction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blundon v.

The State therefore asserts that, under the Maryland authorities cited above, the petition was correctly rejected by the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals rightly affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Additionally, the State avers that Petitioner failed to claim in the circuit court that he had \"extraordinary cause\" for his\n   late filing. And, as the statute mandates, where extraordinary cause is not shown, a petition \"may not be filed more than 10 years after the sentence was imposed.\" CP \u00a7 7-103(b). The State argues that, taken together, these two undisputed facts-that the petition was \"filed\" one day after the ten-year deadline and that Petitioner did not argue that his circumstances were extraordinary-completely bar Petitioner's claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The State argues next that this Court \"need not, and should not, adopt and apply the prison mailbox rule to [Petitioner's] post-conviction case.\" In the State's estimation,\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. First, the State reads\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   as deciding that the prison mailbox rule applied to unrepresented inmates who, having done all that they could reasonably do to timely file an appeal, nonetheless could not meet a strict thirty-day filing window. The State argues that this was also true in\n   <em>\n    Fallen v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165679\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/139/\">\n    378 U.S. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165679\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/139/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 1689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165679\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/378/139/\">\n    12 L.Ed.2d 760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964) -a case producing a concurrence upon which the\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   Court relied-where the time to file was a\n   mere ten days after judgment had been entered. In addition, the\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   Court concluded that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) allowed for the possibility that \"filing\" could occur by delivery to prison authorities,\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    487 U.S. at 272-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The State argues that this possibility does not exist in Rule 1-322(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The State further notes that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   interpreted a federal rule of procedure; it did not make a constitutional pronouncement. Therefore, the decision is not binding on state courts. The State points to instances in which other state courts considered adopting the rule but declined to do so, generally for fear of encroaching on legislative authority to set deadlines and an unwillingness to declare judicially what could easily be established in a rulemaking capacity. In this case, the State argues that CP \u00a7 7-103, with its ten-year deadline and extraordinary cause provision, fully protects an unrepresented inmate's access to the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The State would also have us distinguish the other cases upon which Petitioner relies. The State asserts that in\n   <em>\n    Coates v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2273034\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/180/502/\">\n    180 Md. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20A.2d%20676\">\n    25 A.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942), and\n   <em>\n    Beard v. Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2214147\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/211/658/\">\n    211 Md. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.2d%20426\">\n    128 A.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957), both of which predated\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that a prisoner must have made every effort to timely file an appeal. The State points out that Petitioner waited until the very end of the ten-year filing period. Moreover, according to the State, Petitioner chose to file his petition on his own behalf even though he was entitled under CP \u00a7 7-108 to the assistance of counsel. As we understand the State's assertion, Petitioner could have obtained the assistance of the Office of the Public Defender to ensure receipt by the clerk of the circuit court before the limitations period expired. For these two reasons, the State contends that Petitioner failed to show that he made every effort to comply with the statute's filing deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As for Petitioner's constitutional arguments, the State argues that constitutional protections already exist in the statute. Ten years to file a claim with an exception for extraordinary cause, the State asserts, is more than enough to avoid any constitutional issue. The State argues that this Court should reject Petitioner's claim, as it \"simply represents one self-interested litigant's attempt to obtain post-conviction review despite his own unjustified failings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the State insists that if this Court plans to adopt the prison mailbox rule, we should do so through the established rulemaking process and not Petitioner's appeal. The State notes that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   was based (at least in part) on the Supreme Court's determination that the federal prison system had \"well-developed procedures for recording the date and time at which [prison authorities] receive papers for mailing.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    487 U.S. at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, the State argues, there is no evidence in the record that Maryland prisons either have appropriate procedures in place or could adopt them cost-effectively. The State claims that these types of inquiries are best handled by the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, which can\n   consider these and other relevant factors in drafting a new rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons explained below, we adopt the prison mailbox rule as the law in Maryland for post-conviction petitions filed by unrepresented prisoners. And because it is an \"application of new interpretations of constitutional provisions, statutes or rules,\" the prison mailbox rule applies to \"the case before us and all other pending cases where the relevant question has been preserved for appellate review.\"\n   <em>\n    Polakoff v.

Unlike other litigants,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoners cannot personally travel to the courthouse to see that the notice is stamped \"filed\" or to establish the date on which the court received the notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    at 270-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further distinguishing prisoners proceeding without the aid of counsel from other litigants, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Other litigants may choose to entrust their appeals to the vagaries of the mail and the clerk's process for stamping incoming papers, but only the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner is forced to do so by his situation. And if other litigants do choose to use the mail, they can at least place the notice directly into the hands of the United States Postal Service (or a private express carrier); and they can follow its progress by calling the court to determine whether the notice has been received and stamped, knowing that if the mail goes awry they can personally deliver notice at the last moment or that their monitoring will provide them with evidence to demonstrate either excusable neglect or that the notice was not stamped on the date the court received it.\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoners cannot take any of these precautions; nor, by definition, do they have lawyers who can take these precautions for them. Worse, the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner has no choice but to entrust the forwarding of his notice of appeal to\n   prison authorities whom he cannot control or supervise and who may have every incentive to delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court then turned to the relevant rules of procedure. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   An appeal permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At the time of\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1), which defines the time limits in Rule 3, provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In a civil case in which an appeal is permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be filed with the clerk of the district court within 30 days after the date of entry of the judgment or order appealed from[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Given this language, the Court concluded, \"nothing in the statute suggests that, in the unique circumstances of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner, it would be inappropriate to conclude that a notice of appeal is 'filed' within the meaning of \u00a7 2107 at the moment it is delivered to prison officials for forwarding to the clerk of the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    487 U.S. at 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the most part, those courts have articulated three main reasons militating against adopting the rule: (1)\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , as an interpretation of a federal procedural rule, is not binding precedent; (2) the language in the statutes and rules in their jurisdictions would not square with the prison mailbox rule; and (3) the reliability of the prison mail system described in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   is not present in their jurisdictions. Delaware and Missouri offer two examples of states in which supreme courts have rejected the prison mailbox rule for these reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Supreme Court of Delaware held that Delaware procedural rules precluded the adoption of the prison mailbox rule, stating that \"a notice of appeal filing deadline is not subject to enlargement in Delaware.\"\n   <em>\n    Carr v.

From now on, an unrepresented prisoner is deemed to have filed his or her post-conviction petition at the moment the prisoner formally delivers it to prison authorities for forwarding to the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This result not only is reasonably grounded in the language of CP \u00a7 7-103(b) and Maryland Rule 1-322(a), it also is equitable in light of the unique circumstances\n   faced by prisoners unaided by counsel. None of the holdings of the Maryland cases cited above are disturbed by this pronouncement, nor do they preclude it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   does not stand in the way of our adoption of the prison mailbox rule. Indeed, as noted above, the reasoning of that decision is wholly in line with the rationale undergirding our adoption of the rule. And, though neither\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    In re Vy N.\n   </em>\n   dealt with unrepresented prisoners attempting to file post-conviction petitions, the teachings of those cases apply to the case at bar. Both\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Vy N.\n   </em>\n   involved relinquishing authority over documents to a government agent, and in neither case did the litigants have control over what happened next. A prisoner acting without the assistance of counsel has even less control over his or her filings than did the parties in those two cases. Maryland Rule 1-322(a) provides, \"The filing of pleadings, papers, and other items with the court shall be made by filing them with the clerk of the court.\" Yet, in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , we determined that a notice of appeal could be delivered to the clerk's post office box rather than to the clerk's physical address at the courthouse-i.e., that a pleading could be deemed filed when received at a place other than the clerk's office. In\n   <em>\n    In re Vy N.\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Special Appeals held-and we have not overturned-that, so long as an authorized\n   person received a pleading on the day it was due, even if the clerk did not stamp it, the pleading would be deemed filed. In adopting the prison mailbox rule, we apply together the principles established in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Vy N.\n   </em>\n   to decide that an unrepresented prisoner, under CP \u00a7 7-103(b), \"files\" his or her post-conviction petition when the prisoner delivers it, properly addressed, to prison authorities for mailing to the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   , we also stated that \"the date of filing is the date the\n   <em>\n    clerk\n   </em>\n   receives the pleading, not the date when the pleading was mailed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    381 Md. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89841\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/27/\">\n    846 A.2d 1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting Niemeyer &amp; Schuett,\n   <em>\n    Maryland Rules Commentary\n   </em>\n   35). But\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   and, for that matter,\n   <em>\n    In re Vy N.,\n   </em>\n   were decided in different contexts-neither involved the \"unique\" position of unrepresented inmates who must surrender all outgoing mail to prison authorities for forwarding.\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    487 U.S. at 270-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circumstances of an unrepresented inmate are undeniably different from those of a non-incarcerated litigant-represented or unrepresented-who can physically assure the delivery of papers or pleadings on a particular day, call and check in with the clerk's office regarding the receipt of any mailed documents, and make emergency provisions if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   At bottom, CP \u00a7 7-103(b) and Rule 1-322(a) are sufficiently symmetrical to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202107\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4 at issue in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   . Both the federal statute and CP \u00a7 7-103 provide a timeframe for filing, and both the federal rules and Rule 1-322 make clear that filings must be directed to the clerk of the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just as in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , CP \u00a7 7-103(b) does not say that \"filed\" means received and stamped by the clerk's office. The Supreme Court made the point in\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   that ordinary litigants have control over the method and timing of their filings; unrepresented inmates do not. They can only deliver their pleadings and papers to the prison mailroom and hope for the best. \"Filing,\" for them,\n   means something altogether different than\n   for the ordinary litigant. Moreover, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Mol\u00e9\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose the possibility that the \"filing\" requirement might apply differently to different classes of persons. Simply stated, application of Rule 1-322 in that case did not involve the unique circumstances present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The cases from our sister state courts upon which the State relies, including\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    O'Rourke\n   </em>\n   , do not persuade us to reach a contrary conclusion. The courts in those cases engaged in rigid analyses based solely on the text of applicable rules and statutes in their jurisdictions. Both courts specifically noted that, because\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   interpreted a federal statute and rule of procedure, they were not bound by the Supreme Court's holding. And, in our view, both courts focused on the impracticability of implementing the prison mailbox rule without fairly weighing the interests of the prisoners whom the rule was designed to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Like we do today, the Supreme Court of Georgia adopted, by way of a judicial opinion, the prison mailbox rule in cases involving appeals from habeas corpus petitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massaline v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1067921\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/274/552/\">\n    274 Ga. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1067921\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/274/552/\">\n    554 S.E.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). In doing so, the court implemented a creative yet pragmatic solution that addresses the concerns about reliability cited in\n   <em>\n    Carr\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    O'Rourke\n   </em>\n   and raised by the State here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   We recognize that the mechanics for administering this Court's adoption of a mailbox rule may require some refinements after it is put in practice. Whether the unrepresented inmate-litigant delivered his court papers to the prison officials on or before the court deadline will be the question. Absent an established system for logging the date an inmate's outgoing legal mail is delivered to prison officials, a pro se prisoner may prove the timeliness of his filing in, at least, the following ways:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (a) an official United States Postal Service post-mark showing a date before the deadline will be conclusive;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (b) the date on the certificate of service will give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the prisoner handed his filing to the prison officials on that date; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (c) an affidavit reflecting the date and the fact the prisoner provided his legal filing with sufficient prepaid postage for first-class mail will give rise to a rebuttable presumption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The State may rebut the presumption that arises when a litigant relies on methods (b) or (c) by proving that, contrary to the representation in the certificate of service or affidavit, the prisoner delivered his application or notice of appeal to the prison officials after the deadline for filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723. Although we leave such particulars to our rulemaking process, these measures offered by the Supreme Court of Georgia suggest, at the least, a possible framework for assisting courts in determining with accuracy the date on which a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition may fairly be deemed to have been deposited with prison authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We decline to adopt what the State has characterized as the \" 'did all he could do' legal standard\" from the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Fallen\n   </em>\n   and our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Coates\n   </em>\n   . None of those cases set a legal standard for an unrepresented prisoner's conduct that focuses on his or her efforts to timely file; rather, those cases recognize the point at which-given the unique circumstances an unrepresented prisoner faces-those efforts no longer matter. As the Supreme Court explained, \"[o]ther litigants may choose to entrust their appeals to the vagaries of the mail and the clerk's\n   process for stamping incoming papers, but only the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner is forced to do so by his situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    487 U.S. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774898\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/266/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If we were to adopt the State's position, courts would be required to determine what constituted the sum total of reasonable efforts by an unrepresented prisoner.

In the event of a system outage on the day of a filing deadline, Rule 20-501 grants electronic filers a one-day extension to file or, alternatively, provides that paper submissions will be accepted. By promulgating that Rule, we recognized that that there may be circumstances that call for some measure of flexibility-even for those litigants who have the luxury of filing one minute before the filing window expires. Given the proliferation of electronic filing, we note that unrepresented prisoners currently have even less access to the courts than non-incarcerated individuals.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    According to the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, Post Conviction Defenders Division, prisoners are informed that they \"may file a post conviction petition on [their] own,\n    <em>\n     or apply\n    </em>\n    to Post Conviction Defenders Division to have an attorney file a petition for [them].\"\n    <em>\n     Post Conviction Defenders Division, Frequently Asked Questions\n    </em>\n    , Maryland Office of the Public Defender (emphasis added) (last visited Apr. 23, 2018), https://perma.cc/9ZLC-GPFQ.

We have no doubt that the Committee's work will produce proposed rules designed to clarify and refine implementation of the rule we announce today. Indeed, we encourage the Committee to determine the scope of the prison mailbox rule and explore whether, for example, the rule also should apply to prisoner-filed notices of appeal and petitions for writ of certiorari.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
