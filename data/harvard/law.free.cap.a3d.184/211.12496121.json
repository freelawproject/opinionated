The defendant received two concurrent forty-year sentences, with twenty-five years to serve and the remainder suspended with probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) admitting the testimony of Natalie Kissoon, M.D., which he contends amounted to improper bolstering that was admitted without proper foundation; (2) refusing to grant defendant's motion to pass the case; and (3) denying defendant's motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant and his ex-wife, Michele Rathbun (Michele), were living together at the time the couple's first child, Megan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was born on May 21, 1999. The couple married in 2002, had a second child on November 11, 2003, and divorced in November 2004. After their second child was born, Michele was employed at a bank and worked longer hours than defendant, which necessitated defendant picking up the children at preschool, bathing them, feeding them, and putting them to bed. After the couple divorced in 2004, Michele began a relationship with Gary Benevides (Gary), who became a father figure to her children and lived in the home with Michele and the children. Similarly, defendant began dating and eventually married Desiree Tasca; he resided at his father's house, which was a short distance from Michele's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2006, when Megan was approximately six or seven years old, defendant and Desiree moved to Utah. The defendant and Desiree subsequently had two children together; and, according to Michele, upon learning of this, Megan reacted \"[w]ith excitement\" and she \"liked the fact [that] she had\" younger siblings. Although Megan never traveled to Utah to visit defendant, they remained in contact over the telephone and occasionally over video chat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, Desiree and her two children visited Michele and her family. During this visit, Desiree and Michele had a discussion in which Desiree stated that her oldest daughter was very similar to Megan in the sense that she was \"extremely quiet and introverted[.]\" Around the same time, in 2012, Michele began noticing a change in Megan that was concerning. She observed cuts on Megan's legs that she described as \"just cuts * * * just slices, scratches, cuts * * * they were just lines.\" Megan's behavior worsened after Desiree's visit; and according to her mother, she became \"[v]ery introverted, quiet, depressed * * * unhappy[,]\" and her cuts \"became more obvious.\" When Michele confronted Megan with bloodied tissues, scissors, razor blades, and tacks that she had found in Megan's room, Megan initially denied that she was cutting herself but eventually disclosed that she was harming herself because, according to Michele, \"she did not like herself, that she thought she was ugly and disgusting, that she hated herself.\" Michele took Megan to her pediatrician, Russell Stokes, M.D., who referred Megan to a therapist, Clare Sartori.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Michele found a notebook in Megan's room with the words \"I'm broken\" written repeatedly on every page. Michele confronted her daughter and asked her, \"Why are you so broken?\" At this point, according to Michele, Megan stated that \"her father had hurt her\" and that \"[m]y father touched me.\" Megan further\n   revealed to her mother that her father sodomized her and performed oral sex on her. In light of these allegations, Michele visited Megan's therapist, contacted the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), and sat for an interview with the Rhode Island State Police. Megan underwent a physical exam at Hasbro Children's Hospital, performed by Dr. Kissoon, a fellow in child-abuse pediatrics. Megan also underwent interviews by DCYF, the State Police, and a forensic psychologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 22, 2013, defendant was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-37-8.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the state presented Michele, Gary, Dr. Kissoon, and Megan as witnesses. Michele testified in depth about Megan's revelations. She testified that Megan told her \"[t]hat her father had * * * put his penis in her butt and that her father had put his mouth on her private part * * * and had touched her.\" Megan also testified at trial. She testified that, when she was younger and lived with defendant, he showered with her \"almost every time.\" On one occasion in particular, when she was approximately four years old, Megan recalled defendant telling her to put her hands on the wall of the shower and subsequently sodomizing her. Megan testified with respect to another incident that occurred after defendant and Michele had divorced and defendant had moved out of the family home. When Megan was seven years old, she visited defendant at her grandfather's home, where defendant was residing at the time. Megan awoke to the sound of defendant and Desiree fighting, and recalled Desiree telling her, \"[Y]our dad and I were arguing. I'm going to put you in his bed.\" Sometime thereafter, defendant joined Megan in his bed and she was awakened again by \"something very uncomfortable down * * * near [her] private parts.\" Megan attempted to stop the oral copulation by kicking defendant, to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Also at trial, Dr. Kissoon testified as an expert in child-abuse pediatrics. She testified that Megan was brought to the Child Protection Center at Hasbro Children's Hospital by her mother \"due to concerns for sexual abuse.\" Pursuant to standard procedure, Dr. Kissoon performed a physical exam on Megan and did not discover anything abnormal with respect to Megan's physical condition. Doctor Kissoon testified that, \"even when we know that there's been penetration, 90 to 95 percent of those children had a completely normal physical exam, including a normal genital exam.\" Finally, Dr. Kissoon stated that her final assessment in Megan's case was \"[t]hat her disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse.\" At this point, defendant moved to strike Dr. Kissoon's statement pursuant to Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel later, during Megan's testimony, further argued that the doctor's statement should be stricken because she had not reviewed Megan's school records or her pediatric medical records and had based her conclusion solely on what Michele had disclosed to her. The court allowed the statement in question to stand; however, on the following day, the court sustained the objection, striking Dr. Kissoon's statement\n   \"[t]hat her disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse.\" Defense counsel then pressed his objection that Dr. Kissoon's testimony should be stricken in its entirety; the court refused to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that \"the only corroboration of the victim's testimony in this case comes from the now stricken answer of the * * * [d]octor.\" The trial justice denied the motion for a mistrial because corroboration was not required:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[A]s we know, the statute for this type of offense specifically addresses the fact * * * that the testimony standing alone of the victim, if it constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is sufficient to support conviction without any corroborative or confirmatory evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"So for that reason and the other reasons stated earlier in the ruling on Dr. Kissoon's testimony, the [c]ourt will deny the Motion for Mistrial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the conclusion of the state's case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure ; the motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As trial proceeded, defendant testified on his own behalf. He acknowledged that he often helped Megan with her shower and that he would \"get the water running for her and * * * she'd get in and * * * do her little play thing in the shower, and then [he would] reach in from the outside and shampoo her head.\" When asked if he ever got into the shower with Megan without his clothes on or if he had sodomized her, defendant replied, \"Absolutely not.\" The defendant further stated that he was not aware of Megan's abuse allegations until he received a phone call from her in August 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 24, 2015, defendant was found guilty of two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial based upon the newly discovered evidence that, after the trial, Michele filed a complaint seeking protection from domestic abuse by Gary and obtained a restraining order against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was defendant's argument that this newly discovered evidence would refute the state's contention at trial that, because Megan's home life had been stable, the only possible explanation for her self-harm was abuse by her father when she was a young child. The court denied defendant's motion for a new trial, and defendant timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, defendant argues that: (1) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to strike the entire testimony of Dr. Kissoon for lack of foundation; (2) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to pass the case after Dr. Kissoon testified that Megan's disclosures were consistent with sexual abuse; and (3) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to grant defendant's second motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    The Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is well settled that \"[t]he admissibility of evidence is a question addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant further contends that Dr. Kissoon's testimony served no purpose other than to bolster Megan's allegations.

At the outset, the trial justice struck the potentially prejudicial portion of Dr. Kissoon's testimony from the record prior to ruling that the remainder of her testimony did not constitute improper bolstering. After scouring the record, we cannot point to a single instance in which Dr. Kissoon commented on \"the truthfulness or credibility of [Megan].\"\n   <em>\n    Huffman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308333\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/68/558/#p570\">\n    68 A.3d at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Before this Court, both parties address the effect of the stricken statement in light of the remainder of Dr. Kissoon's testimony. However, in addition to striking the prejudicial statement from the record, the trial justice also gave the jury a cautionary instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"I need to inform you that the [c]ourt has granted a motion to strike a very small portion of testimony furnished yesterday by Dr. Natalie Kissoon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Members of the Jury, you must recognize that when a [c]ourt does strike evidence or testimony from the record, it's your solemn obligation, in accordance with your oath, not to utilize that evidence in any way or to refer to it or to speculate as to why it has vanished and been removed from the record. And I know it's, we call this process unringing a bell, and as difficult as that might seem, the rules are that you cannot consider it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"So I'm going to, you have to pretend that you never heard it basically. Okay. So the last two questions on direct examination that were posed to Dr. Natalie Kissoon are being stricken from the record. The questions are as follows: Question by the prosecutor, 'Were you able to make an assessment in [Megan's] case?' The answer of Dr. Kissoon was, 'Yes.' And the next and last question, 'What was your assessment?' Answer, 'That her disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse.' Those two questions, those two answers in their entirety are off the record. They are gone. You have to pretend that you never heard them, basically, and they cannot formulate any part of your deliberations, conversations, or speculation.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This Court has held that \"if the trial justice provides the jury with an adequate cautionary instruction, this Court assumes that the jury followed it unless 'some indication exists that the jury was unable to comply with the instruction.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial justice's cautionary instruction was more than sufficient, as she repeatedly iterated that the jury was forbidden to consider the stricken statements. Moreover, when considered in connection with Dr. Kissoon's remaining testimony that \"[Megan's] physical exam was normal with the exception of an abrasion that she had on her chest, which she said occurred [when] she was removing * * * a temporary tattoo,\" and \"[Megan] does not have any findings on physical exam indicating that she's been sexually abused[,]\" we are satisfied that the potential for prejudice was eliminated.

We note that defendant first alleged a Rule 16 discovery violation as the basis for the exclusion of the evidence; he later renewed his motion to strike the testimony. The trial justice carefully assessed Dr. Kissoon's testimony and the relevant caselaw, and instructed the jury not to consider that part of the testimony that the trial justice believed might be prejudicial to defendant. The trial justice found that Dr. Kissoon's testimony did not violate the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   , and stated that Dr. Kissoon's stricken statement did \"not render [infirm] in any way * * * the rest of Dr. Kissoon's testimony * * * which [the trial justice] believe[d] ha[d] been proper[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6957561\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/92/172/\">\n    92 A.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The motion to pass the case was based on the remainder of Dr. Kissoon's testimony because, defendant argued, he did not \"see the probative value, if any, * * * of the other things she had to say[,]\" and he claimed that \"the only corroboration of the victim's testimony in this case comes from the now stricken answer of the * * * [d]octor.\" The trial justice correctly relied on G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-37-11\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and stated that \"the testimony standing alone of the victim, if it constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is sufficient to support conviction without any corroborative or confirmatory evidence.\" This Court has explicitly eliminated any requirement of independent corroboration for sex-offense cases because the corroboration requirement \"arbitrarily singles out victims of sex offenses as a class whose credibility is immediately suspect.

In the instant case, the trial justice properly admitted the remainder of Dr. Kissoon's testimony, determining that it was both relevant and not prejudicial to defendant. The amount of probative value to accord to Dr. Kissoon's testimony was within the exclusive purview of the jury, and thus defendant's argument that the trial justice erred in refusing to pass the case because her\n   testimony did not have probative value is of no moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Based on our careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice appropriately denied defendant's motion to pass the case.

The first prong of the two-part test involves a \"four-part inquiry that requires that the evidence be (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably change the verdict at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815065\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/526/#p532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815065\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/526/#p532\">\n    708 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532 ). \"Once this first prong is satisfied, the second prong calls for the hearing justice to determine if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138-39 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815065\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/526/#p532\">\n    708 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The defendant argues that a new trial was warranted based on what he submits was newly discovered evidence that, after the trial had concluded, Michele filed a police report against Gary in which she stated that Gary was \"extremely violent towards [her] when [they] were together including breaking [her] jaw a few years ago.\" The defendant avers that this discord in Michele and Gary's relationship could serve to explain Megan's concerning behavior and self-harm, as opposed to sexual abuse by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Turning to the first prong set forth by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   , the police report was not discoverable during or prior to trial because it did not exist-defendant was found guilty on June 24, 2015, and the police report was not filed until October 7, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815065\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/526/#p532\">\n    708 A.2d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nonetheless, we are not convinced that evidence of violence in Gary and Michele's relationship was not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence. Both Michele and Gary testified in this case and disclosed that the relationship had broken down by the time of trial; defendant could have explored this further through the exercise of due diligence. A thorough cross-examination of both witnesses could have elicited testimony consistent with physical violence as alleged in the police report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Furthermore, the trial justice determined, and we agree, that evidence of a tumultuous relationship between Gary and Michele, if admitted, would be \"merely impeaching\" of the testimony by Michele and Gary, and that it would not have impacted the verdict. Specifically, if admitted, this new evidence could impeach the testimony that Megan had a pleasant home life. However, the connection between the newly discovered evidence of the police report and whether or not the defendant sexually abused Megan as a young child is so far attenuated to the issues before the jury as to have no impact on the verdict in this case. We conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the four-part inquiry set forth in the first prong under\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ; therefore, we need not address the second prong, which asks \"if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    DiPetrillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8306767\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/922/124/#p138\">\n    922 A.2d at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Firth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11815065\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/526/#p532\">\n    708 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532 ).
