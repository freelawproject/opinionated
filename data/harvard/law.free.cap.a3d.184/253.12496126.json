The defendants town of Fairfield (town) and its Board of Selectmen (board)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court granting an application by the plaintiffs, five individual electors of the town,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a writ of mandamus ordering\n   a special election for a vacant seat on the board. On appeal, the defendants claim, inter alia, that article VI, \u00a7 6.3 (B), of the Fairfield Town Charter (charter),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which does not provide for a special election when the board has acted to fill a vacancy within thirty days, is controlling over \u00a7 9-222, which contemplates the possibility of a petition for a special election to fill such a vacancy even after the board has acted, and that, therefore, the trial court improperly issued a writ of mandamus compelling a special election in the present case. We agree with the defendants and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n   The record, including a joint stipulation of the parties, reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. In November, 2015, Michael C. Tetreau, Christopher W. Tymniak, and Laurie McArdle were elected to the board for a four year term commencing on November 20, 2015, and ending on November 20, 2019. McArdle, a member of the Republican Party, subsequently resigned from the position of selectman, effective December 1, 2016. On December 7, 2016, Tetreau and Tymniak, as the remaining selectmen, appointed Edward Bateson III, who is also a member of the Republican Party, to serve out McArdle's remaining term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Subsequently, numerous electors in the town, including the plaintiffs; see footnote 4 of this opinion; filed petitions with Elizabeth Browne, the town clerk, \"request[ing] that the vacancy in the office of [s]electman ... be filled by a special election in accordance with [ \u00a7 9-222 ].\" On January 9, 2017, Browne certified that those petitions collectively contained signatures of more than 5 percent of the town's electors. Browne then requested advice from Stanton Lesser, the town attorney, about whether the statutes providing for a special election were applicable because the board had filled the vacancy by appointment within thirty days, as required by \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter. Lesser responded with a letter to Browne, opining that a special election was necessary. On January 9, 2017, Browne notified the board of the certified petitions and proposed a special election date of June 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The minutes of the board's January 25, 2017 meeting included a resolution, approved by the Office of the Secretary of the State (Secretary), scheduling the special election for June 6, 2017, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-164 and 9-222. At the meeting, Tymniak amended that resolution (1) to conclude that, \"pursuant to the plain meaning of [\u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter] there is no need to fill a vacancy on the [board] in\n   accordance with the procedure set forth in [c]hapter 146 of the General Statutes because it was filled by the [remaining selectmen] within [thirty] days,\" and (2) to declare the petitions for a special election to be \"void ab initio insofar as no such special election is required or appropriate under the clear and plain meaning of [the charter].\" The board then voted two to one in favor of the amended\n   resolution, thus refusing to set a date for the special election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Lesser then requested an opinion from the Secretary, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-3, concerning whether the town was \"legally obligated to hold a special election for the position of [s]electman, said position being ... vacated by [McArdle], who was replaced with ... Bateson by the remaining two selectmen.\" Lesser apprised the Secretary about the dispute with respect to the effect of the charter. By letter dated January 30, 2017, Attorney Theodore Bromley issued an opinion, on behalf of the Secretary, concluding that, under \u00a7 9-222, Browne was \"required to 'call' a special election for the office of [s]electman,\" which would be held \"in accordance with the provisions of ... \u00a7 9-164,\" thus requiring the board \"to establish a date for the special election ... which cannot be later than [150 days] following the filing of the petitions submitted.\" That letter did not, however, mention the charter. Following subsequent communications with a representative of the Republican town committee, Bromley declined to amend the January 30 letter, stating that the Secretary's interpretive authority is limited to statutes and does not extend to the charter, leaving it to Lesser, as the town attorney, to resolve any conflicts between those sources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Lesser forwarded the January 30 letter to the board with a cover letter dated January 31, 2017, continuing to opine that the board's resolution declining to set a special election improperly \"cites only [the charter],\n   and ignores the provisions of ... \u00a7 9-222 dealing with the term of the appointed selectman, not the method of appointment, which mandates the special election.\" Lesser provided the board with a resolution for consideration at its February 1, 2017 meeting that would rescind the previous resolution and schedule a special election on June 6, 2017. At that meeting, the board considered Lesser's proposed resolution and voted two to one against it, again declining to schedule a special election. Nevertheless, on February 3, 2017, Lesser instructed Browne to issue statutory notices calling a special election. Browne issued that notice to the Secretary on February 6, 2017, and then sent copies of that notice to the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican town committees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, on February 17, 2017, the plaintiffs brought the present application, seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the board to schedule a date for that special election. On March 10, 2017, after hearing argument based on stipulated facts, the trial court concluded that the board was required to conduct a special election in accordance with \u00a7 9-222. In a subsequent memorandum of decision, the trial court reasoned that \"there is no conflict between the charter and the statute\" because \"[w]hile both \u00a7 9-222 and the ... [c]harter require that a vacancy on the [b]oard ... be filled within thirty days, only the statute addresses the length of the replacement appointee's term. As the charter does not address the term to be served by the appointed person, and neither authorizes nor forbids a special election, the defendants' restrictive interpretation of the charter would create a conflict where none exists. Accordingly, in the absence of a conflict, the court finds that [General Statutes] \u00a7 9-7 does not apply to the present case, and instead finds that the statutory provision concerning special elections in \u00a7 9-222 is applicable to the present case.\" Accordingly, the trial\n   court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs and issued a writ of mandamus ordering the board \"to schedule a special election for the office of selectman of ... in accordance with ... \u00a7 9-222 and the applicable statutes referenced\n   therein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants then filed the present appeal from the judgment of the trial court granting the writ of mandamus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   With no appellate stay in place prior to the argument and decision of this appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the town\n   conducted the special election on June 6, 2017. This resulted in the election of Kevin P. Kiley to the seat previously held by McArdle, into which the board had previously appointed Bateson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the defendants ask us to vacate the writ of mandamus, to void the June 6, 2017 special election, and to reinstate Bateson to the board. They claim that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter fails to address the term of the person appointed to fill the vacancy and, therefore, must be read together with \u00a7 9-222, which allows a special election. The defendants further contend that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter to require a special election because the charter's incorporation of \u00a7 9-222, by way of reference to chapter 146 of the General Statutes, was contingent on the board's failure to fill the vacancy within thirty days. Relying on home rule principles, the defendants argue that the charter controls over conflicting statutes insofar as filling a vacancy on a town's legislative body is a matter of local concern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court properly determined that the town is subject to the procedures set\n   forth in chapter 146 of the General Statutes, and specifically the special election required by \u00a7 9-222, because those provisions supplement, rather than conflict with, the charter. The plaintiffs emphasize that \"[a]mbiguities in election laws are construed to allow the greatest scope for public participation in the electoral process, to allow candidates to get on the ballot, to allow parties to put their candidates on the ballot, and most importantly to allow the voters a choice on [e]lection [d]ay.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Butts\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bysiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343886\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/665/#p675\">\n    298 Conn. 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20A.3d%20932\">\n    5 A.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Citing article I, \u00a7 1.1, of the charter for the proposition that \"rights conferred by statute are supplementary to the charter,\" the plaintiffs then argue that there is no home rule violation because the charter is silent as to the term of office of one appointed to fill a vacancy on the board, and, therefore, the term of office provisions in \u00a7 9-222, defining a term of office for an appointee as the earlier of (1) the end of the remaining term of the selectman who the appointee replaced, or (2) the election of a replacement selectman in a duly held special election, do not conflict with the charter. We, however, agree with the defendants and conclude that filling a vacancy on the board is a purely local function that, in light of principles of home rule, must be governed exclusively by \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter, given its conflict with the procedure set forth in \u00a7 9-222.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The dispositive issue in this appeal, namely, whether \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter and \u00a7 9-222 conflict, and the effect of any conflict between the two provisions, presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kiewlen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meriden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20139\">\n    317 Conn. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=115%20A.3d%201095\">\n    115 A.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (noting plenary standard of review applies to statutory construction and interpretation of municipal charters); see also\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Naugatuck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457349\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/295/#p307\">\n    268 Conn. 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307-308,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=843%20A.2d%20603\">\n    843 A.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ;\n   <em>\n    Windham Taxpayers Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Selectmen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"770622\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/234/513/#p532\">\n    234 Conn. 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=662%20A.2d%201281\">\n    662 A.2d 1281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). \"In construing a [municipal] charter, the rules of statutory construction generally apply....

See General Statutes \u00a7 9-222 (\"[i]f such a vacancy ... is not so filled within thirty days after the day of its occurrence, the town clerk shall, within ten days thereafter, notify the elective town officers enrolled in the same political party as the first selectman or selectman, as the case may be, who vacated the office, or all elective town officers, if such first selectman or selectman who vacated the office was not enrolled with a political party, and it shall be filled by such elective town officers within sixty days after its occurrence\"). The statute then defines the term of the person appointed by that process to fill the vacancy in the disjunctive, providing that person \"shall serve for the portion of the term remaining unexpired\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   until a special election called as hereinafter provided upon petition of a number of electors of such town equal to five per cent of the names on the last-completed registry list thereof, but not fewer than fifty such electors.

Significantly, the charter explicitly limits the use of statutory procedures by employing the contingent term \"if\"; such a construction contemplates a contingency that did not occur in the present case-namely, a failure by the board to fill the vacancy created by McArdle's resignation within thirty days.

Insofar as \u00a7 6.3 (B) of the charter-in contrast to \u00a7 9-222-does not provide for the prospect of a special election by which to end the term of the board's appointee to the vacancy, it would be surplusage to explain further in the charter that the appointee shall, in the words of the statute, \"serve for the portion of the term remaining unexpired.\" This is because a \"vacancy\" is understood to mean an opening in an office arising during the term prior to the next regularly scheduled election. As the Rhode Island Supreme Court has explained, the \"word 'vacancy' generally has no technical meaning, other than 'empty' and 'unoccupied,' as applied to an office without an incumbent....

It necessarily follows that the statute giving the mayor such power under\n   certain circumstances conflicts with ... the charter.\" (Citation omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20N.E.2d%20131\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, with no attack on the validity of the charter provision at issue in the present case, we conclude that it controls the method by which to fill the vacancy on the board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the board timely designated a new selectman, the provision of the charter directing resort to chapter 146 of the General Statutes, which could have required a special election pursuant to \u00a7 9-222, simply was not triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, we address the plaintiffs' argument, made in their briefs and emphasized at oral argument before this court, that construing the charter in a manner allowing the vacancy to be filled only by appointment or designation, rather than by special election as provided by \u00a7 9-222, is antidemocratic and disenfranchises\n   the town's electors, particularly in light of a 2006 charter amendment extending a selectman's term of office from two years to four. First, the electors have not been deprived of their opportunity to participate in the democratic process with respect to the procedure for filling a vacancy because, \"[a]s the source of a municipality's powers, charters are generally adopted and amended at a referendum by the municipality's electors.
