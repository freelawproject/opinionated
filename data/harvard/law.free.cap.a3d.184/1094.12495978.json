He contends before this Court that the hearing justice erred in denying his application for postconviction relief because, in petitioner's view, the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the United States Constitution was violated when his parole was revoked and he was denied the possibility of parole in the future pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 13-8-14(b). He further avers that the separation of powers doctrine as well as his right to be free from double jeopardy were also violated when he was denied the possibility of parole; and he further argues that his due process rights were violated when his parole was revoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 4, 1974, petitioner was convicted in Providence County Superior Court of murder in violation of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-23-1. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. This Court affirmed his conviction in\n   <em>\n    State v. Jefferson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169807\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/116/124/\">\n    116 R.I. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12169807\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/116/124/\">\n    353 A.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). We refer the interested reader to that opinion for a detailed recitation of the facts underlying Mr. Jefferson's original murder conviction. We will restrict ourselves to only those facts which are relevant to the case before us. In setting forth said facts, we rely primarily on Mr. Jefferson's application for postconviction relief and the attachments thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 2, 1976, after Mr. Jefferson's 1974 murder conviction, the General Assembly amended the parole statutes to include the following language, which remains in the current version of the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[I]n the case of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life who is released on parole and who is subsequently convicted of a crime of violence as defined in section 11-47-2,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   said conviction shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole\n   and the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.\" P.L. 1976 ch. 223 \u00a7 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-8-14(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsequently, in January of 1986, Mr. Jefferson was granted parole. He was thereafter arrested in Pennsylvania and, on May 18, 1994, was convicted in that commonwealth of one count of aggravated assault, for which he served a twenty-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 13 and December 29, 1993, after Mr. Jefferson's Pennsylvania arrest, but before his conviction, a preliminary parole revocation hearing was held in Pennsylvania with respect to determining whether or not, as a result of his Pennsylvania arrest, there was probable cause that he had violated his parole related to his Rhode Island sentence. Thereafter, on November 10, 1994, after Mr. Jefferson's Pennsylvania conviction and while he was serving his sentence in Pennsylvania, the Rhode Island Parole Board held a final parole revocation hearing and voted to revoke his parole and indicated, in the minutes from that hearing, that he would \"no longer be eligible for parole * * *.\" In November of 2013, upon completion of his prison term in Pennsylvania, petitioner was transported to the Adult Correctional Institutions in Rhode Island. On April 14, 2014, Mr. Jefferson appeared before the Parole Board for what appears to have been a second final parole revocation hearing; there is no indication in the record that he was represented by counsel at that time. The Parole Board voted to affirm the above-referenced revocation of Mr. Jefferson's parole and, according to his application for postconviction relief presently at issue, informed him that he \"is and forever will remain ineligible for parole-consideration.\" Mr. Jefferson represents, in his application for postconviction relief, and the state does not contest, that the basis of the Parole Board's decision that he will remain ineligible for parole was the mandate contained in \u00a7 13-8-14(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Jefferson filed the instant\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief on July 1, 2014. He alleged therein that the Parole Board's reliance on \u00a7 13-8-14(b) was \"improper and unconstitutional * * *.\" Specifically, he contended that he had not been convicted of any offense listed under G.L. 1956 \u00a7 11-47-2. He further contended that his due process rights under\n   <em>\n    Morrissey v. Brewer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    408 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), were violated during the revocation proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 1, 2015, Mr. Jefferson's court-appointed counsel (having entered his appearance on October 1, 2014) filed both a motion to withdraw as counsel\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a memorandum in support of that motion pursuant to this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Shatney v.

Subsequently, on April 29, 2015, Mr. Jefferson filed an \"Objection to Defense Counsel's Shatney Memorandum.\" On June 2, 2015, a second hearing was conducted, at which Mr. Jefferson appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ; at the close of that hearing, Mr. Jefferson's application for postconviction relief was denied.

For the purposes of this opinion, we will focus only on the requirements set forth therein with respect to the final revocation hearing, as those are the pertinent requirements for this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears from the facts of this case that, after Mr. Jefferson's preliminary\n   parole revocation hearing, which took place on December 13 and December 29, 1993, he was in essence given two final parole revocation hearings on November 10, 1994 and April 14, 2014. The United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   stated that, for a final parole revocation hearing, the minimum requirements of due process are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole; (b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a 'neutral and detached' hearing body such as a traditional parole board, members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    408 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It necessarily follows that Mr. Jefferson was entitled to each of the just-quoted requirements at his final parole revocation hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   However, in\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court specifically opted not to pass on \"the question whether the parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or to appointed counsel if he is indigent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The United States Supreme Court has never held that a parolee is entitled in every case to representation by an attorney at a final parole revocation hearing; rather, that Court has held that \"the decision as to the need for counsel must be made on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system.\"\n   <em>\n    Gagnon v.

In our judgment, the instant case is on its face one of particular factual and legal complexity, and it is our view that in this case petitioner should be represented by counsel before the Parole Board if he so chooses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p790\">\n    411 U.S. at 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10343\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/778/#p790\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The need for counsel at revocation hearings derives, not from the invariable attributes of those hearings, but rather from\n   <em>\n    the peculiarities of particular cases\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added). We expressly refrain from formulating any broader rule in these premises; we restrict ourselves to the case at hand. In support of our conclusion, we note that, according to the several letters Mr. Jefferson attached to his \"Objection to Defense Counsel's Shatney Memorandum,\" he specifically requested counsel, in writing and on more than one occasion, prior to the April 14, 2014 hearing before the Parole Board. In support of his request for an attorney, Mr. Jefferson cited the fact that he was contending that he had been \"wrongly convicted of [the] 'trigger' offense;\" he further cited the \"complex issues involved\" in the case, and he made specific mention of the applicability of \u00a7 13-8-14(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is clear from the record that, when the Parole Board first revoked Mr. Jefferson's parole on November 10, 1994, at his first final parole revocation hearing, he was not \"heard in person\" because he was incarcerated in Pennsylvania at the time, nor was he represented by counsel in connection with his parole revocation.\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    408 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, it does not appear that Mr. Jefferson's due process rights, detailed in\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   , and his right to an attorney, recognized in\n   <em>\n    Gagnon\n   </em>\n   , were complied with at the time of the initial revocation of his parole by the Rhode Island Parole Board in 1994. Moreover, after Mr. Jefferson completed his sentence in Pennsylvania and was transported back to Rhode Island, he appeared before the Parole Board for what appears to have been a second final parole revocation hearing, at which appearance the Parole Board affirmed the revocation of his parole. There is no indication that he was represented by counsel at that hearing despite his numerous requests for counsel. It was error for the Parole Board to deny Mr. Jefferson counsel at the April 14, 2014 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Without addressing the constitutionality of \u00a7 13-8-14(b) as applied to Mr. Jefferson, we note that the applicability of \u00a7 13-8-14(b) to Mr. Jefferson turns in part on whether the offense for which he was convicted in Pennsylvania (aggravated assault) constitutes \"a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 11-47-2.\" The consequences of this determination are obviously severe-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , whether Mr. Jefferson will ever be eligible for parole or whether he must serve his life sentence without the possibility of parole. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that fundamental fairness and due process require that counsel be provided to him. We deem it error, therefore, for the Parole Board to\n   have denied him counsel at the November 10, 1994 hearing and the April 14, 2014 hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Accordingly, we remand this case to the Superior Court with instructions that it remand the case to the Parole Board to conduct a new parole revocation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons stated herein and due to the especially complex nature of this case, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court; and we remand the record to that tribunal with instructions that it remand the case to the Parole Board to conduct a new parole revocation hearing which complies with the requirements of due process and the right to be represented by counsel if Mr. Jefferson so chooses.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The General Assembly has amended G.L. 1956 \u00a7 10-9.1-9 so as to require a party aggrieved by a final judgment entered in a postconviction relief proceeding to seek review by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    P.L. 2015, ch. 91, \u00a7 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, \u00a7 1.

In my view, the decision to hold a new parole hearing is, at best, premature at this juncture. Significantly, this Court has not been provided with a record of the proceedings before the Parole Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, the Board's discretion was severely constricted under the circumstances of this case. Mr. Jefferson's conviction of aggravated assault in Pennsylvania conclusively establishes the fact that he indeed violated the conditions of his parole. Under the provisions of G.L. 1956 \u00a7 13-8-14(b), the conviction automatically triggers his parole revocation and precludes his eligibility for future parole. The only statutory question that must be resolved is whether the Pennsylvania conviction constitutes \"a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 11-47-2 [.]\" Section 13-8-14(b). The ultimate resolution of that issue is a question of law properly cognizable in the Superior Court in the context of a petition for postconviction relief. So too must any constitutional question be resolved by the courts, not by the Parole Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   I join my dissenting colleague, however, in her assessment that Jefferson was ignominiously \"Shatneyed.\" In the interest of justice, therefore, I would vacate the judgment denying Jefferson's application for postconviction relief and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new hearing with appointed counsel.

Jefferson was then convicted in Pennsylvania of the underlying offense that gave rise to the violation, and sentenced\n   to twenty years imprisonment.

This Court should refrain from entering these waters. First, clearly, the parolee's due-process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard and to confront one's accusers, as set forth in \u00a7 13-8-18.1(a) and (b), mirrors the Supreme Court's pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    408 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782797\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/471/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the parolee's right to counsel and right \"under certain circumstances to the appointment of counsel\" also are provided by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-8-18.1(b)(4). Critically, for purposes of this case, \u00a7 13-8-18.1(e) provides that \"[i]f the alleged violator is found to have been entitled to counsel and no such counsel has been appointed, the parole violation charges\n   <em>\n    must be dismissed with prejudice\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Alarmingly, with no record of the Parole Board proceeding, the majority has concluded that Jefferson was entitled to counsel, and that no such counsel was appointed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    Jefferson's Parole Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To begin with, we have no record in this case and, with the exception of the documents attached to Jefferson's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief, we have no idea what occurred before the Parole Board in 1994, and again in 2014, twenty years after the conviction that gave rise to Jefferson's parole revocation. What is clear in these paltry materials is that Jefferson sought to relitigate the merits of his Pennsylvania criminal conviction before the Parole Board and again in Superior Court on postconviction relief, where he alleged actual innocence to those charges. The majority has declared that it was error for the Parole Board to deny Jefferson counsel and an opportunity to be heard in person when the Parole Board voted to revoke his parole on November 10, 1994, and again at the 2014 hearing. The majority also concludes that Jefferson was entitled to disclosure of the evidence against him, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, and a written statement of the evidence relied upon in revoking his parole. The majority is mistaken. The Pennsylvania conviction is conclusive on the question of whether Jefferson committed a parole violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13-8-18.1(f). In the usual course of events, when confronted with a finding of probable cause to conclude that the parolee has violated a condition of his or her parole, the Parole Board, in a final hearing, would determine whether Jefferson's parole permit should be revoked. In the case of a criminal conviction, the parolee is not entitled to relitigate the merits of the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, because Jefferson was serving a sentence of life imprisonment when he was granted parole, the Parole Board's\n   discretion was limited. The only question before the Parole Board was whether Jefferson's felony conviction in Pennsylvania for aggravated assault falls within the provisions of \u00a7 13-8-14(b). This is a question of law. The majority opinion ignores the provisions of this statute that are triggered upon conviction of a violent crime while on parole, by one serving a sentence of life imprisonment, and \"shall constitute an\n   <em>\n    automatic revocation of parole\n   </em>\n   and the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.\" (Emphasis added.) This is the controlling statutory provision before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Section 13-8-14(b) provides, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"In the case of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life who is released on parole and who is subsequently convicted of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 11-47-2, the conviction shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole and the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   After his term of incarceration in Pennsylvania, Jefferson was returned to Rhode Island and appeared before the Parole Board on April 14, 2014; he was subsequently informed that the Parole Board voted to affirm his 1994 parole revocation. It is fair to say that, in the face of a final criminal conviction for a violent felony, the board had no discretion but to inform Jefferson that the provisions of \u00a7 13-8-14(b) applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The operative language in \u00a7 13-8-14(b) is that \"the\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   shall constitute an\n   <em>\n    automatic revocation\n   </em>\n   of parole[.]\" (Emphasis added.) A conviction for a crime of violence, as enumerated in \u00a7 11-47-2, is conclusive. Because the Pennsylvania conviction is accorded full faith and credit, no court or administrative body would look behind the judgment to determine whether there is probable cause to conclude that the parolee violated parole. The majority's suggestion that\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   mandates or even permits the Parole Board to look beyond the conviction and permit Jefferson to confront his accusers twenty years after the conviction simply is wrong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Gough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2428109\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/86/23/#p32\">\n    86 R.I. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20779\">\n    133 A.2d 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (1957) (considering parole to be void as of the date of subsequent criminal conviction);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Furthermore, the Legislature has addressed the effects of a criminal conviction in the parole violation context: Section 13-8-18.1(f) provides, in relevant part, that \"[p]roof of conviction of a crime committed subsequent to release on parole shall constitute probable cause for the purposes of the preliminary hearing.\" Thus, the issue of whether Jefferson violated his parole in Pennsylvania was conclusive; it is not however, the controlling issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   It is only when a parolee serving a life sentence has been convicted of an enumerated violent crime that \u00a7 13-8-14(b) becomes operative and \"shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole[.]\" By employing the term \"automatic,\" the Legislature has divested the Parole Board of any discretion in its application. Parole is revoked by operation of law, and the second part of that section comes into play: \"the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.\" In the case at bar, it was only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Jefferson was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to and served twenty years in prison in Pennsylvania that the Parole Board entered its final revocation decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moody v.

I am confident that the Parole Board did not employ the provisions of \u00a7 13-8-14(b) in a vacuum and that the presumption of administrative regularity that generally attaches to the decisions of administrative bodies obtains in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ouimette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3116995\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ri/117/361/#p363\">\n    117 R.I. at 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3117233,3116995\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/367/704/\">\n    367 A.2d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Court has every confidence that the Parole Board, charged with significant responsibility, carries out its duties faithfully according to statutory directions);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

Furthermore, and most critically, whether Jefferson's Pennsylvania conviction fell within the provisions of \u00a7 11-47-2 is a question of law that is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . The mandate set forth in the majority opinion requires the Parole Board \"to conduct a new parole revocation hearing which complies with the requirements of due process and the right to be represented by counsel * * *.\" The majority should explicate just what is expected of the Parole Board at this juncture, and how it should be accomplished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Unfortunately, this analysis is not the terminus of my alarm at the degree and breadth of error in the majority's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Waiver\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In a\n   <em>\n    footnote\n   </em>\n   , the majority opinion reaches and then decides the question of whether, in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief, Jefferson waived the constitutional claims raised by his appellate counsel on appeal. Indeed, the majority not only concludes that, by citing\n   <em>\n    Morrissey\n   </em>\n   , Jefferson \"clearly raised the violation of his due process rights\"-which is irrelevant-but with no analysis, discussion, or citation to authority, the majority takes an unacceptable leap and declares that, by merely\n   <em>\n    mentioning\n   </em>\n   \"due process\" in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief, Jefferson preserved \"his contention that the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause of the United States Constitution was violated when his parole was revoked and he was denied the possibility of parole in the future.\" This remarkable holding, set forth in a footnote, is legally incorrect and overlooks the entire argument by the state, which was based on waiver. Because the question of waiver forms the basis for the state's argument in favor of affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, its resolution belongs in the body of the opinion with appropriate jurisprudential support and analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   There is no question that, in the ordinary case, the raise-or-waive rule would be a significant hurdle for Jefferson to overcome. Even Jefferson does not suggest that the mere mention of the phrase \"due process\" suffices to overcome the raise-or-waive rule. In his reply brief to this Court, Jefferson argues against the application of the raise-or-waive rule, not because the issues were preserved as the majority concludes, but in light of the grave injustices wrought upon him by the application of\n   <em>\n    Shatney v.

This Court's attempt in\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   to short-circuit duplicitous applications for postconviction relief has too often resulted in the denial of an applicant's right to collateral review of his or her conviction. Simply put, the\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   nature of\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   and the questionable procedure in which counsel is appointed to undertake an initial review of the merits of a case is a procedural and substantive hodgepodge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7310839\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/56/448/#p456\">\n    56 A.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456 (R.I. 2012) (the Superior Court erroneously interpreted\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   as requiring an attorney to report back to the court rather than represent the applicant). It is my opinion that the salutary goal we aimed to accomplish in\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   has been misconstrued by the trial bench, is inconsistently applied, and produces disparate and unjust results. Furthermore, the\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   practice overlooks the statutory right of a postconviction-relief applicant in this state to have the assistance of counsel, and ignores the statutory mandate that the\n   <em>\n    Public Defender\n   </em>\n   shall be appointed to represent indigent applicants in postconviction-relief cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In the case at bar, in accordance with \u00a7 13-8-14(b), as a result of his Pennsylvania conviction, Jefferson has been denied any further opportunity for release on parole. He filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application for postconviction relief, and private counsel was appointed. The record contains no explanation as to why the Public Defender was not appointed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   G.L. 1956 \u00a7 10-9.1-5. The first order of business was to comply with\n   <em>\n    Shatney's\n   </em>\n   distasteful gatekeeping function as a condition precedent to litigating one's claim. Private counsel was appointed to determine whether there were any viable issues that would warrant counsel remaining in the case. Notably, the no-merit review performed by private counsel was based solely on the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   application, with no consideration by counsel that other viable grounds for collateral review may exist such that an amended application was in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although the Public Defender in practice refuses to take on\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   cases, notwithstanding the command of the Legislature that the applicant shall be represented by the Public Defender, on appeal, after the case has been dismissed, the Public Defender enters the case, comes before this Court and proceeds to condemn both the trial justice and the\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, in this case and in many others, applicants seeking postconviction relief are deprived of their right to collateral review of their convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Additionally, \u00a7 10-9.1-6(b) specifically allows for summary dismissal of applications for postconviction relief on the pleadings where there is no basis for relief. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \"When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing. The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application or direct that the proceedings\n   otherwise continue. Disposition on the pleadings and record is not proper if there exists a genuine issue of material fact.\" Section 10-9.1-6(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The distinguishing factor between\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   and \u00a7 10-9.1-6(b) is that the applicant has the benefit of counsel, and the trial justice, the ultimate factfinder, is not called upon to initiate summary disposition measures as a condition precedent to collateral review. Accordingly, it is my opinion that although\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   was a worthwhile and well-intended effort by this Court, it is time for\n   <em>\n    Shatney\n   </em>\n   to be assigned to the graveyard of noble causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I respectfully dissent in this case. I would vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court with directions to appoint counsel for the applicant and proceed,\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , in accordance with the provisions of the Post Conviction Remedy statute, chapter 9.1 of title 10.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    In her reply brief to this Court, counsel for Jefferson declared that \"Mr. Jefferson's court-appointed post-conviction attorney conducted absolutely no investigation into the case and determined that the issues raised in his client's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    pleadings lacked merit. Likewise, a Superior Court judge promptly endorsed this erroneous no-merit finding despite the existence of glaring constitutional issues that appear after reading R.I.G.L. \u00a7 13-8-14(b), the statute implicated in this case.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
