Clark (Clark), D. Campbell (Campbell), Steven Glunt (Glunt), and Dorina Varner (Varner) (collectively, SCI Defendants), and dismissed Brown's defamation complaint. Upon review, we affirm the trial court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Other than including their names in the caption, Brown's complaint contained no mention of Campbell, Glunt, or Varner. Brown alleges that Clark, an employee in the prison commissary, falsely reported to the unit manager that Brown threw his identification at Clark and used profanity. Brown received a verbal reprimand from the unit manager as a result of Clark's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In his complaint, Brown avers Clark defamed him by making the false report to the unit manager. He alleges Clark violated the Department of Corrections' (DOC) code of ethics by making a false report. Brown further avers Clark was not acting within the scope of her employment when violating the code of ethics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The SCI Defendants jointly filed preliminary objections in the nature of demurrers to the complaint. All four SCI Defendants asserted that sovereign immunity barred Brown's action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2310. In addition, Campbell, Glunt, and Varner sought dismissal because the complaint contained no averments concerning them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After briefing by the parties, the trial court sustained the SCI Defendants' preliminary objections. The trial court found all four SCI Defendants were shielded by sovereign immunity. The trial court further found that the complaint failed to plead any facts to support claims against Campbell, Glunt, and Varner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Brown argues Clark is not entitled to sovereign immunity. He asserts that Clark's allegedly false report about Brown's conduct violated the DOC code of ethics, and, therefore, was outside the scope of her employment. Brown asserts no argument relating to the trial court's dismissal of Campbell, Glunt, and Varner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defamation is an intentional tort, and Commonwealth personnel are immune\n   from liability for intentional torts when acting in the scope of their employment.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Conduct is within the scope of employment when it is the type of activity the person is employed to perform, occurs in an authorized time and space, is at least partly in service of the employer's interest, and does not involve a degree of force beyond that expected by the employer.\n   <em>\n    Kull v. Guisse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301361\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/81/148/\">\n    81 A.3d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.

Brown reasons that by doing so, Clark acted outside the scope of her employment. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Brown asserted the same argument in\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Sayors\n   </em>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1509 C.D. 2015, filed July 13, 2016),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203745223\">\n    2016 WL 3745223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 Pa. Commw. Unpub. LEXIS 497 (unreported). In\n   <em>\n    Sayors\n   </em>\n   , as here, Brown claimed a prison employee made false reports of threatening and abusive speech by Brown. As here, Brown contended the allegedly false statements were outside the scope of the defendant's employment because the statements violated the DOC code of ethics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This Court squarely rejected Brown's argument in\n   <em>\n    Sayors\n   </em>\n   . We concluded allegations of false or fabricated misconduct reports do not overcome the bar of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203745223\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Kull\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Northwest Training Partnership Consortium\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11990497\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/694/1134/\">\n    694 A.2d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997), this Court upheld the application of sovereign immunity to a prison warden for an alleged intentional tort. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   , a transsexual, alleged that the warden tortiously interfered with the plaintiff's employment by denying the plaintiff access to inmates to perform job training duties. This Court concluded the warden's conduct, even if tortious, was within the scope of his employment because it also furthered the maintenance of order in the prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Similarly, here, Clark's allegedly false report of misconduct by Brown facially furthered the maintenance of order by promoting orderly behavior by inmates. Thus, like the warden's conduct in\n   <em>\n    Holt\n   </em>\n   , Clark's conduct was within the scope of her employment because it served, at least in part, her employer's interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Brown's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v. Department of Corrections\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-1366 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 21, 2009),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203055324\">\n    2009 WL 3055324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2086060\">\n    2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   , a federal district court, applying\n   Pennsylvania law, declined to enter summary judgment for the defendant on the basis of sovereign immunity. However,\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable. Unlike Brown here, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   averred facts demonstrating that the defendant's allegedly false report concerning the plaintiff served the defendant's personal interest in concealing his own misconduct. Because Brown alleges no facts suggesting any personal interest served by Clark's alleged false report,\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. Significantly, the federal trial court's application of Pennsylvania law in\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   also conflicts with this Court's precedents cited above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Brown neither averred facts nor cited applicable authority to overcome Clark's assertion of sovereign immunity. Therefore, this Court affirms the trial court's order sustaining Clark's preliminary objections and dismissing Brown's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2018, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The Honorable Katherine V.
