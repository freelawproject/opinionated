(BOA), and EverBank Mortgage\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (EverBank) (collectively defendants). This matter came before the Supreme Court on April 5, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties' memoranda and at\n   oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. For the reasons outlined below, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This appeal centers on a purported procedural flaw, and our rendition of the facts focuses accordingly. On March 5, 2003, Goodrow executed a mortgage on his Newport property in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for the lender, E*Trade Mortgage Corporation (E*Trade), and the lender's successors and assigns; the mortgage was later assigned to BOA. Goodrow averred that, from 2003 until 2011, he \"made monthly payments faithfully via automatic bank payments\" in the amount of $1,890.47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, in November 2010, BOA \"adjusted [his] monthly mortgage payment from $1,890.47 to $1,970.49\" without notifying him. Goodrow explained that BOA \"wrongfully sent a notice of default and intent to accelerate\" to him in January 2011. Goodrow responded by sending, by certified mail, correspondence disputing that his account was in arrears and \"requesting reconciliation with [BOA's] accounting.\" Goodrow stated that BOA never responded to his request for account information. According to Goodrow, since January 2011, he had made numerous attempts to contact BOA to \"rectify the discrepancy\" between his records and BOA's records, all to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Goodrow further alleged that he continued to make timely mortgage payments, until June 2011, at which time \"[BOA] refused to accept\" Goodrow's payment and informed him that his mortgage was in foreclosure. Further, Goodrow claimed that in May 2011, BOA \"began publishing false negative credit information\" about him and that BOA \"continues to publish false negative information to Goodrow's detriment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2013, Goodrow filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, naming as defendants EverBank, MERS, E*Trade, and BOA. The complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that (1) the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to BOA was void; (2) BOA, MERS, and EverBank \"had no standing to foreclose\" on his property; (3) \"[t]he mortgage is void due to fraud\"; (4) BOA never notified him that his monthly payment amount had increased; (5) BOA \"maliciously reported negative credit reports\" about him; and (6) the failure to hold both the promissory note and the mortgage prohibited MERS from exercising the statutory power of sale. In three separate counts, Goodrow requested the following relief: (1) that the court issue a declaratory judgment stating that he owns the property outright; (2) that the court enter an order quieting title to the property and specifying that he owns a fee simple interest in it; and (3) that the court award him $10 million in punitive damages because of defendants' \"criminal\" actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On April 23, 2015, the federal court granted defendants' motion to dismiss based on the following determinations: (1) Goodrow lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage; (2) MERS had the power to foreclose as mortgagee; and (3) BOA, as the assignee of the mortgage, also had the power to foreclose as mortgagee. With respect to Goodrow's claims about BOA's alleged breach of its contractual duties of good faith and fair dealing, the federal court held that Goodrow \"did not make any of these legal claims in his [c]omplaint\" and, as such, found that Goodrow was barred from \"assert[ing]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   them in the face of [d]efendants' motions [to dismiss].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In January 2016, Goodrow filed a three-count complaint in Newport County Superior Court. That complaint sought monetary damages for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as well as a preliminary injunction to stop a foreclosure. Thereafter, EverBank removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, but the case was ultimately remanded to Newport County Superior Court due to a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in the federal district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2016, EverBank and BOA each filed motions to dismiss Goodrow's complaint on\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   grounds. At an October 5, 2016 hearing on those motions, defendants first argued that the breach-of-contract claim \"was dealt with or should have been dealt with in a federal court action which was dismissed * * * in April 2015.\" The defendants asserted that, in his decision, the federal district court judge did not exclude the breach-of-contract issues, but rather explained that he was \"not going to address those issues that are being brought for the first time by the plaintiff in response to our motion to dismiss.\" Second, defendants contended that, \"in the four corners of the complaint [Goodrow] has failed to demonstrate that EverBank breached the terms of the mortgage agreement, and as a consequence the complaint should be dismissed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Superior Court hearing justice rendered a bench decision wherein he found that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   warranted the granting of defendants' motions to dismiss. That decision was memorialized in an October 24, 2016 order granting the motions and dismissing Goodrow's complaint, with prejudice. On November 4, 2016, Goodrow timely appealed that order to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss[,] * * * this Court applies the same standard as the hearing justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Warfel v.

First, he contends that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is not applicable because the federal court action and the instant action \"did not stem from the same transaction or series of transactions.\" Goodrow argues that the federal court dismissal was not a final judgment for\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   purposes. Moreover, he submits that the federal court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate his claims once it determined that he did not have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Goodrow argues that his breach-of-contract claims were not appropriate for dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because he \"allege[d] numerous instances of [d]efendants' failure to perform the obligations of servicing his mortgage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, Goodrow asserts that the hearing justice erred by effectively converting defendants' motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment by relying on documents outside of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Conversion to a Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because it is determinative of the standard of review that applies in this case, we first address Goodrow's argument that the hearing justice erred by converting the motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment by relying on the federal court's dismissal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Ordinarily, when ruling on a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), 'a court may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint, or not expressly incorporated therein, unless the motion is converted into one for summary judgment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chase v.

The federal district court judge determined that, as to Goodrow's claims of breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, \"[b]ecause [Goodrow] did not make any of these legal claims in his [c]omplaint, * * * he cannot now assert them in the face of [d]efendants' motions.\" The judge further elaborated\n   that \"[t]he [c]ourt rules on the [m]otion to [d]ismiss based on the content of the [c]omplaint, not on new assertions made for the first time in response to the motion.\" This only reinforces our opinion that, while Goodrow did not raise these claims in the first action, he\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have, and he should have done so in accordance with the procedural guidelines provided by the relevant rules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Therefore, we hold that the trial justice correctly determined that an identity of issues existed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Final Judgment on the Merits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Finally, the application of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   requires that there be 'finality of judgment in the earlier action.' \"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v.

Still, Goodrow alludes to the following notion to support his position that the federal court dismissal was not an adjudication on the merits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"If the first suit was dismissed for defect of pleadings, or parties, or a misconception of the form of proceeding, or the want of jurisdiction, or was disposed of on any ground which did not go to the merits of the action, the judgment rendered will prove no bar to another suit.\"\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

The lack of standing was but one of many reasons that the federal district court judge granted defendants' motions to dismiss. The judge, after determining that Goodrow lacked standing to pursue his claims, also ruled that Goodrow's allegations \"fail in the face of\" the relevant \"exemplar cases\" from that court, the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Goodrow is correct that he was \"prohibited from undertaking the procedures usually employed in litigating a case,\" such as \"conducting discovery, preparing pre-trial documents, participating in trial, objecting to and offering evidence and exhibits, [and] conducting examinations and cross examinations of witnesses.\" However, because \"[d]ismissal with prejudice * * * constitutes a full adjudication of the merits as if the order had been entered subsequent to trial[,]\" we hold that this element is also satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    School Committee of Town of North Providence v.
