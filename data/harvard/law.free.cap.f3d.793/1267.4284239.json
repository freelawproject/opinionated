Caulkett, </em>575 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1995, 192 L.Ed.2d 52 (2015). We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the debtor\u2019s motion to strip Bank of America\u2019s junior mortgage lien. <em>See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Waits, </em>578 Fed.Appx. 827 (11th Cir.2014). The Supreme Court vacated the opinion and remanded the case to us for consideration in light of <em>Caulkett. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Waits, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2798, \u2014 L.Ed.3d - (2015). After consideration, we deny Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary reversal, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Caulkett </em>and this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkS\">In this Chapter 7 case, the debtor, Yvonne Roberts Waits, had two mortgages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>on her house, a senior mortgage lien and a junior mortgage lien. The outstanding balance on the senior mortgage lien exceeded the house\u2019s current value. Bank of America\u2019s junior mortgage lien was thus completely underwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\">Waits moved to \u201cstrip off\u2019 Bank of America\u2019s junior lien under \u00a7 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states, \u201cTo the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d). The bankruptcy court granted Waits\u2019s motion, and this Court affirmed. We explained our prior precedents in <em>In re McNeal, </em>735 F.3d 1263 (11th Cir.2012), and <em>Folendore v. United States Small Business Administration, </em>862 F.2d 1537 (11th Cir.1989), dictated the conclusion that \u00a7 506(d) allows a Chapter 7 debtor to void a junior mortgage lien when the senior lien exceeds the home\u2019s value.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In <em>Caulkett, </em>the Supreme Court vacated two Eleventh Circuit decisions that followed this same reasoning. The Supreme Court held \u201ca debtor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding may not void a junior mortgage lien under \u00a7 506(d) when the debt owed on a senior mortgage lien exceeds the current value of the collateral.\u201d <em>Caulkett, </em>575 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. at 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Caulkett, </em>our holdings in <em>McNeal </em>and <em>Folendore </em>are overruled. Accordingly, the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of Waits\u2019s motion to strip off Bank of America\u2019s junior lien. We deny Bank of America\u2019s motion for summary reversal, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the bankruptcy court, and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Caulkett </em>and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-24\">. On June 15, 2015, the parties were directed to file supplemental letter briefs addressing how the <em>Caulkett </em>decision applies to this case. Bank of America timely filed its brief. To date, however, this Court has not received a response from Waits, whose brief was due July 13, 2015.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
