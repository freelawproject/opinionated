Three one-half pounds tare to be deducted on each bale. Said hops to be delivered f. o. b. cars at Belle-ville, 111., and to be p'aid for in net cash ten days from date of arrival at the rate of twenty-one (21) cents per pound. Time of shipment October, 1895. In witness whereof, the said parties have hereunto set their hands, Belleville, 9th day of December, 1890.\u201d In due time Horst Bros. loaded a car with the specified quantity of hops, but did not prepay the freight. When the ear arrived at Belleville, the railroad company placed it on the side track of the brewery company. Within three days that company examined the hops, refused to accept them on the ground that they were not of the required quality, notified Horst Bros., and asked instructions. Both parties continued in their refusal to take the hops. The railroad company afterwards took the car away, and that is the last shown by the record, except that neither party ever came into possession of the hops or any proceeds from their sale. Horst Bros, filed their declaration, containing common counts only, and attached thereto a copy of the contract. The brewery company filed a plea of the general issue, and gave notice of a special defense that the hops were not of contract quality. Horst Bros, had a verdict and judgment for the full contract price.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-10\">Eucius D.

In view of the prior dealings between the parties, shown by the record, we attach no importance to Horst Bros.\u2019 failure to prepay the freight. On shipments that had been accepted, the brewery company had been paying freight and charging bade the amount to Horst Bros.; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and no objection was made to the present shipment on that the freight had not been prepaid. Treating the freight as prepaid, and the brewery company\u2019s refusal to accept as perverse, there remains the question of Horst Bros.\u2019 right to recover for goods sold and delivered. The parties had the right to make a contract which would require the brewery company to accept Horst Bros.\u2019 selection of choice California hops and to pay within io days after the_ arrival of the car at Belleville. But the contract they entered into in 1890 bound Horst Bros, to an agreement to sell and deliver in 1895 an article which would have no existence until then, and bound the brewery company to an agreement to purchase, receive, and pay for that article. This was not a sale. The minds of the parties had never met on a specific, identified thing as the object of barter. Their minds could not meet until Horst Bros, had made an appropriation of a specific, identified thing as a fulfillment of the contract in that respect, and until the brewery company had accepted or acquiesced in that appropriation. Under this contract, neither Horst Bros, nor any third party was authorized to make a binding selection and appropriation for the brewery company. The brewery company never consented to the appropriation. That it should have done so is of no consequence in this action for the price of goods sold and delivered. If a party purchases, he may be held to pay for the thing. If he agrees to purchase and refuses, the remedy is for breach of the contract to purchase. 2 Benj.\u201d Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 1051, 1117; 1 Mechem, Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 729, 730; 2 Mechem, Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 1369, 1370; Pope v.
