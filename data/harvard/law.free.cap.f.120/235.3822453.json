C. McClurg &amp; Co., one of its creditors, appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The question presented is whether the corporation is such a one-as is comprehended within the terms of the bankruptcy act (30 Stat. c. 541, \u00a7 4b [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3423]), which provides that a corporation \u201cengaged principally in manufacturing, trading, printing, publishing or mercantile pursuits\u201d may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt. The matter is ruled by our decision in the case-of In re The Surety, Guarantee &amp; Trust Company, 121 Fed. 73, announced at this term. In addition to the authorities referred to in the opinion in that case, we may call attention to the following: In re Oriental Soc. (D. C.) 104 Fed. 975; In re Mutual Mercantile-Agency (D. C.) 111 Fed. 152; In re Philadelphia &amp; L. Transp. Co. (D. C.) 114 Fed. 403; In re Tontine Surety Co. of New Jersey (D. C.) 116 Fed. 401; In re White Star Laundry Co. (D. C.) 117 Fed. 570. We are content to adhere to our ruling in the case referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The decree of involuntary bankruptcy is reversed, and the causes-are remanded to the court below, with a direction in each ease to&gt; set aside the adjudication and to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u00b61\" orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b267-18\">.
