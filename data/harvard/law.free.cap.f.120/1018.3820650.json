That decision, however, is the. law of the case, and we are without authority, upon this appeal, to disturb that judgment. Supreme Lodge Knights of Pythias v. Lloyd, 46 C. C. A. 153, 107 Fed. 70; United States Life Ins. Co. of City of New York v. Cable, 39 C. C. A. 264. 98 Fed. 761. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
