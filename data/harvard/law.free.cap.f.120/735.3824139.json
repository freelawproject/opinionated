See Hubgh v. New Orleans &amp; Carrollton R. R. Co., 6 La. Ann. 495, 54 Am. Dec. 565; Satterly v. Morgan, 35 La. Ann. 1166; Towns v. Railroad Co., 37 La. Ann. 630, 55 Am. Rep. 508; Wallis v. Railroad &amp; Steamship Co., 38 La. Ann. 160; Dandie v. Railroad Co., 42 La. Ann. 689, 7 South. 792; Bell v. Lumber Co., 107 La. 725, 31 South. 994. In Mexican Central R. R. Co. v. Sprague, 52 C. C. A. 318, 114 Fed. 544, this court found from the record and evidence that under the specific laws of Mexico, as construed by the Mexican courts, the common-law doctrine as to the nonliability of an employer for the negligence of a fellow servant did not exist in Mexico. In Railroad Co. v. McDuffey, 25 C. C. A. 247, 79 Fed. 934, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held upon proof that under articles 1053 and 1054 of the Civil Code of Canada, as construed by the Canadian courts, \u201cwhere an accident causing injury to a servant was the result of the negligence of a fellow servant, the employer would nevertheless be liable in damages to the injured person,\u201d etc. These last two mentioned cases, and others to the same purport, cited by counsel for plaintiff in error, turned upon local laws and their proper construction, and are not applicable in the instant case. Under the late decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States the employ\u00e9s of a railroad company specifically engaged in operating a train of the company are fellow servants, and, under the general law, for the damages to one through the negligence of the other the employer, without fault himself, is not liable. See Railroad Company v. Baugh, 149 U. S. 368, 13 Sup. Ct. 914, 37 L. Ed. 772; New England Railroad Co. v. Conroy, 175 U. S. 323, 20 Sup. Ct. 85, 44 L. Ed. 181. As the petition and amended petition in this case show that the damages sued for were caused through the negligence of fellow servants of the deceased, and in no wise show any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>negligence attributable to .the railway company, the Circuit Court properly sustained the demurrer to the said petitions, and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The decision of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
