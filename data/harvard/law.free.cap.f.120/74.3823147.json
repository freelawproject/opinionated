Them monastery having been destroyed and the monks driven out during the French Revolution, the recipe for the cordial, which was secret, descended by inheritance to one who in 1863 commenced its manufacture and sale commercially on a part of lands formerly held by the monks, then giving it the name of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, by which it has become well known and attained a large sale. It has been put up since that time in a peculiar shaped bottle, having thereon distinctive labels and seals. The name was registered as a trade-mark in the United States in 1876, as were also the labels. Such person afterward organized the complainant corporation, to which he transferred the business and in which he became the principal stockholder. Defendant about 1898 placed on the market a cordial in bottles of the same sizes and of nearly the exact shape of those of complainant, having labels and seals similarly placed thereon and of similar appearance, having printed thereon the name \u201cBiqueur de St. Benedict\u201d and the word \u201cSt. Benedict\u201d blown in the bottle in the place of the word \u201cB\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\u201d in complainant\u2019s bottles.

It was originally prepared by the B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Monks, but since the French Revolution has been made by a secular company.\u201d Cent. Diet. An historical account of the origin of this cordial is given by Judge Taft in the case of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme De La Distillerie De La B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine v. Micalovitch, Fletcher &amp; Co., 36 Alb. Law J. 364, as follows: \u201cAt F\u00e9camp in Normandy, France, the B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Monks had a monastery for several centuries before the French Revolution. They invented a liqueur or cordial made from cognac and a decoction of an herb growing wild in that country, and other ingredients, and made it for their own use. They preserved the recipe as a secret in a book of recipes. In 1792 the abbey of F\u00e9camp was destroyed and the monks driven out. A. Legrand, Senior of F\u00e9camp, one of whose ancestors was an attorney general of the abbey, came into possession of the book of recipes by inheritance. In 1863 he began the manufacture of the liqueur in question on an estate which was formerly part of the lands of the abbey, and where now is situated a museum of relics of the abbey. The recipe of the monks was followed exactly in the manufacture of th\u00e9 liqueur. The recipe is preserved as a secret known only to Legrand Aine, and two sons in business with him. In 1863 the liqueur first became an article of commerce, and then for the first time was it given the name \u2018B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.\u2019 \u201d M. Legrand Aine continued the business from 1863 until 1876, when he made over to the complainant corporation then formed by him the plant, business, and good will. The fact is stated in the case above referred to as follows: \u201cIn 1876 he (Legrand) organized a corporation which was called the \u2018Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de la Distillerie de la B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Liqueur -de TAbbaye de F\u00e9camp,\u2019 to which he conveyed all the property used for the manufacture of this liqueur, together with his trade-marks, business assets, and good will, and received therefor 4,500 shares out of the 5,000 shares of the company. He became sole director of the company.\u201d This corporation has since continued and now carries on the business at the same place and with the same plant. The article is widely known and sold throughout Europe and the United States, Canada, and South America; its sale in the United States amounting to from five to seven thousand cases annually, and in the state of Illinois to about seven hundred' and forty cases annually. In 1863 M. Legrand selected a peculiarly shaped bottle to contain the cordial, a black glass bottle of ungainly shape, having a bowl-shaped body and long neck, which is peculiar to this business and has become familiarly known to the trade as a container of this cordial. They come in two sizes, quarts and pints. On one face of the bottle is blown the word \u201cB\u00e9n\u00e9dictine,\u201d with a cross at either end. Below it is placed a light brown label with the following printing thereon: \u201cToutes les Bouteilles de B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, Liqueur de l\u2019Ancienne Abbaye de F\u00e9camp doivent avoir au bas une \u00e9tiquette portant le fac-simile de la signature de A. Legrand A\u00edn\u00e9. La plus large ligature du plomb qui entoure le col doit porter les marques et inscriptions suivantes;* Veritablet B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.* Lebouchon devra \u00e9tre marqu\u00e9 tout autour de: V\u00e9ritable Liqueur B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine.* Enfin le dessous du bouchon portera: D. O. M.f\u201d Upon bottles exported to the United States and Canada underneath the label noted is an oblong label with blue ground, having thereon the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cSole Agent for the United States of America and Canada. Henry E. Gourd, New York\u201d; the words \u201cHenry E. Gourd\u201d being in gold letters, the others being in white letters. On the reverse face of the bottle on the shoulder is blown a figure somewhat like a horseshoe, within which is a_ seal of wax of the color of a bright vermilion, and upon it there is a mitre with a crosier, and, below, three mitres. Below this, and upon the face of the bottle, is a circular light brown label having thereon the letters \u201cD. O. M.,\u201d below which is a cross, and beneath that the words \u201cLe Directeur, A. L.\u201d Beneath this label is another label of similar color, having thereon the inscription \u201cVeritable Liqueur B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, Marques d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en France et \u00e1 1\u2019Etranger,\u201d and below this a fac-simile of the signature of A. Legrand Aine. Upon the neck of the bottle are two labels of like color with the others, one containing the words \u201cLiquor. Monaehorum Benedictinorum. Abbatiae Fiscanensis\u201d; the other placed immediately below has thereon the words, in English, \u201cImported from Fecamp (France).\u201d The cork and mouth of the bottle are covered with a tan leather-skin capsule upon which is pasted a label of like color with the others, bearing the words \u201cRegistered TradeMarks\u201d; a wax seal of like color with the other seal being upon this capsule and over the mouth of the bottle. A leaden band passes around the neck of the bottle and over the capsule, and is attached under the seal on the shoulder of the bottle. The trade-mark \u201cB\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\u201d was registered by M. Legrand in September, 1876, in the United States patent office pursuant to-the act of congress, as were also the other labels which have -been described. The appellant, A. Bauer &amp; Co., is a corporation of the state of Illinois, engaged in the general wholesale and retail liquor business in the city of Chicago. Prior to'the filing of the bill it placed on the market at the city of Chicago and sold a cordial in bottles of the precise sizes and nearly the exact shape of the bottle of the appellee, having the imitation of a horeshoe blown in the bottle upon its shoulder as in the appellee\u2019s bottle, and a red seal of wax therein resembling the seal of the complainant, with the letters around it \u201cLiqueur De St. Benedict.\u201d Below it is a circular label of like color and form to that of the appellee\u2019s label, having thereon the words and letters across the face of it \u201cA. B. O. Liqueur de St. Benedict,\u201d and- upon the label a red cross. Beneath that label is another label of like color, having the words printed thereon \u201cLiqueur De St. Benedict.\u201d Around the neck of the bottle are two labels of like color with the appellee\u2019s labels, the upper one-having the inscription \u201cToutes les Bouteilles de Liqueur St. Benedict doivent avoir au has une etiquette portant le facsimile de la signatur de Mossieur,\u201d\u2019 with the fac-simile signature \u201cThe Tucker Hardy Co.,\u201d the latter being the department name given to a branch of A. Bauer &amp; Co. Underneath that label is a smaller label of like color, having thereon the words \u201cFabriqu\u00e9 en Etats Unis.\u201d Upon appellant\u2019s bottle there is a band of lead underneath the' rim of the neck, stretching across the cork. The cork is covered by a capsule made of paper, and, in place of the leaden ligature in the appellee\u2019s bottle, a substitute ribbon of leaden color passes over the capsule and is attached under the seal on the shoulder of the bottle. The mouth of the bottle is also-covered with a wax seal of similar color to that of the appellee\u2019s, and the name \u201cSt. Benedict\u201d is blown upon the face of the bottle. The court below decreed for the complainant, appellee here, enjoining the use of the term \u201cLiqueur St. Benedict\u201d or \u201cSt. -Benedict,\u201d and the use of the bottles and of the marks on the labels specified; which decree is brought here by appeal for review.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-4\">F.

It is true that no one has a monopoly of form, nor has he a monopoly of color, of the shape of the letters, or geographical names, or of his own name, but one may not, by means lawful in themselves when devoted to a lawful end, perpetrate a fraud upon the public, or infringe the rights of another.

It would be impeachment of intelligence to say that here there was not design to market the appellant\u2019s goods as the goods of the appellee. There is such marked similarity in the shape of the peculiar bottle, in the character and arrangement of the labels, the letterpress, the use of the French language of the letterpress upon an article manufactured in the city of Chicago, in the wax seals, in the capsules covering the corks and the means of fastening them, in the name \u201cB\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\u201d and \u201cSt. Benedict\u201d blown in the bottles, that it is clear not only that there was design to deceive but also that deception is most probable. The trade-mark \u201cB\u00e9n\u00e9dictine\u201d has been sustained in able and elaborate opinions in 1887 by Judge Taft, when upon the bench of the superior court of Cincinnati, in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme De La Distillerie De La B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine v. Micalovitch, Fletcher &amp; Co., 36 Alb. Law J. 364, and in 1890 by Judge Thayer in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme De La Distillerie De La Liqueur B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine De L\u2019Abbaye De F\u00e9camp v. Western Distilling Co. (C. C.) 43 Fed. 416. There can be no question of the right of the appellee to the use of the garb with which it has clothed its product, nor of the design of the appellant to pirate that right and to sell its goods as the goods of the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">It is urged that the appellee claims as the assignee or purchaser of the business from M. Legrand; that in the use of the trade-marks so purchased it should indicate that it is the assignee or purchaser, and that, failing therein, it cannot be protected in their use. This contention is predicated upon the case of Medicine Co. v. Wood, 108 U. S. 218, 2 Sup. Ct. 436, 27 L. Ed. 706- There the complainant was the manufacturer of a certain medicine known as \u201cAtwood\u2019s Vegetable Physical Jaundice Bitters,\u201d and claimed as its trade-mark that designation, with the accompanying labels; the right being derived from one Moses Atwood, the designation mentioned being blown in the glass, and the labels attached stating that the article was manufactured by Moses Atwood, Georgetown, Mass.\u2019, while the medicine was in fact manufactured by the complainant in the city of: New York. The court, by Mr. Justice Field, lays down the principle d\u00e9clared in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">\u201cThe object of the trade-mark being to indicate, by its meaning or association, the origin or ownership of the article, it would seem that when a right to its use is transferred to others, either by act of the original manufacturer or by operation of law, the fact of transfer should be stated in connection with its use; otherwise a deception would be practiced upon the public, and the very fraud accomplished, to prevent which courts of equity interfere to protect the exclusive right of the original manufacturer. If one affix to goods of his own manufacture signs or marks which indicate that they are the manufacture of others, he is deceiving the public, and attempting to pass upon them goods as possessing a quality and merit which another\u2019s skill has given to similar articles, and which his own manufacture does not possess an the estimation of purchasers. To put forth a statement, therefore, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>form of a circular or label attached to an article, that it Is manufactured In a particular place by a person whose manufacture there had acquired a great reputation, when, in fact, it is manufactured by a different person at a different place, is a fraud upon the public which no court of equity will countenance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">It will be observed that in that case the labels contained the assertions that the article was manufactured by a certain person and at a certain place, both of which assertions were untrue, and that the decision proceeded upon the theory that such statements were not honest, and worked a deception upon the public in attempting to pass upon them goods as possessing a quality and merit which another\u2019s 'skill had given to a similar article. The trade-mark and labels upon the bottles of the appellee contain no direct assertion of the maker. It may rather be said that the association of the name with the article indicates the place, or process, or quality of manufacture. Here the place of manufacture remains the same, the secret process is unaltered. There would seem to have been no substantial change of ownership. The manufacture continued at the same \u2018place and substantially under the direction of the same person. The cordial made from the recipe of B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine Monks has been known for nearly 400 years. Its reputation rests upon its quality. Its excellence is assured by the fact that it is made in accordance with the original formula, and at the place where it alone has from the beginning been made, and where the herb of which it is a decoction grows wild. The name, as applied to a cordial so ancient and in quality so tmchanging, has by association become the designation of place of manufacture and of quality, rather than that of the manufacturer. There is here no false statement. There is no deception upon the public. In such case the reason of the rule fails, and the rule itself, proper in appropriate cases, should not here be permitted to work a wrong. The question was elaborately considered by Judge Taft and by Judge Thayer in the cases referred to, and their reasoning meets with our approval. See, also, Pillsbury v. Flour Mills Co., 64 Fed. 841, 850, 12 C. C. A. 432, 441; Stone Co. v. Wallace (C. C.) 52 Fed. 431, 437: Cuervo v. Landauer (C. C.) 63 Fed. 1003; Feder v. Benkert, 18 C. C.
