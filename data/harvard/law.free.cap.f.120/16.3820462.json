Upon full and independent consideration of the subject, we concur in the conclusion which was there reached, and in the opinion by which that conclusion was supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-15\">The decree of the circuit court for the Eastern district of Pennsylvania, affirming the decision of the board of general appraisers, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
