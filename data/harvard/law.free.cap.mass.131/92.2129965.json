At a later stage of the case, the defendant offered to show that nothing was due from him to the plaintiff, and the judge excluded the evidence. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-6\">Tort for assault and battery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Allen, J., it appeared in evidence that, on April 15, 1875, the plaintiff, a laboring-woman, called at the defendant\u2019s house in Boston, and demanded of the defendant a sum of money, claiming it was due her as wages; and that, upon the plaintiff making such demand, the defendant became enraged and ordered the plaintiff to quit her house, and, while the plaintiff was leaving the house, she received injuries, which she alleged were occasioned by an assault and battery committed upon her by the defendant. The plaintiff offered evidence tending to show an indebtedness from the defendant to her; but this evidence was excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">The defendant then offered evidence tending to show that, at the time the plaintiff made the demand upon the defendant for money, there was nothing due the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had never made any contract with the defendant by which she would be entitled to wages from the defendant; and the defendant stated, at the time of offering this evidence, that it was offered in mitigation of damages, with a view of showing that the circumstances under which the plaintiff demanded the money enraged and excited the defendant, and caused her to do the wrongful act complained of.

The plaintiff, in making out her case, offered evidence to show an indebtedness from the defendant to her, which was excluded upon the objection of the defendant. At a later stage of the case, the defendant offered evidence to show that nothing was due the plaintiff. To admit the evidence might be unfair and unjust to the plaintiff, who might not be prepared at that time to meet an issue which, on the defendant\u2019s motion, had been excluded from the case. We think the defendant had waived and lost the right to insist upon introducing evidence upon this issue; and that its admission or rejection was within the discretion of the presiding justice, to the exercise of which no exception can be taken. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>101 Mass. 31. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>1 Cush. 228, 243. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
