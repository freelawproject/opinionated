Martin and to her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-11\">The reasons of appeal assigned were, that the will was on condition that the testator should be taken good care of and well treated during the remainder of his life by Joseph Martin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Mary B. Martin, his wife; that they did not perform the condition, but from the time of the making of the will up to the death of the testator they treated him with harshness and cruelty; that they greatly neglected him, and deprived him, among other things, of necessary and proper food and nourishment, and of proper care and medical attendance during his sickness; and that they knew of the provisions of the will, at the time it was executed, and of the condition attached to the provisions therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-4\">The appellee filed a demurrer to the reasons of appeal, on the ground that they were not sufficient in law to sustain the appeal, or to avoid and defeat the will. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">At the hearing in this court, the decree of the Probate Court was affirmed; and the appellants appealed to the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b570-6\"><em>C.
