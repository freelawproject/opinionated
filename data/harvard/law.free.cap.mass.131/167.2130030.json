Danforth, the agent of the defendant, came, in October 1867, to the plaintiff\u2019s house, at his request, with a physician, to make out the papers for insurance on the plaintiff\u2019s life; that the physician examined him and passed him; that Danforth asked him his age, and was told that he was born in 1813; and was also shown two passport books used by the plaintiff in Germany, in which he was represented as twenty-six years old in 1840, and twenty-seven years old in 1841; that the agent thereupon filled out a proposal for insurance to which the agent signed the wife\u2019s name, and the plaintiff witnessed the same; but that neither he nor his wife could read or write English, and the proposal and the questions and answers therein were not read to them, and they did not know what they contained; that the plaintiff paid the first premium and all annual premiums, including that for the year 1877, as his own money, and that the defendant received them as paid on account of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">It further appeared that the proposal for insurance repre sented that the plaintiff was forty-three years old, and contained an agreement on the part of the assured that, if the statements therein made were not true, the policy should be void, and all moneys paid on account thereof be forfeited to the company; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>and that the policy, which insured \u201c the life of Frederick Trabandt for the sole use of Mary Trabandt,\u201d contained the provision that, if the proposal, answers and declarations should be found to be untrue, the policy should be void, and cease and <em>determine; </em>and that, if after three premiums had been paid the policy should be surrendered while in force, the company would issue a paid up non-forfeiture policy therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-4\">It further appeared that yearly notifications, signed by the secretary of the company, were sent to the plaintiff, of the amounts due, giving authority to the agent to receive the same, and that yearly receipts were so given the plaintiff for the amounts paid by him to such agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-5\">There was also .evidence that, when the premium for 1878 became due, the plaintiff went to the office of the defendant in Boston, said he was too poor to pay the premium, and asked that the company would do what it could for him; that the agent asked how old he was, and, on being told the year in which he was born, said at once that he was ten years older than the policy insured him for, and that the policy was void; and that the president of the company subsequently said it was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-6\">The plaintiff contended that the policy was void from the beginning, and never took effect by reason of the fraud of the defendant\u2019s agents.
