Answer, a general denial. Trial in the Superior Court, before Allen, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-8\">James Douglas was a material witness for the plaintiff, and, on his direct examination, was asked by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel if the defendant had come to him and asked him to go to his counsel\u2019s office. Douglas answered that he had. There was no further inquiry or answer in this direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-9\">The defendant, while testifying as a witness, was asked by his counsel, against the plaintiff\u2019s exception, the following question : \u201c What did Douglas say to you and you to him when you went to see Douglas and asked him to go up to your counsel\u2019s office?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cI asked him to go up to my counsel\u2019s office; he said he had been over to Cambridge three or four days, and had got nothing for it; that he was a poor man and could not afford to lose his time, and that he had a job and could not go up. I asked him how much he was going to get for the job, and he said two dollars. I said you .will only lose a half-day, I will give you a dollar; so I gave him a dollar, and he agreed to come up Monday morning, but did not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b333-10\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-11\"><em>0. R. Train M. H. </em>Swett, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-12\"><em>N.

She asked but a single question, and the answer as given was unimportant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>immaterial. Whether it would ever become material did not then appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The defendant was subsequently a witness in his own behalf, and his counsel asked him to give the language used by him and by the witness in the interview to which the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry related, and he was permitted to give it. If there were any materiality in the answer, it was made so solely by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry. It was indeed very unimportant, if material ; but it was clearly within the discretion of the presiding judge to admit it, even though it should not prove to be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We cannot, however, doubt its competency. If the plaintiff\u2019s inquiry of the witness had any materiality, it was to show that there was something unfair or improper in the advance made to the witness. If the defendant\u2019s statement is true, it repels such idea. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
