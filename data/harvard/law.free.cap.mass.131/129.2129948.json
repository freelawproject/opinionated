Trial without a jury in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., who found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-12\">On April 1, 1875, the plaintiff, being the owner of four lots of land in Boston, all of which were subject to two mortgages to the Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank of Lowell, one made by John T. Broadhurst for the sum of $5000, (which the plaintiff, by indenture with the bank, dated May 30,1874, had agreed to pay on September 30, 1877, to which time payment of the notes liad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>been extended by the bank,) and the other by the plaintiff for the sum of $1000, payable May 25, 1874, conveyed the four lots to the defendant by two deeds, one of which, of three lots, stated the consideration to be $21,000, and the other, of the fourth lot, stated the consideration to be $7000; and each deed contained, after the description of the premises granted, this clause: \u201c Subject to two mortgages to the Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank in Lowell, one for the principal sum of $5000, and one for the principal sum of $1000, which the grantee hereby agrees to assume and pay as part of said consideration; \u201d and referred to the records of the mortgages and of the extension of the first mortgage. On April 28, 1877, the defendant conveyed his equity of redemption to George W. Meserve.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-4\">On January 19, 1878, the bank took possession of the mortgaged premises for breach of condition of the mortgages, and executed proper certificates of entry, but never recorded the certificates, and has since retained possession, receiving the rents and profits. The interest on the $5000 mortgage note was paid by the plaintiff to March 30, 1875, and by the defendant from that date to March 30, 1877. The interest on the $1000 mortgage note was paid by the plaintiff to November 1, 1874, and by the defendant from that date to May 1, 1877. No subsequent interest, and no part of the principal, has been paid to the bank, except so far as reduced by its receipt of the rents and profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">Payment of the notes and mortgages was frequently demanded of the plaintiff by the bank before and on, but not after, May 8, 1878, on which day the plaintiff, by instrument under seal, assigned to the bank \u201c all my claims and right and cause of action against said Paul for the nonpayment of said mortgages, and the notes and debts secured thereby, and all benefits to be de&gt;rived from and the damages suffered and sustained by me, said Reed, in consequence of the breach of the agreements and obligations of said Paul to assume and pay the same, as set forth in said deed, or otherwise; \u201d and empowered the bank to compromise and settle said claims, damages, right and cause of action, on such terms as it should deem expedient, either with or without suit, and to release the same; but without cost or expense to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>This action was brought June 15, 1878, for the benefit of the bank, without any previous demand upon the defendant by the plaintiff or by the bank, except that the bank sent to the defendant its usual printed notice that the notes and interest were due, and that he was requested to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-4\">On August 31, 1878, the plaintiff filed his petition in bankruptcy; and, on January 25, 1879, was duly adjudicated a bankrupt. On February 14, 1879, William H. Drury was duly appointed his assignee in bankruptcy. The plaintiff has not yet obtained his discharge in bankruptcy, but proceedings upon his petition are still pending.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">On October 15, 1879, there was filed in this action the following notice: \u201c The Mechanics\u2019 Savings Bank in Lowell comes in and gives notice that the plaintiff\u2019s claim in this case was assigned to it prior to the bringing of the plaintiff\u2019s suit, and that said suit was originally brought for its benefit, and said bank now owns said cause of action, and moves for leave to prosecute said action for its own benefit. By F. W. Kittredge, its attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">\u201cI take notice of the above, and disclaim all right to said action, by reason of the assignment above referred to, and I do not desire to be further heard. Wm. H. Drury, Assignee of the estate of Samuel Gr. Reed in bankruptcy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-7\">There was no evidence at the trial that the bank forbore its claim for payment of the mortgage debts, or that it had taken any part in the proceedings in bankruptcy. Before and at the trial, the defendant asked and contended, as matter of right, that the case should be continued to await the result of the proceedings in bankruptcy, in order that it might be ascertained whether the plaintiff obtained his discharge; contending that such discharge would be a bar to this action. But this request was refused; and to this refusal the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-8\">Upon the facts above stated, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, but was entitled to recover nominal damages only, and found for the plaintiff, assessed damages in the sum of' one dollar, and ordered judgment accordingly; and each party alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-9\"><em>F. W. Kittredge, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-10\"><em>F. W. Hutchins J. H. Young, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2z\">The defendant, by accepting the deeds from the plaintiff subject to two mortgages to the bank, for the amount of which the grantor was personally liable, and \u201c which the grantee hereby agrees to assume and pay,\u201d has promised the grantor to pay those mortgages and not merely to indemnify the grantor against them; if the defendant does not pay the amount of those mortgages as they become due and payable, he is liable to the grantor in an action of contract in the nature of assumpsit upon his promise; and the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages in such an action is the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s debts which the defendant has not paid according to his agreement. <em>Furnas </em>v. <em>Durgin, </em>119 Mass. 500. <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Homer, ante, </em>93. The fact that the defendant has since sold the lands to a third person affords no reason for denying or limiting his liability upon his agreement with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The assignments <em>in pais </em>and in bankruptcy of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action do not affect the right to maintain this suit in his name with the consent of both assignees. <em>Mayhew </em>v. <em>Pentecost, </em>129 Mass. 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The question of the effect upon this suit of a discharge in bankruptcy of the plaintiff from his liability upon the mortgage notes is not before us. He has as yet obtained no such discharge. Whether this case should be continued, to await the determination of the question of his discharge in the bankruptcy court, was wholly within the discretion of the court below. The bankrupt act does not require the State courts to stay any action, except against the bankrupt, and upon the application of the bankrupt or of his assignee in bankruptcy. Even an action against him may proceed to judgment, if neither he nor his assignee interposes any objection, or if the bankruptcy court gives leave to prosecute it for the purpose of ascertaining the amount due. U. S. Rev. Sts. \u00a7 5106. <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>123 Mass. 278, and cases cited. <em>Towne </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>122 Mass. 67, 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The result is, that the defendant shows no defence at law to this action, and his exception to the ruling of the Superior Court that the plaintiff was entitled to recover must be overruled, and the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the ruling that he was entitled to nominal damages only must be sustained. As the dates and amounts of the mortgagee\u2019s receipts of rents and profits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>mortgaged estates do not appear in the bill of exceptions, the point suggested by the defendant at the argument, that those receipts, operating as payment <em>pro tanto </em>of the mortgage debts, should dimmish the damages to be recovered in this action, may be more appropriately raised and determined upon a</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
