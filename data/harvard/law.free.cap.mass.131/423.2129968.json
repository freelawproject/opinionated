J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9x\">According to the manifest intent and natural meaning of the instruction given to the jury, the qualification \u201c if the defendant had reason to believe \u201d applied to the clause \u201c which no other means could effectually prevent,\u201d as well as to the rest of the proposition laid down by the court. In legal effect, as in common understanding, the instruction was, that if the defendant had reason to believe that his assailant intended to do him great bodily harm, and that he was in danger of such harm, which, as he had reason to believe, no other means could effectually prevent, he would be justified in defending himself by shooting him. Anything less than this would clearly afford no justification. Trial of Self ridge, 160. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood</em>ward, 102 Mass. 155,161. The suggestion in argument, that the instruction excluded all other means of self-defence which might result in the death of .the assailant than shooting, is a strained interpretation, which there is nothing in the bill of exceptions to show could have been applied to the evidence before the jury. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
