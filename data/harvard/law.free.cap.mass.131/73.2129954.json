occupied the .kt bought by him in 1859; that his boundary lines were shown to him, in the afternoon of the day he took his deed, by the son of one of his grantors, but that no monuments were then put up or existed, except the streets, and that upon his westerly line, as so given, he within a few days erected a fence, and, later, an L of his house on the line of part of the fence; that the fence was not now standing, but was distant on Broadway forty <em>j6-^ </em>feet west of P Street, as now fixed, or eighteen inches west of the southwest comer of his house, which was thirty-nine feet west of the present P Street, and thence ran in the same general direction as P Street, varying in distance from that street from forty feet to forty-one <em>-\u00a1W </em>feet. This evidence, the tenant contended, fixed a monument controlling the distance given in the deed to Park; but the judge ruled otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">The tenant then offered the deeds to Enwright of the lot above referred to in the demandant\u2019s deed, and of that to the United States of the lot on Broadway, between Enwright\u2019s lot and O Street, both earlier in point of time than the deeds put in by the demandant, and from the same grantor from whom the grantors in the later deeds derived title, both as tending to fix the location of Enwright\u2019s lot as a monument, and also to show that the boundary lines on Broadway given therein, (one hundred and ninety feet ten inches in Enwright\u2019s, and two hundred and fifteen feet eight inches in the United States deed, amounting to four hundred and six feet,) added to the thirty feet, the demandant\u2019s boundary line on Broadway, in the deed put in by him, would bring the demandant\u2019s eastern boundary at this point distant seventy feet from P Street as now-located, and reduce the alleged encroachment to a triangle, having ^-\u00a1L- of a foot base on Broadway, and its apex about six feet from that street. But the judge excluded the evidence, and the tenant excepted. The tenant also contended that said deeds were competent, because, taking the boundary lines given therein on Broadway, in all four hundred and six feet, together with the lines on Broadway given in the deeds put in by the demandant, one hundred feet, the whole distance, five hundred and six feet, corresponded with the former distance between O and P Streets, and thereby tended to show the location of Enwright\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>lot as a monument from both streets, and the true position of the demandant\u2019s easterly line; but the judge excluded the evidence in this view also, and the tenant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-4\">The judge found, as a fact, that the lines of P Street had not been changed from their position as located and fixed in 1886 and 1837 by monuments, and that there was nothing to control the distances given in the deeds to Park and the tenant ; and found for the demandant.

The evidence tended to show that like facts did not exist as to the easterly line of 0 Street. The westerly line of P Street was therefore a fixed and definite boundary, controlling distances if there should be any discrepancy in a deed between monuments and distances. The easterly line of O Street was not shown to be a fixed monument. If there had been evidence that such line was a fixed, definite and known line, the question presented as to the admissibility of the deeds to the United States and to Enwright would be a different one. All that the deeds had any tendency to prove was that the lands granted to the United States and to Enwright extended a certain number of feet from a line which was not itself a fixed and definite line. The limit of those grants was as uncertain as the location of the easterly line of O Street. This rendered the contents of those deeds immaterial, so that it is unnecessary to inquire whether there is any such monument described in them as would have been competent for the tenant to refer to if the location of such monument, which was itself a tract of land, had been fixed and certain. As to the other deeds, there can be no doubt that they were competent evidence. The land conveyed to Park, that conveyed to the tenant and that to the demandant were from the same grantors. Park\u2019s deed was first in time, the tenant\u2019s second and the demandant\u2019s third. Park\u2019s deed bounded upon the east on the westerly line of P Street, which was a fixed monument, and his westerly line was parallel to that line and forty feet distant from it. The westerly line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Park\u2019s land was therefore as certain as the easterly line. The tenant\u2019s deed bounds him easterly upon Park\u2019s land, \u2014 that is, on the land to which he had title, though he occupied beyond, \u2014 which had become a certain monument; and his westerly line was parallel with it, and thirty feet distant from it. That land was also a fixed monument. The demandant\u2019s deed bounded him easterly upon that monument, to wit, the westerly line of the tenant\u2019s land; and although it describes his westerly line as upon Enwright\u2019s land, and thirty feet distant from the tenant\u2019s land, yet by its true construction it grants the land between the tenant\u2019s land and Enwright\u2019s land, wherever that land may be. Where that line is, is a question only between the demandant and Enwright; for, the demandant having established his right to all the land between the tenant\u2019s land and Enwright\u2019s, the only material question between these parties was, Where was the tenant\u2019s true westerly line ? And that line was conclusively fixed by his deed, and cannot be affected by the position of Enwright\u2019s line. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
