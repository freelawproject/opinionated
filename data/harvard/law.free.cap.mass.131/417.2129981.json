The record of the magistrate, which included the complaint and warrant, sent up on appeal from him to the Superior Court, showed that the defendant was brought before him two days after the date of the complaint. <em>Hdd, </em>that, taking the whole record together, the date of the warrant appeared to have been the same as the date of the complaint.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b439-8\">An objection to informality of a warrant is not open to the defendant after verdict in the Superior Court on appeal <em>from </em>the sentence of a magistrate who issued the warrant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-9\">Complaint, under the Sfc. of 1878, <em>c. </em>172, addressed to a trial justice, and alleging that, on August 1, 1879, at Montague, the defendants \u201cdid unlawfully and wilfully use a sweep seine in the waters of the Connecticut River, said seine having a mesh which stretches less than five inches, against the peace,\u201d etc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The defendant, being convicted before the trial justice, appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-4\">The copy of proceedings filed in that court contained: 1st. The complaint, dated and sworn to before the magistrate \u201c this sixth day of August in' the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine.\u201d 2d. A warrant, which directed the defendants to be brought in to answer to \u201cthe foregoing complaint this day made on oath before me, the subscriber,\u201d was dated \u201c this sixth day of in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy- ,\u201d and was not subscribed by the magistrate. 3d.

J., after a verdict of guilty, the defendants filed a motion in arrest of judgment, \u201cfor the reason that the magistrate before whom said action was heard did not make and transmit to the Superior Court a copy of the conviction and other proceedings in the case, and because it did not appear that the papers used on the trial of the case were true copies of the proceedings before said magistrate.\u201d The district attorney thereupon suggested a diminution of the record, and asked to be allowed to file an amended record, which request was granted, and an amended record filed, supplying the omissions in the former .copy; and the motion in arrest of judgment was overruled.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akmq\">The attestation by the magistrate at the end of the record was a sufficient attestation of all the proceedings, including the complaint and warrant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ford, 14 Gray, 399. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Barry, 115 Mass. 146. The case is thus distinguished from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Doty, 2 Met. 18, on which the defendants rely, in which there was no attestation of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Taking the whole record together, the date of the warrant appears, by comparison with the date and jurat of the previous complaint to which it refers and on which it purports to have been issued, and with the succeeding statement in the record of the time when the defendants were brought in upon the warrant, to have been August 6, 1879. <em>Donahoe </em>v. <em>Shed, </em>8 Met. 326. Neither the objection that the original warrant was without signature, nor the objection that the copy duly attested did not correspond with the original, was open after verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>123 Mass. 416. And it may be doubted whether, when the accused is before the court, any objection to the form of the warrant on which he has been brought in is open to him at any stage of the prosecution. 2 Hawk. c. 27, \u00a7 102. Stark. Crim. Pl. (2d ed.) 297. <em>Ex parte Scott, </em>4 Man. &amp; Ryl. 361; <em>S. C. </em>9 B. &amp; C. 446. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
