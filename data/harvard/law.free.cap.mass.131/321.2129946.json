Freeman during their natural lives and the life of the survivor of them; and after the decease of said Hannah Nye Freeman and Helen M. Freeman, to the use of the heirs and assigns of said Dearborn forever.\u201d No conveyance was made to Bangs, the trustee. The effect of the covenants of Dearborn was that he held the estates upon the trusts declared in the settlement; and the determination of this case depends upon the question whether the concluding words of this covenant, \u201c to the use of the heirs and assigns of said Dearborn for ever,\u201d were intended as words of limitation or of purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In construing trust estates created by marriage settlements, regard is to be had to the intention to be deduced from the whole instrument of conveyance to a greater extent than in the construction of the like limitations in legal estates. <em>Loring </em>v. Eliot, 16 Gray, 568. The whole scope of this settlement shows that the purpose of the settlor was to secure out of the fee held by him a provision for his intended wife and her two daughters by a former marriage during their lives, and that the residue of his estate should remain vested in him. The recitals in the first part of the indenture point to this as the only purpose of the settlement. They set out in substance that, in consideration of the intended marriage, the settlor has agreed that his wife shall have, if she survix-es him, in lieu of dower and for her jointure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and support, a life estate in one undivided third part of all the real estate of which he is seised and possessed, and that her daughters and the survivor of them shall have a like estate during their lives. They do not contemplate or refer to any disposition of the estate after the termination of the life estates. The indenture does not in any way affect the settlor\u2019s interest in two undivided third parts of his estate, and there is some improbability in the supposition that he intended to divest himself of the reversion in one undivided third part, thus separating it from the other two thirds and dividing the fee. The language of the clause we are considering, \u201cto the use of the heirs and assigns of said Dearborn forever,\u201d is significant in the same direction. It is not to be supposed that, in an instrument so carefully drawn, the words \u201c and assigns \u201d were used inadvertently or without meaning. They strongly indicate the understanding of the settlor that he retained an estate which he could assign.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">We are therefore of opinion, that these words were intended and are to be construed as words of limitation, and not as words of purchase, and that the one undivided third part remained in the settlor as of his old estate, unaffected by any trust. The rule in <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>case, 1 Rep. 88,104, therefore, has no application to this case; for the same reason, and for the additional reason that this indenture was made prior to the year 1836, the modification of that rule adopted by our statutes is inapplicable. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>89, \u00a7 12. <em>Loring </em>v. Eliot, <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">It appears in this case that Mrs. Hannah Dearborn and Helen M. Freeman are dead, the facts that the latter sailed for Pernambuco in the year 1840, and that neither the vessel in which she sailed nor any person on board has ever since been heard of, justifying and requiring the inference of her death; that the other life tenant, Hannah Nye Freeman, and all the parties who are entitled to the estate, as devisees under the will of said Dearborn, have executed the deed tendered to the defendants. It follows that, as this deed will convey to the defendants a good title, the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree for a specific perform-<em>Decree for the plaintiffs. </em>anee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
