But your petitioner avers that said presiding justice, without any hearing or opportunity for a hearing, and without making known any objection thereto or what there was objectionable in said bill, disallowed said bill upon the 11th day of May aforesaid, and returned it to the files of said Superior Court. Wherefore your petitioner requests leave to establish the truth of the said exceptions as filed and presented as aforesaid, as by law and the rules of this court provided.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-8\"><em>J. W. Hammond, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3v\">moved to dismiss the petition, because it did not positively state that the bill of exceptions presented was in conformity with the truth ; but alleged that the bill was either in conformity with the truth and should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>have been allowed, or was erroneous and incomplete, and a further hearing should have been had before the judge who presided at the trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-4\"><em>W.

The next succeeding averment in the petition, beginning with the words, \u201c or if erroneous in any respect or incomplete, a hearing should have been had,\u201d is superfluous and irrelevant. As this averment contains no affirmative allegation of fact, but only a hypothetical suggestion, followed by an incorrect legal inference, and as the only relief prayed for in the petition is that the truth of the exceptions filed and presented may be established, the court is of opinion that the surplusage and irrelevancy do not, under the existing statutes and rules, require the petition to be dismissed. <em>Petition referred to a commissioner.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
