At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Aldrich, </em>J., the jury returned a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to the exclusion of certain evidence, the nature of which appears in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-10\"><em>(x.

The obvious purpose of the evidence was to induce the jury to believe that the engine on the trip on Saturday could not emit sparks which would communicate fire to the plaintiff\u2019s barn.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We are of opinion that it was competent for the plaintiff to show that the engine on the return trip emitted sparks which set fire to property in the same neighborhood. Such evidence tended to show that the spark-arrester, testified to by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, was either faulty in construction or out of repair, and thus to rebut the presumption which the jury might draw from the defendant\u2019s evidence, which it tended to contradict and control. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Worcester </em>Railroad, 6 Allen, 87. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
