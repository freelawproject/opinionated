Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Bacon, J., who ruled that the action could not be maintained, and found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.

After the death of Dailey, the land and building insured were conveyed by his heirs to Lyons, by a deed absolute in form and containing no mention of his mortgage and no declaration of trust in favor of the grantors. There is nothing to control the effect of this deed. It does not appear that it was given in consequence of fraud, or under any undue influence; or without a sufficient consideration ; or with the intention not to transfer what equity of redemption the grantors had; or to create a trust in their favor in the land itself. In the absence of fraud, such a conveyance is effectual to transfer the mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>although as between mortgagor and mortgagee the transaction is suspiciously viewed in a court of equity. <em>Falis </em>v. <em>Conway Ins. Co. </em>7 Allen, 46. <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>17 Pick. 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The testimony of Lyons to the effect that, when he took the deed, he agreed orally to sell the estate in the following May or June, and account to the heirs for the proceeds after paying his mortgage, does not show an intention to charge the estate with a trust, or operate to prevent the title of the whole, both legal and equitable, from vesting in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It follows that there was a sale of the property within the terms of the policy, which avoided the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
