They had five daughters: Irene Anderson (Anderson), Darlene Stover (Stover), Sandra Melnrick (Melnrick), Ginger Hegeman (Hegeman), and Diane Marich (Marich). In 2006, the Sellmers, the grandparents of Kent Wood, entered into an oral agreement with the Woods to sell five acres of their property to the Woods for $30,000 plus surveying costs. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>August 16, 2006, the Woods commissioned a surveyor and expended $3,474.32 to complete the survey project, paying the last invoice for the project on September 1, 2010. On September 11, 2008, the Woods paid the Sellmers $15,000 by cashier\u2019s check as partial payment for the five-acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b64 On March 16,2009, Bill Sellmer wrote a letter to his tax preparer, seeking advice on how to declare the partial payment for his property on his tax return. The letter also stated that Bill Sellmer deposited the $15,000 check in September 2008. Before the Woods completed the land survey, Bill Sellmer requested that his attorney, Naomi Leisz (Leisz), prepare the needed real estate transfer documents. She prepared a Land Purchase Agreement that was never signed, likely because the survey was not completed until September 2010. On October 22, 2010, Bill Sellmer died and his property passed intestate to his wife Stella, who then died on January 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b65 On March 7, 2011, Leisz, representing Anderson and Stover as personal representatives of Stella Sellmer\u2019s estate, sent a letter to the Woods, asking for any additional documents pertaining to the sale of the five-acre property. Beginning on May 22, 2011, Anderson and Stover published a notice to creditors in the local newspaper for three consecutive weeks. Following the receipt of the letter from Leisz, the Woods discussed the matter with Kent\u2019s mother, Ginger Hegeman (Hegeman). Hegeman assured them that the property would not be transferred out of the estate until any interest they had in the property had been addressed. An email dated January 19, 2012, confirmed the Woods\u2019 account of Hegeman\u2019s representation. On April 24, 2012, the personal representatives Anderson and Stover filed a statement to close the estate and executed a deed of distribution, thus terminating their appointment as personal representatives and distributing the right, title, and interest of the ninety-six-acre property to distributees Anderson, Stover, Hegeman, Melnrick, and Marich.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b66 On January 24, 2014, the Defendants entered into a contract to sell the entire 96 acres from the estate for $299,000, inclusive of the five-acre tract, to another buyer. The Woods became aware of the sale of the property and, on March 27, 2014, filed suit against the Defendants for breach of contract, negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress, fraud, and unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 13, 2015, the District Court denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>judgment and, on July 25, 2016, entered judgment in favor of the Woods, finding that Defendants Anderson, Stover and Hegeman were wrongfully enriched and in breach of an enforceable contract. The court issued judgment against Anderson, Stover and Hegeman, jointly and severally, for compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest, and statutory costs. The Defendants filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court. Additional facts will be provided as necessary to address the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b67 The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>Johnston v. Centennial Log Homes &amp; Furnishings, Inc., </em>2013 MT 179, \u00b6 25, 370 Mont. 529, 305 P.3d 781. We review de novo a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute. <em>Dick Irvin, Inc. v. State, </em>2013 MT 272, \u00b6 18, 372 Mont. 58, 310 P.3d 524. In reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, our standard of review is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Sartori v. S &amp; S Trucking, Inc., </em>2006 MT 164, \u00b6 11, 332 Mont. 503, 139 P.3d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b68 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in concluding that the Woods had an enforceable contract to purchase real property </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u00b69 The Defendants first appeal from the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Woods had an enforceable contract to purchase the five-acre tract from the Sellmers. The court concluded that the Woods had an enforceable contract because they partially and substantially performed their part of the oral contract and were willing and able to complete the transaction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b610 Under \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-903(l)(d), 70-20-101, and 30-11-111, MCA, an agreement for the sale of real property is invalid under the statute of frauds unless the agreement, or some note or memorandum of the agreement, is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged. We have held that the note or memorandum may consist of several writings, and that it need not be in any particular form, or contain the entire contract. As long as the writing or writings include all the material terms, even if such terms are stated generally, the contract is valid. <em>Olsen v. Johnston, </em>2013 MT 25, \u00b6 20, 368 Mont. 347, 301 P.3d 791 (citing <em>Johnson v. Ogle, </em>120 Mont. 176, 181-82, 181 P.2d 789, 791 <em>(1947), Hughes v. Melby, </em>135 Mont. 415, 421, 340 P.2d 511, 515 (1958); <em>Kluver v. PPL Mont., LLC., </em>2012 MT 321, \u00b6 38, 368 Mont. 101, 293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>P.3d 817; <em>Dineen v. Sullivan, </em>123 Mont. 195, 199, 213 P.2d 241, 243 (1949)). \u201cThe material terms of a contract for the sale of real property will include the parties, the subject matter, a reasonably certain description of the property affected, the purchase price or the criteria for determining the purchase price, and some indication of mutual assent.\u201d <em>Olsen, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"Ave\">\u00b611  We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Roland v. Davis, </em>2013 MT 148, \u00b6 21, 370 Mont. 327, 302 P.3d 91. Clear error exists if substantial, credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact, if the district court misapprehended the evidence\u2019s effect, or if we have a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Roland, </em>\u00b6 21. In this case, the District Court identified several writings which established the existence of a valid, written contract between the Woods and the Sellmers. The writings here include: 1) the unsigned Land Purchase Agreement; 2) the land survey describing the property to be sold, paid for by the Woods; 3) the $15,000 check issued by Tina Wood to Bill Sellmer, who then endorsed and deposited the check; and 4) the letter from Bill Sellmer to his tax preparer referencing the $15,000 he received as partial payment for the \u201cpiece of ground\u201d he sold. Each of these writings contain one or more terms referencing the parties involved and the sale, description, and purchase price of the property. Additionally, because Bill Sellmer deposited the check, told his accountant that he had sold a portion of his property, allowed for the survey to be completed on his property, and because the survey proposal, cashier\u2019s check, and tax preparer letter were each signed by either Bill Sellmer or the Woods, there exists sufficient indicia of mutual assent in this case to find the existence of a written, enforceable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A1V\">\u00b612  Additionally, even in the absence of a written contract, we have \u201clong recognized the doctrine of part performance as an exception to the Statute of Frauds.\u201d <em>Morton v. Lanier, </em>2002 MT 214, \u00b6 20, 311 Mont. 301, 55 P.3d 380; <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 70-20-102, 30-11-111, MCA. In <em>Epletveit v. Solberg, </em>119 Mont. 45, 169 P.2d 722 (1946), we explained this Court\u2019s view of the exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">Where one party, to an oral contract has, in reliance thereon, so far performed his part of the agreement that it would be perpetrating a fraud upon him to allow the other party to repudiate the contract and to set up the statute of frauds in justification thereof, equity will regard the case as being removed from the operation of the statute and will enforce the contract by decreeing specific performance of it, or by granting other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>appropriate relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><em>Epletveit, </em>119 Mont. at 57, 169 P.2d at 729. In the present case, the District Court concluded that Woods sufficiently performed on the contract to their detriment and in reliance on the contract. Tina Wood paid the Sellmers $15,000, which Bill Sellmer acknowledged in his letter to his tax preparer as partial payment for a piece of land he had sold. The Woods also expended $3,474.32 to complete a land survey on the Sellmers\u2019 property. It is beyond real dispute that the Woods did these things to their detriment and in reliance on the contract. To hold otherwise would be to allow the Defendants to perpetrate a fraud on the Woods. Since the property was subsequently sold to a bona fide purchaser, the court properly granted the Woods other appropriate, equitable relief. As such, we conclude that the District Court properly determined that the Woods had an enforceable contract to purchase the five-acre tract and suffered compensatory damages in the amount of $18,474.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b613 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in entering a judgment against Anderson, Stover, and Hegeman, jointly and severally </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">\u00b614 The Defendants also appeal the District Court\u2019s judgment in favor of the Woods and against Defendants Anderson, Stover, and Hegeman, jointly and severally. The Defendants contend that the court erred in entering judgment against them because of the period of limitations contained in \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-803, -1011, and -1013, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b615 Montana\u2019s probate code contains limitations periods, also known as nonclaim provisions, which govern the presentation of claims against a decedent's estate, an estate\u2019s personal representatives, and any subsequent distributees. Sections 72-3-803 (limitations on creditor\u2019s claims), 72-3-1011 (limitations on actions against personal representative), 72-3-1013, MCA (limitations on actions against distributees).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b616 First, the District Court found that the Woods\u2019 claim was not time barred by \u00a7 72-3-803, MCA. We agree, but also conclude that the court\u2019s determination does not end the inquiry in this case. Section 72-3-803, MCA, requires creditors to file claims against an estate within a specified period of time or be forever barred from asserting their claim. Under \u00a7 72-3-801, MCA, a personal representative is required to give notice, either in writing or by publication, to the creditors of an estate. Unless a personal representative has already given written notice by mail or another form of delivery, the personal representative must publish a notice to creditors for three consecutive weeks \u201cin a newspaper of general circulation in the county announcing the personal representative\u2019s appointment and address and notifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>creditors of the estate to present their claims within 4 months after the date of the first publication of the notice or be forever barred.\u201d Section 72-3-801(1), MCA. Section 72-3-803, MCA, further provides that all claims arising at or after the death of a decedent, including those founded on contracts not based on a contract with a personal representative, \u201care barred against the estate, the personal representative, and the heirs and devisees of the decedent\u201d unless the claim is presented \u201cwithin the later of 4 months after it arises\u201d or \u201cwithin 1 year after the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d Section 72-3-803(l)(a), 2(a)-(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b617 In <em>Tulsa Prof'l Collection Servs., Inc. v. Pope, </em>485 U.S. 478, 108 S. Ct. 1340 (1988), the United States Supreme Court held that an unsecured creditor\u2019s claim is an intangible interest in property protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Pope, </em>485 U.S. at 485, 108 S. Ct. at 1345. As such, the Court held that notice by publication is insufficient to protect a creditor\u2019s property interest where the identity of a creditor is known or \u201creasonably ascertainable\u201d: instead, a creditor must be given \u201cnotice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice.\u201d <em>Pope, </em>485 U.S. at 491, 108 S. Ct. at 1348 (quoting <em>Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 800, 103 S. Ct. 2706, 2712 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b618 Further, in <em>Boyer v. Sparboe, </em>263 Mont. 289, 867 P.2d 1116 (1994), we held that an estate cannot use \u00a7 72-3-803, MCA, to a bar creditor\u2019s claim where the estate: 1) has actual notice of a claim; and 2) through a representation, gives assurances to the claimant that no creditor\u2019s claim action is necessary to protect the claim. <em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 294, 867 P.2d at 1119-20. In <em>Boyer, </em>a property owner contacted a deceased store owner\u2019s son about the coins and precious metals he had been storing at the family\u2019s gold and silver store. <em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 290, 867 P.2d at 1117. The son, who was not a personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate, assured Boyer that the property was safe at the store and, over the next two years, Boyer received further assurances to the same effect. <em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 290-91, 867 P.2d at 1117-18. However, when Boyer attempted to retrieve his property with a copy of the storage receipt, the store refused to return his property and Boyer filed a complaint seeking recovery of his gold and silver. <em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 291, 867 P.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b619 The district court found that Boyer\u2019s claim was barred because he failed to file a creditor\u2019s claim within the time limits contained in \u00a7 72-3-803, MCA. In reversing the district court, we found the statutory bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>inapplicable because the estate \u201chad actual knowledge of Boyer's claim\u201d and because, \u201cbased upon <em>the family\u2019s </em>representations, Boyer assumed his claim was intact and that no creditor\u2019s claim needed to be filed.\u201d <em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 294, 867 P.2d at 1119 (emphasis added). Accordingly, we held that the estate was estopped from raising the nonclaim statute to bar Boyer\u2019s claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">We wish to emphasize that the rationale behind the statutory requirement that a creditor\u2019s claim be filed is sound and should not be easily dispensed with. However, under very limited circumstances, as in this case, where an estate has actual notice of a claim and makes representations to the claimant which lead the claimant to believe that it is not necessary to protect his claim by filing a creditor's claim under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-801 et seq., MCA, the estate will not be able to use the failure to file a creditor\u2019s claim as a defense to bar the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Boyer, </em>263 Mont. at 294, 867 P.2d at 1119-20.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">\u00b620  In this case, the Defendants ask us to ignore the holdings announced in <em>Pope </em>and <em>Boyer. </em>We decline to do so. As required by <em>Pope, </em>the Woods were entitled to receive actual notice to present their claims because they were known creditors of the estate, as demonstrated by the Leisz letter asking for further verification of the contract and copying the personal representatives of the estate, Anderson and Stover. Additionally, and contrary to the Defendants\u2019 assertion, while the Leisz letter was sufficient to prove that the Defendants had knowledge of the Woods\u2019 property interest in the five-acre tract, the letter was insufficient to give actual notice to the Woods under \u00a7 72-3-801, MCA, because it did not notify them to present their claim within the statutory time period or be forever barred. Furthermore, because Hegeman, a family member of the decedent and an heir of the estate, made a representation to the Woods similar to the assurance made in <em>Boyer, </em>which led the Woods to believe that it was unnecessary for them to file a creditor\u2019s claim, our case law further precludes the estate from using the nonclaim statute as a defense to bar the claim. Thus, the District Court did not err in its conclusion that the Defendants could not use the limitation provided in \u00a7 72-3-803(2)(b), MCA, to bar the Woods\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\u00b621 However, the court\u2019s determination under \u00a7 72-3-803, MCA, does not end our inquiry here because the statutory provision only applies to <em>claims against a decedent\u2019s estate. </em>The Commissioner\u2019s Comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>accompanying the Uniform Probate Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> state that \u201ca claimant whose claim has not been barred may have alternative remedies when an estate has been distributed subject to his claim.\u201d Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 3-1005 cmt. (2010). In this case, the estate had been closed and a deed of distribution had been filed prior to the filing of the Woods\u2019 complaint. <em>See Mathey v. Mathey, </em>109 Mont. 467, 473, 98 P.2d 373, 376 (1939) (\u201cAfter distribution to the heirs or devisees, the estate ceases to exist.\u201d). Because the Woods did not petition the District Court to reopen the estate for consideration of their claims under Title 72, chapter 3, part 8, MCA, the Woods\u2019 alternative remedies in this case are provided in \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-1011 and -1013, MCA, and subject to the period of limitations contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b622 For instance, once an estate has been closed through the filing of a closing statement, a creditor may maintain a claim against a personal representative under \u00a7 72-3-1011, MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">Unless previously barred by adjudication and except as provided in the closing statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose claims have not otherwise been barred against the personal representative for breach of fiduciary duty are barred unless a proceeding to assert the same is commenced within 6 months after the filing of the closing statement. The rights thus barred do not include rights to recover from a personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation, or inadequate disclosure related to the settlement of the decedent\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Additionally, after an estate has been closed and its estate properties distributed, \u00a7 72-3-1012, MCA, states that the distributees take subject to undischarged, unbarred claims. Such claims are subject to the period of limitations provisions of \u00a7 72-3-1013, MCA, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">(1) Unless ... <em>otherwise barred, </em>the claim of any claimant to recover from a distributee who is liable to pay the claim ... is forever barred at the later of 3 years after the decedent\u2019s death or 1 year after the time of distribution thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">(2) This section does not bar an action to recover property or value received as the result of fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Section 72-3-1013, MCA (emphasis added). Thus, this provision \u201cdescribes an ultimate time limit for recovery by creditors .... of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>decedent from distributees.\u201d Unif. Probate Code \u00a7 3-1006 cmt. (2010). In sum, while we agree with the District Court\u2019s determination the Woods\u2019 claim is not \u201cotherwise barred\u201d under \u00a7 72-3-803, MCA, we must now determine if their action can proceed under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-1011 and -1013, MCA, because the estate in this case has been closed and distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b623 Montana\u2019s probate code provides an overriding fraud provision, which enables a person injured by fraud to \u201cobtain appropriate relief, including restitution against the perpetrator of the fraud or any person benefiting from the fraud, whether innocent or not, other than a bona fide purchaser for value and without notice.\u201d Section 72-1-111(1), MCA. Under this section, where a person institutes \u201can action to recover property or value received as the result of [a distributee\u2019s] fraud,\u201d the person must commence proceedings \u201cwithin 2 years after the discovery of the fraud.\u201d Sections 72-1-111(2), 72-3-1013(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b624 There are two kinds of fraud recognized in Montana: actual fraud and constructive fraud. Section 28-2-404, MCA. While we agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that the facts in this case do not support a finding of actual fraud, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings support the Woods\u2019 constructive fraud claim against the Defendants in this case. Under \u00a7 28-2-406, MCA, constructive fraud is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">(1) any breach of duty that, without an actually fraudulent intent, gains an advantage to the person in fault or anyone claiming under the person in fault by misleading another person to that person\u2019s prejudice or to the prejudice of anyone claiming under that person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">(2) any act or omission that the law especially declares to be fraudulent, without respect to actual fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\u00b625 The presence of a legal duty is an essential element of a claim for constructive fraud. <em>Mattingly v. First Bank, </em>285 Mont. 209, 218, 947 P.2d 66, 71 (1997). Whether a legal duty exists is a question of law for the court\u2019s determination. <em>H-D Irrigating, Inc. v. Kimble Props., Inc., </em>2000 MT 212, \u00b6 25, 301 Mont. 34, 8 P.3d 95. \u201cAlthough the legal duty which often exists in constructive fraud cases is a fiduciary one, this Court has previously held that Montana\u2019s constructive fraud statute \u2018does not require that the plaintiff demonstrate a fiduciary relationship, [but] merely requires the establishment of a duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>H-D Irrigating, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Mattingly, </em>285 Mont. at 219, 947 P.2d at 72). Under certain \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d constructive fraud \u201cmay exist where one party has acted to mislead the other in some way.\u201d <em>H-D Irrigating, </em>\u00b6 25. For instance, \u201cWhere a party, by his words or conduct creates a false impression concerning serious impairments or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>important matters and subsequently fails to disclose relevant factors, constructive fraud may be found.\u201d <em>Drilcon, Inc. v. Roil Energy Corp., </em>230 Mont. 166, 171, 749 P.2d 1058, 1061 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b626 The Defendants argue that the Woods filed an untimely complaint under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-1011 and -1013(1), MCA, because it was filed more than: 1) six months after the filing of the closing statement; 2) three years after Stella Sellmer\u2019s death; and 3) one year after the final deed of distribution. The District Court rejected the Woods\u2019 constructive fraud claim after finding no evidence of false statements \u201cthat induced the Woods to do anything, or refrain from doing anything, regarding the formation or performance of the contract.\u201d But the court also found the Hegeman e-mail an \u201carguabllel\u201d exception, though it \u201cmerely caused [the] Woods to delay legal advice or initiat[e] legal action for a period of time.\u201d Given this finding, we conclude that the court did not err in concluding that the Woods were not time barred from making their claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b627 As a preliminary matter, we first address the Defendants\u2019 contention that the Woods filed an untimely complaint under \u00a7 72-3-1011, MCA. First, we agree with the District Court\u2019s finding that Defendants Anderson and Stover, as personal representatives, did not engage in fraudulent conduct in this case because the record does not demonstrate that Anderson or Stover misled the Woods to their detriment. Additionally, while \u00a7 72-3-1011, MCA, provides that a personal representative cannot invoke the six-month limitations period to bar a claim if the representative has made a misrepresentation or an inadequate disclosure, the Woods\u2019 complaint did not allege such conduct. Moreover, the Woods\u2019 complaint did not allege a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of Anderson and Stover and, even if they could maintain such an action,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they were time barred by the six-month limitation period contained therein. Thus, we conclude that the Woods could not maintain an action against Anderson and Stover, in their capacity as personal representatives, under \u00a7 72-3-1011, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AFNG\">\u00b628 As noted above, the District Court found that Hegeman\u2019s representations caused the Woods to delay legal advice or legal action on their claim. While the court downplayed this effect of Hegeman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>representations,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we conclude that her misleading statements constitute a special circumstance which supports a finding of constructive fraud. Although no fiduciary relationship existed between the Woods and Hegeman, Hegeman, through her own representations, created a legal duty to disclose facts relevant to the closing of the estate and subsequent sale of the five-acre tract when she promised to protect the Woods\u2019 interest in the property. Specifically, Hegeman, Kent Wood\u2019s mother, made assurances to her son and daughter-in-law that she would personally see to it that no action would be taken to allow for the transfer of the five-acre tract until their interest in the property was first addressed. However, as the District Court found, at some point Hegeman \u201cchanged her mind\u201d and acquiesced to the estate\u2019s plan to deny the Woods\u2019 claim of interest in the contract and the property, but failed to disclose her change in position to the Woods. In failing to tell the Woods that she had instead agreed to advance her own interest in the property over that of her son and daughter-in-law, Hegeman acted in direct contravention of her earlier promise to protect the Woods\u2019 interest over her own. Even if she lacked fraudulent intent, Hegeman\u2019s action and subsequent omission constituted constructive fraud because Hegeman and the other distributees gained an advantage by misleading the Woods to their prejudice. Section 28-2-406(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b629 Because the Woods filed their complaint within two years of discovering the fraud, which began when they became of aware of the land sale contract between the Defendants and a bona fide purchaser for value, the commenced action fell within the limitations period contained in \u00a7 72-1-111(2), MCA. While the District Court did not explicitly identify the fraudulent conduct in this case, its findings and conclusion support such a finding. As such, we affirm the District Court\u2019s order insofar as it entered judgment in favor of the Woods and against Defendants Hegeman, Anderson, and Stover for actual damages. <em>Dewey v. Stringer, </em>2014 MT 136, \u00b6 16, 375 Mont. 176, 325 P.3d 1236 (stating that \u201c[w]e will not reverse a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reached that result for the wrong reason\u201d). However, we must also remand for an entry of judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>against Defendants Melnrick and Marich because, under \u00a7 72-3-1012, MCA, they have been joined in this proceeding and the statute requires them to also bear the cost of the claim. Section 72-3-1012(2), MCA (\u201cAs between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b630 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court did not err in entering judgment in favor of the Woods and against Defendants Hegeman, Anderson, and Stover. At the same time, we must remand this case for an entry of judgment against all the distributees of the estate in accordance with \u00a7 72-3-1012(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b631 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part, and remand for an entry of judgment consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"AWl\">JUSTICES SANDEFUR, BAKER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-8\"> The Woods\u2019 filed their original complaint on March 27, 2014, and an amended complaint on June 30, 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-11\"> This Court often relies on the Commissioners\u2019 Comments accompanying the Uniform Probate Code when interpreting Montana statutes based on that code. <em>See In re Estate of Lettengarver, </em>249 Mont. 92, 99, 813 P.2d 468, 473 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> We note that \u201ca personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate does not owe fiduciary duties to a person having claims against the estate until the claim has been allowed.\u201d Unif.
