Lande died in 1997, and the lands were converted to fee status in 2006. Scott Ranch petitioned the Water Court in 2016 for adjudication of existing water rights appurtenant to the lands. The court denied Scott Ranch\u2019s petition. It held that the lands were part of the Tribal Water Right established by the Crow Water Rights Compact and did not require a separate adjudication. Scott Ranch appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b62 We restate the dispositive issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>Whether the Water Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights claims.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\u00b63 Scott Ranch is a Montana limited liability company owned by three non-Indian siblings. It owns allotment lands located in Big Horn County, within water basin 43P and within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation. The lands formerly were held in trust by the United States for the benefit of Thor Lande, an allottee of the Crow Reservation\u2019s federally reserved water right and a member of the Crow Tribe. Lande died in 1997. The United States issued fee patents and converted the lands to fee status in 2006. Scott Ranch purchased the lands from an heir of Lande in 2010 and in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">\u00b64 Scott Ranch filed a petition for adjudication of existing water rights in July 2016. It asserted that all of its forty-seven claims were exempt from the claim filing requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-221 and -222, MCA, because they were \u201cfor stock or individual domestic use, based upon instream flow or groundwater sources.\u201d Scott Ranch asserted that its water rights were not available for state adjudication until 2006, when the fee patents were issued. It asked the Water Court to declare that it possessed <em>\u201cWalton\u201d </em>rights\u2014private water rights held by a non-Indian successor to allotment lands that are derived from the allottee\u2019s share of the federally reserved water right for the reservation\u2014as appurtenances to the lands. It filed the petition \u201cout of necessity\u201d on the ground that the recent issuance of fee patents created \u201ca unique set of facts\u201d that prevented Scott Ranch or its predecessors-in-interest from seeking adjudication until this time. It noted also that the Water Rights Compact between the Crow Tribe, the State of Montana, and the United States (Crow Compact) did not address or adjudicate its water rights and that neither the April 2013 Crow Current Use List nor the January 2016 Preliminary Decree of Basin 43P contained its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b65 Shortly after Scott Ranch filed its petition, the Water Master contacted Scott Ranch\u2019s counsel by telephone and recommended that counsel file the matter with the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (the Department) under the exempt claims filing procedures. Scott Ranch responded by filing a motion for a ruling on its petition for adjudication. It asked the Water Court to determine that its claimed water rights were federally reserved <em>Walton </em>rights that fell under the general adjudication of the Water Court. Scott Ranch asserted in this motion that its claims did not fall within the scope of \u00a7 85-2-222, MCA, as exempt claims because the rights were tied to Indian Trust land until 2006. In addition, Scott Ranch acknowledged that two of its claims would not be exempt under the statute. Therefore, Scott Ranch argued, the exempt claims filing procedures did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">\u00b66 The Water Court held a hearing on Scott Ranch\u2019s petition in September 2016. The United States, the Crow Tribe, and the Montana Attorney General participated in the hearing but did not intervene in the proceeding or submit briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u00b67 In November 2016, the court denied Scott Ranch\u2019s petition. It held that Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights were part of the Tribal Water Right established on behalf of the Crow Tribe and its allottees under the Crow Compact. The court reasoned that Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights were appurtenant to an allotment, that the allottee\u2019s water rights were part of the Tribal Water Right, and therefore that Scott Ranch had a right to share in the Tribal Water Right. The court concluded that Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights therefore did not require separate adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u00b68 Scott Ranch moved to alter or amend the judgment under M. R. Civ. P. 59(e), and for relief from final judgment or order under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b). It urged the court to hold that its <em>Walton </em>rights were not part of the Tribal Water Right and that they should instead be subject to the jurisdiction of the State of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\u00b69 The court denied Scott Ranch\u2019s motions in December 2016. It reasoned in part that Scott Ranch\u2019s claimed water rights did not come into existence until after the Legislature ratified the Crow Compact in 1999. The court explained that \u201cthe only water right remaining <em>after </em>the Compact was ratified was the Tribal Water Right.\u201d It stated that the tribal allottees had \u201cno independent claim to a separate water right\u201d apart from the Tribal Water Right, and therefore that the allottees could not have conveyed such a separate right to Scott Ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b610 This Court applies the same standards of review to decisions of the Water Court as it does to decisions of a district court. <em>In re Crow Water Compact, </em>2015 MT 217, \u00b6 19, 380 Mont. 168, 354 P.3d 1217. We review the Water Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law de novo to determine whether they are correct. <em>In re Crow Water Compact, </em>\u00b6 19. We review a court\u2019s conclusion as to its jurisdiction de novo. <em>Interstate Explorations, LLC v. Morgen Farm &amp; Ranch, Inc., </em>2016 MT 20, \u00b6 6, 382 Mont. 136, 364 P.3d 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the Water Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b612 Scott Ranch argues that the Water Court erred in determining that its claims were part of the Tribal Water Right and therefore not governed by state law. It asks us to reverse the court\u2019s decisions and to instruct the court to declare that its water rights are recognized under state law. Amici United States, State of Montana, and Crow Tribe urge us to reverse the Water Court on the grounds that the court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate Scott Ranch\u2019s claims and that the court erroneously held that Scott Ranch possessed an interest in the Tribal Water Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u00b613 The Montana Legislature enacted the Water Use Act of 1973 (the Act) in order to \u201cprovide for the administration, control, and regulation of water rights and establish a system of centralized records of all water rights,\u201d as mandated by the Montana Constitution. Section 85-2-101(2), MCA; 1973 Mont. Laws ch. 452, \u00a7 2; Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(4). The Act required the Department to begin the process of determining \u201cexisting\u201d water rights. 1973 Mont. Laws ch. 452, \u00a7 6. The Act defines an \u201cexisting water right\u201d as \u201ca right to the use of water that would be protected under the law as it existed prior to July 1, 1973.\u201d Section 85-2-102(12), MCA. For water rights based on appropriations after July 1,1973, the Act provides for a mandatory permitting process administered by the Department. Sections 85-2-301 to -381, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoj\">\u00b614 In 1979, the Legislature created a unified process for the general adjudication of existing water rights throughout the state. 1979 Mont. Laws ch. 697, \u00a7\u00a7 1-38; \u00a7 85-2-701(1), MCA. The Legislature expressed its intent to include existing federal \u201creserved Indian water rights\u201d as part of the general adjudication. 1979 Mont. Laws ch. 697, \u00a7 27; \u00a7 85-2-701(1), MCA. Under the terms of the Act, owners of existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>water rights were required to file claims with the Department by April 30, 1982, or abandon their claims to those rights. <em>Matter of the Adjudication of Water Rights in the Yellowstone River, </em>253 Mont. 167, 171, 832 P.2d 1210, 1212 (1992) (citing \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-221 and -226, MCA). The Legislature later extended that deadline to July 1, 1996. Section 85-2-221(3), MCA. The Act provides that the \u201c[Department and the district courts may not accept any statements of claim\u201d for existing water rights submitted after July 1, 1996. Section 85-2-221(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A1M\">\u00b615 The water rights claimed by Scott Ranch are \u201cexisting\u201d rights, as defined by \u00a7 85-2-102(12), MCA. Under federal law, the creation of an Indian reservation impliedly reserves to the tribe water rights on that reservation necessary to fulfill the purposes of the reservation, with the priority date being the date of the reservation\u2019s creation. <em>Lewis v. Hanson, </em>124 Mont. 492, 496, 227 P.2d 70, 72 (1951) (citing <em>Winters v. United States, </em>207 U.S. 564, 28 S. Ct. 207 (1908)); <em>Colville Confederated Tribes v. Walton, </em>647 F.2d 42, 46 (9th Cir. 1981). The Crow reservation was established by treaty in May 1868. <em>United States v. Powers, </em>305 U.S. 527, 528, 59 S. Ct. 344, 345 (1939). The federally reserved water rights for the Crow Tribe thus have a priority date of May 1868\u2014the date of the reservation\u2019s creation. <em>See Lewis, </em>124 Mont. at 496, 227 P.2d at 72; <em>Walton, </em>647 F.2d at 46. The Tribe\u2019s federally reserved water rights were thus \u201cexisting\u201d prior to July 1, 1973. Section 85-2-102(12), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b616 When a tribal member conveys allotment land to a non-member, the water rights appurtenant to the land transfer to the non-member. <em>Walton, </em>647 F.2d at 50; <em>Lewis, </em>124 Mont. at 496, 227 P.2d at 72 (\u201cUpon conveyance of the land by an Indian the water right passes to the grantee as an appurtenance unless a contrary intention appears.\u201d). Non-Indian successors to Indian allotment lands thus acquire <em>\u201cWalton\u201d </em>rights\u2014a \u201cright to share in reserved waters.\u201d <em>Walton, </em>647 F.2d at 50. As the non-Indian successor-in-interest to allotment lands conveyed by a tribal member, Scott Ranch possesses <em>Walton </em>water rights as appurtenances to the lands it acquired. <em>See Lewis, </em>124 Mont. at 496, 227 P.2d at 72; <em>Walton, </em>647 F.2d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b617 Scott Ranch\u2019s <em>Walton </em>rights arose out of the transfer of land from a tribal allottee, not out of the Crow Compact. Under the terms of the Crow Compact itself, a \u201cwater right held by a nonmember of the Tribe on land not held in trust by the United States for the Tribe or a Tribal member\u201d is a right \u201cRecognized Under State Law.\u201d Section 85-20-901, Art. 11.19, MCA. Scott Ranch is a \u201cnonmember\u201d of the Crow Tribe, and the lands it acquired are \u201cnot held in trust by the United States.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Section 85-20-901, Art. 11.19, MCA. Scott Ranch\u2019s claims are recognized under state law and are not part of the Tribal Water Right under the Crow Compact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Water Court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b618 As claims for existing water rights recognized under state law, Scott Ranch\u2019s claims were subject to the general statewide adjudication\u2014and the July 1,1996 filing deadline\u2014\u201cunless exempted under 85-2-222.\u201d Section 85-2-221(1), (4), MCA. Section 85-2-222, MCA, exempts pre-1973 water rights claims for \u201clivestock and individual uses as opposed to municipal domestic uses based upon instream flow or ground water sources.\u201d Section 85-2-222(1), MCA. Under recent amendments to the Act, a party claiming an exempt water right has until June 30, 2019, to file \u201ca statement of claim for each water right asserted.\u201d 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3. A party seeking adjudication of \u201cexempt\u201d claims must follow specific procedures for filing the claims with the Department. 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3. Failure to file a claim for an exempt right by the 2019 deadline \u201cdoes not result in the forfeiture\u201d of the existing right, but it \u201csubordinates the existing right to all other water rights except those exempt rights for which a claim has not been filed.\u201d 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b619 Nearly all of Scott Ranch\u2019s forty-seven claims were for \u201clivestock\u201d or \u201cindividual uses\u201d and were thus exempt from the filing requirements of \u00a7 85-2-221(1), MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-222(1), MCA. Scott Ranch asserted in its initial petition that all of its claims were exempt under \u00a7 85-2-222, MCA. Yet in its subsequent motion for ruling on its petition for adjudication, Scott Ranch clarified that two of its claims were not exempt and argued that the exempt claims filing process provided by \u00a7 85-2-222, MCA, did not apply to its claims. It asked the Water Court for a determination \u201cthat these claims are federally reserved claims that fall under the general adjudication of the Water Court, and not the exempt claim process.\u201d Scott Ranch acknowledges on appeal that it \u201cdid not believe its water rights claims fell within the scope of \u00a7 85-2-222.\u201d Scott Ranch thus did not \u201crequest a judicial determination\u201d from the Water Court of its exempt rights and therefore did not file an exempt claim. Section 85-2-222(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u00b620 The Water Court has jurisdiction over \u201cmatters relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>determination of existing water rights within the boundaries of the state.\u201d Section 3-7-224(2), MCA. It may not, however, accept any statements of claim for non-exempt, existing rights submitted after July 1, 1996. Section 85-2-221(4), MCA. Scott Ranch petitioned the Water Court to declare that its existing claims fell under the general adjudication of the court. Scott Ranch disavowed that the exempt claims process applied, and did not follow the process prescribed by \u00a7 85-2-222, MCA, for seeking judicial determination of exempt claims. Its non-exempt claims were subject to the July 1, 1996 deadline for existing water rights. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-221(1), (3), MCA. The Water Court was thus barred from hearing Scott Ranch\u2019s post-July 1, 1996 petition as it was filed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-221(4), MCA. It therefore lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Scott Ranch\u2019s claims, and it erroneously proceeded to address the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"A41\">\u00b621  Although the Water Court lacked jurisdiction over Scott Ranch\u2019s petition as filed, the Legislature has allowed owners claiming existing, exempt water rights\u2014such as Scott Ranch\u2014to file statements of claim until June 30, 2019. 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3. Insofar as Scott Ranch\u2019s exempt claims are concerned, it should follow the procedures set forth by the 2017 Legislature for submitting its claim to the Department for examination prior to the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u00b622 The circumstances surrounding Scott Ranch\u2019s water rights claims present a somewhat unusual situation. The allotment lands that it acquired had been held in trust by the United States until 2006, when they were converted to fee status. At the time of the July 1, 1996 claims filing deadline, Scott Ranch\u2019s claimed water rights had not yet been conveyed out of trust and were still part of the federally reserved Indian water right. Neither Scott Ranch nor its predecessors-in-interest could have timely filed claims for existing rights by the general adjudication deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u00b623 It is possible that other owners in circumstances similar to Scott Ranch\u2019s face this same predicament. Apart from the recently enacted provisions for filing exempt water rights claims prior to June 30,2019, no mechanism exists for a party in Scott Ranch\u2019s position that has not already filed a statement of claim to include its existing <em>Walton </em>claims in the general statewide adjudication process. <em>See </em>2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3. We emphasize that Scott Ranch and owners in similar circumstances should file their exempt claims by the June 30, 2019 deadline in order to avoid having their rights subordinated \u201cto all other water rights except those exempt rights for which a claim has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>filed.\u201d 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 338, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b624 We reverse the Water Court\u2019s order denying Scott Ranch\u2019s petition for adjudication and remand with instructions that it dismiss the petition without prejudice so that Scott Ranch may timely file an exempt claim with the Department under the revised \u00a7 85-2-222(2), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-8\"> The Water Court relied in part on our holding in <em>In re Crow Water Compact </em>for its conclusion that Scott Ranch could not, as a successor of Indian allotment lands, claim water rights separate from the Tribal Water Right. The petitioners in that case were allottees and members of the Crow Tribe. <em>In re Crow Water Compact, </em>\u00b6 10. Scott Ranch is not a member of the Crow Tribe. As such, our holding in <em>In re Crow Water Compact </em>is not on point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\"> We note Scott Ranch\u2019s indication that two of its forty-seven claims are nonexempt claims and that Scott Ranch will not be able to file these claims under the exempt claims filing process. Because these claims were still part of the federally reserved Indian water right at the time of the July 1, 1996 filing deadline, Scott Ranch and the amici represent that its predecessors could not have filed the claims before that date. This suggests a possible jurisdictional gap that is not developed in the briefing here and may warrant the Legislature\u2019s examination: the adjudication process for non-exempt <em>Walton </em>claims that were not separated from a federally reserved Indian water right until after July 1, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
