McGee was receiving public assistance in the form of SNAP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> benefits. On March 13, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services (Department) learned that Naber was living with McGee and sent McGee a notice requesting income information for Naber. McGee responded that she did not have access to the information the Department requested. The Department notified McGee that without the income information it could not verify her eligibility and her benefits would be terminated. On April 30,2014, the Department terminated McGee\u2019s benefits. McGee requested a hearing. At the hearing, the Administrative Hearing Examiner upheld the Department\u2019s termination. McGee appealed. The Board of Public Assistance upheld the Department\u2019s determination and McGee appealed to the District Court. The District Court upheld the Department\u2019s determination. McGee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">\u00b64 This Court reviews an agency and District Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conservation Dist., </em>2008 MT 377, \u00b6 18, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court err when it upheld the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services\u2019 interpretation of the relevant federal statute?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">\u00b66 SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, is a joint federal-state program to help low-income individuals and families buy food. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is the federal agency that administers SNAP, and the Department is the state agency that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>administers it in Montana. State participation is optional, but participating states must submit a plan of operation to the federal government and comply with applicable federal laws and regulations. Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2020. Montana law requires the Department to administer SNAP in conformity with federal law. Section 53-2-201(1)(f), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b67 The Food Stamp Act and SNAP regulations set forth the policies regarding benefit eligibility based on a household\u2019s size, and gross and net income. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 et seq.; 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.1 et seq. A household is required to provide income information to the Department to verify the household\u2019s income is below the SNAP benefit income limits. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(d), (f)(l)(i); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b68 McGee argues Naber is not part of the household because Naber customarily purchases and prepares meals separately from McGee. In interpreting the federal regulations, the Department determined, that because McGee and Naber live together with the biological child they have in common, they constitute a household. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m)(l). Therefore, Naber was required to provide income information, but refused to do so. Because it was unable to verify the household\u2019s income, the Department determined it was required to terminate the household\u2019s benefits. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b69 Only households with income that does not exceed a federally specified income level are eligible for SNAP benefits. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.9(a). 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m) defines what constitutes a household for purposes of determining eligibility and benefit amount. A household means \u201ca group of individuals who live together and customarily purchase food and prepare meals together for home consumption.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m)(B). In addition, the statute clarifies that \u201cparents and their children 21 years of age or younger who live together ... shall be treated as a group of individuals who customarily purchase and prepare meals together for home consumption <em>even if they do not do so.\u201d </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m)(B)(2) (emphasis added). Federal regulations further clarify who is included in a household.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">Special household requirements ... the following individuals who live with others must be considered as customarily purchasing food and preparing meals with the others, even if they do not do so, and thus must be included in the same household ... a person under 22 years of age who is living with his or her natural or adoptive parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.1(b)(1), (b)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"aq6-dedup-0\">\u00b610  The general rule is that individuals who live with others, but customarily purchase food and prepare meals separately from the others is a separate household, and that individuals who live with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>others who customarily purchase food and prepare meals together are treated as a single household. However, when two individuals live together with a minor child in common, even if they customarily purchase food and prepare meals separately, they shall be treated as a single household. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m)(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b611 The Department, the Administrative Hearing Examiner, the Board of Public Assistance, and the District Court each correctly concluded that McGee, Naber, and their biological child constitute a household. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012(m)(l)(B)(2); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.l(l)(b)(ii). The fact that they may or may not purchase food and prepare meals separately is immaterial in this case. After the Department determined Naber was a member of the household, it requested information necessary to determine eligibility from the household. The Department is required to obtain verification of eligibility. And when a member of a household refuses to cooperate by providing income information the application must be denied. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b612 An agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight, and the court should defer to that interpretation unless it is plainly inconsistent with the spirit of the rule. <em>State Pers. Div. v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., Child Support Div</em>., 2002 MT 46, \u00b6 63, 308 Mont. 365, 43 P.3d 305; <em>Clark Fork Coal. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording. <em>Clark Fork Coal., \u00b6 20; Kirchner v. Mont. Dept. Pub. Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>2005 MT 202, \u00b6 18, 328 Mont. 203, 119 P.3d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b613 Here, the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute regarding household composition and verification was not unreasonable. The Department has expertise in matters concerning the determination of eligibility for SNAP, including household composition. We defer to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbW\">\u00b614  The District Court conclusions of law were correct. Naber must be included as a member of the household and was required to provide income verification. When the household refused to provide income information the Department requested, the Department was required to terminate SNAP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b156-10\">JUSTICES SHEA, RICE, McKINNON and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\"> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
