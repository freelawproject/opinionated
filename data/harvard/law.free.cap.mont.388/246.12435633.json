(collectively Big Sky) appeal from the order of the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Chouteau County, denying their motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss and for change of venue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-10\"><em>Did the District Court err in determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case and that, under \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, venue was proper in Chouteau County </em>?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\u00b63 On July 31, 2014, Stevenson visited the Billings, Montana, location of Big Sky RV, Inc., a Montana corporation with its principal office registered in Bozeman, Gallatin County, Montana. Stevenson purchased a fifth wheel trailer for $72,595 at the Billings location, trading in her previous trailer, valued at $8,000. She also provided a down payment of $21,773 and financed the remainder of the purchase price through Ally Bank (Ally). In August 2014, Big Sky RV delivered the new trailer to Stevenson\u2019s home in Fort Benton, Chouteau County, Montana, picking up her trade-in trailer on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\u00b64 On November 4, 2015, Ally filed a Complaint for Claim and Delivery against Stevenson in the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Chouteau County, Montana, claiming that Stevenson had defaulted on her payment obligations under the loan agreement. Ally demanded payment due under the agreement or possession of the fifth wheel. On January 11,2016, Stevenson filed a revised answer to Ally\u2019s complaint and a third-party complaint against Big Sky, alleging damages for breach of contract, violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, and violations of the Montana Consumer Protection Act (MCPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-14\">\u00b65 Stevenson\u2019s third-party complaint asserted that both subject matter jurisdiction and venue were proper because Ally initiated this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>action in Chouteau County and because Big Sky RV delivered possession of the new trailer, and picked up the trade-in trailer, in Chouteau County. On February 1, 2016, Big Sky filed a motion to dismiss Stevenson\u2019s third-party complaint for failure to state a claim. On February 10, 2016, the District Court denied Big Sky\u2019s motion for failure to file the required brief. On February 29, 2016, Big Sky filed both its answer to Stevenson\u2019s third-party complaint and a separate motion and brief for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that under \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, venue was improper in Chouteau County and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the MCPA claim. On February 16,2017, the District Court denied Big Sky\u2019s motion. Big Sky filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b66 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>In re Estate of Big Spring, </em>2011 MT 109, \u00b6 20, 360 Mont. 370, 255 P.3d 121 (citation omitted). A district court must determine whether the complaint states facts that, if true, would vest the court with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted). This determination by a district court is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Big Spring, </em>\u00b6 20 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b67 The determination of whether a county represents the proper place for trial presents a question of law that involves the application of the venue statutes to pleaded facts. The Supreme Court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to change venue is plenary, and the Supreme Court determines whether the district court\u2019s ruling was legally correct. <em>Deichl v. Savage, </em>2009 MT 293, \u00b6 6, 352 Mont. 282, 216 P.3d 749 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case and that, under \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, venue was proper in Chouteau County </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b69 Big Sky appeals from the District Court\u2019s conclusion that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this matter and that venue was proper in Chouteau County. The court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case because the MCPA applies to businesses operating in the state and Big Sky RV sold a product to a resident of Chouteau County, which constitutes \u201cdoingbusiness\u201d in Montana. The court also determined that venue was proper in Chouteau County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>because the defendant resides in the county and because Big Sky delivered the trailer to Chouteau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b610 The MCPA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">A consumer who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of a method, act, or practice declared unlawful by 30-14-103 may bring an individual ... action under the rules of civil procedure <em>in the district court of the county in which the seller, lessor, or service provider resides or has its principal place of business or is doing business </em>to recover actual damages or $500, whichever is greater.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Section 30-14-133(1), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b611 Big Sky argues that the District Court erred in failing to dismiss its motion for judgment on the pleadings because \u201c[ejither as a venue limitation or subject matter jurisdiction restriction,\u201d \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, required Stevenson to bring her MCPA action where Big Sky resides, has its principal place of business, or is doing business. However, whether \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, provides a limitation on subject matter jurisdiction or venue is an important distinction. This Court has previously explained the difference between jurisdiction and venue in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">This Court has long recognized the distinction between \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cvenue.\u201d In general terms, jurisdiction is a court\u2019s authority to hear and determine a case, and goes to the \u201cpower\u201d of the court. Jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred by consent of the parties where there is no basis for jurisdiction under the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">Venue, on the other hand, refers to the place where the case is to be heard, or where the power of the court can be exercised. Venue is a personal privilege of the defendant and, thus, may be waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-10\"><em>In re Support Obligation of McGurran, </em>2002 MT 144, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 310 Mont. 268, 49 P.3d 626 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Azj\">\u00b612  In <em>McGurran, </em>we interpreted \u00a7 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA, of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, which states that a petition for judicial review of an administrative decision \u201cmust be filed in the district court for the county where the petitioner <em>resides </em>or has the petitioner\u2019s <em>principal place of business </em>or where the agency <em>maintains its principal office.\u201d </em>Section 2-4-702(2)(a), MCA (emphasis added). We interpreted the statute as venue provision, rather than one conferring jurisdiction, because it \u201csets forth the proper place where a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>administrative decision can be heard.\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 16. We also explained that \u201cI vlenue provisions are not jurisdictional.\u201d <em>McGurran, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing \u00a7 25-2-112, MCA, which provides that \u201c[t]he designation of a county in this part as a proper place of trial is not jurisdictional and does not prohibit the trial of any cause in any court of this state having jurisdiction.\u201d). Like the statute considered in <em>McGurran, </em>\u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, merely sets forth the proper place where an MCPA claim can be heard, and does not involve a district court\u2019s power to hear and dispose of a case. As such, we conclude that \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA, is a venue provision. Given that the statute does not confer jurisdiction, we further conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Dewey v. Stringer, </em>2014 MT 136, \u00b6 16, 375 Mont. 176, 325 P.3d 1236 (stating that \u201c[w]e will not reverse a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reached that result for the wrong reason.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b613 We must now determine whether venue was proper in Chouteau County. Big Sky argues that the District Court erred in denying its motion for change of venue because the single trailer delivery to Chouteau County is insufficient to confer venue under \u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA. Big Sky contends that this Court has a well-established definition of \u201cdoing business\u201d in this context, which requires a Montana corporation to engage in a \u201ccontinuity of conduct\u201d and more than \u201ctwo isolated transactions.\u201d We have held that \u201cisolated transactions, whereby a <em>foreign corporation </em>sells goods or other manufactured products on sample or specifications, the same being fabricated in <em>another state </em>and shipped into this state by such corporation for use or installation, does not constitute the doing of business in this state.\u201d <em>Gen. Fire Extinguisher Co. v. Nw. Auto Supply Co., </em>65 Mont. 371, 378, 211 P. 308, 310 (1922) (emphasis added); <em>see also Greene Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Morris, </em>144 Mont. 234, 244, 395 P.2d 252 (1964). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>However, as the District Court noted, such cases interpreted the term \u201cdoing business\u201d as applied to out-of-state corporations, not corporations registered in, and conducting business within, Montana. Thus, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Big Sky\u2019s reliance on such cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"AEU\">\u00b614  With respect to the MCPA\u2019s venue provision, this Court has not determined which acts are sufficient to constitute \u201cdoing business\u201d in a Montana county, when a transaction occurs between a Montana consumer, located in one county, and a corporation registered in, and having its principal place of business, in another Montana county. However, at least one other state has interpreted a similar venue statute and determined that \u201ca single transaction is sufficient to establish venue if it forms the basis of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>State v. Life Partners, Inc., </em>243 S.W.3d 236, 240 (Tex. App. 2007) <em>(citing Legal Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Trevino, </em>605 S.W.2d 857 (Tex. 1980)) (interpreting the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act\u2019s \u201chas done business\u201d venue clause). In this case, the transaction at issue involved the agreement of Big Sky and Stevenson that the trailer be delivered to Chouteau County. Since there is sufficient evidence to show that Big Sky entered into a sales contract with Stevenson, a Chouteau County resident, and, pursuant to the contract, delivered the purchased good to Stevenson there, we conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that venue was proper in Chouteau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b615 Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the District Court did not err in concluding that it had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter and that venue was proper in Chouteau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-5\"> Pursuant to Article VII, Section 4, Subsection 1 of the Montana Constitution, \u201cThe district court has original jurisdiction in ... all civil matters and cases at law and in equity.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 3-5-302(l)(b)-(c), MCA. Accordingly, because the MCPA\u2019s statutory provisions do not limit subject matter jurisdiction, jurisdiction is proper in the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Chouteau County. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-14-133(1), MCA (stating that a \u201cconsumer ... may bring an individual ... action under the rules of civil procedure,\u201d without limiting the general subject matter jurisdiction of Montana\u2019s district courts); <em>compare, e.g., </em>\u00a7 3-7-501(1), MCA (\u201cThe jurisdiction of each judicial district concerning the determination and interpretation of cases certified to the court under 85-2-309 or of existing water rights is exercised exclusively by it through the water division or water divisions that contain the judicial district wholly or partly.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
