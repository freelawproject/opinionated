In 2012, the State charged Sheehan with felony theft, by common scheme, for obtaining benefits by means of deception after he allegedly misrepresented the severity of his injury to medical providers. At the close of the evidence, Sheehan moved to dismiss based on insufficient evidence. The District Court denied the motion. The District Court also rejected Sheehan\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the termination of benefits under workers\u2019 compensation statutes. The jury found Sheehan guilty. On appeal, Sheehan contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him and that the District Court abused its discretion in rejecting his proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">\u00b63 Sheehan worked as a heavy equipment operator for Riverside Sand and Gravel in Billings, Montana. He injured his left shoulder on October 1, 2009, when his jacket sleeve got caught on the controls as he was exiting an excavator. Riverside\u2019s manager, Kenneth Crouse, submitted a \u201cFirst Report of Injury Form\u201d the next day to the Montana State Fund\u2014Riverside\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Sheehan returned to his home in Plains to recover from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">\u00b64 The State Fund accepted Sheehan\u2019s claim and assigned it to claims examiner Karen Horne. The State Fund began paying Sheehan temporary total disability (TTD) benefits of $1,252 on a bi-weekly basis on October 7, 2009. The State Fund also paid medical services benefits related to Sheehan\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">\u00b65 After returning to Plains, Sheehan went to see Dr. Terry Smith. Dr. Smith initially diagnosed Sheehan\u2019s injury as a sprained shoulder. After receiving MRI results, Dr. Smith added a diagnosis of a cervical sprain and a brachial plexus injury. Sheehan saw a physical therapist, Dr. Stanley Stanhope, from October 2009 to January 2010. Dr. Stanhope observed that, throughout the course of therapy, Sheehan demonstrated a limited range of motion and self-reported acute pain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>symptoms. Dr. Stanhope noted that Sheehan\u2019s pain symptoms were \u201codd,\u201d \u201cbizarre,\u201d and \u201crare,\u201d given the nature of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b66 In January 2010, Crouse conveyed his suspicions to Horne about Sheehan\u2019s inability to work and his concerns regarding Sheehan\u2019s motivation to return to work. Crouse requested that Horne investigate Sheehan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. Horne referred an \u201cactivity check\u201d to the State Fund\u2019s Special Investigation Unit. The State Fund contracted with a private investigator to monitor Sheehan and observe his activities. The private investigator observed Sheehan twice in early February 2010. The investigator did not observe Sheehan engage in any activities that were inconsistent with his reported injury. Also in early February 2010, Horne contacted Sheehan and told him that Riverside had a modified duty position available. Sheehan said that he would attempt to return to work, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b67 Around that same time, Sheehan began seeing Dr. Michael Righetti, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Righetti took a history of Sheehan\u2019s symptoms at his initial visit. Dr. Righetti noted that Sheehan\u2019s case was \u201cdifficult ... because the symptoms that he was having were confusing.\u201d Based on his evaluation of Sheehan, Dr. Righetti ascertained that Sheehan\u2019s subjective symptoms did not match the doctor\u2019s objective findings. For example, Dr. Righetti noted that Sheehan exhibited \u201cgive-away weakness,\u201d which he explained \u201cis usually a sign that somebody is trying to show that they are weak, but they may not be weak.\u201d Dr. Righetti noted further that Sheehan\u2019s injured arm showed no evidence of loss of muscle mass, which he stated would be unusual after five months of alleged non-use since \u201cmuscles atrophy considerably\u201d within a week of non-use. Additionally, Dr. Righetti observed that Sheehan displayed \u201cexaggerated expressions of pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b68 Nevertheless, Dr. Righetti believed that Sheehan could have an injury, and he referred Sheehan for a functional capacity exam. The results of that exam, coupled with the results of a nerve conduction study, led Dr. Righetti to conclude that Sheehan suffered from a mild brachial plexus lesion. Dr. Righetti admitted that he \u201cmissed the diagnosis originally.\u201d Dr. Righetti\u2019s letter to Horne following a February 24, 2010 visit with Sheehan acknowledged that his \u201coriginal impressions are likely to have been inaccurate in that this patient is probably not exaggerating his symptoms.\u201d Dr. Righetti set a treatment plan for Sheehan and followed up with him on April 5, 2010. Dr. Righetti\u2019s letter to Horne following the April 5 visit confirmed the brachial plexus diagnosis and clarified that the diagnosis \u201cexplains his symptoms and the lingering symptoms.\u201d In that same letter, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Righetti indicated that Sheehan\u2019s symptoms were not yet under control, so Dr. Righetti could not determine what Sheehan was \u201ccapable of performing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b69 Dr. Righetti examined Sheehan again on May 3, 2010, at the request of Horne, to determine whether Sheehan could return to work as an equipment operator. After seeing him, Dr. Righetti determined that Sheehan could not return to work at that time. Dr. Righetti based his opinion on Sheehan\u2019s continued complaints of pain and his \u201cexpression of an inability to do this job.\u201d Dr. Righetti notified Horne of his conclusion, and she requested an alternative job analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b610 Sheehan saw Dr. Smith again on May 13, 2010. Sheehan expressed concern to Dr. Smith that Dr. Righetti was going to release him to work. Sheehan told Dr. Smith that he had tried operating a mini excavator, but after thirty minutes he was in extreme pain and could barely move his arm. Dr. Smith noted that Sheehan\u2019s ability to use his left arm had not improved and that his pain levels were worse than when Dr. Smith initially treated him. Dr. Smith\u2019s letter to the State Fund following the visit indicated that Sheehan may \u201cnot regain much function of the left arm due to nerve damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b611 Sheehan saw Dr. Righetti the next day. Dr. Righetti concluded that Sheehan was at maximum medical improvement\u2014meaning that Sheehan\u2019s injury was not \u201cgoing to get much better with the treatment options ... available\u201d and that his \u201ccondition [had] established a certain degree of stability.\u201d Dr. Righetti determined that Sheehan had a thirteen percent upper extremity impairment and an eight percent whole body impairment due to his injury. Dr. Righetti clarified that he based the impairment rating on the objective findings from the nerve conduction study\u2014not on his physical examinations of Sheehan\u2014and on Sheehan\u2019s subjective symptoms, which Dr. Righetti explained were \u201cunsubstantiated by objective findings\u201d and led him to suspect that Sheehan\u2019s symptoms \u201cwere not valid.\u201d Dr. Righetti cleared Sheehan to work with restrictions and recommended no further treatment on his shoulder. Dr. Righetti noted in a letter to Horne regarding his May 14 visit with Sheehan that he did \u201cnot have any tapes to observe on [Sheehan] to indicate that his subjective complaints and/or activities outside of the observed medical arena are greater than one would expect for his complaints of pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b612 Less than two weeks later, the private investigator took video of Sheehan helping to construct a family friend\u2019s cabin. The videos showed Sheehan hammering, removing concrete forms, lifting and carrying multiple pieces of plywood, and operating a skid steer. While working on the cabin, Sheehan demonstrated a full range of motion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>his left shoulder. The private investigator took another video of Sheehan working at the same construction site on June 28. The video showed Sheehan starting a pull-start chain saw with his left arm, using the chain saw to cut logs above his shoulder-height, carrying a ladder with his left arm, and operating a skid steer.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b613 When Horne received the May videos, she sent them to Dr. Righetti. After reviewing the videos, Dr. Righetti sent a letter to Horne. Dr. Righetti noted that Sheehan\u2019s \u201crepresentation and reported abilities in [Dr. Righetti\u2019s] office are not consistent with his activities on the video.\u201d Dr. Righetti noted further that the video demonstrated a number of inconsistencies and misrepresentations Sheehan made regarding his activity limitations and actual capabilities. The doctor pointed out, for instance, that Sheehan stated that he could not use equipment because the movement of his arm caused him extreme pain, but the videos showed him operating a skid steer. Dr. Righetti stated that he \u201cdid not notice pain behaviors as [Sheehan] represented in [his] office\u201d and that Sheehan\u2019s \u201crange of motion appeared almost normal.\u201d Based on his review of the videos, Dr. Righetti concluded that Sheehan was \u201cmisrepresenting his condition\u201d and that \u201che would be able to return to work as an excavator operator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b614 After receiving Dr. Righetti\u2019s letter, Horne sent Sheehan a fourteen-day notice that the State Fund would be discontinuing Sheehan\u2019s TTD benefits. The State Fund closed Sheehan\u2019s claim on July 8, 2010, and he stopped receiving benefits. In total, the State Fund paid Sheehan $24,593 in TTD benefits and $22,273 in medical services benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b615 In May 2012, the State charged Sheehan with theft, by common scheme. The State alleged that from May 3, 2010, to July 8, 2010, Sheehan \u201ccollected approximately $5,991 in TTD benefits from Montana State Fund while he was misrepresenting his physical capabilities to medical providers.\u201d Dr. Smith, Dr. Stanhope, and Dr. Righetti\u2014among others\u2014testified during the four-day jury trial. Before the case went to the jury, Sheehan orally moved to dismiss based on insufficient evidence. The District Court denied his motion. The court also rejected Sheehan\u2019s proposed jury instruction on \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA (2009), which governs the termination of TTD benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Although settlement of jury instructions took place off the record, the District Court allowed Sheehan\u2019s counsel to state his objection to the rejected instruction on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b616 The jury convicted Sheehan of felony theft, by common scheme. The District Court imposed a deferred sentence of six years and ordered Sheehan to pay restitution to the State Fund in the amount of $5,991.44, plus a ten percent restitution fee. On June 2, 2015, we granted Sheehan leave to file an out-of-time appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b617 We review questions on the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case to determine whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Spottedbear, </em>2016 MT 243, \u00b6 8, 385 Mont. 68, 380 P.3d 810. We review a jury\u2019s verdict to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict, not whether the evidence could have supported a different result. <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 8. It is within the province of the jury to weigh the evidence based on the credibility of the witnesses and determine which version of events should prevail. <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"a5v-dedup-0\">\u00b618 A district court\u2019s statutory interpretation constitutes a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>State v. Shively, </em>2009 MT 252, \u00b6 13, 351 Mont. 513, 216 P.3d 732. Similarly, this court reviews for correctness the legal determinations a lower court makes when giving jury instructions, including whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. <em>State v. Lackman, </em>2017 MT 127, \u00b6 8, 336 Mont. 6, 395 P.3d 477. District courts are given broad discretion when instructing a jury; reversible error occurs only if the instructions prejudicially affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Lackman, </em>\u00b6 8. A district court\u2019s decision on jury instructions is presumed correct, and the appellant has the burden of showing error. <em>Lackman, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b619 <em>1. Whether the State presented sufficient evidence that Sheehan obtained unauthorized control over workers\u2019 compensation benefits by means of deception.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b620 Sheehan contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of theft by common scheme because he was authorized under Montana\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes to receive TTD benefits until July 8, 2010. He argues that the State could not show that he obtained unauthorized control over the TTD benefits because the State Fund was statutorily required to go through certain procedures before terminating his benefits\u2014procedures the State Fund had not complied with by May 3, the first date he was charged with receiving unauthorized benefits. Sheehan observes that it is undisputed that he was entitled to receive TTD benefits prior to May 3. In order to be eligible for TTD benefits in the first place, Sheehan points out, he had to meet the requirements of \u00a7 39-71-701, MCA. Once he qualified for TTD benefits, Sheehan contends, he was authorized to receive those benefits until the State Fund complied with the statutory requirements for terminating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b621 The Workers Compensation Act requires the State Fund to give an injured worker fourteen days\u2019 notice before terminating the worker\u2019s TTD benefits. Section 39-71-609(1), MCA. Sheehan posits that \u00a7 39-71-609(2), MCA, placed additional restrictions on terminating his benefits because Dr. Righetti determined, based on objective medical findings, that Sheehan had suffered permanent partial impairment from his injury. Therefore, Sheehan contends, his \u201cTTD payments lasted until July 8, 2010, not because of [his] alleged misrepresentations, but because by law the State Fund could not terminate his benefits until it fully complied with [statutory criteria], and provided a 14-day notice of benefit termination pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-71-609(1), (2).\u201d Sheehan asserts that his receipt of TTD benefits was authorized up until the point the State Fund completed these statutory prerequisites. Accordingly, Sheehan argues that he could not be guilty of theft under \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, because the State could not demonstrate that he obtained unauthorized control over the TTD benefits he received from May 3 through July 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b622 The theft statute provision under which Sheehan was charged provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts ... unauthorized control over any part of any benefits provided under Title 39, chapter 71, by means of... deception or other fraudulent action.\u201d Section 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. We construe \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\u201caccording to the plain meaning of its language.\u201d <em>Lackman, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation and internal quotations omitted). In so doing, \u201c[w]e must attempt to give effect to the purpose of the statute and avoid an absurd result.\u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>2014 MT 135, \u00b6 17, 375 Mont. 164, 334 P.3d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b623 Sheehan stresses that \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, includes the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act within its terms\u2014thereby incorporating the Act\u2019s processes of administering and terminating benefits. Contrary to Sheehan\u2019s arguments, however, the statute\u2019s reference to Title 39, chapter 71, does not mean that administrative requirements of the workers\u2019 compensation system are included in the elements of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. Rather, subsection 5 establishes a separate offense of theft based on the defendant\u2019s wrongful receipt\u2014or helping another to receive\u2014\u201cbenefits provided under Title 39, chapter 71.\u201d Section 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. In other words, the statute\u2019s reference to Title 39, chapter 71, simply specifies that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are the subject of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b624 The plain language of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, requires the State to prove the following elements: that the defendant \u201cobtain[ed] or exert[ed] ... unauthorized control over any part of any\u201d workers\u2019 compensation benefits; that the defendant did so \u201cby means of ... deception or other fraudulent action\u201d; and that the defendant acted \u201cpurposely or knowingly.\u201d Section 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. The State Fund\u2019s compliance with statutory requirements for terminating TTD benefits, such as providing the claimant with fourteen days\u2019 notice, has no bearing on whether a defendant obtained \u201cunauthorized control\u201d of those benefits by deception or fraudulent action. Section 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. The purpose of \u00a7 45-6-301(5), MCA, is to deter people from obtaining workers\u2019 compensation benefits through false statements, deception, or fraud. If a person purposely or knowingly engages in such conduct, he has committed theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b625 To conclude that a defendant cannot exert unauthorized control over workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, until the State Fund has completed the statutory process for terminating those benefits would not give effect to the statute\u2019s purpose, and it would lead to an absurd result. As Sheehan emphasizes, once the State Fund has awarded TTD benefits, it generally cannot terminate those benefits or convert them to permanent partial disability benefits until it provides fourteen days\u2019 notice and fully complies with certain criteria. Section 39-71-609, MCA. Those criteria require physicians to make the following determinations: \u201cthat the claimant has reached medical stability\u201d; \u201cthe claimant\u2019s physical restrictions resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the industrial injury\u201d; and \u201cthat the claimant can return to work, with or without restrictions, on the job on which the claimant was injured or on another job for which the claimant is suited by age, education, work experience, and physical condition.\u201d Section 39-71-609(2), MCA. Making those determinations necessarily requires the claimant to be forthcoming with her physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b626 Under Sheehan\u2019s interpretation, a claimant who misrepresents the nature of his injury to a physician could not be prosecuted under \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, as long as the claimant was \u201cauthorized\u201d to receive benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. The claimant would be \u201cauthorized\u201d to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits until the State Fund met the statutory criteria for terminating or converting benefits, based in part on a physician\u2019s findings. Sheehan\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, would foreclose prosecution of a person who obtains workers\u2019 compensation benefits by means of deception or fraud as long as the State Fund had not yet completed the required termination process, even when the claimant\u2014by deceiving his physician\u2014prevented the State Fund from knowing that it should terminate his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b627 Sheehan\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, is illogical because once the State Fund complies with the statutory criteria for terminating TTD benefits, the claimant no longer receives those benefits. If a claimant is not receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the claimant cannot be guilty of \u201cobtain[ing] or exertfing] unauthorized control over any part of any benefits provided under Title 39, chapter 71.\u201d Section 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. Sheehan\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, would effectively nullify the statute because a claimant always would be \u201cauthorized\u201d to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits up until the point she no longer received workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b628 Processes established in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act are not incorporated into the elements of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. But the State did have to prove each element of the theft offense by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The elements of \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA, \u201care factual in nature and their existence must be determined by the jury.\u201d <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A70\">\u00b629 Sheehan presented evidence that he did not obtain the TTD benefits by means of deception or fraud from May 3 to July 8. He stressed that Dr. Smith and Dr. Righetti diagnosed him with a brachial plexus injury and that both doctors acknowledged that his injury could explain his symptoms. Our inquiry on appeal, however, is \u201cnot whether the evidence could have supported a different result,\u201d but whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>\u201csufficient evidence exists to support the verdict.\u201d <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 8. Dr. Stanhope and Dr. Righetti both testified as to their doubts regarding Sheehan\u2019s self-reported pain symptoms. Dr. Smith acknowledged that Sheehan\u2019s representations to him did not match the activities in which Sheehan was engaged in the videos. Those videos, played to the jury, showed Sheehan seemingly using his arm pain-free to build a friend\u2019s cabin a few weeks after representing both to Dr. Smith and to Dr. Righetti that his pain was too great to allow his return to work as an equipment operator. The jury weighed the conflicting evidence and determined that Sheehan had obtained the TTD benefits by means of deception or fraud. \u201cSuch a determination is exclusively within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Spottedbear, </em>\u00b6 32 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\">\u00b630  We conclude, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Sheehan obtained the TTD benefits by means of deception or fraud from May 3 to July 8. Accordingly, the State presented sufficient evidence to convict Sheehan under \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b631 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in rejecting Sheehan\u2019s proposed jury instruction on the termination of workers\u2019 compensation benefits under \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">\u00b632 Sheehan again argues that he could not have obtained \u201cunauthorized control\u201d of the TTD benefits until the State Fund complied with \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA. As such, he contends that the District Court\u2019s rejection of his jury instruction regarding the termination of workers compensation benefits under \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA, \u201ccaused the jury not to be instructed on the law governing termination of workers\u2019 compensation benefits as it relates to the elements of felony theft.\u201d Moreover, Sheehan asserts, without an instruction on \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA, \u201cthe jury could not ascertain whether Mr. Sheehan had obtained or exerted unauthorized control of his TTD benefits, in violation of Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-6-301(5).\u201d Accordingly, Sheehan argues, the court\u2019s rejection of his instruction prejudicially affected his right to a fair trial and the District Court therefore abused its discretion in rejecting his proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b633 As demonstrated above, whether the State Fund complied with statutory procedures for terminating Sheehan\u2019s TTD benefits has no bearing on whether Sheehan obtained unauthorized control over those benefits by means of deception or fraud under \u00a7 45-6-301(5)(b), MCA. The District Court correctly concluded as much in rejecting Sheehan\u2019s proposed instruction regarding \u00a7 39-71-609, MCA. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>instructed the jury that in order to convict Sheehan, the State had to prove the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">1.

I write separately only to address Sheehan\u2019s attempt to conflate the circumstances that gave rise to his prosecution for felony theft with the process by which injured workers legitimately receive TTD benefits, and the legitimate process by which those benefits may be terminated or converted. In my view, our rejection of Sheehan\u2019s argument reflects nothing more than a rejection of that conflation. It thus bears reemphasizing that Sheehan\u2019s criminal liability had nothing to do with the mandatory statutory process by which his TTD benefits were terminated. Rather, as the Court correctly emphasizes, it had to do with the manner by which a rational trier of fact could have found Sheehan obtained those benefits during the period charged\u2014that being, by means of deception or fraud. Absent evidence that Sheehan purposely or knowingly obtained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>benefits by means of deception or fraud, there would have been no basis for a criminal charge. Opinion, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b637 As the Court correctly notes, when an injured worker is awarded TTD benefits, certain criteria must be met before those benefits may be terminated or converted. Opinion, \u00b6 25. These statutory criteria are intended to ensure that a worker\u2019s TTD benefits are not terminated or converted without adequate investigation into the worker\u2019s physical and vocational limitations and his ability to return to work. They are not, as Sheehan\u2019s defense would suggest, a grant of immunity from criminal liability. As the Court correctly notes, if we were to accept Sheehan\u2019s interpretation of the statute, it would lead to an absurd result. Opinion, \u00b6 25. I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
