Before the close of trial, the State dropped the assault charge. Daniels, who represented himself at trial, proposed a jury instruction on lesser-included offenses of aggravated burglary. The District Court rejected his proposed instruction. A Hill County jury convicted Daniels of aggravated burglary and criminal mischief. Daniels argues on appeal that the court abused its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of assault.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"abu-dedup-0\">\u00b62 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">\u00b63 In the early morning of November 1,2013, Mark Loney called 9-1-1 and reported that Daniels had kicked in the door to Loney\u2019s apartment and assaulted him. Police officers responded to the scene and observed that Loney\u2019s thin, wooden apartment door \u201chad been broken in\u201d and that the handle was still locked. They observed that Loney was bleeding from a cut on his forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">\u00b64 Daniels\u2019s son and the son\u2019s mother, Rachelle, had stayed at Loney\u2019s apartment the night before, on Halloween. Daniels had expected his son to return to his home after trick-or-treating. When his son did not return, Daniels arrived at Loney\u2019s apartment around 2:30 a.m. and took his son home with him. Daniels returned to Loney\u2019s apartment at around 5:00 a.m. According to Loney, Daniels kicked in the door, approached Loney, who was asleep on the couch in the living room, and began punching Loney in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">\u00b65 The State charged Daniels with felony aggravated burglary under \u00a7 45-6-204(2), MCA, misdemeanor assault under \u00a7 45-5-201(1)(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>MCA, and misdemeanor criminal mischief under \u00a7 45-6-101(1)(a), MCA. Daniels pleaded not guilty to the charges. He chose to represent himself at trial after his counsel withdrew. The District Court appointed standby counsel for Daniels.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b66 At trial, Daniels disputed Loney\u2019s account that he had kicked down the door to Loney\u2019s apartment and assaulted Loney on the couch. Daniels instead asserted that when he returned to Loney\u2019s apartment at around 5:00 a.m., he knocked on the door, Loney came out of the apartment, and the two began arguing. Daniels testified that Rachelle locked the door behind the two men out of fear. Daniels said that Loney pushed him in the chest, that he pushed Loney back, and that Loney then \u201cstarted swinging\u201d at Daniels. Daniels testified that he then put Loney in a headlock, and that during the scuffle the two men unintentionally fell through the front door. Daniels testified that he punched Loney twice and then left.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b67 During the settling of jury instructions, the court expressed concerns about submitting to the jury both the aggravated burglary and misdemeanor assault charges, questioning whether to do so would violate double jeopardy principles. To avoid raising such an issue, the State offered to dismiss the misdemeanor assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b68 Daniels proposed a jury instruction that included misdemeanor assault and misdemeanor criminal mischief as lesser-included offenses of aggravated burglary. The court refused to give Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction on the grounds that it misstated the law and that the State had agreed to drop the misdemeanor assault charge. The verdict form included only the offenses of aggravated burglary and criminal mischief. The jury found Daniels guilty of both. The court sentenced him to fifteen years in prison with ten years suspended for the aggravated burglary conviction and to six months in jail with credit for time served for the criminal mischief conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s refusal to give a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Jay, </em>2013 MT 79, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 332, 298 P.3d 396. We review claims of instructional error in a criminal case to determine whether the jury instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Shegrud, </em>2014 MT 63, \u00b6 7, 374 Mont. 192, 320 P.3d 455. Because a trial court has broad discretion when instructing a jury, reversible error will occur only if the jury instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 7. A defendant is prejudiced by the failure to give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>requested lesser-included offense instruction when the evidence could warrant a jury finding the defendant guilty of a misdemeanor offense instead of a felony. <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b610 Daniels argues that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. He asserts that assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary in this case and that the evidence at trial could have supported a conviction of assault instead of aggravated burglary. To the extent that his proposed instruction was incorrectly worded, Daniels argues that the court should have granted him leniency as a pro se defendant and redrafted the instruction to correct the mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b611 The State argues that Daniels failed to preserve for appeal his argument that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his proposed instruction because he failed to timely inform the court or the prosecutor that he intended to rely on obtaining a possible conviction of assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. It asserts further that the court was not required to construct Daniels\u2019s legal arguments for him, even though he was representing himself. Finally, the State contends that the District Court correctly rejected Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction because it was inconsistent with Daniels\u2019s claim of self-defense and because the charge of assault was unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">\u00b612 In determining whether a district court was obligated to give a proposed lesser-included offense instruction at trial, we apply the two-step approach articulated in <em>State v. Castle, </em>285 Mont. 363, 368, 948 P.2d 688, 690-91 (1997). <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 39. First, we determine whether, \u201cas a matter of law, the offense for which the instruction is requested is a lesser-included offense of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 39. Second, \u201cwe determine if the lesser-included instruction is supported by the evidence of the case.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 39. If both criteria are met, then the District Court must give the proposed instruction. <em>See Jay, </em>\u00b6 42; \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA. \u201cA lesser-included offense instruction is not supported by the evidence when the defendant\u2019s evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 42 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">\u00b613 The aggravated burglary statute under which Daniels was charged and convicted states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">(2) A person commits the offense of aggravated burglary if the person knowingly enters or remains unlawfully in an occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>structure and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA3n\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"52\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOUAAAA0AQAAAABd0MIxAAAAVklEQVR4nGP8z4Ab/GTCI8nAMCo7KjsqOwhk/zZAeU9gwhOg9P//////sP8PAQeh9H/2////////gwiTWRygPCWYcAeSyf9gBn6HMe5DTGYcLVWGuCwAbnQ/xPnFsjQAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"228\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">(ii) the person knowingly or purposely commits any other offense within that structure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">(b) in effecting entry or in the course of committing the offense or in immediate flight after effecting entry or committing the offense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA1-\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"26\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAM0AAAAaAQAAAAA8/OVTAAAAUElEQVR4nGP8z4AD/GTCJcPAMCpFc6kJUPbfBijjE4T6//8/+38I+GEPZTz4/////x8EDOyAslkcoAxBuIH3oeb8g9L/f///////D8ZBnzYAZRk5tpzdAssAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"204\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">(ii) the person purposely, knowingly, or negligently inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury upon anyone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Section 45-6-204(2), MCA. The misdemeanor assault statute under which the State originally charged Daniels defines assault as \u201cpurposely or knowingly [causing] bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-201(1)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\u00b614 A lesser-included offense is defined in part as an offense that \u201cis established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d Section 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA. The term \u201cfacts\u201d in this statute \u201crefers to the statutory elements of the charged offense and not to the individual facts of the cas <em>e.\u201d Jay, </em>\u00b6 40. As charged, aggravated burglary required proof that Daniels \u201cknowingly or purposely commiflted] any other offense within\u201d the structure that he entered unlawfully. Section 45-6-204(2)(a)(ii), MCA. The State\u2019s theory as charged and presented at trial was that Daniels\u2019s assault against Loney constituted the \u201cother offense\u201d required for aggravated burglary. The State did not argue at trial, and does not argue on appeal, that assault was not a lesser-included offense of Daniels\u2019s aggravated burglary charge. Because the assault was charged as the secondary offense for aggravated burglary, we conclude that misdemeanor assault is, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d a lesser-included offense of Daniels\u2019s aggravated burglary charge. <em>See Jay, </em>\u00b6 <em>39; State v. Tellegen, </em>2013 MT 337, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, 372 Mont. 454, 314 P.3d 902 (discussing theft as incorporated in the charged burglary offense).</p>\n<p id=\"Auh\">\u00b615  The evidence presented at trial supported an instruction on assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. Daniels\u2019s theory of the case was that: (a) he was not the aggressor in the fight but hit Loney in self-defense; and (b) he did not knowingly enter or remain in Loney\u2019s apartment because he and Loney inadvertently fell through the door. Daniels testified that when he returned to Loney\u2019s apartment for the second time at 5:00 a.m., he knocked on the door, Loney came outside, the two men got into a physical fight that Loney provoked by \u201cswinging\u201d at Daniels, and then the two fell through Loney\u2019s apartment door. Daniels told the jury that he had his back to the door and Loney \u201cpushed me and we both came tumbling through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the door.\u201d In closing argument, Daniels first addressed the predicate assault offense and the elements of justifiable use of force. Daniels argued that \u201cthere is no proof at all that that door got kicked in, because I told you what happened. We fought out there, and we went through the door. And I\u2019m in my rights to protect myself.\u201d He then turned to the elements of aggravated burglary and argued that he did not knowingly enter Loney\u2019s apartment. Daniels told the jury, \u201cNow, the first element is that, did someone go in there into a structure. That\u2019s not proven.\u201d The evidence could have supported Daniels\u2019s argument that he did not knowingly enter or remain in Loney\u2019s apartment even if Loney was not the aggressor in their fight. Daniels therefore was entitled to the lesser-included assault instruction. <em>See Jay, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b616 Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction on assault would have given the jury an alternative to convicting him of aggravated burglary if it did not believe that Daniels justifiably used force against Loney but if it did believe that he inadvertently fell through Loney\u2019s apartment door. His claim of self-defense did not bar him from proposing this instruction on assault, and he did not adopt an \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach, as the State and the Dissents contend. Instead, he offered alternative theories as to why the jury should acquit him of aggravated burglary\u2014that he did not knowingly enter Loney\u2019s apartment and that he fought with Loney in self-defense. The evidence could have supported the jury in finding that Daniels knocked on Loney\u2019s apartment door, that Loney exited the apartment, and that the two fell through the apartment door while they were fighting\u2014i.e., that Daniels did not \u201cknowingly\u201d enter or remain unlawfully in Loney\u2019s apartment. Section 45-6-204(2), MCA. At the same time, the jury also could have chosen not to believe Daniels\u2019s testimony that Loney instigated the fight by \u201cswinging\u201d at him, and could have concluded instead that Daniels \u201cpurposely or knowingly causeldl bodily injury\u201d to Loney. Section 45-5-201(1)(a), MCA. The evidence thus warranted the jury \u201cin finding the defendant guilty of [the] lesser-included offense\u201d of assault. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 42 (citation and internal quotations omitted). In that case, the evidence would not have \u201crequire[d] an acquittal.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 42 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">\u00b617  District courts should \u201cgrant wider latitude to <em>pro se </em>litigants\u201d as long as that latitude does not prejudice the other party. <em>State v. Ferre, </em>2014 MT 96, \u00b6 16, 374 Mont. 428, 322 P.3d 1047. In fulfilling his or her duty to \u201cuphold and apply the law,\u201d a judge is allowed to \u201cmake reasonable accommodations to ensure self-represented litigants the opportunity to have their matters fairly heard,\u201d including, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>limited to, \u201cliberally construing\u201d the litigant\u2019s pleadings. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.2. cmt. 5. Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction on assault as a lesser-included offense and his statements made during closing argument were imperfectly articulated. The District Court found fault with Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction because it included both criminal mischief and assault. Daniels does not argue on appeal that both offenses should have been included. But neither the District Court nor the prosecutor suggested that assault was not a lesser-included offense of the charged felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u00b618 We held in <em>Tellegen </em>that where the State charged theft as a predicate offense to burglary under \u00a7 45-6-204(1)(b), MCA, and the jury convicted the defendant of both theft and burglary, the theft conviction should have been vacated under \u00a7 46-11-410(2)(a), MCA. <em>Tellegen, </em>\u00b6 25. As we noted in a later case, \u201c[t]he same statute specifically provides that, j wlhen the same transaction may establish the commission of more than one offense, a person charged with the conduct may be prosecuted for each offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Zink, </em>2014 MT 48, \u00b6 12, 374 Mont. 102, 319 P.3d 596 (quoting \u00a7 46-11-410(1), MCA). Under \u00a7 46-11-404(3), MCA, \u201c[t]he prosecution is not required to elect between the different offenses set forth in the charging document, and the defendant may be convicted of any number of the offenses charged except as provided in 46-11-410.\u201d <em>Zink, </em>\u00b6 12. Thus, the proper course in this case would have been to send the case to the jury as charged, allow the jury to determine whether to convict Daniels of aggravated burglary or assault, and, if the jury checked both of those boxes on the verdict form, to dismiss the assault charge prior to imposing sentence. <em>See Zink, </em>\u00b6 13 (noting that \u201ca defendant may be charged in the alternative, so long as he is convicted of only one offense.\u201d). When the District Court identified the concern at the end of trial while settling instructions, neither the District Court nor the prosecutor recognized or discussed this course of action. Although Daniels did not object to the State\u2019s dismissing the assault charge, he did advocate for an instruction under which the jury would have been told to convict him of either the greater or the lesser offense but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\u00b619 We are not persuaded by the State\u2019s and Justice McKinnon\u2019s contention that Daniels failed to preserve this issue for appeal. Of course, a party \u201cmay not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 39, 320 Mont. 211, 89 P.3d 947. Yet Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction shows that he requested the court to give the jury the option of convicting him of misdemeanor assault rather than aggravated burglary, regardless of the fact that the State had dropped the assault charge against him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Daniels expressly reiterated to the trial court that he was offering the lesser-included offense instruction even though the State had dismissed the assault charge. And his statements during closing argument reflect this theory ofhis case. Under these circumstances, we decline\u2014as Justice McKinnon would do\u2014to fault Daniels exclusively for failing to see that the instructions and the verdict form laid out the correct path. Dissent, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\">\u00b620  Other than including criminal mischief as an underlying offense, Daniels\u2019s proposed instruction mirrored the pattern instruction on lesser-included offenses. M. Crim. Jury Instr. 1-111 (2009). \u201cSelf-represented litigants are still required to comply with the same substantive law and procedural requirements as represented litigants.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.2 cmt. 5. The record shows that Daniels, a pro se defendant, expressly proposed an instruction on assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary and did not withdraw it when asked. That his proposed instruction was imperfectly worded does not mean Daniels was not entitled to a proper instruction. He has not raised new arguments or changed his legal theory on appeal. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 39. Daniels therefore is not barred from appealing the denial of his proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"AYb\">\u00b621  The District Court showed patience with Daniels during the trial and advised him of the procedures he must follow in presenting his case. The court rightly made \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d by offering to modify two of Daniels\u2019s other proposed instructions regarding justifiable use of force. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.2 cmt. 5. Daniels complied with procedural requirements by offering a proposed instruction and not withdrawing it. He complied with substantive law because he was entitled to his proposed instruction if the evidence supported it. <em>See Jay, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39, 42. The evidence at trial did support his proposal for the lesser-included offense instruction. The District Court therefore abused its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on assault or to give the jury the alternative to convict Daniels of that lesser-included offense. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b622 The verdict form did not give the jury the option of convicting Daniels of misdemeanor assault. The difference between a conviction of aggravated burglary\u2014a felony that carries a maximum sentence of forty years in prison, \u00a7 45-6-204(3), MCA\u2014and a conviction of misdemeanor assault\u2014which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail, \u00a7 45-5-201(2), MCA\u2014is stark. Daniels\u2019s imperfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>presentation of his case caused the State only minimal prejudice, because Daniels raised the theory at trial and offered an instruction on it. \u201cWhere, as here, a jury could be warranted in finding a defendant guilty of a lesser included offense, the district court is <em>required </em>to give a lesser included offense instruction if requested by [one of] the parties.\u201d <em>Shegrud, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA) (emphasis added). Any prejudice to the State under the circumstances of this case is subordinate to Daniels\u2019s fundamental rights and the requirement that he receive an instruction to which the law entitles him.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b623 The District Court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-16\"> Daniels does not appeal his criminal mischief conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b121-7\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A0e\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b624 As the State argues and the Court acknowledges, Daniels did not offer an instruction clearly proposing misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated burglary. More importantly, he offered no argument or explanation during settlement of instructions that would clarify what he was requesting. Consequently, the Court grounds reversible error on its own assessment of what Daniels was trying to accomplish. The problem is, of course, that the District Court obviously did not, and could not, have understood what Daniels now claims he wanted. Daniels insisted on representing himself at trial, and while stand-by counsel was standing by, he offered his own instructions and arguments. He should be held to them, like every other litigant. Instead, the Court allows Daniels\u2019 new appellate counsel to re-argue the settlement of instructions\u2014the arguments that should have been made at trial\u2014and accepts them. The Court\u2019s granting of \u201cwide latitude,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17, to Daniels, and the reversal of the conviction thereon, clearly prejudices the State. The Court\u2019s repeated assertions that Daniels \u201cexpressly\u201d proposed and \u201cexpressly\u201d reiterated that he was offering a lesser-included instruction for assault are simply not founded in the record. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b625 It is not error for a district court to deny a proposed instruction that is inconsistent with the theory of the defense. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 356, 77 P.3d 239 (finding it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny an accountability instruction where such an instruction \u201cwas inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of complete innocence\u201d); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>2014 MT 142, \u00b6 22, 375 Mont. 234, 335 P.3d 1218 (\u201cBecause Taylor\u2019s theory, if believed, would require an acquittal, a lesser included instruction for sexual assault was arguably not appropriate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00b626 The Court strains to find that Daniels offered \u201calternative theories\u201d to justify the need for an assault instruction, but the record indicates otherwise. Opinion, \u00b6 16. Daniel\u2019s entire defense was self-defense. Daniels testified that Loney stepped out on the porch and started a fight by pushing Daniels in the chest. He added in closing argument that \u201cit was not lawful for [Loney] to put his hands on me in the first place, to push me at all. He had no right to do that.\u201d Daniels argued to the jury that \u201cI\u2019m in my rights to protect myself.\u201d Daniels theorized that Loney had a romantic relationship with Rachelle and was merely using this incident \u201cas a way to try to get rid of me.\u201d At no point did Daniels offer an alternative theory that, at most, he had committed a simple assault upon Loney. Indeed, he argued just the opposite\u2014that under the statutory definition of assault, he had not assaulted Loney. Daniels placed the entirety of his defense on justifiable use of force, which, if believed, would have required an acquittal. This was not a case of \u201calternative theories.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16. Further, if Daniels\u2019 self-defense theory had been believed, the Court\u2019s alternative theory regarding aggravated burglary\u2014\u201cthat he did not knowingly enter Loney\u2019s apartment,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 16\u2014would have necessarily required acquittal because his falling through the door occurred while acting in self-defense, not by his intention, which Daniels explicitly argued to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b627 Under these circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to not offer a lesser-included instruction on assault. Daniels has not demonstrated that such omission prejudicially affected his substantive rights. <em>State v. Spotted Eagle, </em>2010 MT 222, \u00b6 6, 358 Mont. 22, 243 P.3d 402. The jury decided the case based upon the defense that Daniels presented, to which he now should be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b628 I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b122-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AJJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u00b629 I dissent on the basis that (1) the alleged error in failing to give a lesser included assault instruction was not preserved, and (2) a lesser included assault instruction was inconsistent with Daniels\u2019 claim of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b630 (1) <em>The alleged error in failing to give a lesser included assault instruction was not preserved.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b631 This proceeding aptly demonstrates the difficulties trial courts have managing a criminal trial when the defendant chooses to represent himself. The District Court made every effort to afford Daniels wide latitude and flexibility in presenting his case; offered Daniels every opportunity to explain his position and arguments; and construed Daniels\u2019 pleadings and arguments liberally, as courts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>required to do for self-represented litigants. However, Daniels effectively has obtained a reversal based upon a proposed jury instruction, which was legally incorrect because it included criminal mischief as a lesser included offense of aggravated burglary, without offering any objection or explanation to the District Court that the instruction should be reframed to include only assault. Assuming error by the trial court through failure to extract assault from the unartfully drafted instruction or in simply overlooking assault as a lesser included offense, Daniels nonetheless remained silent during the entire settling of instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Daniels offered no objection, explanation, or argument regarding his theory and evidentiary basis for assault as a lesser included offense and gave the District Court no opportunity to correct its alleged error or oversight. Additionally, Daniels offered no objection or explanation, on the basis of his lesser included offense theory, to the State\u2019s dismissal of the assault charge; nor did he object or explain why the verdict form, containing only the offense of aggravated burglary, was wrong because it did not include a lesser included offense. I have difficulty finding, on this record, that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to anticipate Daniels\u2019 defense strategy and fashioning a jury instruction in support of that strategy. <em>State v. Feltz, </em>2010 MT 48, \u00b6 14, 355 Mont. 308, 227 P.3d 1035. The suggested evidentiary support by this Court for a lesser included offense of assault could not have been gleaned by the trial court absent explanation from Daniels. Daniels testified that Loney started the fight and that Daniels acted in self-defense, thus the evidentiary connections and support for a lesser included instruction were far from clear or apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b632 Our precedent, nearly four decades worth, is well-established on the necessity to instruct a jury of a lesser included offense when the evidence or theory of the defendant supports the lesser offense and \u201c[u]pon request of the defendant at the settling of instructions ....\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Section 46-16-607(3), MCA. In fact, the Court has already held that misdemeanor assault is, \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d a lesser included offense of aggravated burglary. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 39. This appeal, in part, concerns the extent to which the Court, at the expense of being impartial to the State, the victim, and being fair to the trial court, is willing to bend rules of law relating to preservation of error in order to be \u201cflexible\u201d to a defendant who has chosen to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b633 The rule is well established that this Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Peterson, </em>2002 MT 65, \u00b6 24, 309 Mont. 199, 44 P.3d 499 (citing <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, 989 P.2d 836). A party may not raise new arguments or change its legal theory on appeal. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100 (where this Court declined to follow an exception to the rule when the facts are undisputed). The critical reason for the rule is \u201cthat it is <em>fundamentally unfair </em>to fault the trial court for failing to rule on an issue it was <em>never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 17, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b634 In addition, we have said \u201c[i]t has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a district court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>State v. English, </em>2006 MT 177, \u00b6 71, 333 Mont. 23, 140 P.3d 454. <em>\u201cAcquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it. </em>This Court will not hold a district court in error when it has <em>not been given an opportunity to correct itself.\u201d English, </em>\u00b6 71 (citation omitted; emphasis added). Daniels has identified no exception to these rules for preserving error, except to offer that he should not be bound by them because he has chosen to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">\u00b635 When the District Court refused Daniels\u2019 Proposed Instruction No. 4, the District Court explained that the instruction \u201cindicates that the criminal mischief may be a lesser included offense, but provides no authority for that position.\u201d The District Court told Daniels it was an incorrect statement of the law. The District Court also stated that the proposed language was needless given the State\u2019s dismissal of the assault charge. Assuming error in the District Court\u2019s conclusions, Daniels did not explain to the District Court, which was particularly necessary given his simultaneous claim that he was acting in self-defense, why he was entitled to assert a lesser included offense theory and receive a lesser included offense instruction for assault. In fact, aside from composing an incorrect jury instruction which mentions assault in the context of a lesser included offense with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>criminal mischief, Daniels <em>never </em>made clear to the District Court his lesser included offense theory for assault: not at the time of the State\u2019s dismissal of the assault charge; not at the time jury instructions were settled; nor at the time the verdict form, containing only the offense of aggravated burglary, was agreed upon. As is demonstrated by this Court\u2019s Opinion, Daniels\u2019 theory of the case was first established in his closing argument, which <em>followed </em>the settling of the jury instructions. Opinion, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b636 Additionally, the Court directs that \u201cthe proper course in this case would have been to send the case to the jury as charged ....\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. However, such a bidding or instruction to the State interferes with a prosecutor\u2019s discretion in deciding what to charge and the strategy the State chooses for obtaining a conviction on the offense it deems is most warranted. Often a prosecutor may elect to pursue only the greater offense out of concern that the jury may reach a compromise verdict on a lesser offense. Similarly, a defense strategy may be that, because of a belief that the State cannot prove the greater offense, the defendant strategizes that a compromise verdict by the jury on a lesser offense is too risky. In both examples, the parties, and not this Court, are the ones trying the case and most familiar with the evidence. This is why \u00a7 46-16-607(3), MCA, requires that the lesser included instruction be considered \u201cupon <em>request </em>of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added). The significance of allowing the State to charge; a defendant to elect a lesser included offense strategy; and the trial court to decide whether the evidence supports a lesser included offense instruction cannot be overstated. Indeed, the Court\u2019s meandering explanation through <em>Tellegen, Zink, </em>and \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, landing with a second-chair command of what the District Court should have done, will prove difficult to decipher and employ in the future by litigants and the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b637 In my view, although Daniels submitted a partial <em>legally </em>correct jury instruction proposing a lesser included offense of assault, he otherwise failed to adequately present his argument and explain to the District Court that his theory of defense entitled him to the instruction. I agree with the State when it maintains that a defendant who elects to represent himself cannot thereafter complain that the poor quality of his own defense requires remediation through liberal construction to rectify missed opportunities in the trial court. The trial judge should have the first opportunity to correct the error and is not required to anticipate, conjure up, or decipher claims of any litigant. A judge has the responsibility to preside in such a way as to promote fairness to all litigants. To require the trial judge to assume a role of anticipating and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>formulating arguments and requests of a criminal defendant is inconsistent with the requirement that a judge be fair and impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"AjFl\">\u00b638 (2) <em>A lesser included assault instruction was inconsistent with Daniels\u2019 claim of self-defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b639 I agree with Justice Rice\u2019s observations in \u00b6 26 of his dissent characterizing Daniels\u2019 testimony and theory of defense. Further, Daniels\u2019 theory of self-defense, ifbelieved, wouldhave required the jury to acquit him of assault. For this reason, and because no alternate theory of defense was presented, I would conclude that Daniels was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b640 This Court has missed an important distinction in our jurisprudence with respect to lesser included offenses. While we cite and rely upon the two-step inquiry described in <em>Castle </em>and utilized in <em>Jay, </em>we overlook the requirement that to give a lesser included offense instruction it must be consistent with the defense\u2019s theory of its case. Accordingly, a defendant does not get a lesser included instruction simply because, as a matter of law, a lesser included offense is available, \u201cwhen the defendant's evidence <em>or theory, </em>if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d Jay, \u00b6 42 <em>(citing State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 39, 325 Mont. 27, 103 P.3d 1037 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b641 In <em>Burkhart, </em>a prosecution for deliberate homicide, evidence was presented at trial that indicated Burkhart was angry about his car and exclaimed, \u201cI am going to kill the fucker that broke into [my] car.\u201d An instruction for mitigated deliberate homicide would have required evidence of extreme mental or emotional distress. Because there was no evidence of this nature presented or any other evidence to justify a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide, an instruction on mitigated homicide was properly denied. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b642 In <em>State v. Martinez, </em>1998 MT 265, 291 Mont. 265, 968 P.2d 705, we reiterated that two criteria must be met before a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction, and also explained that the defendant\u2019s \u201cevidence or theory\u201d cannot be inconsistent with guilt for the lesser included offense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">First, the offense must actually constitute a lesser included offense of the offense charged, and, second, there must be sufficient evidence to support the included offense instruction. <em>Furthermore, although a defendant is entitled to jury instructions on every issue or theory having support in the evidence, a lesser included offense instruction is not supported by the evidence where the defendant's evidence or theory, ifbelieved, would require an acquittal.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Martinez, who was charged with felony assault for his use of a weapon, argued that he was entitled to a lesser included instruction of misdemeanor assault because Gillespie, the victim, was not a credible witness. However, Gillespie provided the only testimony at trial regarding the specific events underlying the felony assault charge. This Court concluded that, as a result, if the jury had discounted Gillespie\u2019s testimony\u2014as Martinez asserts it should have\u2014there would have been no evidence at all in support of an assault charge. The absence of evidence establishing the elements of a criminal charge supports a verdict of acquittal. We again noted \u201ca lesser included offense instruction is not supported by the evidence where the defendant\u2019s evidence or theory, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b643 In <em>State v. Schmalz, </em>1998 MT 210, 290 Mont. 420, 964 P.2d 763, Schmalz relied upon the common-law rule that the court must instruct upon every issue or theory having support in the evidence, citing, <em>inter alia, State v. Gopher, </em>194 Mont. 227, 633 P.2d 1195 (1981). This Court noted, however, that \u201can instruction on a lesser included offense of assault has no support in the evidence and is not necessary when the defense\u2019s evidence, if believed, would require an acquittal.\u201d <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6 23. We concluded that \u201cthe testimony of Schmalz\u2019s mother, if believed, would support an acquittal, not a conviction of felony assault\u201d because, \u201caccording to her testimony, Schmalz had no intent to shoot her at all.\u201d <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6 23. A lesser included instruction would have been incorrect because \u201cif the jury believed the testimony upon which the defense relies, an instruction on the lesser included offense would have no support in the evidence because the necessary intent would be lacking.\u201d <em>Schmalz, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u00b644 In <em>State v. Howell, </em>1998 MT 20, 287 Mont. 268, 954 P.2d 1102, Howell was charged with deliberate homicide and requested a lesser included instruction on aggravated or felony assault. We held that \u201cthe record contains no evidence that Howell intended to inflict bodily injury rather than to cause the death of Oliver.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>\u00b6 34. Howell also stated that he did not intend to injure Oliver, but cut him accidentally. We concluded Howell was not entitled to the lesser included instruction because \u201c[t]his theory, if accepted, would support an acquittal, not a conviction for assault.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b645 <em>Castle, </em>itself, is an excellent illustration of when a defendant is entitled to a lesser included instruction. In <em>Castle, </em>the defendant was charged with deliberate homicide. The testimony at trial established that the defendant punched the victim three times in the jaw and once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>on the side of the head, but that another man stabbed the victim several times and kicked the victim in the head. <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 368, 948 P.2d at 691. The pathologist who examined the victim testified that the causes of death were stabbing and severe blunt force injuries to the head. He stated that the type of blows that caused this injury were not simple punches or even the type of punch that would normally be inflicted by a boxer. <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 368, 948 P.2d at 691. The district court refused the defendant\u2019s request for jury instructions on assault. On appeal, this Court held that \u201c[ajlthough this Court holds that assault is an included offense, that does not mean that an instruction on this offense must be given every time a defendant is charged with deliberate homicide. Rather, there must be some basis from which a jury could rationally conclude that the defendant is guilty of the lesser, but not the greater offense.\u201d <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 368, 948 P.2d at 691. We determined that the testimony and medical evidence \u201cwere consistent with the defense theory that, although the defendant punched [the victim], ... those blows only amounted to assault and did not cause his death.\u201d We held that the district court erred in not instructing the jury on assault. <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 369, 948 P.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b646 Here, this is not a situation where Defendant has offered <em>alternate </em>theories for his defense. Daniels\u2019 testimony was that Loney was the aggressor and pushed him first; Daniels testified he only acted in self-defense to protect himself. In doing so, during this melee, Daniels and Loney fell through the front door. Based on this evidence and the foregoing authority, a lesser included instruction of assault would have been inconsistent with Daniels\u2019 theory of self-defense; if the jury accepted that Daniels acted in self-defense, they would have been required to acquit Daniels. Daniels is not entitled to a lesser included instruction for assault simple because, as a matter of law, assault is an element of aggravated burglary. This Court overlooks the requirement that the instruction be consistent with the defendant\u2019s evidence <em>or theory </em>and that, if accepted by the jury, the theory would not support an acquittal for the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b647 I would affirm the District Court for the reason that Daniels failed to preserve the alleged error. However, this Court has erred as well in finding that Daniels was entitled to a lesser included instruction of assault because a conviction for assault would be inconsistent with Daniels\u2019 claim of self-defense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> This Court suggests that Daniels\u2019 proposed instruction \u201cmirrored the pattern instruction on lesser-included offenses.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 20. However, while the instruction was correct in that it instructed to choose either the greater or lesser offense, and not both, the substance of Daniels\u2019 instruction was incorrect and, thankfully, does not mirror our pattern jury instructions. It reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">The Defendant is charged with aggravated burglary a Felony and two lesser charges of assault, a misdemeanor, and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. A lesser included offense is one that is less serious than the charged offense. The Defendant cannot be convicted of the felony and the misdemeanors. The charge of aggravated burglary includes the elements of both misdemeanors.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
