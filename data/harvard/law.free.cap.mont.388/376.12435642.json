The City raises six issues, but we reverse and remand for further proceedings on the issue stated below, and do not address the additional issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Did the District Court err by holding the CBAs were unambiguous and excluding extrinsic evidence concerning interpretation of those agreements?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">\u00b62 Officers are current and retired police officers, and members of the Montana Public Employees Association-Billings Police (Union). The Union, on behalf of the Officers, collectively bargains with the City to adopt an agreement governing the terms of the Officers\u2019 employment. The central dispute in this case is the correct interpretation of the longevity pay provisions in the 2000-2003, 2003-2006, and 2006-2009 CBAs entered by the City and the Union. Those provisions stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">2000-2003 CBA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">Longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate based upon the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">.45 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1 x years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">2003-2006 CBA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">Beginning July 1, 2003, longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate based upon the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">.45 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer from year 1 to 15 years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">.50 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer after year 15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">2006-2009 CBA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">(Same language as in the 2003-2006 CBA, but with nearly appropriately corresponding dates.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">\u00b63 The City paid longevity pay to the Officers in accordance with its understanding of the contractual formula provided in the 2000-2003 CBA, including the language \u201cx [or, times] the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1 x [times] years of service.\u201d The internal wording, \u201cthe hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>placed between two multiplication signs, was read by the City as a singular phrase that set the base wage to be used in the calculation, that being an officer\u2019s hourly wage rate \u201cat the beginning of year 1.\u201d Further, the City understood the phrase coming after the second multiplication sign, \u201cyears of service,\u201d also provided in the 2000-2003 CBA, to mean years that an officer had actually served or completed. For example, the City would calculate longevity pay for an officer beginning his or her sixth year of employment based upon five years of completed service. Even though the phrase \u201cat the beginning of year 1,\u201d and the multiplier based on \u201cyears of service,\u201d were not included in the 2003-2006 and 2006-2009 versions of the CBA, the City continued to calculate longevity pay pursuant to these terms, believing it had agreed with the Union to do so, and thus paid this longevity benefit over the entire period in dispute. The Union agreed with this calculation and is not a party in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b64 The Officers filed suit in 2009, claiming the City had incorrectly calculated longevity pay under the CBAs. Specifically, the Officers claimed that the CBA required the City to pay \u201caccumulated longevity enhancements.\u201d The Officers claimed that, instead of basing longevity on an officer\u2019s hourly wage rate at the beginning of year 1, the City was required to cumulatively \u201cadd longevity increases to each police officer\u2019s hourly rate\u201d in order to calculate the \u201cfull longevity increase owed.\u201d The Officers claimed other damages associated with their longevity claim, including retirement contributions. The Officers asserted that the longevity provisions of the CBAs were \u201ccomplete and unambiguous, and none of these provisions requires the introduction of extraneous evidence in order to interpret them.\u201d Officers requested, and the District Court certified, the matter as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b65 The City answered, asserting it had initially paid and thereafter continued to pay the longevity benefit as negotiated with the Union under the CBA. Noting the changes in language in the successive CBAs, the City specifically denied Officers\u2019 assertion that the longevity provisions were unambiguous, and affirmatively asserted \u201cthat the introduction of extrinsic evidence is necessary to interpret them.\u201d Further, in a counterclaim, the City noted that later versions of the CBA had eliminated the multiplier for an officer\u2019s years of service and, pursuant to the Officers\u2019 assertion that the CBAs were unambiguous and amenable to a plain reading, the City had overpaid longevity to the Officers and, under such a reading, would be entitled to a refund. The District Court dismissed the City\u2019s counterclaims as a matter of law, reasoning that they were dependent upon extrinsic evidence that was inappropriate to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>\u00b66 Officers moved for summary judgment on their claims and, in response to Officers\u2019 accumulation theory, the City cited <em>Raw v. City of Helena, </em>139 Mont. 343, 347, 363 P.2d 720, 722 (1961), for the proposition that \u201cit is to the base salary and not to the base salary plus longevity that longevity is added.\u201d However, the District Court did not expressly address the Officers\u2019 accumulation theory, but rather focused on whether the CBAs were subject to a plain reading, reasoning that \u201c[t]he Court finds that the language, \u2018longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate ...\u2019 is clear, unambiguous, and easily understandable. It is not ambiguous nor reasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u201d (Emphasis original.) Rejecting the City\u2019s argument that extrinsic evidence was necessary to properly understand the longevity provisions of the contracts, the District Court ruled that \u201c[tjhere can be no reasonable argument that the [CBAs] and the attachments thereto plainly state and mean anything other than that longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate. ... There is no need for extraneous or parol evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b67 Then, the District Court, in a few sentences at the end of its order, offered determinative examples about how longevity was to be calculated under the CBAs, and in so doing incorporated calculation issues that had not been pleaded or briefed by the parties, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">As an example, in 1994, an officer who is in his 11th year of service would calculate his longevity addition according to the formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">.45 x .01 x $10.8898 x 11 = .539</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">For the same officer, who in 1995 would be in his 12th year of service, the longevity addition would be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">.45 x .01 x $11.2709 x 12 = .609</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Although offering equations, the District Court did not reference any language in the CBAs or discuss any governing legal principles to explain its determination of the components therein, including its use of a years-of-service multiplier for periods when the CBAs included no multiplier, or, critically, its implied rejection of the City\u2019s long use of <em>completed </em>years of service in that multiplier. It did not analyze the specific language differences in the successive versions of the CBAs or the City\u2019s use of the contractual phrase \u201cthe hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1\u201d to calculate the base wage in the formula. The District Court simply reasoned that the CBAs \u201care complete, unambiguous, and easily understandable on their faces and require no extraneous evidence for interpretation\u201d and provided example equations, with no source authority for the particular components and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>calculations employed in the example equations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A62\">\u00b68 Following retirement of the presiding judge, Hon. Neis Swandal, the District Court\u2019s partial summary judgment order became known in the litigation as the \u201cSwandal Formula,\u201d even though, technically, it provided no actual \u201cformula\u201d based upon contract language, but only example equations. Nonetheless, the order significantly altered the litigation going forward. The Officers thereafter embraced the equations the District Court had adopted <em>sua sponte, </em>rather than the accumulation theory drawn from the CBAs that they had originally stated in their complaint. The Officers\u2019 expert accountant testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">Q. And it\u2019s correct, is it not, that you did not use in your computations the longevity formulas that appear in the [CBAs].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZs\">A. I believe I used the judge\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">Q. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">A. \u2014requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">Q. Right. I just wanted to make that clear. You didn\u2019t use the longevity formula in the three contracts, you used the Judge\u2019s order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">A. That\u2019s correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>incorporation of a non-completed year of service within the years-of-service multiplier took the City by surprise, as that specific issue had not been previously raised in the litigation or briefed, and was contrary to the City\u2019s longstanding practice in wage agreement administration. As the City\u2019s Human Resource Director testified, when asked about the Swandal Formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARL\">Of course, you know I disagree .... And you\u2019re going to tell me, well, Swandal has already heard that, but how do you have 1 year of experience at Day 1? I\u2019m very passionate about that, because I don\u2019t understand that. We have 3 other groups that are also paid longevity. We have police\u2014or sorry\u2014teamsters, fire and non-bargaining, and all of those 3 groups also start after completed years of service. You have to complete a year before you get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>longevity ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This understanding of longevity was echoed in the testimony of the Officers\u2019 Class Representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">Q. As far as you know, when the police union and the city in their longevity contracts talked about years of service, was the understanding that years of service was a count of completed years? That is, <em>you sign on, and at the end of 12 months, you\u2019ve got a year.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">A. I believe so, yes, sir. That would be longevity. [(Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u00b610 Following a bench trial, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ruling that \u201c[t]he plain language of the CBAs governs the outcome of this case,\u201d the District Court again refused to consider extrinsic evidence offered by the City about the meaning of the longevity formulas in the CBAs. The court stated it was making \u201cone exception\u201d to this ruling, for purposes of considering extrinsic evidence about the years-of-service multiplier, reasoning the omission of the multiplier in the 2003-2006 and 2006-2009 CBAs was merely a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error.\u201d Noting that Judge Swandal had previously \u201cinterpreted the formula such that an officer in his first year of service would have longevity calculated to include one year of service,\u201d the District Court adopted the same interpretation, concluding that \u201clongevity must be calculated in accordance with the plain language of the CBAs, \u2018at the beginning of year one.\u2019 \u201d Although the term, \u201cat the beginning of year 1,\u201d was stated only in the 2000-2003 CBA, the District Court applied the term to the successive CBAs based on consideration of extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\u00b611 However, while stating it was making this \u201cone exception\u201d to the exclusion of extrinsic evidence, the District Court nonetheless selectively considered and relied upon other extrinsic evidence that was critical to its findings of fact and conclusions of law. First, the District Court found that \u201c[hjistorically, the City calculated longevity beginning on day one of year one.\u201d To support this factual finding, the District Court cited to extrinsic evidence\u2014a purported internal City memorandum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u00b612 Secondly, the District Court found that \u201cthe City does write plain language agreements calling for longevity increases only after completion of one year of service,\u201d citing to extrinsic evidence of the later 2009-2012 CBA negotiated between the Union and the City, which provided for longevity pay based upon \u201cyears of <em>completed </em>service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Citing these two findings of fact, both clearly premised upon extrinsic evidence of the City\u2019s practices outside the subject CBAs, the District Court entered the following conclusion of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The fact that the City historically paid longevity commencing in an officer\u2019s first year of service, and the fact that the City changed its longevity language, after this case was filed[,] to state that longevity was to be calculated based upon completed years of service, both cause the Court to question the credibility of the City\u2019s position to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">\u00b613 The District Court entered a final judgment requiring the City to pay the Officers $932,960.90, imposing a 110% penalty of $1,026,256.99, and awarding attorneys\u2019 fees of $653,072.63 and costs of $125,854.60, for a total of $2,738,145.12. The City appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">\u00b614 We review questions of law, including the interpretation of provisions in a collective bargaining agreement, for correctness. <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 18, 338 Mont. 402, 168 P.3d 615 (citing <em>Reier Broad. Co. v. Reier, </em>2000 MT 120, \u00b6 20, 299 Mont. 463, 1 P.3d 940; <em>Hughes v. Blankenship, </em>266 Mont. 150, 154, 879 P.2d 685, 687 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err by holding that the CBAs were unambiguous and excluding extrinsic evidence concerning interpretation of those agreements </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">\u00b616 We are here concerned with whether the law was properly applied to the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. \u201cThe interpretation of provisions in a collective bargaining agreement is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>question oflaw.\u201d <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(citing Hughes, </em>266 Mont. at 154, 879 P.2d at 687); <em>accord Wurl v. Polson Sch. Dist. No. 23, </em>2006 MT 8, \u00b6 16, 330 Mont. 282, 127 P.3d 436. If the \u201ccontract provision is clear and unambiguous,\u201d the \u201ccourt must apply the language as written.\u201d <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 16). However, \u201c[i]f a contract term is ambiguous, interpretation of the term requires resolving a question of fact regarding the intent of the parties to the contract.\u201d <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17); <em>accord In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 30, 320 Mont. 229, 92 P.3d 1148 (holding a contract ambiguity requires \u201ca determination of a question of fact: the real intention of the parties at the time of contracting\u201d). Whether ambiguity exists is a \u201cquestion of law for the court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17). \u201cAn ambiguity exists where the language of the contract, as a whole, could reasonably be subject to two different meanings.\u201d <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Wurl, </em>\u00b6 17); <em>accord State v. Asbeck, </em>2003 MT 337, \u00b6 18, 318 Mont. 431, 80 P.3d 1272. If the court determines that an ambiguity is present in the instrument, then \u201cextrinsic evidence may be introduced at trial to allow the trier of fact to determine the intent of the parties in entering into the contract.\u201d <em>Mary J. Baker Revocable Trust v. Cenex Harvest States Coop., Inc., </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 55, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851 [hereinafter <em>Baker Revocable Trust].</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b617 The City and the Officers both acknowledge there are language inconsistencies within the subject CBAs, but disagree about the significance of these problems, and whether they rise to a contract ambiguity as a matter of law. Additionally, the parties read different meanings into the existent contract language. The Officers read the term \u201cat the beginning of year 1\u201d in the 2000-2003 CBA to mean that longevity is to be <em>paid </em>from the beginning of the first year of employment, and believe that phrases stated on pay matrices attached to the CBAs support this interpretation. They further argue that the term is meant to modify the years-of-service multiplier. In contrast, the City believes that the term must be read as part of the complete phrase set between two multiplication signs, \u201cthe hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1,\u201d to mean that the rate of longevity pay is calculated based upon what Officers <em>earned </em>at the beginning of the first year of employment. Both of these interpretations of the contract language are reasonable readings, thus creating a legal ambiguity. <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18. The City argues that its interpretation, requiring an officer to complete a year of service, is supported by common meaning of the word \u201clongevity,\u201d by common law rules of grammatical construction that generally require a term (\u201cat the beginning of year 1\u201d) to modify the last antecedent (\u201cthe hourly rate of an officer\u201d), and by the long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>history and practice of the parties under the CBAs. Of course, consideration of the parties\u2019 history and practice would first require a legal determination of contract ambiguity, followed by the admission of extrinsic evidence at trial. Such offers of proof were made by the City, but were denied by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b618 Adding to the interpretational difficulty is the fact that not one, but three, CBAs are at issue, providing different language. The contested term mentioned above, \u201cat the beginning of year 1,\u201d is found only in the 2000-2003 CBA. Not only was its meaning contested, but the propriety of its continued application to the subsequent CBAs was another legal question to be determined in the proceeding. The District Court, both in the Swandal Formula and after trial, resolved these questions in the Officers\u2019 favor. The problem is that the Swandal Formula, premised upon no pleading or briefing, provided no explanation about how it arrived at these determinations, but simply incorporated them into equations; then, the District Court reached the same conclusions after trial by doing what it explicitly said it would not do\u2014relying on extrinsic evidence of the City\u2019s practices outside the subject CBAs. As noted above, the District Court used extrinsic evidence to resolve the most critical longevity calculation issue: the rejection of the City\u2019s demonstrably long practice of calculating years of service based upon <em>completed </em>years of service.</p>\n<p id=\"A7-\">\u00b619  The District Court\u2019s legal analysis was inherently contradictory and legally incorrect. Although concluding as a matter of law that the subject CBAs contained no ambiguity and could be resolved on their plain language, the District Court nonetheless considered and relied upon extrinsic evidence to interpret the CBAs. \u201cIf the court determines that the instrument contains no ambiguity, then the extrinsic evidence may not be considered further.\u201d <em>Baker Revocable </em>Trust, \u00b6 55. Only when \u201cthe court determines that an ambiguity is present in the instrument\u201d may extrinsic evidence be introduced at trial to determine the intent of the parties. <em>Baker Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"AWq\">\u00b620  At a minimum, <em>some </em>ambiguity in the CBAs was acknowledged by the parties and by the District Court by applying the years-of-service multiplier to all of the CBAs, even though it was contained only in the 2000-2003 CBA. While the District Court described this as a \u201cscrivener\u2019s error,\u201d it nonetheless here required extrinsic evidence to interpret the CBAs correctly. The District Court received extrinsic evidence on this point, but minimized its actions as the \u201cone exception\u201d it was making to the exclusion of such evidence. However, despite this statement, the District Court cited and relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>upon other extrinsic evidence in its findings of fact and conclusions of law. It was an error of law to rely on extrinsic evidence in favor of the Officers, while imposing a blanket exclusion upon the extrinsic evidence offered by the City. <em>Baker Revocable Trust, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b621 We conclude from a review of the record that the District Court erred by concluding as a matter of law that the longevity provisions of the subject CBAs were unambiguous. The differing language of the successive CBAs are reasonably subject to more than one interpretation, and the blanket exclusion of all extrinsic evidence offered by the City\u2014while selectively relying on other extrinsic evidence\u2014was likewise erroneous. We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this conclusion, and for consideration at trial of extrinsic evidence about the parties\u2019 intent, subject to application of the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b622 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-7\">JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER, SANDEFUR and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\"> It is not clear why the District Court used the years 1994 and 1995 in its equations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-12\"> Although not explained by the District Court in its order, the Swandal Formula may have impliedly incorporated portions of the Officers\u2019 original accumulation theory within its example equations.

The Court contends that while the District Court ruled the CBAs were unambiguous, it nonetheless cited and relied upon extrinsic evidence beneficial to the Officers but excluded extrinsic evidence presented by the City. The Court holds that this was an error of law. I conclude that one of the three examples of the District Court\u2019s purported use of extrinsic evidence set forth in the Court\u2019s majority opinion, the example pertaining to scrivener\u2019s error, was appropriate. I further conclude the other two examples did not constitute inadmissible extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">\u00b625 Extrinsic, or parol, evidence is evidence relating to a contract but not appearing on the face of the contract because it comes from other sources, such as statements between the parties, depositions, correspondence, or the circumstances surrounding the agreement. It is generally not admissible to contradict or add to the terms of an unambiguous contract. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>675 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). In other words, as noted above in \u00b6 16, if a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>is clear and unambiguous, the court must apply the language as written and may not look to extrinsic evidence to interpret the language or determine the intent of the parties. <em>Kuhr, </em>\u00b6 18<em>; Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 154, 108 P.3d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b626 Here, the Court faults the District Court for considering extrinsic evidence regarding the formula used to calculate longevity pay for Officers. Beginning in 1994, the City and the Union negotiated CBAs containing a formula developed to calculate the amount of longevity pay to be added to the Billings police officers\u2019 hourly pay. Since 1994, the formula consistently contained two fractional multipliers (.45 and .01), but the remaining factors were less consistent. For example, the 1994-1997 CBA used the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year one (referenced as PD1) multiplied by the years of service. Consequently, the formula read: .45 x .01 x the hourly rate of PD1 x years of service. The 1997-2000 CBAs used the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year two; as a result, the formula was: .45 x .01 x the hourly rate of PD2 x years of service. In the subsequent and applicable CBAs, discussed below, the City again revised the formula factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b627 As noted in \u00b6 2 of the majority opinion, the three CBAs relevant to this case spanned the time periods of July 1, 2000-June 30, 2003 (CBA I), July 1, 2003-June 30, 2006 (CBA II), and July 1, 2006-June 30, 2009 (CBA III). The longevity clauses in each of these CBAs read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARh\">CBA I: Longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate based upon the following formula: .45 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1 x years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">CBAs II and III: Beginning July 1,2003,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> longevity shall be added to each officer\u2019s hourly rate based upon the following formula:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">.45 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer from year 1 to 15 years of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">.50 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer after year 15.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b628 As is readily apparent when reading these clauses, CBAs II and III do not reference that longevity must be calculated based upon the hourly rate of an officer \u201cat the beginning of year 1.\u201d Nor do the two latter CBAs include \u201cyears of service\u201d as a critical and statutorily-required multiplier. Section 7-32-4116, MCA, addressing minimum wage and longevity pay of police in first- and second-class cities, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>(1) Each duly confirmed member of a police department of cities of the first and second class of Montana is entitled to a minimum wage for a daily service of 8 hours\u2019 work of at least $ 750 per month for the first year of service and thereafter at least $ 750 a month plus 1% of the minimum base monthly salary of $ 750 for each additional year of service up to and including the 20th year of additional service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAPF\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANAAAAApAQAAAABsQpoIAAAAUklEQVR4nGP8z4ALMOGUGZUalSJX6m8DlPMEJjqBgYGBgeH///8/7P9DwEEo/Z/9/////wkYyOIA5SjBRDtgBv6DmfMdxrj//////4yjaZ6WUgCCVTfQXpRKPAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"208\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">(3) Added salary for years of service will be based on the base monthly salary as established in this section and not on the actual current salary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b629 The City testified that the omissions in CBAs II and III were inadvertent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the City continued to calculate and pay longevity in the same manner it had done under CBA I, using an officer\u2019s base rate pay during his or her first year of service and multiplying it by the number of years the officer had served. Accepting this undisputed testimony, the District Court, then-presiding Judge Swandal, noted in its March 8, 2011 order that these omissions were scrivener\u2019s errors and reformed CBAs II and III accordingly. Subsequently, Judge Gilbert, presiding over the case following Judge Swandal\u2019s retirement, incorporated reference to this scrivener\u2019s error in the court\u2019s January 28, 2016 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b630 The City now appears to argue on appeal that the District Court erred by accepting its repeated admission that CBAs II and III failed to include \u201cat the beginning of year 1\u201d and \u201cyears of service\u201d in its longevity formula. In admitting this inadvertent omission, the City also informed the District Court that its absence did not affect the manner in which it calculated officer longevity and that it performed under CBAs II and III as it had under CBA I, using the omitted factors as before. By admitting that it continued calculating longevity as it had under CBA I, the City was also admitting that the absence of the formula factors did not render CBAs II and III ambiguous from its perspective. Consequently, informed that the omissions had no effect on the City\u2019s performance, the District Court concluded it was a scrivener\u2019s error and incorporated the \u201ccorrected\u201d formula into its July 8, 2011 order. The City did not object to the order and later praised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Judge Swandal\u2019s manifest and correct understanding of the CBAs.</p>\n<p id=\"AtV\">\u00b631 Subsequently, in December 2013, the City began arguing the meaning of \u201cyears of service,\u201d asserting it actually meant \u201cyears of completed service.\u201d As such, the City now argues that the District Court erred by reforming CBAs II and III based upon extrinsic evidence, i.e., its admissions of inadvertent error as it pertains to the longevity formulas in CBAs II and III. The City claims the court did not err by adding the omitted language but that it erred by not attributing the City\u2019s meaning of the omitted language. This argument should not be well taken. The District Court concluded the language of CBA I was unambiguous. Inserting the identical language into CBAs II and III did not render those agreements ambiguous. \u201cIt has long been the rule of this Court that on appeal we will not put a district court in error for a ruling or procedure in which the appellant acquiesced, participated, or to which appellant made no objection.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2017 MT 163, \u00b6 34, 388 Mont. 89, 397 P.3d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b632 The second reference to extrinsic evidence noted in the Court\u2019s majority opinion is the court\u2019s factual finding regarding the first date upon which the City historically calculated longevity. Finding of Fact No. 17 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">The City\u2019s handling of the longevity formula has not been consistent. Historically, the City calculated longevity beginning on day one of year one. However, at times, the City computed longevity beginning in year two, as it now argues is proper. This inconsistent calculation of longevity was detailed in a Memo sent to Karla Stanton by a computer specialist employed by the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"atm-dedup-1\">\u00b633 The Court notes that the City claims the memo does not exist; however, the existence or lack thereof of the memo is not decisive. The District Court heard testimony that the City\u2019s payment of longevity pay was inconsistent but ruled that the unambiguous language of the CBA required the City to pay past due longevity calculated \u201cat the beginning of year one\u201d in accordance with the plain language of the CBAs. The District Court\u2019s reference to evidence revealing the City\u2019s inconsistency was not an improper reliance on extrinsic evidence as it was not used to interpret the agreement or determine the parties\u2019 intent. Rather, it was an acknowledgment that the City was not calculating longevity in the manner required by the applicable CBAs.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap33\">\u00b634 Notably, the District Court has twice ruled that the applicable CBAs dictate that longevity pay begins on an officer\u2019s first day of employment and not after a completed year of service. The District Court first concluded this in its July 8,2011 order. At that time, Judge Swandal was tasked with ruling on Watters\u2019 motion for partial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>summary judgment in which Watters argued the City failed to add longevity payments to each officers\u2019 base hourly rate; rather, the City erroneously paid longevity as a separate, stand-alone payment. This stand-alone method resulted in the underpayments of longevity benefits. Judge Swandal concluded that the language of the CBAs unequivocally required the City to add longevity payments to each officers\u2019 hourly rate. While the parties had not yet raised the issue of the meaning of \u201cyears of service,\u201d the court set forth the following example, applying the formula to \u201can officer who is in his 11th year of service\u201d: .45 x .01 x $10.8898 x 11 = .539. In this example, by using eleven years of service before the officer had completed the eleventh year of service, the District Court interpreted the CBA to provide instant longevity. As noted above, the City did not object to the court\u2019s interpretation at that time and later lauded the District Court\u2019s \u201cstraightforward example.\u201d It was not until December 2013 that the City asserted that \u201cyears of service\u201d meant \u201cyears of <em>completed </em>service\u201d and that neither the City nor the Union intended the City to pay instant longevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b635 Subsequently, in January 2016, the District Court, Judge Gilbert presiding, issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order and determined, as did Judge Swandal, that under CBAs I-III, longevity pay began \u201cin an officer\u2019s first year of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b636 Lastly, the District Court\u2019s third reference to extrinsic evidence, as pointed out in the majority opinion, is the District Court\u2019s reference to the July 1, 2009-June 30, 2012, CBA between the Officers and the City. In this collective bargaining agreement, drafted as the case before us was proceeding, the \u201cyears of service\u201d longevity pay factor was revised to expressly state \u201cyears of <em>completed </em>service.\u201d Again, the court\u2019s review of the 2009-2012 CBA was not intended to obtain evidence to aid in the interpretation of the earlier CBAs, or determine the intention of the parties. It was referenced to illustrate that the City was capable of drafting an agreement that clearly stated its intention to calculate and pay longevity benefits based upon years of <em>completed </em>service. Moreover, the District Court\u2019s observation of the change in the 2009 CBA went to the City\u2019s credibility, rather than to contract interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b637 It is well-established that courts must enforce written contracts as written and not insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted. Section 1-4-101, MCA. Additionally, \u201c[ejvidence of surrounding circumstances may not be used to add to, vary, or contradict the terms of the contract. Nor may extrinsic evidence be used ... to show an intention independent of the instrument.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Broadwater Dev., L.L.C. v. Nelson, </em>2009 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 352 Mont. 401, 219 P.3d 492 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b638 In this case, the District Court concluded that CBA I was unambiguous and clearly stated that longevity was to be added to an officer\u2019s hourly rate at the beginning of year one. The court subsequently reformed CBAs II and III based upon the City\u2019s testimony that it erroneously omitted reference to an officer\u2019s hourly rate <em>at the beginning of year one x years of service. </em>After reformation based upon admitted scrivener\u2019s error, the three CBAs clearly stated that an officer\u2019s longevity pay was to be calculated \u201cat the beginning of year 1.\u201d The City has ample experience in drafting CBAs with its fire and police providers as reflected in the 1997-2000 CBA in which the City based longevity upon the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of his or her second year of service and the 2009-2012 CBA draft expressly stating that calculation of longevity was based upon years of <em>completed </em>service. While the City strenuously argues against the court\u2019s interpretation, the District Court and this Court must interpret the language in the contract before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b639 Additionally, I believe the Court is remiss in failing to address other issues raised by the parties on appeal. Those issues, including but not limited to the proper statute of limitations, the appropriate class members based upon accrual date, and certain damage awards, are likely to be raised and/or challenged in the subsequent proceeding on remand and may very well be subject to a subsequent appeal. As these issues are currently before this Court, they should be resolved prior to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b640 I conclude the Court\u2019s majority improperly put the District Court in error for accepting extrinsic evidence to appropriately reform CBAs II and III based upon admissions of inadvertence. I further conclude the \u201cextrinsic\u201d evidence the majority asserts the District Court relied upon, i.e., the City\u2019s inconsistent payment of longevity pay and the court\u2019s reference to the 2009 CBA, was not extrinsic evidence in that the court did not rely upon it to assist in interpreting the plain language of the CBAs or to discern the intent of the parties. Lastly, I conclude the District Court correctly interpreted the plain language of the contract and refused to accept contradicting extrinsic evidence. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH joins the Dissent of JUSTICE WHEAT.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\"> It appears the drafter of CBA III failed to change the operable date in the longevity clause to July 1, 2006, as CBA III continues to read \u201cBeginning July 1, 2003.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> As testified to by the City, the corrected formula in CBAs II and III would read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">.45 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1 x years of service from year 1 to 15 years of service. .50 x .01 x the hourly rate of an officer at the beginning of year 1 x years of service after year 15 of service.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
