Broesder appeals the Order issued by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, affirming and adopting the Standing Master\u2019s April 13,2016 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Decree of Dissolution, which dissolved the marriage between Donald and Sandra Broesder. We reverse and remand, addressing the following restated issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Did the District Court err by failing to consider the tax consequences of the distribution of the marital estate, resulting in an inequitable </em>distribution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b62 Since 1951, Donald has lived and worked on the Broesder family ranch, which was homesteaded by Donald\u2019s grandfather in 1911, and then owned by his parents. Donald and Sandra were married in 1976, and for approximately 35 years they lived and worked on the ranch. Together with their sons, Seth Broesder and Shane Broesder, and daughter-in-law, Sarah Broesder, Donald and Sandra own the ranch in a small corporation with restrictions upon the sale of stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b63 During the marriage, Donald worked exclusively on the ranch, while Sandra worked both on the ranch and elsewhere, including serving as a Pondera County Commissioner. Sandra\u2019s non-ranch income was used for personal expenses, as well as for ranch and family expenses. Seth, Sarah, and Shane have also worked on the ranch. Ranch shares were given to Donald and Sandra to compensate them for their work on the ranch, and for property and assets, which they transferred to the ranch corporation when it was originally incorporated. Shares of the ranch corporation are held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"352\"

width=\"1201\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">\u00b64 The parties agree the ranch is the significant marital asset, and the land is the significant ranch asset. The total value of the ranch is approximately $3.1 million, with the land valued at approximately $2.3 million. Donald and Sandra both have minimal personal assets. As counsel for Sandra stated, at the hearing before the District Court, the land is \u201creally the majority asset of the corporation. And, in fact, that was the reason the other shareholders sought to intervene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\u00b65 Seth and Sarah moved to intervene in the matter, arguing that intervention was necessary to protect their interests in the ranch. The Standing Master denied the motion for intervention, reasoning \u201c[t]he notion that an equitable division in this matter cannot be achieved without compelling the sale of assets is speculative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">\u00b66 During the proceedings, Donald suggested Sandra keep her ranch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>shares as her portion of the marital estate, but Sandra offered it would be necessary, in that event, for her to be given \u201csome sort of control\u201d over ranch decisions, as well as receiving reimbursement for living costs the ranch had provided during the marriage. Regarding possible sale between them, Donald suggested using the book value of $10.25 per share set, in 2003, by the shareholders pursuant to their stock agreement as the value of Sandra\u2019s interest. However, the resulting value of $101,557 was unrepresentative of the fair market value of Sandra\u2019s shares, and the Standing Master concluded such a price would constitute a windfall for Donald, who was unwilling to sell his shares for that price. Sandra thought the ranch assets should be valued at $4 million, but regarding a buyout of the shares, Sandra testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">Q. If the Court values the marital portion of the corporation, and values the corporation at $4 million, could either you or Don realistically get a loan to purchase the other\u2019s interest at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">A. Probably not. I don\u2019t see how the ranch cash flow could service that amount of debt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b67 The Standing Master determined Donald\u2019s interest in the ranch tobe $1,159,541 and Sandra\u2019s interest tobe $1,159,424. Following this determination, the Standing Master ordered Donald to pay Sandra the sum of $1,159,483 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for her interest in the ranch, with $50,000 to be paid within 60 days and the remainder within 24 months. The Standing Master ordered Sandra would not unreasonably withhold her consent to actions taken by Donald in furtherance of the judgment, including \u201cliquidation of the corporate property.\u201d However, no consideration was given to the tax implications of liquidating ranch property and assets to satisfy the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b68 Donald filed objections to the Standing Master\u2019s Order, and the District Court conducted a hearing. Donald urged consideration of the tax implications of a sale, which the District Court acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">Mr. Ferguson: [TJhere\u2019s absolutely no tax consequences figured into this, either. You and I both know that if this ranch is liquidated, the tax consequences are going to be enormous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">The Court: True, because of the low basis and the high sale value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHHf\">Mr. Ferguson: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">The Court: There\u2019s no doubt about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u00b69 The District Court affirmed and adopted the Standing Master\u2019s Order, reasoning the Standing Master had \u201cconsidered the totality of circumstances, limited marital assets, and equitably structured a way for Donald to satisfy the marital property division.\u201d The court did not address the tax consequences in its written order. Donald appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b610 Two standards of review are relevant in cases involving both a standing master and the district court: the standard the district court applies to the master\u2019s report and the standard we apply to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Marriage of Davis, </em>2016 MT 52, \u00b6 4, 382 Mont. 378, 367 P.3d 400 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Kostelnik, </em>2015 MT 283, \u00b6 15, 381 Mont. 182, 357 P.3d 912). We review a district court\u2019s decisions <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it applied the correct standard of review to a standing master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>Kostelnik, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Patton, </em>2015 MT 7, \u00b6 17, 378 Mont. 22, 340 P.3d 1242). A district court reviews a standing master\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 24, and its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct, <em>Patton, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by failing to consider the tax consequences of the distribution of the marital estate, resulting in an inequitable </em>distribution?</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b612 Donald argues the Standing Master and District Court failed to consider the tax consequences of the practical conclusion of the District Court\u2019s order, a \u201cforced liquidation of Broesder Ranch, Inc.,\u201d resulting in an \u201cinequitable and unconscionable\u201d distribution of the martial estate. Sandra argues Donald failed to present evidence of tax consequences, merely raising the issue in legal arguments to the District Court, and that the distribution of the marital estate was nonetheless fair and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">\u00b613 \u201cIn a proceedingfor dissolution of a marriage,... the court... shall, ... finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both. ...\u201d Section 40-4-202(1), MCA. This statute and public policy demand an equitable distribution of the marital estate, including tax liability. We have previously held \u201cwhere a property distribution ordered by a court includes a taxable event precipitating a concrete and immediate tax liability, such tax liability should be considered by the court before entering its final judgment.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>2015 MT 263, \u00b6 16, 381 Mont. 50, 357 P.3d 314 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Beck, </em>193 Mont. 166, 172, 631 P.2d 282, 285 (1981)). We have also held determining the existence of a \u201cconcrete and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>immediate\u201d tax event caused by a distribution order \u201crequires examining the context around the distribution order.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 18. \u201cTo find that a taxable event is concrete and immediate, we have not demanded that the distribution order specifically direct the very event that triggers taxation.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 18. However, \u201cwe have demanded that the distribution order at least reasonably appear to trigger a taxable event\u201d in the context of the surrounding circumstances. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"AHr\">\u00b614 The decree here does not expressly mandate liquidation of the ranch. However, it orders Donald to pay $1.1 million to Sandra for her share of the martial estate, and the record fails to establish that there are available assets in the marital estate for such a payment or that financing a purchase of Sandra\u2019s shares at fair market value is feasible. Thus, the \u201cliquidation of corporate property\u201d referenced by the Standing Master would appear to be a necessity to satisfy the judgment\u2014the ranch would have to be sold, which would \u201creasonably appear to trigger a taxable event.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 18. Notwithstanding this eventuality, the tax consequences were not \u201cconsidered by the court before entering its final judgment.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b615 Theorizing on the application of federal and state corporate and capital gains taxes, Donald argues on appeal that sale of the ranch property would trigger over $1 million in taxes, which, after distribution to the other shareholders, would leave Donald with almost enough funds to satisfy the decreed payment to Sandra, and nothing for himself. Such a scenario would obviously be inequitable. Whether Donald\u2019s scenario is accurate is unknown, as there is no record evidence of the tax consequences of liquidation, but nonetheless serves to illustrate the need to follow <em>Clark </em>in this instance and assess the tax implications, even if Donald only generally raised the issue before the District Court. While we have adopted no firm rule, we have cautioned about ordering the sale of a spouse\u2019s business assets \u201cin order to satisfy the judgment, thereby losing the bulk of the marital estate distributed to him and undermining his future ability to earn an income.\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Harris, </em>2013 MT 145, \u00b6 35, 370 Mont. 294, 308 P.3d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"abc-dedup-0\">\u00b616  The Standing Master erred as a matter of law by failing to consider the tax consequences of the likely result that the ranch would be sold to satisfy the judgment, and the District Court erred in adopting this conclusion. We reverse and remand this matter for a new trial or, in the discretion of the District Court, such further proceedings as would be necessary to implement this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-11\"> There is a $59 discrepancy between Sandra\u2019s interest in the Ranch and the amount Donald was ordered to pay her for her interest. There is no explanation in the record for this discrepancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
