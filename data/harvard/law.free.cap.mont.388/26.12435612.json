Over the next six minutes, Stagl made three separate phone calls to 911 updating dispatch concerning Zietlow\u2019s behavior. During the first 911 call, Stagl told dispatch that she was reporting on behalf of her coworker, later identified as Jamie Weavers (Weavers). Stagl can be heard in the 911 tape asking Weavers more questions, which were specifically prompted by the dispatcher. Stagl reported to dispatch her coworker\u2019s answers: that Weavers observed Zietlow stumbling; that Zietlow smelled like alcohol; and that Weavers could tell Zietlow was intoxicated. Stagl, herself, observed Zietlow walk into the building and enter the restroom. Stagl continued to provide dispatch with a real time update of Zietlow\u2019s activities, relating that Zietlow was \u201cbugging other customers,\u201d walking around other vehicles while customers were \u201cjust kind of watching him,\u201d and appeared to be about to leave. Stagl described Zietlow\u2019s vehicle as a black Chevy Silverado LTZ with temporary dealer plates and provided the tag number in its entirety. She provided a physical description of Zietlow, which included his hair color, height, the presence of facial hair, and what he was wearing. During her last call to 911, Stagl describes Zietlow pulling out of the parking lot and heading east on Highway 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">\u00b64 Highway Patrol Trooper Andrew Novak (Trooper Novak) used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>tag information provided by Stagl and learned the vehicle was registered to Zietlow and that Zietlow lived about 6 miles from the Bonner Town Pump. When Trooper Novak arrived at the address he did not observe any black Chevy Silverado pickup truck. At that point, Trooper Novak turned around and headed back towards the Town Pump. Almost immediately, however, he observed a pickup truck matching the description given by Stagl pull into Zietlow\u2019s driveway. Trooper Novak initiated a traffic stop, during which he confirmed the tag number, the vehicle\u2019s description, and the physical description of Zietlow. Ultimately, the stop ripened into probable cause to arrest Zietlow for driving under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b65 On June 15, 2015, Zietlow was charged in Missoula County Justice Court with Aggravated Driving Under the Influence, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-465, MCA, due to having a blood alcohol content above .16. Zietlow argued in a motion to suppress that the investigating officer did not have particularized suspicion to initiate the stop of his vehicle. The Justice Court denied Zietlow\u2019s motion and Zietlow subsequently entered a guilty plea to aggravated DUI, reserving his right to appeal the Justice Court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. Zietlow filed a notice of appeal. Following briefing by the parties and an evidentiary hearing in which Trooper Novak testified, the District Court denied Zietlow\u2019s motion to suppress in a written order issued May 31, 2016. Zietlow appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b66 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were applied correctly as a matter of law. <em>City of Missoula v. Moore, </em>2011 MT 61, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 22, 251 P.3d 679. A district court\u2019s finding that particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact, which this Court reviews for clear error. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 10. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record leaves us with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b67 <em>Whether a corroborated tip from an identified citizen informant based, in part, on personal observations of a co-worker is reliable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A9H\">\u00b68 The United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Const, amend. IV; Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11. Law enforcement officers may stop any person or vehicle that is observed in circumstances that create a particularized suspicion that the person or occupant of the vehicle has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense. Section 46-5-401(1), MCA; <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, \u00b6 57, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d <em>1124; Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b69 Particularized suspicion exists when an officer has objective data and articulable facts from which the officer can make certain inferences, and a resulting suspicion that the subject is, or has been, engaged in wrongdoing. <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 16. Whether particularized suspicion exists is a question of fact, which is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. Gill, </em>2012 MT 36, \u00b6 15, 364 Mont. 182, 272 P.3d 60. When evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court considers the quantity or content of the information available and the quality or degree of reliability of that information. <em>Gill, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqy\">\u00b610  We have stated that \u201c[a] citizen informant who is motivated by good citizenship and [is] willing to disclose the circumstances by which the incriminating information became known is presumed to be telling the truth.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 34, 314 Mont. 434, 67 P.3d 207 (internal quotations omitted)). Thus, information provided by a citizen informant, \u201csuch as the citizen informant\u2019s name, address, and telephone number, lends a \u2018high indicia of reliability\u2019 to his or her report.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>State v. Myhre, </em>2005 MT 278, \u00b6 18, 329 Mont. 210, 124 P.3d 126). An arresting officer may rely on information conveyed by a reliable third person to form the particularized suspicion necessary to justify an investigative stop if the report contains some indicia of reliability. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>286 Mont. 156, 162, 951 P.2d 37, 41 (1997). To determine the reliability of a third person report and thus the sufficiency of an officer\u2019s particularized suspicion based on that report, this Court has adopted three factors to use in its evaluation. <em>State v. Clawson, </em>2009 MT 228, \u00b6 11, 351 Mont. 354, 212 P.3d 1056 (citing Pratt, 286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43). The factors are: (1) whether the informant identified themselves to the authorities; (2) whether the informant's report is based on personal observation; and (3) whether the officer\u2019s observations corroborate the informant\u2019s information. <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 164-65, 951 P.2d at 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b611 Zietlow does not contest that the first <em>Pratt </em>factor\u2014the identity of the citizen informant\u2014has been satisfied. Zietlow argues, however, that the second and third factors have not been met. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Zietlow maintains that Stagl\u2019s report was not based on her own personal observations of Zietlow\u2019s intoxicated behavior and that Trooper Novak did not corroborate any of the information provided by Stagl.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b612 This Court has previously considered the reliability of a citizen informant\u2019s report when that report is based, in part, on observations made by someone other than the citizen informant. In <em>Clawson, </em>we addressed the second <em>Pratt </em>factor and determined not only that the citizen informant \u201csaw and heard the unprovoked and belligerent confrontation that Clawson initiated with her husband a short distance [away],\u201d but that \u201cshe heard her husband\u2019s contemporaneous conclusion that Clawson was intoxicated, based upon his face-to-face interaction with Clawson.\u201d <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13. We noted that the citizen informant \u201cobserved and relayed details about Clawson\u2019s appearance, his vehicle type, make, color, and license.\u201d <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13. Further, \u201cshe observed and relayed Clawson\u2019s direction of travel when he left,\u201d which was corroborated by law enforcement when they located Clawson in the area indicated by the citizen informant. <em>Clawson, </em>\u00b6 13. Here, as in <em>Clawson, </em>Stagl heard first-hand her coworker\u2019s conclusion that Zietlow was intoxicated, stumbling around, and smelled like alcohol. Stagl\u2019s own personal observations were that Zietlow was \u201cbugging other customers\u201d who were \u201cjust kind of watching him.\u201d She provided a detailed description of his vehicle and plates; gave a detailed physical description of Zietlow; and identified his direction of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b613 We have rejected a rigid and mechanical approach to assessing the information offered as justification for an investigatory stop and instead have held that whether or not particularized suspicion exists is \u201cfactually driven and depends on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 168, 951 P.2d at 44. Although some of the information Stagl imparted to dispatch was relayed to her by a coworker, Stagl also provided her own personal observations which supported a finding that Stagl\u2019s information was reliable. Stagl called 911 because, in addition to the contemporaneous observations relayed to her by a coworker, Stagl observed unusual behavior which supported a conclusion that Zietlow might be intoxicated and was preparing to operate a motor vehicle. We reject the proposition that law enforcement must be constrained in their investigation of a suspected DUI on the basis that only Weavers\u2019 report to dispatch is sufficient to trigger an investigatory stop. Zietlow\u2019s intoxicated behavior, which was sufficiently alarming to both Stagl and Weavers to compel them to report to law enforcement, does not necessitate <em>separate </em>calls by each to law enforcement. The circumstances clearly establish the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was occurring as Stagl was talking to dispatch and that Stagl was relating what Weavers was contemporaneously reporting and observing. We conclude that the report contained sufficient personal observations from Stagl and Weaver, as reported by Stagl, to satisfy the second <em>Pratt </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b614 When addressing the third <em>Pratt </em>factor, corroboration of the informant\u2019s tip by law enforcement, we have held it sufficient that \u201c[a]n officer corroborates an informant\u2019s report by observing illegal activity <em>or </em>by finding \u2018the person, vehicle, and the vehicle\u2019s location substantially as described by the informant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 165, 951 P.2d at 43 (emphasis in original)). We also stated in <em>Pratt </em>that if the first and second factors are met, an officer may corroborate a citizen informant\u2019s tip \u201ceven though the officer did not observe any illegal or impaired driving on Pratt\u2019s part before the investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Pratt, </em>286 Mont. at 168, 951 P.2d at 44. Here, both the first and second <em>Pratt </em>factors have been met; thus, it was only necessary that Trooper Novak corroborate Stagl\u2019s report by observing some of the details Stagl relayed, regardless of whether the corroboration was of innocent behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u00b615 Trooper Novak relied on Stagl\u2019s description of both the vehicle and the temporary tag number to find the address associated with the vehicle, which was not far from the Town Pump. Knowing that he could not make it to the Town Pump until well after Zietlow had left, Trooper Novak proceeded straight to the address. He arrived there in 12 minutes and, upon observing the vehicle was not at the address, turned around and headed back towards the Town Pump. Almost instantly, Trooper Novak observed a vehicle matching Stagl\u2019s description pull into the residence associated with the license plate. Trooper Novak corroborated the clothes Zietlow was wearing, Zietlow\u2019s physical description, and observed Zietlow in control of the vehicle matching the description and plate number relayed by Stagl.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b616 Zietlow appears to argue that Trooper Novak was unable to corroborate Zietlow\u2019s route of travel as being the same as that relayed by Stagl, particularly since he was found more than 6 miles from the Bonner Town Pump. In <em>State v. Peters, </em>2011 MT 274, 362 Mont. 389, 264 P.3d 1124, however, we found the third Pratt factor satisfied where police found an alleged drunk driver\u2019s truck parked in his own driveway after a concerned citizen reported him and provided his license plate number. <em>Peters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 60. The law enforcement officer in <em>Peters </em>went to the business where the citizen informant reported she had last seen Peters. Not finding Peters at that location, the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>then proceeded to the address associated with the license plate number given by the citizen informant. At the address, the officer found a vehicle with the license plate number matching the description given by the citizen informant and located Peters inside his home. We held the corroboration of these innocent details sufficient to satisfy the third <em>Pratt </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"ak-dedup-0\">\u00b617  Based on the totality of the circumstance, we conclude that Stagl\u2019s report satisfied the <em>Pratt </em>factors and that it was sufficiently reliable to provide Trooper Novak with particularized suspicion to stop Zietlow\u2019s vehicle. We affirm the District court\u2019s denial of Zietlow\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICE SANDEFUR, SHEA and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
