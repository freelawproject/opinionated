The jury acquitted Stutzman of a separate charge against K.W., R.W.\u2019s twin sister. The court later denied Stutzman\u2019s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>1. Whether the prosecutor violated Stutzman\u2019s right to a fair trial by telling the jury in closing argument that, in order to find Stutzman not guilty, it would have to conclude that R.W. andK.W. had lied during their testimony;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\n<em>2.

Whether the District Court erred in not disclosing to the defense information from the medical and counseling records that it reviewed in camera.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">\u00b64 Stutzman began living with Angela, R.W., and K.W. in May 2013. Shortly after he moved in with them, R.W. and K.W. both disclosed to their mother and their school counselor, Tara Sylvester, that Stutzman had inappropriately touched them. The police arrested Stutzman, and the State charged him with felony sexual assault against R.W. and felony sexual intercourse without consent against K.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">\u00b65 R.W. testified at trial that Stutzman had touched her inappropriately on two occasions. The first incident occurred while R.W. was sitting on Stutzman\u2019s lap at home. She stated that Stutzman touched her \u201cin the wrong places,\u201d which she described as her \u201cprivate areas.\u201d R.W. told her mother that Stutzman had touched the inside of her thigh, which made her feel \u201cweird.\u201d Angela addressed the matter with Stutzman, who was apologetic but denied that anything inappropriate occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u00b66 The second incident occurred in a tent in the family\u2019s backyard over Memorial Day weekend. R.W. had invited several friends for a sleepover, and Stutzman volunteered to sleep in the tent with the children to supervise them. R.W. claimed that during the night Stutzman \u201cput his hands in [her] pants and started rubbing [her] in the wrong place.\u201d She explained that Stutzman had touched her \u201cprivate area,\u201d her \u201ccover-up area,\u201d or where she goes \u201cpee.\u201d K.W. testified that, sometime during the same weekend, Stutzman had penetrated her vagina with his finger while she was sleeping. K. W. told R.W. the next morning what happened, and R.W. said they needed to tell their mom.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b67 After R.W. and K.W. told their mother about these incidents, Angela kicked Stutzman out of the house. The children then spoke with Sylvester. Sylvester testified at trial that the children had received counseling services prior to the May 2013 incidents because they met the criteria for being \u201cseriously emotionally disturbed.\u201d R.W. suffered from \u201cADHD and oppositional defiant behaviors,\u201d and K.W. suffered from \u201cADHD and anxiety disorder.\u201d Based on her discussions with the children, Sylvester believed that Stutzman had sexually abused them, and she contacted the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">\u00b68 Shortly before trial, Stutzman sought a continuance in order to obtain additional medical and counseling records concerning the girls. The court conducted an in camera review of the children\u2019s medical records from the Billings Clinic and of their counseling records from Altacare, Sylvester\u2019s employer. The court concluded that the records contained no exculpatory evidence of Stutzman\u2019s behavior. It declined to disclose any of the records, and trial proceeded as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b69 Stutzman\u2019s theory at trial was that R.W. and K.W. had fabricated their allegations in order to get him out of the house. During closing argument, defense counsel referred to Angela\u2019s testimony, stating, \u201c Tf we get him out of here, we\u2019re golden,\u2019 that\u2019s what mom said. Those words just jump out at you, because they provide a motive for these girls to tell the stories that they did.\u201d He suggested that the girls did not understand the repercussions of their alleged lies about Stutzman, stating that \u201cpart of the understanding whether or not they have to tell the truth is an understanding of what happens if they don\u2019t. They know that they\u2019ll get in trouble, but do they know the consequences of what could happen to this person, to Mike? Do they truly understand that?\u201d In the State\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor said, \u201cA not guilty verdict means you don\u2019t believe [K.W.] and [R.W.]. It means you think they\u2019re lying.\u201d Stutzman objected, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s not what that means.\u201d The court replied, \u201cIt\u2019s closing argument.\u201d The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>continued her argument without further comment on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b610 The court instructed the jury that it must unanimously \u201cagree that the defendant is either guilty or not guilty in order to reach a verdict.\u201d It provided a definition of sexual assault and listed the elements of sexual assault that the State was required to prove. It did not instruct, however, that the jury had to agree unanimously on at least one specific criminal act that Stutzman had committed in order to convict him of sexual assault. Stutzman neither objected to the court\u2019s instructions nor offered a specific unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b611 The jury found Stutzman not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent against K.W. and found him guilty of sexual assault against R.W. Stutzman moved for a new trial on the sexual assault conviction, arguing that the State\u2019s comment during its rebuttal closing argument was so improper and prejudicial that it violated his constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b612 The court denied Stutzman\u2019s motion for a new trial. It reasoned, \u201cOnce defense counsel argued that the victims had a motive to lie and did not understand the repercussions of their alleged lies, rebuttal by the State was not prejudicial in the comments of the prosecutor. No error attaches when the prosecutor\u2019s actions are provoked by defense counsel.\u201d The court reasoned that Stutzman provoked this comment by referencing the motive of the victims to lie\u2014to get Stutzman out of the house. The court sentenced Stutzman to twenty-five years in prison with twenty years suspended and required that he be designated as a Level 2 Sexual Offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b613 We generally review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Morse, </em>2015 MT 51, \u00b6 18, 378 Mont. 249, 343 P.3d 1196. We likewise review a district court\u2019s decision regarding jury instructions for an abuse of discretion, so long as the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>State v. Dobrowski, </em>2016 MT 261, \u00b6 6, 385 Mont. 179, 382 P.3d 490. When a defendant raises the plain error doctrine to request our review of issues that the defendant did not raise before the district court, our review is discretionary. <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224. We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of discovery for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Duffy, </em>2000 MT 186, \u00b6 18, 300 Mont. 381, 6 P.3d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b614 1. <em>Whether the prosecutor violated Stutzman\u2019s right to a fair trial by telling the jury in closing argument that, in order to find Stutzman not guilty, it would have to conclude that R.W. and K.W. had lied during their testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b615 Stutzman asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s argument \u201cdiluted the presumption of innocence and shifted the burden of proof\u2019 to him. He argues that it constituted prosecutorial misconduct and that it was highly prejudicial, entitling him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b616 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants the right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 27, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091. To determine whether a defendant is entitled to a new trial by reason of prosecutorial misconduct, we consider \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper\u201d and whether they \u201cprejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Pierce, </em>2016 MT 308, \u00b6 24, 385 Mont. 439, 384 P.3d 1042 (citing <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 25, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b617 The burden is on the defendant to show that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments prejudiced his right to a fair trial. <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 25. In determining whether prejudice occurred, we view the improper comments \u201cin the context of the case in its entirety.\u201d <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 25. \u201cWe evaluate a prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument in the context of the argument as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Walton, </em>2014 MT 41, \u00b6 13, 374 Mont. 38, 318 P.3d 1024; <em>accord State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 68, 305 Mont. 123, 23 P.3d 216 (holding that a prosecutor\u2019s improper comments were not prejudicial \u201cin light of all the surrounding circumstances, including the context in which the remarks were made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u00b618 Stutzman argued in closing that R.W. and K.W. fabricated the allegations against him as a way to get him out of their home, and he questioned the children\u2019s ability to understand the repercussions of lying. The prosecutor began her rebuttal argument by discussing reasonable doubt and the State\u2019s burden of proof. She proceeded to discuss the evidence, responding to defense counsel\u2019s arguments. She then stated that a not guilty verdict would require the jury to believe that R.W. and K.W. were lying. After Stutzman objected, she did not discuss this contention further. Instead, the prosecutor reviewed the evidence and questioned how it would support Stutzman\u2019s assertion that K.W. and R.W. had a motive to lie, pointing to specific evidence that suggested the girls did not lie on the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"Acg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u00b619  Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Stutzman has failed to \u201cdemonstrate, from the record,\u201d that even if improper, the prosecution\u2019s isolated remark prejudiced him. <em>State v. Sanchez, </em>2008 MT 27, \u00b6 55, 341 Mont. 240, 177 P.3d 444. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and rebuttal argument centered on the evidence presented at trial and how it proved Stutzman\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor made the comment about the girls\u2019 lying in rebuttal, after Stutzman suggested that R.W. and K.W. had fabricated their allegations. Viewing the prosecution\u2019s comment \u201cin light of all the surrounding circumstances, including the context in which the remarks were made,\u201d <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 68, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stutzman\u2019s motion for a new trial on this ground. Stutzman has not met his burden of showing that the prosecutor\u2019s statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 25. We therefore do not address whether the comments were improper on their face. <em>See Pierce, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b620 2. <em>Whether the District Court committed plain error when it failed to give a specific unanimity instruction to the jury on the sexual assault charge after R.W. testified to two alleged sexual assaults.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b621 Stutzman argues that the District Court erred when it failed to instruct the jury that it must agree unanimously that Stutzman committed a specific underlying criminal act in order to convict him of sexual assault. He contends that the State presented two separate incidents in which Stutzman allegedly sexually assaulted R.W.\u2014one that occurred while she was sitting on his lap, and another that occurred during the backyard campout. Stutzman contends that although the jury unanimously found him guilty of sexual assault against R.W., the jurors might not have unanimously concluded that the State proved at least one of the two particular acts. This, in Stutzman\u2019s view, creates uncertainty about the unanimity of the jury\u2019s verdict and warrants a new trial. Stutzman argues that we should review the court\u2019s failure to give a specific unanimity instruction for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">\u00b622 A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict. <em>State v. Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 129, 130 P.3d 169. Unanimity \u201crequires substantial agreement as to the principal factual elements underlying a specific offense.\u201d <em>Vernes, </em>\u00b6 21. When the State charges multiple criminal acts within one count, and when \u201ca genuine possibility exists that different jurors will conclude a defendant committed disparate illegal acts subsumed under the single count,\u201d the court must provide a specific unanimity instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>directing the jurors \u201cto reach a unanimous verdict on at least one specific criminal act before finding guilt for the multiple-act count.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 12, 306 Mont. 525, 36 P.3d 372, <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Robinson v. State, </em>2010 MT 108, \u00b6 12 n.1, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b623 Because Stutzman did not object to the court\u2019s jury instructions or offer a specific unanimity instruction on the sexual assault charge, he did not preserve that issue for appeal. We generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Favel, </em>2015 MT 336, \u00b6 13, 381 Mont. 472, 362 P.3d 1126. We may, however, \u201cchoose to invoke the common law plain error doctrine where failing to review the claimed error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 13. We invoke plain error review \u201csparingly, on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Favel, </em>\u00b6 23. When the circumstances of a case do not warrant application of the plain error doctrine, we need not address the merits of the alleged error. <em>See State v. Lawrence, </em>2016 MT 346, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 386 Mont. 86, 385 P.3d 968; <em>State v. Thorp, </em>2010 MT 92, \u00b6 25, 356 Mont. 150, 231 P.3d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\u00b624 Trial on the charge that Stutzman sexually assaulted R.W. focused on the incident that allegedly occurred in the tent. In both its opening and closing statements, the defense referred only to the incident in the tent\u2014not the touching alleged to have occurred while R.W. sat on Stutzman\u2019s lap\u2014as the basis for the sexual assault charge. In the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated, \u201c[R.W.] told you, \u2018He stuck his hands in my pants and he rubbed my private\u2019 ... She called it her cover-up area.\u201d It later stated, \u201c[Stutzman] waited until [R.W.] was asleep, and then he stuck his hands down her pants.\u201d These were clear references to the incident in the tent. The prosecutor framed the incident on Stutzman\u2019s lap\u2014in which R.W. alleged that he inappropriately touched her over her clothes\u2014as an opportunity to test the potential consequences of his actions. When R.W. told her mom about this incident, Stutzman claimed it was an accident. The prosecutor argued that, after Stutzman did not face any consequences for this action, he \u201cprogressed\u201d to inappropriately touching R.W. underneath her clothes in the tent. The prosecutor\u2019s comments about the incident on Stutzman\u2019s lap were directed toward her argument that his behavior escalated to ultimately assaulting R.W. in the tent.</p>\n<p id=\"AZf\">\u00b625  The record therefore demonstrates that the parties considered the tent as the basis for the sexual assault charge. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to offer a specific unanimity instruction undoubtedly reflects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>this understanding. The court did not plainly err when it did not <em>sua sponte </em>give a specific unanimity instruction in light of the parties\u2019 presentation of the case. The circumstances of this case thus do not warrant application of the plain error doctrine. <em>See Lawrence, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12; <em>Thorpe, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b626 3. <em>Whether the District Court erred in not disclosing to the defense information from the medical and counseling records that it reviewed in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b627 After the District Court conducted an in camera review of the sealed documents from the Billings Clinic and Altacare, it disclosed none of the documents to counsel for the parties. Stutzman argues that this Court must review the records to ensure that the District Court did not err in refusing to disclose these documents to the defense. If the documents contain \u201cfavorable and material information\u201d that the court failed to disclose, Stutzman argues that he should receive a new trial. He argues that any information that could weaken R.W.\u2019s, Angela\u2019s, or Sylvester\u2019s credibility as witnesses or any medical documents that could support Stutzman\u2019s defense that he did not sexually assault R.W. would constitute \u201cfavorable and material information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b628 A defendant has a right to discover exculpatory evidence. <em>Duffy, </em>\u00b6 19. Exculpatory evidence includes that which is favorable to the accused and material either to guilt or to punishment. <em>State v. Colvin, </em>2016 MT 129, \u00b6 12, 383 Mont. 474, 372 P.3d 471; <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646. We do not focus our inquiry \u201con whether the evidence is admissible or inadmissible, but rather whether the evidence is favorable to the defense and could have affected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>State v. Weisbarth, </em>2016 MT 214, \u00b6 24, 384 Mont. 424, 378 P.3d 1195. \u201cFavorable\u201d evidence includes evidence that has the \u201cpotential to lead directly to admissible exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Weisbarth, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b629 When a defendant requests a crime victim\u2019s confidential records, the district court has a \u201cduty to conduct an in camera review to ascertain whether there [is] any exculpatory evidence in the files.\u201d <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2014 MT 329, \u00b6 9, 377 Mont. 291, 339 P.3d 829. If the trial court finds records that constitute potentially exculpatory evidence, \u201cthe district court must balance the defendant\u2019s need for exculpatory evidence against the privacy interest of the victim.\u201d <em>Duffy, </em>\u00b6 21. \u201cIf confidential information is not exculpatory or necessary for the preparation of the defense, defense counsel\u2019s right to review the information is outweighed by the victim\u2019s right to confidentiality.\u201d <em>Duffy, </em>\u00b6 21. Ultimately, to mandate reversal of the conviction, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>defendant \u201cmust prove \u2018that there is a reasonable probability that had the information been provided, the result would have been different or[,] stated another way, is it a \u201cverdict worthy of confidence\u201d?\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 47, 301 Mont. 289, 8 P.3d 801 (quoting <em>Kills on Top v. State, </em>273 Mont. 32, 42, 901 P.2d 1368, 1374 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"AYMN\">\u00b630 We have conducted a complete review of the Billings Clinic and Altacare records that the District Court reviewed in camera. The Billings Clinic records contain medical documents for R.W. and K.W. and include reports from two forensic examinations conducted on June 12, 2013. Both reports were included in R.W.\u2019s medical file and both are identified as a report of her examination. The first report describes an \u201c[albnormal vaginal exam ... compatible with blunt force trauma.\u201d The second report describes a \u201cIn lorrnal vaginal examination\u201d which \u201cneither denies nor confirms sexual abuse.\u201d The reports make it apparent\u2014particularly from the patients\u2019 descriptions of the alleged incidents of sexual assault\u2014that the report of the abnormal examination pertains to R.W. and that the report of the normal examination pertains to K.W. Nonetheless, due to the fact that both reports were in R.W.\u2019s file and under her name, the District Court should have disclosed these records to the defense. One of the reports was potentially exculpatory, and disclosure would have afforded Stutzman the opportunity to question the examining physician and to clarify the discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b631 Yet even if Stutzman had been able to use the reports at trial to argue that the report describing a \u201cInlorrnal vaginal examination\u201d pertained to R.W., the absence of physical evidence of penetration \u201cneither denies nor confirms sexual abuse,\u201d as noted in the report. <em>See State v. McAlister, </em>2016 MT 14, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 13, 382 Mont. 129, 365 P.3d 1062 (holding that the evidence to convict the Defendant of sexual intercourse without consent was sufficient despite medical examination results showing no physical evidence of penetration). Taken together, particularly in light of the abnormal findings on the report that correlates most likely with R.W., we are unable to conclude that the reports contained exculpatory information material to Stutzman\u2019s guilt or innocence. Instead, we conclude that their disclosure would not have \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Weisbarth, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b632 The Altacare documents include notes and evaluations from counselors, including Sylvester, regarding R.W.\u2019s and K.W.\u2019s mental and behavioral health. Some of these documents describe R.W.\u2019s recounting of Stutzman\u2019s sexual assault in the tent. Another document\u2014a \u201cPsycho Educational Group Note\u201d completed by two counselors, apparently including Sylvester\u2014states that R.W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cappeared to not be too fond of her mom\u2019s new boyfriend,\u201d a probable reference to Stutzman.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b633 Assuming that one or more of the Altacare notes may have had relevance and potential utility to the defense, we are confident that disclosure would not have \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Weisbarth, </em>\u00b6 24. R.W. testified that Stutzman sexually assaulted her in the tent. R.W. told her mother about the incident, her mother kicked Stutzman out of the house as a result, R.W. spoke with Sylvester about the incident shortly thereafter, and R.W. seemed, in Sylvester\u2019s words, \u201cjust not herself, very quiet, withdrawn.\u201d Angela stated during cross-examination that, upon R.W. and K.W. telling her about Stutzman\u2019s alleged abuse, she initially thought they \u201cmight have made this up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAzE\">\u00b634 The Altacare documents containing R.W.\u2019s descriptions of the incident in the tent, while relevant to the issue at trial, only verify R.W.\u2019s testimony. As such, they would not have constituted \u201cfavorable\u201d evidence for Stutzman and were therefore not exculpatory. <em>Weisbarth, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b635 The Psycho Educational Group Note stating that R.W. was not \u201ctoo fond\u201d of Stutzman constitutes potentially favorable evidence for the defense, and it too should have been disclosed. Stutzman could have used this note to cross-examine R.W. on her sentiments toward him. The District Court abused its discretion by failing to produce this document. <em>Duffy, </em>\u00b6 18. But again we conclude that the error is not ground for reversal because it would not have affected the outcome of the case. Stutzman had ample opportunities to probe this topic at trial. Defense counsel solicited testimony from Angela that she initially believed her children might have fabricated the allegations against Stutzman, and the defense argued in closing that the children made up the allegations in order to get Stutzman out of the house. That R.W. was not \u201ctoo fond\u201d of Stutzman would not have substantially strengthened the evidence Stutzman used to argue about R.W.\u2019s motive to lie. This single comment to her counselors did not prove fabrication or show that R.W. was hostile or vindictive. On the strength of the record as a whole, disclosure of the Altacare documents would not have \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Weisbarth, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"AZX\">\u00b636  The verdict against Stutzman is a \u201cverdict worthy of confidence,\u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 47, and the District Court\u2019s failure to disclose these records does not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b637 The prosecution\u2019s statement to the jury during its rebuttal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>argument did not violate Stutzman\u2019s right to a fair trial. The District Court did not err in failing to give a specific unanimity instruction on the sexual assault charge absent a request by the defense. Finally, the District Court\u2019s refusal to disclose medical records from the Billings Clinic or counseling records from Altacare did not deprive Stutzman of a fair trial.
