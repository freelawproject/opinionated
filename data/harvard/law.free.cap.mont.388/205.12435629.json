The First Judicial District Court invalidated the rule. We affirmed. <em>Clark Fork Coalition v. Tubbs, </em>2016 MT 229, 384 Mont. 503, 380 P.3d 771 (hereafter <em>\u201cClark Fork </em>I\u201d). The Coalition sought fees under the private attorney general doctrine, and the District Court granted its motion. The Department appeals the District Court\u2019s order awarding fees to the Coalition.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u00b62 We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">\u00b63 The Montana Water Use Act (hereafter \u201cthe Act\u201d) exempts certain new groundwater appropriations from permitting requirements. Section 85-2-306, MCA. In part, it exempts appropriations outside of stream depletion zones that do not exceed 35 gallons per minute and 10 acre-feet per year, \u201cexcept that a <em>combined appropriation </em>from the same source by two or more wells or developed springs exceeding 10 acre-feet, regardless of the flow rate, requires a permit.\u201d Section 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA (emphasis added). The statute does not define the phrase \u201ccombined appropriation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">\u00b64 The Department promulgated a rule in 1987 that stated, \u201cGroundwater developments need notbe physically connected nor have a common distribution system to be considered a \u2018combined appropriation.\u2019 \u201d Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(7) (1987) (hereafter \u201c1987 Rule\u201d). The Department issued a new rule in 1993 that defined a \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d as \u201can appropriation of water from the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>source aquifer by two or more groundwater developments, that are physically manifold into the same system.\u201d Admin. R. M. 36.12.101(13) (1993) (hereafter \u201c1993 Rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b65 In 2009, the Coalition filed a petition for declaratory ruling with the Department asking it to invalidate the 1993 Rule. A Department hearing examiner considered, but ultimately denied, the Coalition\u2019s petition, concluding that the 1993 Rule did not conflict with the Act. The hearing examiner nonetheless ordered the Department to initiate proposed rulemaking to repeal the 1993 Rule because of increasing demands on water resources in Montana. For reasons not relevant to the issue on appeal, the Department did not repeal and replace the 1993 Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b66 The Coalition filed a petition for judicial review in the District Court in 2010, challenging the validity of the 1993 Rule and the hearing examiner\u2019s denial of its petition. The District Court invalidated the 1993 Rule, reinstated the 1987 Rule, and required the Department to develop a new rule consistent with its order. The court reasoned that the 1993 Rule\u2019s definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d \u201cviolates not only the spirit and legislative intent behind the Water Use Act, but... [also] the legislative intent in the enactment of the exempt well statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b67 The Montana Well Drillers Association, the Montana Association of Realtors, and the Montana Building Industry Association appealed the District Court\u2019s order. The Department did not participate in the appeal. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s invalidation of the 1993 Rule and its reinstatement of the 1987 Rule, but reversed its order directing the Department to initiate new rulemaking. <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 46. We held that the Rule was inconsistent with the statute and was therefore invalid. <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b68 Prior to our decision in <em>Clark Fork I, </em>the Coalition had moved for fees under the private attorney general doctrine, and the District Court had granted that motion. The court rejected the Department\u2019s argument that it was protected from liability by quasi-judicial immunity, because it held that the issue in the litigation\u2014the Department\u2019s promulgation of the 1993 Rule\u2014was not a quasi-judicial function. The court concluded that the private attorney general doctrine applied, reasoning that the litigation between the parties directly implicated constitutional interests. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnRP\">the constitution mandates that the legislature keep track of water rights. The legislature passed the Water Use Act to breath[e] life into that mandate. However, [the Departmentl\u2019s rule conflicted with the statute which codifies the protections guaranteed in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>constitution. While decided on statutory grounds, this Court\u2019s Order [on the Coalition\u2019s petition for judicial review] is explicit in integrating the constitutional rationale underlying the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtL\">The court concluded that the Coalition \u201cqualifies for attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine because it bore a significant and necessary burden to vindicate all Montanans\u2019 constitutional water rights in a suit against the party which created the invalid rule.\u201d The parties then stipulated to attorney fees in the amount of $100,000, but agreed that the Department would not pay the fees or appeal the District Court\u2019s order on fees until this Court resolved the appeal in <em>Clark Fork I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b69 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s ruling granting or denying attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine. <em>Gateway Vill., LLC v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2015 MT 285, \u00b6 15, 381 Mont. 206, 357 P.3d 917; <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship v. Att\u2019y Gen. of Mont., </em>2012 MT 271, \u00b6 7, 367 Mont. 112, 291 P.3d 545; <em>Baxter v. State, </em>2009 MT 449, \u00b6 46, 354 Mont. 234, 224 P.3d 1211. A district court\u2019s determination whether legal authority exists for an award of attorney fees is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Mlekush v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2015 MT 302, \u00b6 8, 381 Mont. 292, 358 P.3d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the Coalition was entitled to recover attorney fees following its successful challenge to the Department\u2019s 1993 Rule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\u00b611 The Department argues that the District Court abused its discretion in granting the Coalition\u2019s motion for attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine. It contends that the private attorney general doctrine does not apply, in part because the Coalition did not vindicate important constitutional interests. The Department contends also that the quasi-judicial immunity doctrine protects it from liability for attorney fees because the Coalition\u2019s challenge was based on the hearing examiner\u2019s discretionary decision to deny the Coalition\u2019s petition\u2014a quasi-judicial act.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\u00b612 The Coalition argues that the District Court rightly determined that the private attorney general doctrine applied to its successful challenge of the Department\u2019s rule. The Coalition asserts that its litigation vindicated constitutional interests articulated in Article IX, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution, which provides for the protection of existing water rights and water resources and requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the Legislature to regulate and administer water rights in the state. The Coalition argues further that the quasi-judicial immunity doctrine does not shield the Department from liability because the litigation concerned the Department\u2019s promulgation of the 1993 Rule\u2014an administrative act\u2014and not the quasi-judicial act of the hearing examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b613 An administrative agency may promulgate rules only within the bounds set by the Legislature. <em>See Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 25 (stating that \u201cIrlule.s adopted by administrative agencies which conflict with statutory requirements or exceed authority provided by statute[ ] are invalid\u201d (citation and internal quotations omitted)). Agency rules must be \u201cconsistent and not in conflict with the statute\u201d and must be \u201creasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting \u00a7 2-4-305(6), MCA). We determined in <em>Clark Fork I </em>that the Department\u2019s 1993 Rule conflicted with the Act and was thus invalid. <em>Clark Fork </em>I, \u00b6 28. The District Court agreed with the Coalition that its success in the litigation justified an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b614 Montana follows the American Rule, under which \u201c \u2018a party in a civil action is generally not entitled to [attorney] fees absent a specific contractual or statutory provision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conservation Dist., </em>2011 MT 51, \u00b6 20, 359 Mont. 393, 251 P.3d 131 (hereafter <em>\u201cBRPA IIP) </em>(quoting <em>Montanans for the Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Comm\u2019rs, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 62, 296 Mont. 402, 989 P.2d 800 (hereafter <em>\u201cMontrust\u201d)). </em>There are limited \u201cequitable exceptions\u201d to this rule. <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 64. Among them is the private attorney general doctrine. <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 20. \u201cThat doctrine applies when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests which are significant to its citizens.\u201d <em>Gateway Vill., LLC, </em>\u00b6 12 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A89\">\u00b615 When determining whether to award fees under the private attorney general doctrine, we consider: \u201c(1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, [and] (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.\u201d <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 66; <em>accord BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 14. \u201cWe also consider whether an award of fees would be unjust under the circumstances.\u201d <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 14 <em>(citing Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath, </em>2003 MT 48, \u00b6 33, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576); <em>accord BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 20. We have held that fees under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>private attorney general doctrine may be awarded \u201conly in litigation vindicating constitutional interests.\u201d <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y v. State, </em>2004 MT 376, \u00b6 21, 325 Mont. 70, 103 P.3d 1085 (citing <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 66). We have invoked the private attorney general doctrine sparingly. <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b616 Decisions awarding fees under the private attorney general doctrine illustrate its narrow application. In <em>Montrust, </em>we addressed the validity of several statutory provisions concerning the administration and disposition of school trust lands that the federal government granted to the state. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1-9. We noted that the Montana Constitution required the State to act as trustee of the lands. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14. The Constitution provided guidelines for the State\u2019s disposition of these lands and required, among other things, that the State obtain \u201cthe full market value\u201d of any of the lands of which it chose to dispose. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. We held that a number of the challenged statutory provisions permitted the State to violate its fiduciary duties as trustee of the lands and to dispose of the lands for less than their full market value, in violation of the Constitution. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 23, 32, 42, 51, 58. We concluded that Montrust had \u201clitigated important public policies that are grounded in Montana\u2019s Constitution,\u201d that the State had not disputed the necessity of private enforcement or Montrust\u2019s resultant burden, and that Montrust\u2019s litigation had benefitted \u201ca large class: all Montana citizens interested in Montana\u2019s public schools.\u201d <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 67. We therefore held that Montrust was entitled to fees under the private attorney general doctrine. <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\u00b617 In <em>BRPA III, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of private attorney general fees. We based our holding on the constitutional underpinnings of our decision in the underlying litigation, <em>Bitterroot River Protective Ass\u2019n v. Bitterroot Conservation District, </em>2008 MT 377, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219 (hereafter <em>\u201cBRPA IF). </em>In <em>BRPA II, </em>the plaintiff and appellant had challenged the validity of two statutes: the Natural Streambed and Land Preservation Act of 1975 (the \u201c310 Law\u201d) and the Stream Access Law. <em>BRPA II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 1-4. We noted in that case that the 310 Law was \u201cone of a comprehensive set of laws enacted by the Legislature to accomplish the goals of the constitution, including Article IX, section 1, which requires legislative provision of remedies to prevent depletion and degradation of natural resources.\u201d <em>BRPA II, </em>\u00b6 28 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We noted also that the Stream Access Law had its origins in Article IX, Section 3(3) of the Montana Constitution, which provides that waters within the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201care the property of the state for the use of its people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law.\u201d <em>BRPA II, </em>\u00b6 51 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b618 We noted in <em>BRPA III </em>that our interpretation of the 310 Law in the prior case \u201cwas expressly premised upon its constitutional purpose.\u201d <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>BRPA II, </em>\u00b6 45). We explained that both parties in the litigation in <em>BRPA II </em>had proffered \u201cextensive constitutionally-based arguments\u201d regarding the application of the Stream Access Law. <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>BRPA II, </em>\u00b6 50). We held therefore that \u201cconstitutional concerns were integrated into the rationale underlying the decision\u201d in <em>BRPA II </em>and that the two statutes at issue \u201cdirectly implemented constitutional provisions.\u201d <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23, 25. This satisfied \u201cthe requirement [under the private attorney general doctrine] that constitutional interests be vindicated to demonstrate the societal importance of the litigation.\u201d <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 26 (citing <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 66).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b619 In contrast, we have denied private attorney general fees when the litigation, though successful, did not vindicate a constitutional interest. In <em>Baxter, </em>we addressed whether physicians who aided patients in dying were protected from prosecution for homicide. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 3. We explicitly declined to address the physicians\u2019 constitutional arguments. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 10. Instead, we concluded that Montana statutes protect physicians from prosecution so long as they obtain the patients\u2019 consent. <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 50. We held that \u201c[o]ur holding today is statute-based. Therefore, without the vindication of constitutional interests, an award of fees under the private attorney general doctrine is not warranted.\u201d <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b620 Likewise, in <em>American Cancer Society, </em>we concluded that the successful party in the litigation was not entitled to private attorney general fees. The petitioners in that case challenged the constitutionality of a recently-enacted law exempting certain establishments from local government smoking ordinances. <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 7. The petitioners argued in part that the statute \u201cunconstitutionally deprives local governments and the people of the right of self-government in violation of Article XI, Section 6, of the Constitution of Montana.\u201d <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 3. We held that the challenged statute \u201cdoes not set forth a prohibition of self-governing powers,\u201d that it \u201cdoes not preempt any no-smoking ordinances adopted by any self-governing entity,\u201d and that it thus \u201chas no force and effect.\u201d <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 18. We concluded that our holding \u201camounts to a declaration that [the statute] is ineffectual rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>unconstitutional; therefore, without the vindication of a constitutional interest, this case does not warrant private attorney general fees.\u201d <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b621 In <em>Clark Fork I, </em>we addressed whether the Department\u2019s 1993 exempt well rule was consistent with the authorizing statute. <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 28. We conducted a statutory analysis of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA, and concluded, <em>\u201cbased upon the plain language of the statute and the stated purpose of the Act,\u201d </em>that \u201c \u2018combined appropriation\u2019 refers to the total amount or maximum quantity of water that may be appropriated without a permit and not to the manner in which wells or developed springs may be physically connected.\u201d <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis added). We held that the 1993 Rule\u2019s definition of \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d was \u201cinconsistent with the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA,\u201d and with the \u201cstated statutory purpose of the Act\u201d because \u201cit engrafted an additional requirement on the exempt well statute that wells or developed springs be \u2018physically manifold into the same system.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 28. We determined also that \u201c[t]he term \u2018combined appropriation\u2019 utilized in the original 1987 statute has remained intact and unchanged in the subsequent statutory amendments of 1991 and 2013.\u201d <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 33. We thus held, \u201cThe 1993 Rule is invalid because it conflicts with the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306, MCA, and because the Legislature, as is its prerogative, has not abrogated the original meaning it placed on \u2018combined appropriation\u2019 since the IL legislature first incorporated the term in 1987.\u201d <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b622 This case differs in a material respect from <em>BRPA III, </em>where \u201cconstitutional concerns were integrated into the rationale underlying the decision.\u201d <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 25. The issue addressed in <em>Clark Fork I </em>was purely an issue of statutory interpretation\u2014whether the Department\u2019s 1993 Rule conflicted with \u00a7 85-2-306(3)(a)(iii), MCA. <em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 35. The case did not address whether the 1993 Rule implicated or conflicted with any constitutional provisions. There were no constitutional concerns \u201cintegrated into the rationale,\u201d <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 25, and the Coalition did not litigate \u201cimportant public policies... grounded in Montana\u2019s Constitution,\u201d <em>Montrust, </em>\u00b6 67. Although the Act itself implements the mandates of Article IX, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution, the Department\u2019s rule is a step removed. The litigation did not \u201cdirectly implement) ] constitutional provisions,\u201d but centered only on construction of the Act. <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 23. Under the Coalition\u2019s argument, because water rights are an important constitutional interest, virtually any case challenging the Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>administration of the Act could subject the agency to a potential fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"A7A\">\u00b623  Because the decision in the underlying case was \u201cstatute-based,\u201d <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 47, the Coalition is not entitled to fees under the private attorney general doctrine, <em>Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 14. We do not address whether the Coalition satisfied the remaining factors of this doctrine, because its failure to show that the litigation vindicated constitutional interests is dispositive. <em>See Am. Cancer Soc\u2019y, </em>\u00b6 21; <em>Baxter, </em>\u00b6 47. The District Court abused its discretion in concluding that the Coalition could recover fees under the private attorney general doctrine. Because we reverse on this ground alone, we need not address the Department\u2019s argument on quasi-judicial immunity. <em>See Sikorski v. Johnson, </em>2006 MT 228, \u00b6 26, 333 Mont. 434, 143 P.3d 161 (holding that the State was not liable because it had no duty, and concluding that it was therefore unnecessary to reach the State\u2019s quasi-judicial immunity argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s order granting the Coalition\u2019s motion for attorney fees is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b237-9\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"A_F\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">\u00b625 The prevailing party in a civil action against a state agency is entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees only if the court finds that \u201cthe claim or defense of the ... agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or defended in badfaith.\u201dSection 25-10-711, MCA. Based on the language of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, a determination that the DNRC did not act in bad faith or defend this litigation frivolously is dispositive and precludes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the DNRC. In contrast, whether the DNRC acted in bad faith is only one of several factors to be considered in determining if the circumstances support an award of fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine, an equitable exception to the American Rule. The Court\u2019s analysis, therefore, must necessarily include consideration of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. Consistent with our precedent, we recently employed such an analytical framework in <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance v. Bullock, </em>2016 MT 104, 383 Mont. 318, 371 P.3d 430. I would do so as well here. If the DNRC pursued its defense of the 1993 Rule in good faith, then such a determination is conclusive and attorney fees may not be assessed against the agency. As the District Court failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>address \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, its conclusions of law were incorrect. Further, based upon the procedural history of this litigation, any determination by the District Court that it was \u201cjust\u201d to assess attorney fees against the DNRC because it \u201cfailed to promulgate a valid rule\u201d was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b626 In <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance, </em>we considered a challenge to Legislative Referendum 121 (LR 121), which denied certain state services to individuals defined by the law to be \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d Montana Immigrant Justice Alliance (MIJA) requested attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine. We applied the provisions of \u00a7 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA, explaining that attorney fees are recoverable against the state only if the state\u2019s claims or defenses were frivolous or pursued in bad faith. \u201cA claim or defense is frivolous or in bad faith when it is outside the bounds of legitimate argument on a substantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance, </em>\u00b6 48, citing <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 10. We held that the Attorney General was defending, as his duty required, an enactment passed by 80 percent of the voting citizens of Montana and that the topic was important to a large number of Montanans. Observing that there were bona fide differences of opinion, we concluded that the State\u2019s defense of LR 121 \u201cwas not frivolous or in bad faith.\u201d Mont. <em>Immigrant Justice Alliance, \u00b6 </em>49. We held that MIJA\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the private attorney general doctrine was not allowed under \u00a7 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA. <em>Mont. Immigrant Justice Alliance, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b627 Similarly, in <em>Ostergren v. Dept. of Rev., </em>2004 MT 30, 319 Mont. 405, 85 P.3d 738, we concluded that although the taxpayer prevailed against the Department of Revenue (DOR) in that its property was valued in accordance with taxpayer\u2019s arguments, as opposed to DOR, the taxpayer was not entitled to fees if the DOR\u2019s claim did not rise to \u201cthe level of frivolity or bad faith.\u201d <em>Ostergren, </em>\u00b6 24. The 1997 Montana Legislature passed Senate Bill 195 which required reappraisals of class three, four, and ten properties statewide and caused significant market value increases. The taxpayer asserted DOR willfully mishandled the property assessment statute, acted in bad faith in refusing to refund taxes, and DOR had ignored 1996 values in its reappraisals. We determined that there was a disagreement on the valuation of property and that the appeals process is available for such situations. \u201cSimply because a taxpayer does not agree with the DOR\u2019s valuation of property does not entitle a taxpayer to attorney fees and costs.\u201d <em>Ostergren, </em>\u00b6 25. <em>See also Dearborn Drainage Area, </em>240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at 900 (the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks \u201cacted in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>faith and in accordance with constitutional and statutory mandates\u201d in representing the public\u2019s recreational use rights in the waters of Bean Lake); <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 20 (\u201cWhile the Attorney General did not prevail, it is difficult to conclude that his arguments were frivolous</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b628 Although both the language of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, and our precedent applying it are clear, this Court, by failing to mention \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, appears to have accepted the Coalition\u2019s argument that \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, is a statute-based fee provision which is not at issue in this case. The Coalition maintains that they are not seeking reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, but rather are pursuing attorneys\u2019 fees under the four factor test of the private attorney general doctrine which, the Coalition argues, \u201cprovides its own, independent basis for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees separate from \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA.\u201d The Coalition ignores that \u201c[t]he statutes establish the law of this state respecting the subjects to which they relate, and their provisions and all proceedings under them are to be liberally construed ....\u201d Section 1-2-103, MCA. Section 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, specifically declares that an agency of the state may only be required to pay costs if the agency has brought or defended an action which was frivolous or pursued in bad faith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8F\">\u00b629 I would construe \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, and the private attorney general doctrine consistently, as we attempted to do in <em>W. Traditions P\u2019ship. </em>Whether an agency acted frivolously or in bad faith are guideposts within which to assess\u2014under the particular facts, procedural history, and relevant principles of law of the case\u2014whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the private attorney general doctrine is equitable and consistent with \u00a725-10-711, MCA. <em>W. Traditions P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 18. Accordingly, the \u201cfrivolous or in bad faith\u201d standard set forth in \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, may not be ignored when the action is against the state or an agency of the state, regardless of what equitable theory the prevailing party chooses to advance. The private attorney general doctrine must be consistent with the legislature\u2019s determination of the standard to be employed when a state agency is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b630 In these proceedings, the procedural history is significant in assessing the DNRC\u2019s actions in the context of the private attorney general doctrine and \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA. Sixteen years after the adoption of the 1993 Rule, the Coalition filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling and requested the DNRC declare the 1993 Rule invalid because it was inconsistent with the Montana Water Use Act. The DNRC determined that the Petition presented a controversy of statewide importance and appointed a hearing examiner. Interested persons were provided an opportunity to file statements of position and briefs. Following a public hearing, the DNRC\u2019s hearing examiner issued his Declaratory Ruling on August 17, 2010, concluding the 1993 Rule was consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-306, (3), MCA. However, the hearing examiner determined that the 1993 Rule defining \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d was not the best definition that could be provided and consequently committed the DNRC to redefine the term through rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b631 In September 2010, the Coalition filed the instant Petition for Judicial Review. In November, the parties signed a stipulated agreement to revise the definition of combined appropriation and acknowledged that the Coalition would participate in rulemaking. The stipulation also provided that if the term \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d was defined by the 62nd Legislature, the DNRC\u2019s rulemaking efforts would cease. The 62nd Legislature passed House Bill 602, which authorized a formal study of exempt wells by the Water Policy Interim Committee (WPIC) and prohibited DNRC rulemaking until after October 1, 2012. As a result, the parties entered into a modified agreement which extended timelines and rulemaking to July 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b632 In response to the 2012 WPIC Report, the 63rd Legislature passed two bills in 2013: Senate Bill 19, which essentially codified the 1993 Rule, and Senate Bill 346, which authorized a stream depletion zone in areas where modeling demonstrated that exempt wells were having an impact on senior water users. Governor Bullock vetoed Senate Bill 19 and it did not become law. The DNRC next provided notice in August 2013 of a proposed rule revising the definition of combined appropriation. A public hearing was scheduled for September 2013. The WPIC submitted a letter of objection to the DNRC\u2019s proposed rule asserting that it was inconsistent with its 2012 Report and the legislature\u2019s intent. The Environmental Quality Council (EQC) also filed a formal objection to the DNRC\u2019s proposed rule. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-305(6) and 75-1-324(10), MCA, an objection by EQC delays effectiveness of the rule until after final adjournment of the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>regularly scheduled session. Accordingly, the DNRC withdrew the proposed rule following the public hearing in September.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b633 In December 2013, the DNRC published notice of a second proposed rule. Again, the WPIC and EQC objected to the proposed rule. In response, the DNRC withdrew its second proposed rule and, recognizing that judicial review was the only way to resolve the controversy between the 1993 Rule and its impact on senior water rights, proceeded with the Coalition to reopen the Petition. During this entire period, the hearing examiner\u2019s determination that the 1993 Rule was consistent with \u00a7 85-2-306(3), MCA, remained valid. It was not until October 17, 2014, when the District Court reversed the hearing examiner and concluded that the Declaratory Rulings\u2019 interpretation of the 1993 Rule was incorrect, that the 1993 Rule was held invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"ADNc\">\u00b634 The controversy over exempt wells, the impacts on senior water users, and combined appropriations continues. The 64th Legislature again passed legislation to protect combined appropriations consistent with 1993 Rule. Legislation codifying the 1993 Rule and further defining what qualifies for the exemption passed through both chambers of the 65th Legislature, but was again vetoed by Governor Bullock. Given this procedural history and the complexity of crafting a solution, it would be inequitable to hold the DNRC responsible for not having been able to craft a rule when two legislatures, interim committees, and other stakeholders were also unable to do. The DNRC\u2019s reliance on the hearing examiner\u2019s Declaratory Ruling and subsequent efforts to conduct rulemaking, culminating in two proposed rules, cannot be characterized as defending or asserting claims in bad faith or which are frivolous. I would thus conclude that pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, and the equitable considerations underlying the private attorney general doctrine, that it would be inequitable to award the Coalition attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b635 The foregoing analysis is how I would resolve the issue of whether the Coalition is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. I do not agree with the Court that resolution of the dispute should be on the basis of the first factor of the private attorney general doctrine; that is, that <em>Clark Fork I </em>did not involve a public policy of significant importance to Montanans which was void of any underlying constitutional considerations. We stated in <em>Clark Fork I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">Based upon the plain language of the statute, it is evident that the intent of the Legislature in enacting subsection (3)(a)(iii) was to ensure that, when appropriating from the same source, only a de minimus <em>quantity </em>of water, determined by the Legislature to be 10 acre-feet per year, could be lawfully appropriated without going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>through the rigors of the permitting process. An exception to the exemption for quantities exceeding 10 acre-feet per year, regardless of flow rate and number of wells or developed springs utilized for the appropriation, protects other water rights utilizing the same water source. This is consistent with the purpose of the Act as a remedial statute designed to strictly adhere to the prior appropriation doctrine and to provide for the \u201cadministration, control, and regulation of water rights ... and confirm all existing water rights....\u201d Section 85-2-101(2), (4), MCA. We have explained that \u201cthe Water Use Act was designed to protect senior water rights holders from encroachment by junior appropriators adversely affecting those senior rights.\u201d <em>Mont. Power Co. v. Carey, </em>211 Mont. 91, 98, 685 P.2d 336, 340 (1984). This fundamental purpose is reflected throughout the Act and many of the subsections of the Act begin with a policy declaration stating that the protection of senior water rights and the prior appropriation doctrine is the Act\u2019s core purpose. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 85-1-101(4), MCA (the Act\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprotect existing uses\u201d); \u00a7 85-2-101(4), MCA (it is \u201ca purpose of this chapter to recognize and confirm all existing rights\u201d); \u00a7 85-2-101(4), MCA (the purpose of permitting is to \u201cprovide enforceable legal protection for existing rights\u201d). Accordingly, based upon the plain language of the statute and the stated purpose of the Act, we conclude that \u201ccombined appropriation\u201d refers to the total amount or maximum quantity of water that may be appropriated without a permit and not to the manner in which wells or developed springs may be physically connected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Clark Fork I, </em>\u00b6 24. In this respect, the District Court was correct in its conclusion that the Coalition\u2019s challenge to the 1993 Rule was an important matter of public policy that vindicated constitutional interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b636 We stated in <em>BRPA III, </em>that a case need not involve a constitutional claim in order to vindicate constitutional interests. <em>BRPA III, </em>\u00b6 25. Cases involving statutory interpretation may nonetheless qualify for private attorney general fees when constitutional concerns are vindicated by statutory compliance. Here, our interpretation of the validity of the 1993 Rule was premised on the statute\u2019s constitutional purpose and its impact on senior water rights. The rights the Montana Water Use Act are designed to protect are explicitly recognized in Article IX, Section 3(1), of the Montana Constitution. The procedural history of this case alone demonstrates that the litigation and legislative efforts revolved around substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>policy issues and concerns over protecting the existing rights of senior water users. I, accordingly, do not agree with the Court that the Coalition did not litigate important policies grounded in the Montana Constitution and I would not decide this matter upon that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b637 Based on the foregoing analysis, I would conclude that \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, and equitable considerations of the private attorney general doctrine preclude an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. To the extent the Court\u2019s analysis differs, I specially concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> In <em>Montrust, </em>while recognizing the district court denied fees on the basis of \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, we failed to reconcile \u00a7 25-10-711, MCA, with our newly adopted private attorney general doctrine. Thus, we granted attorney fees against an agency absent a showing of bad faith or frivolity. Although we have subsequently described <em>Montrust </em>as not a \u201cgarden variety\u201d constitutional challenge to a legislative enactment, the tension between <em>Montrust </em>and \u00a7 25-10-711(l)(b), MCA, still remains. <em>See W.
