We affirm and restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by revoking Torres\u2019 suspended </em>sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b63 In 2008, Torres pled guilty to felony Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) and received a three-year deferred sentence. In January 2009, Torres\u2019 sentence was revoked and he was sentenced to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for five years, with two years suspended. After serving three years, Torres was released in January 2012 to serve the suspended portion of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b64 In August2013, while serving his suspended sentence, Torres was arrested for felony PFMA in Yellowstone County. Citing this charge and alleging other probation violations, the Lewis and Clark County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a second petition for revocation of Torres\u2019 sentence. Torres denied the allegations of the petition and filed a motion to set aside his 2008 PFMA conviction, arguing the pre-2013 PFMA statute was unconstitutional as violating the equal protection provisions of the Montana and United States Constitutions. The District Court denied Torres\u2019 motion to set aside his previous conviction, and Torres admitted to the violations set forth in the petition to revoke. He received a two-year sentence to the DOC, which was ordered to run concurrently with the sentence imposed by the Yellowstone County District Court for Torres\u2019 2013 PFMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u00b65 Torres appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to set aside the 2008 PFMA conviction and revocation of his suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s revocation of a suspended sentence for abuse of discretion and to determine whether the court\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 17, 301 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318; <em>State v. Adams, </em>2013 MT 189, \u00b6 11, 371 Mont. 23, 305 P.3d 808. Further, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>In re M. W., </em>2012 MT 44, \u00b6 9, 364 Mont. 211, 272 P.3d 112; <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 11, 340 Mont. 167, 174 P.3d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err by revoking Torres\u2019 suspended </em>sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"A8G\">\u00b68 Torres argues a revocation proceeding \u201cis as good a venue as any to allege illegality of an imposed sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d He presents a constitutionally-based challenge to his 2008 PFMA conviction, arguing that such \u201ccollateral challenges\u201d to prior convictions are permissible pursuant to <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64. Alternatively, recognizing that we were, in his words, \u201cdisinclined to consider [] the unconstitutionality\u201d of the PFMA statute in <em>State v. Watts, </em>2016 MT 331, 286 Mont. 8, 385 P.3d 960, because the issue had not been preserved, Torres asks that we review his challenge pursuant to <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979), or the plain error doctrine. Turning to the merits of his challenge, Torres cites our decision in <em>State v. Theeler, </em>2016 MT 318, 385 Mont. 471, 385 P.3d 551, which recognized that the former version of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA, violated equal protection, but criticizes what he describes as the \u201cpatch-fix\u201d remedy of severance we adopted there. <em>See Theeler, </em>\u00b6 14 (severing the phrase \u201cwith a person of the opposite sex\u201d from \u00a7 45-5-206(2)(b), MCA). He argues the statute constitutes an unconstitutional \u201cfelony enhancement\u201d and should be completely invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"A0V\">\u00b69  Torres\u2019 numerous arguments are wrapped around the proverbial and procedural axle. First, this is a sentence revocation proceeding on Torres\u2019 original 2008 PFMA conviction, the sentence he is still serving. Although Torres claims to be raising a \u201ccollateral challenge\u201d to a prior conviction, of the nature addressed in <em>Maine, </em>to prevent a felony \u201cenhancement,\u201d that is not the situation here. <em>Maine </em>addressed challenges to \u201ca prior conviction offered for enhancement purposes.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 32. Unlike <em>Maine, </em>no prior conviction is being offered to enhance a new charge in this proceeding, which concerns only the sentence for the original 2008 PFMA conviction. Torres\u2019 arguments under <em>Maine </em>could be pursued in a subsequent criminal proceeding in which the State seeks to use his 2008 conviction to enhance a new charge, but not within a revocation proceeding on Torres\u2019 original conviction. In a sentence revocation proceeding, the conviction is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b610 Torres\u2019 argument that a revocation proceeding \u201cis as good a venue as any to allege illegality of an imposed sentence for the underlying offense,\u201d runs counter to longstanding precedent. In <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22, we held that we were \u201cwithout jurisdiction to review the legality\u201d of Muhammad\u2019s original sentence in a revocation proceeding, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Muhammad had not challenged his original sentence by appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>State v. White, </em>2008 MT 464, \u00b6 20, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274 (overruled in part on other grounds by <em>State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283, \u00b6 27, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701), we held that \u201cWhite may not, within the context of the [2007] revocation proceeding, challenge the legality of the conditions imposed on her 1997 suspended sentence, as such a challenge is untimely.\u201d). In <em>In re M.W., </em>\u00b6 12, we concluded that \u201cM.W. did not appeal from the order imposing the registration requirement entered by the Youth Court in July 2009.... [T]he challenge he now attempts to make to the original imposition of the requirement has been forfeited.\u201d <em>See also Adams, </em>\u00b6 17 (\u201cAdams did not challenge the 2007 Sentence until the State filed a petition to revoke in 2012, and his challenge is untimely.\u201d). As recognized by the federal courts, \u201ca supervised release revocation proceeding is not the proper forum for a collateral attack on the conviction or sentence that resulted in the term of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Warren, </em>335 F.3d 76, 77 (2nd Cir. 2003). Torres is improperly attemptingto \u201ccollaterally\u201d attack his 2008 PFMA conviction within a sentence revocation proceeding involving that same conviction. Essentially, Torres seeks a second chance to appeal and raise issues he failed to raise when he did not appeal from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b611 The State argues, regardless of whether Torres could challenge his conviction in a revocation proceeding, he previously waived his constitutional challenge to the PFMA statute in 2008 when he voluntarily pled guilty, citing <em>Watts. </em>In <em>Watts, </em>the defendant pled guilty to PFMA pursuant to a plea agreement, which did not preserve a right to challenge his conviction, and affirmatively stated he was waiving his appeal rights. <em>Watts, </em>\u00b6 10. We held that \u201cWatts has not preserved the right to challenge his conviction based on the constitutionality of the underlying statute.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>\u00b6 10. Watts was premised on a long line of authority holding the knowing and voluntary entry of a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of constitutional rights violations which occurred prior to the plea. <em>Watts, </em>\u00b6 9; <em>see also State v. Lindsey, </em>2011 MT 46, \u00b6 19, 359 Mont. 362, 249 P.3d 491; <em>State v. Pavey, </em>2010 MT 104, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 248, 231 P.3d 1104; <em>State v. Kelsch, </em>2008 MT 339, \u00b6 8, 346 Mont. 260, 194 P.3d 670; <em>State v. Rytky, </em>2006 MT 134, \u00b6 7, 332 Mont. 364, 137 P.3d 530; <em>State v.

Turcotte, </em>164 Mont. 426, 428, 524 P.2d 787, 788-89 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"A6p\">\u00b612  As in <em>Watts, </em>Torres forfeited his constitutional challenge of the PFMA statute when he pled guilty, in 2008, and, consistent therewith, we decline to review the matter pursuant to <em>Lenihan </em>or the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\"> We have subsequently clarified the meaning and use of the term \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d <em>State v.
