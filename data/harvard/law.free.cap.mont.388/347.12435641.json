Following a five-day trial, a Lewis and Clark County jury concluded that Wittich accepted and failed to report nearly $20,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>campaign contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions, in violation of Montana campaign laws. The District Court denied Wittich\u2019s motion for a new trial and entered an order trebling the verdict amount. Wittich appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AxX\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">\n<em>1. Whether the Commissioner satisfied the statutory procedures for filing a judicial action against Wittich;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying Wittich\u2019s motions in limine to exclude two witnesses from testifying as experts;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Wittich\u2019s motion for a new trial;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>4. Whether the District Court acted within its discretion in trebling the verdict amount.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b63 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u00b64 In June 2010, Wittich won the Republican primary election for Senate District 35 in Gallatin County. Wittich went on to win the general election in November. In early 2010, Wittich\u2014an attorney\u2014represented Western Tradition Partnership in a case against the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner. <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>2011 MT 328, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.3d 1. Western Tradition Partnership acted as a \u201cconduit of funds for persons and entities including corporations who want to spend money anonymously to influence Montana elections.\u201d <em>W. Tradition P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 7. The United States Supreme Court ultimately reversed this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Western Tradition Partnership </em>and concluded that Montana law violated the First Amendment by prohibiting political expenditures by corporations on behalf of candidates for public office. <em>Am. Tradition P\u2019ship, Inc. v. Bullock, </em>567 U.S. 516, 132 S. Ct. 2490 (2012). The High Court\u2019s decision did not address Montana\u2019s campaign finance disclosure and reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">\u00b65 In September 2010, Debra Bonogofsky\u2014a Republican candidate for House District 57 in Yellowstone County\u2014filed an administrative complaint with the Commissioner against her primary opponent, Dan Kennedy. Bonogofsky asserted that Kennedy violated Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>campaign laws, in part, by coordinating with a number of groups on campaign mailings. Her written complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">Only the candidates that are supported by these groups ([Western Tradition Partnership], Montana Conservative Alliance, Montana Citizens for Right to Work etc.) are given the information to use Direct Mail and Communication, which is directly connected to [Western Tradition Partnership] through a common address in Aurora, CO. The mailings that [Western Tradition Partnership] sent out and the mailings the candidates \u201csent out\u201d are all too similar to be coincidence. I maintain that Dan Kennedy and also the other candidates knew what kind of help they would receive and these mailings should not be considered an independent expenditure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Commissioner began investigating Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b66 During the investigation, Commissioner Motl identified a number of the \u201cother candidates\u201d Bonogofsky referenced in her complaint. One of the candidates was Wittich. The Commissioner consulted with Bonogofsky, and she directed that her complaint be filed against Wittich as well. Commissioner Motl notified Wittich of the complaint in January 2014 and issued a Sufficiency Decision on March 31, 2014. The Commissioner concluded that Wittich violated Montana\u2019s campaign laws during his 2010 primary by failing to report or disclose expenses for services associated with campaign mailings that the Commissioner determined were in-kind contributions, by accepting illegal corporate contributions through coordination, and by failing to maintain or produce campaign finance records. The Commissioner concluded further that the case warranted civil adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">\u00b67 Commissioner Motl notified the Lewis and Clark County Attorney of the Sufficiency Decision the same day it was issued. The County Attorney waived his right to prosecute the alleged violations. The next day, the Commissioner filed the underlying complaint against Wittich in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u00b68 Wittich moved to dismiss, arguing that the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Commissioner referred the matter to the wrong county attorney before filing the judicial action in violation of \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA. The District Court denied the motion following a hearing. Wittich filed another motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because an administrative complaint was not filed against him with the Commissioner. The District Court denied the motion, and Wittich appealed. This Court dismissed Wittich\u2019s appeal as premature, based in part on our conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cthe issues on appeal are not matters implicating the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r of Political Practices v. Wittich, </em>No. DA 16-0151, Or. (Mont. Mar. 18, 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b69 Wittich moved to amend his answer to add an affirmative defense. His affirmative defense asserted that the laws underlying the Commissioner\u2019s complaint violated his right to freedom of speech under the United States and Montana C onstitutions. In its order allowing the amendment, the District Court noted that it was a \u201cclaim that could be handled by briefing prior to the trial.\u201d Wittich did not brief the issue or request a legal ruling prior to trial. The final pretrial order included Wittich\u2019s affirmative defense, and the parties discussed the issue during the final pretrial conference. The District Court concluded during the conference that Wittich could not raise the issue during trial because it was \u201cnot a jury question.\u201d The court reiterated during settlement of jury instructions that Wittich\u2019s affirmative defense did not \u201craise the type of claims that are appropriate for submission to the jury.\u201d The District Court ultimately rejected Wittich\u2019s proposed jury instruction on his affirmative defense and instructed the jury on a definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d that Wittich asserted was unconstitutional. Wittich did not object to the rejection of his jury instruction or to the given instruction defining \u201ccontribution.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b610 Commissioner Motl disclosed two experts prior to trial\u2014himself and C.B. Pearson, a campaign consultant. Wittich filed motions in limine to exclude both Commissioner Motl and Pearson from testifying as experts. The District Court denied both motions and allowed the Commissioner and Pearson to testify as experts during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b611 The jury trial began on March 28,2016. By then, Wittich had been elected to the Montana House of Representatives. After the parties\u2019 opening statements, a juror approached the Clerk of Court and expressed concern that she may not be able to remain unbiased because she felt that Wittich was being unfairly prosecuted. The Clerk reported the issue to the court and the court conferred together with the parties\u2019 counsel and the juror. Upon questioning by the court, the juror stated that she thought she could reserve her judgment until the parties had presented all of the evidence, but she stated also that she \u201cfelt all along [that she] shouldn\u2019t be part of this.\u201d Following their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>discussion, the District Court excused the juror. It expressed concern to counsel that the juror was \u201cdistraught\u201d and that she was \u201con the edge of abreakdown.\u201d After discussing the matter further with counsel, the court released the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b612 The trial proceeded for five days. The jury concluded that Wittich failed to maintain and preserve records of his campaign contributions and expenditures; that he accepted or received corporate contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions; and that he failed to report all contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions. The jury determined that Wittich accepted and failed to report $ 19,599 in corporate contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions. The District Court trebled the verdict amount and entered judgment in the amount of $68,232.58. The final judgment included $9,435.58 in penalties for violations the court had determined in a prior summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b613 Wittich filed a motion for a new trial, which the District Court denied. Wittich appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute for correctness. <em>Williams v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>2013 MT 243, \u00b6 24, 371 Mont. 356, 308 P.3d 88. We review a district court\u2019s discretionary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Plath v. Schonrock, </em>2003 MT 21, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 101, 64 P.3d 984. Similarly, we review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cartwright v. Scheels All Sports, Inc., </em>2013 MT 158, \u00b6 37, 370 Mont. 369, 310 P.3d 1080. The decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion. <em>Willing v. Quebedeaux, </em>2009 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 350 Mont. 119, 204 P.3d 1248. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Plath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the Commissioner satisfied the statutory procedures for filing a judicial action against Wittich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u00b616 Wittich asserts two grounds in arguing that the District Court did not have jurisdiction because the Commissioner failed to satisfy certain \u201cstatutorily mandated prerequisites\u201d for filing the judicial action against him: (1) a complaint was not submitted to the Commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>against Wittich, and alternatively the Commissioner did not issue Wittich a notice and order of noncompliance; and (2) the Commissioner failed to refer the matter to the appropriate county attorney before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">A. Whether Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint was sufficient to initiate the Commissioner\u2019s investigation of Wittich and whether the Commissioner was required to issue Wittich a notice and order of noncompliance prior to bringing the judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b617 Wittich asserts that the Commissioner did not satisfy certain \u201cstatutory prerequisites\u201d before initiating the action against him because Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint did not explicitly name him and because the Commissioner did not issue him a notice and order of noncompliance. Relying on \u00a7 13-37-111(2), MCA, and Admin. R. M. 44.10.307(2) (2010), Wittich contends that a \u201cproper written complaint\u201d must be filed against a candidate before the Commissioner \u201cmay investigate violations that are unrelated to statements filed with the [Commissioner].\u201d Wittich contends further that \u201cMontana law explicitly requires a written administrative complaint naming the alleged violator\u201d and that the Commissioner therefore improperly sought to \u201cexpand\u201d Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint to include him. Because Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint did not explicitly name him, Wittich argues that \u201c[n]o administrative complaint was ever made against\u201d him. As such, Wittich alleges that the Commissioner did not have the statutory authority to investigate him or subsequently to file the judicial action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b618 Wittich asserts that if there was no complaint naming him specifically, the Commissioner had to issue him a notice and order of noncompliance. Relying on \u00a7 13-37-121(5), MCA, Wittich contends that such a notice is a \u201cprerequisite to initiation of any administrative or judicial action.\u201d Because the Commissioner did not follow either of these \u201cstatutorily mandated prerequisites,\u201d Wittich argues that the action was not properly before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b619 Title 13, chapter 37, MCA, governs the claims against Wittich. In interpreting the statutes contained in that chapter, our role \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. We construe statutes \u201caccording to the plain meaning\u201d of their language. <em>Fellows v. Saylor, </em>2016 MT 45, \u00b6 21, 382 Mont. 298, 367 P.3d 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b620 Montana law makes the Commissioner \u201cresponsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>investigating all of the alleged violations of the election laws contained in chapter 35 of [Title 13] or this chapter and in conjunction with the county attorneys [the Commissioner] is responsible for enforcing these election laws.\u201d Section 13-37-111(1), MCA. Section 13-37-111(2)(a), MCA, provides that \u201c[u]pon the submission of a written complaint by any individual, the commissioner shall investigate any other alleged violation of the provisions of ... this chapter.\u201d The procedures prescribed in \u00a7 13-37-121, MCA, regarding notice and orders of noncompliance pertain to the Commissioner\u2019s inspection of a candidate\u2019s campaign statements and reports. <em>See,e.g., </em>\u00a7 13-37-121(1), MCA (providing that the Commissioner must inspect each statement and report filed with the Commissioner, and if the statement or report does not satisfy chapter 37\u2019s provisions, the Commissioner \u201cshall immediately notify the person of the noncompliance\u201d and issue \u201can order of noncompliance as provided in this section\u201d if the person fails to comply). If an individual files a complaint with the Commissioner \u201cpursuant to 13-37-111, the procedure described in this section regarding the provision of notice and issuance of orders of noncompliance is not a prerequisite to initiation of any other administrative or judicial action.\u201d Section 13-37-121(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b621 It is undisputed that Bonogofsky properly submitted a written complaint with the Commissioner and that the complaint specifically named Kennedy as the person against whom the complaint was brought. The complaint alleged that Kennedy violated Montana\u2019s campaign laws through his \u201cassociation and endorsement by Western Tradition Partnership and Dan Fuchs and Direct Mail and Communication.\u201d Bonogofsky alleged further that \u201c[t]hese groups while not registered with the State of Montana are really political committees and should operate under the laws regulating these committees. Therefore under Montana Law, they are subsequently [sic] subject to the limitations on contributions.\u201d Her complaint went on to allege that \u201c[o]nly the <em>candidates </em>that are supported by these groups ... are given the information to use Direct Mail and Communication .... The mailings that [Western Tradition Partnership] sent out and the mailings the <em>candidates </em>\u2018sent out\u2019 are all too similar to be coincidence.\u201d (Emphasis added). Bonogofsky continued, \u201cI maintain that Dan Kennedy and also the <em>other candidates </em>knew what kind of help they would receive and these mailings should not be considered an independent expenditure.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b622 Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint did not allege that only Kennedy violated Montana\u2019s campaign laws; rather, the complaint alleged that \u201cother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>candidates\u201d violated Montana\u2019s campaign laws as well. The Commissioner was \u201cresponsible for investigating <em>all </em>of the alleged violations of the election laws\u201d brought forth in Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint. Section 13-37-111(1), MCA (emphasis added). In fact, after Bonogofsky submitted her written complaint with the Commissioner, the plain language of \u00a7 13-37-111, MCA, explicitly required the Commissioner to <em>\u201cinvestigate any other alleged violation\u201d </em>of Montana\u2019s campaign laws included in the complaint. Section 13-37-111(2)(a), MCA (emphasis added). This encompassed Bonogofsky\u2019s allegations pertaining to the \u201cother candidates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b623 During his investigation of the alleged violations in Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint, the Commissioner identified Wittich as one of the \u201cother candidates\u201d whom Bonogofsky alleged had violated Montana\u2019s campaign laws. At that point, the Commissioner consulted Bonogofsky, and she directed that her complaint be filed against Wittich. Section 13-37-111, MCA, authorized the Commissioner to investigate Wittich based upon Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint. Further, because Bonogofsky filed her complaint pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-111, MCA, issuing notice and an order of noncompliance was <em>\u201cnot </em>a prerequisite to initiation of any ... judicial action.\u201d Section 13-37-121(5), MCA (emphasis added). Such notice and order of noncompliance would have been required if the Commissioner initiated a civil action against Wittich based on the Commissioner\u2019s inspection of Wittich\u2019s campaign statements and reports, and not on Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint. Section 13-37-121, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AFV0\">\u00b624 Wittich\u2019s reliance on \u00a7\u00a7 13-37-111(2) and -121(5), MCA, to assert that the Commissioner did not have the authority to investigate him or to initiate the judicial action against him is misplaced. His interpretation of the statutes runs counter to their plain language. Moreover, Wittich\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 13-37-111(2), MCA, inserts a requirement into the statute that the Legislature omitted. Nothing in the statute \u201cexplicitly requires a written administrative complaint naming the alleged violator.\u201d Instead, the statute requires \u201cthe submission of a written complaint\u201d and that the Commissioner \u201cinvestigate any other alleged violation\u201d contained in the complaint. Section 13-37-lll(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b625 Wittich\u2019s reliance on Admin. R. M. 44.10.307(2) (2010) to assert that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case is similarly misplaced. It is well established that administrative rules do not affect a court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a case. \u201c[JJurisdiction is conferred on courts only by the Constitution or statutes adopted pursuant to the Constitution.\u201d <em>Pinnow v. Mont. State </em>Fund, 2007 MT 332, \u00b6 20, 340 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1237 <em>(citing Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 52, 334 Mont. 489, 148 P.3d 643); <em>accord State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6 29, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66 (\u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s authority is determined by statute, not administrative rule.\u201d). Further, the statutes\u2014and not the administrative rules\u2014vest the Commissioner with authority to investigate and enforce alleged violations of Montana\u2019s campaign laws. Wittich\u2019s arguments that the District Court lacked authority to hear the case because the Commissioner failed to follow \u201cstatutorily mandated prerequisites\u201d recognize as much.</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">\u00b626  We conclude that Bonogofsky\u2019s complaint was sufficient to initiate both the Commissioner\u2019s investigation into Wittich and the resulting judicial action against Wittich. We conclude further that the Commissioner was not required to issue Wittich a notice and order of noncompliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">B. Whether the Commissioner failed to refer the matter to the appropriate county attorney before filing the judicial action against Wittich.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b627 Relying on \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, Wittich asserts that the Commissioner failed to \u201cfirst notify and arrange to transmit relevant information to the county attorney where the alleged violation occurred\u201d before filing a judicial action. Wittich contends that the alleged violation occurred entirely in Gallatin County because all of his \u201ccampaign activities\u201d took place there, \u201cincluding all accounting, bookkeeping, receipt of contributions, and administrative tasks related to his campaign.\u201d Moreover, Wittich argues, the Commissioner may initiate a judicial action only once the county attorney where the alleged violation occurred has waived its right to prosecute. Because the Commissioner did not notify or arrange to transmit the relevant information to the Gallatin County Attorney, and the Gallatin County Attorney was not afforded an opportunity to waive its right to bring the action, Wittich alleges that the Commissioner failed to follow another \u201cstatutorily mandated prerequisite\u201d to bringing the action against him. As such, Wittich contends that the District Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u00b628 Contrary to Wittich\u2019s assertions, whether the Commissioner failed to refer the matter to the appropriate county attorney under \u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, is an issue \u201cof statutory interpretation and not one of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r of Political Practices for Mont. v. Bannan, </em>2015 MT 220, \u00b6 11, 380 Mont. 194, 354 P.3d 601. We dismissed Wittich\u2019s earlier appeal in this case on the same ground. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Comm\u2019r of Political Practices v. Wittich, </em>No. DA 16-0151, Or. (Mont., Mar. 18, 2016). We decline to address the jurisdictional argument further and turn instead to the relevant statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b629 After the Commissioner renders a sufficiency decision, \u201cthe commissioner shall notify the county attorney of the county in which the alleged violation occurred and shall arrange to transmit to the county attorney all information relevant to the alleged violation.\u201d Section 13-37-124(1), MCA. If the county attorney does not initiate an action within thirty days of receiving notice of the violation, or waives its right to prosecute, the Commissioner may \u201cinitiate the appropriate\u201d action. Section 13-37-124(1)-(2),MCA. Subject to the provisions of\u00a7 13-37-124, MCA, \u201c[a]ll prosecutions [of violations of Montana campaign laws] must be brought in the state district court for the county in which a violation has occurred or in the district court for Lewis and Clark County.\u201d Section 13-37-113, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b630 The plain language of \u00a7 13-37-124(1), MCA, does not require that the Commissioner refer the matter to the county attorney where the \u201ccampaign activities\u201d occurred; rather, it requires that the Commissioner refer the matter to the county attorney where \u201cthe alleged violation occurred.\u201d In contrast, \u00a7 13-37-122, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] candidate ... who is the subject of an order of noncompliance may seek judicial review in the district court of the county in which the candidate resides.\u201d These venue provisions are distinct from one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b631 As the District Court concluded in denying Wittich\u2019s motion to dismiss, \u201cthere are certain portions of the complaint that allege violations which occurred in Gallatin County. However, the complaint also alleges violations occurring in Lewis and Clark County.\u201d Those alleged violations included Wittich\u2019s failure to file or report certain campaign documents with the Commissioner in Lewis and Clark County. The statute contemplates actions in the First Judicial District, \u00a7 13-37-113, MCA, and the District Court did not err as a matter of law in concluding that at least some of the alleged violations occurred in Lewis and Clark County. As such, the Commissioner referred the matter to an appropriate county attorney pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-124(1), MCA, and the Commissioner properly initiated the judicial action once the Lewis and Clark County Attorney waived its right to prosecute pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-124(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\u00b632 We conclude that the Commissioner satisfied the statutory procedures for filing the judicial action against Wittich.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b633 2. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>Wittich\u2019s motions in limine to exclude two witnesses from testifying as experts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b634 Wittich asserts that the District Court erred by allowing Commissioner Motl and Pearson to testify as expert witnesses.

Whether admission of the Commissioner\u2019s expert opinions constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b635 In denying Wittich\u2019s motion to exclude Commissioner Motl as an expert witness, the District Court analyzed the relevant factors for determining the reliability of expert testimony under M. R. Evid. 702. The court determined first that \u201cthe complicated and nuanced world of campaign finance is sufficiently specialized that expert testimony will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence.\u201d In concluding that Commissioner Motl was qualified to give opinions on campaign finance, the District Court noted that the Commissioner \u201cmay be <em>the </em>expert on campaign finance issues in Montana.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Finally, the court determined that Commissioner Motl would be \u201can appropriate fact witness\u201d because the Commissioner had \u201cconducted research and interviewed witnesses\u201d and would therefore have \u201crelevant evidence to provide the jury with [sic] on whether Wittich violated Montana\u2019s campaign finance laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b636 On appeal, Wittich does not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that the Commissioner was qualified as an expert under M. R. Evid. 702. Rather, Wittich contends that the District Court improperly permitted the Commissioner to testify as an expert because \u201cthe opinions offered by the [Commissioner] were legal conclusions and were applying law to fact.\u201d The Commissioner\u2019s testimony, in Wittich\u2019s view, was therefore contrary to M. R. Evid. 704. Wittich alleges that Commissioner Motl \u201cimproperly invad\u00ed ed| the province of the judge and jury\u201d because he expressed legal conclusions and applied the law to facts. The Commissioner does not respond to Wittich\u2019s argument on the merits, but asserts that he waived it by failing to object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AEMq\">\u00b637 Wittich preservedhis objection to Commissioner Motl\u2019s testimony. Wittich\u2019s motion in limine to exclude Commissioner Motl from testifying asserted the same grounds that he argues on appeal. Although the District Court\u2019s order denying Wittich\u2019s motion did not address the argument specifically, the court did note that the Commissioner represented in his briefing that \u201cMotl will not offer any evidence about the ultimate issues of law.\u201d \u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that a party need not make a contemporaneous objection if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>objection would be redundant of a motion in limine.\u201d <em>Anderson v. BNSF Ry., </em>2015 MT 240, \u00b6 77, 380 Mont. 319, 354 P.3d 1248. During Commissioner Motl\u2019s direct examination, Wittich also made a contemporaneous objection \u201cto the legal opinion being expressed\u201d and asked to approach the judge. A sidebar conference was held off the record, so we do not have the benefit of reviewing what was discussed. Nevertheless, Wittich preserved his objection to Commissioner Motl\u2019s testimony and we will address the merits of his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b638 District courts \u201care vested with great latitude in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>\u00b6 37. The rules of evidence allow an expert to \u201ctestify in terms of opinion or inference.\u201d M. R. Evid. 705. The rules allow those opinions and inferences to \u201cembracel ] an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d M. R. Evid. 704; <em>accord Perdue v. Gagnon Farms, Inc., </em>2003 MT 47, \u00b6 28, 314 Mont. 303, 65 P.3d 570. Thus, \u201can expert witness may properly testify as to an ultimate issue of fact.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 28. But an expert may not offer testimony \u201cthat states a legal conclusion or applies the law to the facts.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 28. This Court distinguishes \u201cultimate issues of fact from ultimate issues of law because legal conclusions offered by an expert witness invade the province of the jury.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>accord Hart-Anderson v. Hauck, </em>230 Mont. 63, 72, 748 P.2d 937, 942 (1988) (\u201cIt is for the jury to evaluate the facts in the light of the applicable rules of law, and it is therefore erroneous for a witness to state his opinion on the law of the forum.\u201d (citation and internal quotations omitted)); <em>Wicklund v.

For example, \u201cthe question, \u2018Did T have capacity to make a will?\u2019 would be excluded, while the question, \u2018Did T have sufficient mental capacity to know the nature and extent of his property and the natural objects of his bounty and to formulate a rational scheme of distribution?\u2019 would be allowed.\u201d <em>Heltborg v. Modern Mach., </em>244 Mont. 24, 29, 795 P.2d 954, 957 (1990) (citation and internal quotations omitted). An expert\u2019s testimony as to the first question \u201camounts to no more than an expression of the [witness\u2019s] general belief as to how the case should be decided,\u201d <em>Heltborg, </em>244 Mont, at 31, 795 P.2d at 958 (citation and internal quotations omitted), while an expert\u2019s testimony as to the second question \u201cembraces an ultimate issue to be decided by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the trier of fact,\u201d M. R. Evict 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b640 A review of our case law further elucidates this distinction. We have held the following expert testimony to be inadmissible legal conclusions: whether a defendant had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, <em>Heltborg, </em>244 Mont. at 32, 795 P.2d at 958; whether an insurer breached its statutory obligations under Montana\u2019s Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, <em>Hart-Anderson, </em>230 Mont. at 72, 748 P.2d at 942; and whether a county commission\u2019s growth policy revisions met the legal requirements of Montana statute, <em>Citizens for a Better Flathead v. Bd. of Cnty. </em>Comm\u2019rs, 2016 MT 256, \u00b6 18, 385 Mont. 156, 381 P.3d 555. In each of these cases, by applying the law to the facts of the case, the experts\u2019 testimony did more than \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d M. R. Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b641 On the other hand, we have concluded that the following expert testimony was permissible: an officer\u2019s opinions regarding the cause of an accident, <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 31; assessment of an employer\u2019s \u201cactions in the context of accepted human resources practices\u201d that \u201cdid not track the legal elements of wrongful discharge,\u201d <em>Cartwright, </em>\u00b6 44; and testimony on a train crew\u2019s obligations and duties while approaching a railroad crossing, <em>Mickelson v. Mont. Rail Link, </em>2000 MT 111, \u00b6 103, 299 Mont. 348, 999 P.2d 985. Our case law demonstrates that even though testimony on an ultimate issue of fact may implicate legal issues, an expert\u2019s testimony is admissible as long as it does not reach a legal conclusion or apply the law to the facts. <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 31 (concluding that although \u201ccounsel\u2019s questioning of [the investigating officer] intimates legal issues, such as whether [the driver being sued for negligence] acted negligently by driving on a defective tire or at half the posted speed limit, [the investigating officer\u2019s] testimony reached no legal conclusions on these matters\u201d). It is the jury\u2019s duty \u201cto apply the law as given in the jury instructions to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"AhQ\">\u00b642 Here, the District Court instructed the jury that it \u201cshould take the law in this case from my instructions alone.\u201d The court then instructed the jury on Montana\u2019s campaign finance and practices laws regarding the definitions of relevant terms and the requirements for reporting campaign contributions and expenditures, coordination with outside entities, and contributions from corporations. The instructions directed the jury to determine the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">Did [Wittich] fail to maintain and preserve records of his campaign contributions and expenditures in his 2010 primary election, in violation of Montana campaign practices laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Did [Wittich] accept or receive corporate contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions, in his 2010 primary election, in violation of Montana campaign practice laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">Did [Wittich] fail to report all contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions, in his 2010 primary election, in violation of Montana campaign practice laws?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The ultimate issues of fact to be decided by the jury were: whether Wittich failed to maintain and preserve campaign finance records; whether he accepted or received corporate contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions; and whether he failed to report those contributions. The ultimate issue of law that the jury had to apply to the facts was whether Wittich did those things \u201cin violation of Montana campaign practice laws.\u201d Although the ultimate issues of fact the jury had to decide certainly implicated whether Wittich violated Montana campaign practices laws, the rules of evidence permitted the Commissioner to testify as to his opinions on those issues so long as he did not offer legal conclusions. <em>See Perdue, </em>\u00b6 31. This is because it was the jury\u2019s duty to apply Montana\u2019s campaign laws as given in the District Court\u2019s jury instructions to the ultimate issues of fact in the case. <em>See Perdue, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b643 Issues of fact and law do not neatly divide in a case brought to assess compliance with campaign finance laws. Wittich takes issue with Commissioner Motl\u2019s responses to the following questions: whether Wittich \u201cproduced documents, records, and accounts ... that Montana campaign practice standards expects [sic] him to keep and produce\u201d; whether the Commissioner had \u201cdeveloped an opinion on the fact of coordination\u201d; and whether \u201cthere was a failure to report and disclose in this matter.\u201d Our review of the record establishes that, to some extent, Commissioner Motl\u2019s often narrative answers embraced the overlapping ultimate issues of fact and issues of law, notwithstanding his phrasing of his opinions as on \u201cmatters of fact.\u201d For example, when asked for his \u201copinion on the fact of coordination,\u201d Commissioner Motl responded, \u201cMy opinion is that Mr. Wittich coordinated with the umbrella group of National Right to Work corporations.\u201d The court\u2019s instructions to the jury specified that \u201c[u]nder Montana law, a \u2018coordinated expenditure\u2019 means an expenditure ... that is made in cooperation with, consultation with, at the request or suggestion of, or with the prior consent of a candidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqAc\">\u00b644 At the same time, the jury instructions provided that \u201c[t]o find an expenditure is coordinated, there must be actual, objective evidence showing coordination between the expenditure and the candidate.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>After being asked his opinion as to coordination, Commissioner Motl was asked what he based that opinion on. He responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\">Well, the basis of the opinion, looking first to the specific facts, the exhibits before the jury contain 15 emails by Art Wittich to Christian LeFer, Alii LeFer, Andrew O\u2019Neill, Jedd Coburn, and Sarah Anderson. Those emails, those 15 emails, deal with general campaign work, candidate profile at the very start of the campaign. They develop with\u2014they deal with the walking list work. They deal with copy drafting letters, website work, and graphics. Those people are all paid staff of the umbrella group of corporations that are working under National Right to Work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">In addition to those 15 email contacts, there was 15 phone calls, at least 15 phone calls, from Mr. Wittich\u2019s phone numbers to Mr. LeFer\u2019s phone numbers. I think that is significant because of the extent to which the activity of the National Right to Work group of corporations was attempted to keep secret. But we have 15 phone calls there alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Then there is the idea that a candidate would allow robo call\u2014would allow robo placed signatures on letters. That is the most significant campaign activity of this campaign, 11,000 Direct Mail letters mailed into his district in the closing weeks of his campaign. His ... robo placed signature was placed on every one of them. That shows a great deal of trust and cooperation between the candidate and those umbrella group of corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aah-dedup-0\">Commissioner Motl went on to testify that he investigated the timing of the contacts between Wittich and the entities at issue and that those entities did not report or disclose any independent expenditures to his office in the 2010 Senate District 35 campaign. Commissioner Motl\u2019s testimony was dominated by hard factual evidence of coordination between Wittich and the entities at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b645 An erroneous evidentiary ruling does not constitute reversible error \u201cunless a substantial right of the party is affected.\u201d M. R. Evid. 103. A party\u2019s substantial right \u201cis not affected unless the challenged evidence is of such character to have affected the result of the case.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Edwards, </em>2017 MT 93, \u00b6 50, 387 Mont. 274, 393 P.3d 639 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Although Commissioner Motl offered some legal conclusions, the majority of his testimony assisted the jury in \u201cdeterminfing] a fact in issue,\u201d M. R. Evid. 702, by providing \u201cactual, objective evidence showing coordination between\u201d the entities and Wittich. To the extent that Commissioner Motl\u2019s testimony conveyed to the jury that Wittich violated Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>campaign laws, any error did not prejudice the outcome or otherwise undermine the propriety of the proceeding. He offered proper factual information to show that Wittich had violated the law, as well as proper expert testimony to inform the jury about the campaign finance process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b646 Moreover, on cross-examination, Wittich\u2019s \u201ccounsel had adequate opportunity to bring forth the weaknesses of any assumptions or facts underlying [the Commissioner\u2019s] opinion.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 31. Wittich\u2019s counsel questioned the Commissioner regarding an \u201calternative explanation\u201d for the alleged coordination between Wittich and Western Tradition Partnership and questioned Commissioner Motl\u2019s potential biases stemming from Wittich\u2019s representation of Western Tradition Partnership in the case against the Commissioner. The Commissioner \u201coffered his factual considerations for the jury\u2019s consideration, which did not invade the province of the trier of fact. The jury remained free to decide the weight to give [the Commissioner\u2019s] opinion.\u201d <em>Perdue, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"A5V4\">\u00b647  Viewing the Commissioner\u2019s testimony in its entirety, we conclude that the District Court did not act arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceed the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice in permitting the Commissioner\u2019s testimony. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Commissioner Motl\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">B. Whether Pearson was qualified to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"ati-dedup-0\">\u00b648 In denying Wittich\u2019s motion to exclude Pearson as an expert witness, the District Court again analyzed the relevant reliability factors under M. R. Evid. 702. In determining whether Pearson was qualified to give opinions \u201cregarding the costs associated with running a campaign,\u201d the court noted that Pearson had \u201cover 30 years\u2019 experience in Montana political campaigns.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cPearson\u2019s experience is sufficient to allow him to give opinions on the subject.\u201d Relying on <em>State v. Ayers, </em>2003 MT 114, \u00b6 48, 315 Mont. 395, 68 P.3d 768, the court determined that Wittich\u2019s attacks on the viability of Pearson\u2019s methodology for calculating campaign costs went to the weight of Pearson\u2019s testimony and not to its admissibility. The court concluded, \u201cIf Wittich has concerns about [Pearson\u2019s] qualifications or his methodology, he should raise those issues on cross examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\u00b649 Wittich contends that Pearson was not an expert in the field because \u201che was not qualified to testify about the costs that a print shop would have incurred back in 2010 to produce\u201d the mailings at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>issue. Pearson was not qualified to express such opinions, Wittich asserts, because Pearson did not have \u201cany education or experience in third-party print-shops or the printing industry.\u201d Wittich emphasizes that Pearson \u201chad never worked on a candidate\u2019s campaign, and had never sent the type of letters and slicks out that were in issue in this case.\u201d Moreover, Wittich alleges, Pearson\u2019s testimony was \u201cthe only testimony provided to the jury about the value of alleged in-kind corporate contributions pertaining to the [mailings at issue] and accounted for over two-thirds of the final verdict amount.\u201d As such, Wittich contends that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion in limine to exclude \u201cPearson\u2019s opinions was an abuse of discretion that constituted reversible error when those opinions were expressed during trial to quantify the amount of in-kind contributions that Mr. Wittich allegedly received for printing and mailing\u201d the campaign mailings at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b650 Under M. R. Evid. 702, a witness may be \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d Montana\u2019s \u201cstandard for expert testimony contemplates that an expert\u2019s field will encompass the particular area about which he or she will testify; but the field is not coextensive with its application to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McClue v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2015 MT 222, \u00b6 25, 380 Mont. 204, 354 P.3d 604. \u201cA \u2018field\u2019 of expertise is an area, category, or division wherein a particular activity or pursuit is carried out.\u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b651 Whether a \u201cwitness is an expert is a question of admissibility within the discretion of the trial court, but the degree of the expert\u2019s qualifications goes to the weight of the evidence and is a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Wacker v. Park Rural Elec. Coop., </em>239 Mont. 500, 501-02, 783 P.2d 360, 361 (1989). Our expert testimony standard \u201crecognizes that admissible expert evidence should come in, even if that evidence may be characterized as \u2018shaky.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019McClue, </em>\u00b6 23. The expert\u2019s qualifications and testimony then are \u201copen for attack through the traditional and appropriate methods: vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof.\u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b652 Wittich characterizes the relevant field of expertise as third-party print shops that print the types of mailings at issue in this case. As the District Court noted, however, the issue requiring an expert was \u201cthe costs associated with running a campaign.\u201d Running a campaign was the relevant field of expertise because it was the area in which the particular activity\u2014the costs associated with the printing of \u201cattack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>letters,\u201d \u201cattack slicks,\u201d and \u201csurvey letters\u201d\u2014was carried out. <em>See McClue, </em>\u00b6 25. In other words, \u201crunning a campaign\u201d encompasses campaign mailings produced by third-party print shops. Contrary to Wittich\u2019s assertions, the expert\u2019s field\u2014running a campaign\u2014did not have to be \u201ccoextensive with its application to the particular facts of the case.\u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b653 Pearson\u2019s CV indicated that he had a \u201c[florty-year public interest career\u201d and that he had been a part of \u201cnumerous policy and public policy election campaigns in Montana and the West.\u201d His CV identified four cases in which he had been recognized as an expert and listed fifteen Montana mill levy, initiative, and referendum campaigns with which he had been involved since 1988. His CV stated also that he had written five campaign finance research reports and that he had legislative experience dating back to 1989. Wittich has failed to demonstrate that the District Court acted arbitrarily in determining that \u201cPearson\u2019s experience is sufficient to allow him to give opinions on the subject\u201d of running a campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b654 Wittich\u2019s arguments pertaining to Pearson\u2019s lack of education and experience in the printing industry go to the degree of Pearson\u2019s qualifications, not whether he was qualified as an expert in running a campaign. <em>See Wacker, </em>239 Mont. at 501-02, 783 P.2d at 361. The fact that Pearson had not worked on a candidate\u2019s campaign or sent similar mailings to the ones at issue was open for attack through vigorous cross-examination. <em>See McClue, </em>\u00b6 23. Wittich\u2019s counsel made the seemingly strategic decision not to question Pearson on cross-examination about his lack of experience on a candidate\u2019s campaign, in third-party print shops, or in the printing industry. Instead, he questioned Pearson about his potential biases against Western Tradition Partnership, another area proper for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"azj-dedup-0\">\u00b655 Wittich\u2019s counsel\u2019s decision not to question Pearson regarding his methodology for calculating the costs associated with printing the mailings at issue was seemingly strategic as well. The District Court concluded correctly that Wittich\u2019s arguments regarding \u201cthe viability of Pearson\u2019s methodology goes to its weight, not its admissibility.\u201d <em>See Ayers, </em>\u00b6 48 (concluding that \u201ccriticisms of specific applications of procedures or concerns about the accuracy of test results does not render the scientific theory and methodology invalid or destroy their general acceptance. These questions go to the weight of the evidence, not the admissibility.\u201d (citations and internal quotations omitted)). As Wittich acknowledges on appeal, Pearson\u2019s testimony \u201cwas the only testimony provided to the jury about the value of alleged in-kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>corporate contributions pertaining to the\u201d mailings at issue. We will not fault the District Court for Wittich\u2019s decision not to present contrary evidence or to question Pearson on cross-examination regarding how he calculated that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b656 Wittich has not met his burden on appeal to demonstrate that the District Court abused its discretion in determining that Pearson was qualified to testify as an expert. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Wittich\u2019s motion to exclude Pearson as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b657 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Wittich\u2019s motion for a new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b658 Wittich asserts that the District Court should have granted his motion for a new trial because the court improperly dismissed a juror after opening statements and because it improperly prohibited Wittich from asserting his affirmative defense on the unconstitutional application of Mon tana\u2019s campaign finance laws. He does not argue\u2014as he did to the District Court\u2014that a new trial was warranted because Pearson\u2019s estimate of the mailings\u2019 value provided insufficient evidence to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. We address the arguments Wittich has made on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">A. Dismissal of the juror after opening statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\u00b659 The District Court discussed with both parties\u2019 counsel whether to dismiss the juror who expressed concern about her ability to remain unbiased. During that discussion, the court asked Wittich\u2019s counsel: \u201cWell, do you think you have a right to her ...?\u201d Wittich\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s disqualified herself for cause, and we\u2019re not\u2014I mean, she said that she\u2019s prepared to go forward. And we\u2019re\u2014we\u2014until she says something that would disqualify her for cause, I guess we could\u2014.\u201d The discussion continued regarding what to do with the juror. Wittich\u2019s counsel did not say anything else until after the court decided to dismiss the juror. At that point, Wittich\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cSo, your Honor, are we going to seat an alternate?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A24O\">\u00b660 The Commissioner argues that Wittich failed to preserve this issue for appeal because he did not timely object to the juror\u2019s dismissal. In response, Wittich quotes a portion of the dialogue quoted above and declares that the \u201cDistrict Court considered] this issue during trial, and in Wittich\u2019s Motion for New Trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u00b661 We have long held that the \u201cgeneral rule is that, by failing to challenge or object, a party waives an irregularity in the impaneling of a jury.\u201d <em>Ledger v.

It follows that a party may waive its right to challenge the dismissal of a juror after the impaneling of the jury by failing to challenge or object to the juror\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"AdP6\">\u00b662  Although Wittich\u2019s counsel stated that he did not think that the juror had \u201cdisqualified herself for cause,\u201d he ultimately did not challenge or object to the juror\u2019s dismissal. Counsel did not state an express objection, and his comments were not sufficient to alert the trial court to his disagreement with her removal or to a position that the law required the juror to remain seated. By failing to object, Wittich acquiesced in the juror\u2019s dismissal. <em>Cf. Winslow v. Mont. Rail Link, Inc., </em>2005 MT 217, \u00b6 42, 328 Mont. 260, 121 P.3d 506 (holding that \u201cwe cannot conclude that MRL either consented or acquiesced to the juror\u2019s dismissal\u201d by objecting on the record the next morning at the District Court\u2019s invitation). \u201cWe will not place the District Court in error Tor an action to which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horn v.

Accordingly, we conclude that Wittich waived his right to challenge the juror\u2019s dismissal, and the juror\u2019s dismissal therefore was not ground for granting Wittich\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">B. The constitutionality of the statutes underlying the action against Wittich.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b663 In its order denying Wittich\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court reiterated its earlier rulings by stating that \u201c[n]o constitutional issues were or could have been submitted to the jury for their decision.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the Court and parties worked long and hard to arrive at a set of instructions to give to the jury. The Court and the parties agreed that the settlement of instructions would not be recorded but rather, a record of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>objections would be made outside of the presence of the jury once the Court reconvened in the morning. Each of the parties were provided with the instructions that had been settled the night before. When each of the parties were given an opportunity to lodge any objections to the instructions, as settled, the only objection thereby preserved by Wittich had to do with Instruction No. 28 concerning ignorance of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">It is not to be denied that Wittich expressed constitutionality issues and concerns throughout the pendency of this case and during the run up to the trial. It is also not to be denied, however, that there was no preservation of the discrete issue raised in the Motion for New Trial, i.e., the constitutionality of the 2010 statutory definition of contribution that was submitted to the jury as Instruction No. 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The court concluded that \u201cthe charge to the jury, including as it did the definition of \u2018contribution\u2019 from the applicable 2010 statute, did not violate any of Wittich\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b664 The Commissioner argues that Wittich failed to preserve the constitutional issue raised by his affirmative defense. The Commissioner points out that Wittich never sought a ruling or briefed the issue prior to trial and that he did not object to the jury instruction defining \u201ccontribution.\u201d The Commissioner notes also that Wittich did not object to the District Court\u2019s rejection of his proposed jury instruction regarding his affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\u00b665 Wittich counters by arguing that his affirmative defense contesting the statute\u2019s constitutionality, and the corresponding definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d contained in the jury instructions, \u201cwas explicitly preserved, and the District Court confirmed such <em>during discussions on the Jury Instructions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) Wittich emphasizes that he asserted the affirmative defense prior to trial, that he ensured that the defense was included in the pre-trial order, and that he reiterated his position when the Commissioner moved to strike the affirmative defense during discussion of the jury instructions. Wittich notes that during that discussion, the District Court stated that \u201ceverybody\u2019s position as it exists now is preserved.\u201d Wittich contends that \u201cthe parties and District Court were aware that Wittich\u2019s ninth affirmative defense contested Montana\u2019s definition of contribution in jury instruction 19.\u201d In sum, Wittich argues \u201cthat the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion because it was an error of law to determine that the issue was not preserved, and that it denied Mr. Wittich a fair trial by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>permitting jury instruction 19 while prohibiting Mr. Wittich\u2019s ninth affirmative defense at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b666 As Wittich acknowledges, the District Court granted him leave to assert his affirmative defense \u201c[s]ix months before trial.\u201d In allowing Wittich to assert the defense, the court noted that \u201cit is a claim that can be handled by briefing prior to the trial, even if the Attorney General needs to be brought into the case.\u201d Wittich does not reference on appeal, and the record does not reflect, that he briefed the issue prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u00b667 Wittich correctly notes that the final pre-trial order contained Wittich\u2019s affirmative defense and that the parties discussed the issue during the final pre-trial conference. During that discussion, the District Court stated that Wittich\u2019s affirmative defense was \u201cnot a jury question\u201d and that \u201cit might be able to be raised on appeal if the jury were to determine he violated the statute.\u201d The court asked Wittich\u2019s counsel how the issue would \u201ccome up from an evidentiary standpoint.\u201d Wittich\u2019s counsel suggested that Wittich \u201ccould testify that he thinks his First Amendment rights are [being violated].\u201d The court intimated that it would deal with the issue during settlement of jury instructions. Wittich\u2019s counsel ended the discussion by stating that the District Court had \u201craised our consciousness about it so we\u2019ll give it more mature reflection to see if we can\u2019t come up with additional analysis or an opportunity to withdraw it, but I think we preserve it otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adc\">\u00b668 At the close of evidence, the Commissioner moved to strike, as a matter of law, Wittich\u2019s affirmative defense. The Commissioner\u2019s counsel argued that Wittich \u201cfailed to present any evidence with respect to any alleged constitutional violations\u201d and that he \u201cfailed to preserve those issues through the failure to file any type of pretrial motion with this Court asking the Court to address those issues.\u201d Wittich\u2019s counsel responded by arguing that Wittich\u2019s testimony was \u201csufficient evidence to show that the laws\u201d under which he was charged violated his constitutional rights. Wittich\u2019s counsel argued further that \u201cthe fact that the opposing counsel are special attorneys general for the state is sufficient notice of that claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\u00b669 The court reiterated that it had restricted evidence regarding Wittich\u2019s constitutional claims at the pretrial conference because the affirmative defense did not \u201craise the type of claims that are appropriate for submission to the jury.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">The challenges, as I understand them, are to the law. It is alleged that the law violates the First Amendment and the prosecution being undertaken pursuant to a law that the defendant wants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>claim is unconstitutional. So it didn\u2019t have any place in this trial in terms of what is being submitted to the jury. I\u2019ll just defer any ruling beyond that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-4\">Whether there has been waiver, those kinds of things, whether I\u2019ll have any other post-trial motions, everybody\u2019s position as it exists now is preserved. Waiver hasn\u2019t been waived. If it hasn\u2019t been waived, you can raise something in this Court. If you needed to challenge the constitutionality] of the statute, notice anybody up, like the Attorney General in a way other than it was done, I\u2019m not going to decide any of that right now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The court and the parties then proceeded to discuss the verdict form and a number of the jury instructions on which the parties had settled off the record the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b670 During the discussion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">I could go through my understanding of each instruction that was offered and indicate whether they were going to be given, whether they were withdrawn, whether they were modified, or I could just ask, to the extent, consistent with our agreements last night, that if there needs to be objections preserved for the record, I could just allow each of the parties to do so. Otherwise, I am going to indicate that the record will establish that the document that you\u2019ve been handed with the 31 jury instructions is agreed to. Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The court then asked counsel, \u201cDo you want me to go through one at a time?\u201d Wittich\u2019s counsel responded: \u201cYour honor, we don\u2019t wish for the Court to go through one at a time. We have but one objection that we wish to preserve for the record.\u201d Wittich\u2019s counsel proceeded to articulate his objection to an instruction covering ignorance of the law. Wittich did not object to any other instruction, and he did not object to the court\u2019s failure to give any instruction. The parties discussed a number of minor revisions to other instructions before the court asked if there was \u201cI a |nything [counsel] needled I to talk about\u201d prior to the court instructing the jury. Wittich\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">\u00b671 A statute\u2019s constitutionality undoubtedly is a question of law. <em>E.g., Williams, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Jaksha v.

It was a determination to be made by the trial judge within his statutory powers.\u201d <em>Poncelet, </em>187 Mont. at 542, 610 P.2d at 706. In other words, the statute\u2019s constitutionality was \u201cwithin the province of the judge[,] not the jury.\u201d <em>Wadsworth, </em>275 Mont. at 296, 911 P.2d at 1170.

We conclude that the District Court properly restricted evidence regarding Wittich\u2019s constitutional theory during trial and appropriately declined to instruct the jury on that theory. Additionally, Wittich waived his right to challenge the jury instruction defining \u201ccontribution\u201d on appeal by failing to object to the instruction at trial. <em>Turk v. Turk, </em>2008 MT 45, \u00b6 16, 341 Mont. 386, 177 P.3d 1013 (\u201cThe failure to object to ... jury instructions at trial results in a waiver of the right to challenge them on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u00b674 Finally, the District Court was not \u201cat liberty to look behind the law to determine whether\u201d the law was constitutional \u201c[u]nless and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>until [Wittich] challenge^] the constitutionality of [the] statute.\u201d <em>Jaksha, </em>\u00b6 15. Although Wittich asserted the constitutional issue as an affirmative defense, he never asked the District Court to make a legal ruling on it. Putting it in the final pre-trial order was not sufficient, standing alone, to constitute a request for the court to make a legal ruling prior to taking the case to the jury. It would be \u201cfundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue\u201d that Wittich never gave it an opportunity to actually rule on. <em>Paulson, </em>\u00b6 37. By not presenting the constitutional issue to the District Court, Wittich waived his right to argue it on appeal. <em>See Kulstad, </em>\u00b6 20. We decline to address further Wittich\u2019s arguments pertaining to the statute\u2019s constitutionality. We hold that the District Court determined correctly that Wittich waived his constitutional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"aah-dedup-1\">\u00b675  In light of the trial record, we conclude that the District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in determining that neither the juror\u2019s dismissal nor Wittich\u2019s constitutional argument served as grounds for granting his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\u00b676 <em>4. Whether the District Court acted within its discretion in trebling the verdict amount.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\u00b677 The jury determined that Wittich accepted and failed to report $19,599 in corporate contributions, including coordinated in-kind contributions. At the dispositional hearing, the District Court declined to accept the Commissioner\u2019s recommendation that Wittichbe removed from office, and it considered instead the appropriate financial penalty. The court noted that the \u201cstatute says that the maximum penalty that can be imposed is three times the amount of the illegal contribution.\u201d The court then imposed a penalty of $58,797 for Wittich\u2019s accepting and failing to report the $19,599 in corporate contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u00b678 Wittich argues that \u00a7 13-37-128, MCA\u2014which governs the amount of liability for violations of campaign laws\u2014is punitive because \u00a7 13-37-129, MCA, \u201cillustrates that the amount assessed under \u00a7 13-37-128, MCA is a fine\u201d and because the purpose of the statute \u201cis to punish, not to compensate or remedy a damage that was incurred.\u201d Wittich asserts that because \u00a7 13-37-128, MCA, is punitive, his culpability had to be established by clear and convincing evidence. Wittich contends that the court did not make such a determination. As such, Wittich argues that the District Court\u2019s imposition of treble damages was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">\u00b679 Section 13-37-128, MCA, provides that a person who violates certain provisions of Montana\u2019s campaign laws \u201cis liable in a civil action brought by the commissioner ... for an amount up to $500 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>three times the amount of the unlawful contributions or expenditures, whichever is greater.\u201d Section 13-37-128(1), MCA. Section 13-37-129, MCA, entitled \u201cLiability and disposition of fines,\u201d provides that \u201c[i]n determining the amount of liability under 13-37-128, the court may take into account the seriousness of a violation and the degree of culpability of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b680 We are unpersuaded by Wittich\u2019s argument that reference to \u201cfine\u201d in the title of \u00a7 13-37-129, MCA, makes any liability imposed under \u00a7 13-37-128, MCA, punitive so as to require clear and convincing proof. We have held consistently that \u201cthe text of the statute takes precedence over the title in matters of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>Orozco v. Day, </em>281 Mont. 341, 348, 934 P.2d 1009, 1013 (1997) (citing <em>ISC Distrib., Inc. v.

Contrary to Wittich\u2019s arguments, the statute does not require that a defendant\u2019s culpability be established by clear and convincing evidence. The statute\u2019s plain language makes clear that a district court\u2019s decision to treble damages is discretionary, without a requirement of specific intentional conduct. <em>See Plath, </em>\u00b6 27 (analyzing a similar provision under the Montana Consumer Protection Act and concluding that the Legislature\u2019s intent in drafting the statute \u201cwithout including specific conduct that would trigger imposition of the treble damage award was to provide for a discretionary award of treble damages which is not punitive in nature and which does not require specific intentional conduct on the part of the defendant\u201d). The District Court\u2019s application of the statute was not an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"AUP\">\u00b682  Absent legal error, Wittich has not met his burden on appeal to demonstrate that the District Court acted arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice in trebling the verdict amount.

Further, in what may have been a strategy, the Commissioner was permitted to reformulate issues that would be given to the jury, such as the reporting of campaign contributions and maintaining campaign records, into alternately phrased legal obligations, such as \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cpublic trust.\u201d For example, the Commissioner testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">Q. What role do campaign records kept by a candidate play in regard to Montana candidate elections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">A. Well, consistent with the requirement of transparency is the requirement that a candidate meet the public trust obligation. The public trust obligation is that a candidate running for office, a candidate serving in office, serves the public and not a private interest. It is the interest of the public that a candidate must serve. Consistent with that, then, when a candidate runs for office, the records of their campaign must be available for inspection. ... That is consistent with the public trust obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA2t\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAALsAAAAjAQAAAADk3kbpAAAAS0lEQVR4nGP8z4AVPGTCLs7AMCox9CV+wpgnYAwFiMSPBih/D5T+/wGvUQz/f/yHguMwhvz///8fMPz/C+O/hzH2/////wHjiE1wAEK5OCYPVAaIAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"187\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">It shows a degree of humility on the part of the candidate and acceptance of their responsibility to the public at large, rather than just to themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\u00b686 Wittich offered another objection at this point in the proceeding, although we have no record of the following discussion. Nonetheless, the Commissioner was permitted to use the witness stand as a soap box for his own vision of campaign finance (\u201c[T]he idea is this: Government functions best in governance if the public believes and understands the influences on government.\u201d \u201c[Its] just the culture we have in Montana.\u201d). He was permitted to weave legal-sounding concepts into his testimony, such as \u201cpublic trust,\u201d as quoted above, and the requirement of \u201ctransparency\u201d in campaigns (\u201cSo the word that is used is transparency. So the campaign finance reports, when filed, are intended to inform voters. ... so it\u2019s supposed to be complete transparency.\u201d) and then testify that Wittich had violated these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>concepts (\u201c[M]y opinion is that, as a matter of fact, this record production fails the public trust obligation that is inherent in every candidate for office in the State of Montana.\u201d). Violation of the law was thus conveyed to the jury through the Commissioner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b687 Even further, the Commissioner was permitted to use inappropriate, political labels that could have the effect of painting Wittich as sinister (\u201cThat is dark money. It is dark in every way you can get it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b688 These statements should not have been admitted, and if they constituted a significant part of the Commissioner\u2019s testimony, I would vote to reverse Wittich\u2019s conviction. However, the Commissioner\u2019s lengthy testimony was dominated by hard factual evidence of campaign law violations. For example, the Commissioner testified on direct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">Q. [C]an you identify paid personal services that were provided in the 2010 Senate District 35 primary election that are not listed on Mr. Wittich\u2019s campaign finance reports for that election?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">A. I can do that. Those paid personal services include general campaign management provided Art Wittich by National Right to Work staffers Christian LeFer and Sarah Arnold, specific campaign management provided by Sarah Arnold in the form of processing and distributing the candidate profile, candidate biography and candidate photos in a manner that allowed use by the National Right to Work staff in Virginia and in Montana, the graphics, website, and programming by National Right to Work staffer Andrew O\u2019Neill, the campaign opponent research by National Right to Work staffer Sarah Arnold, the writing and copying ... that were sent out to voters, the writing and copy for seven candidate letters, including the wife letter, by National Right to Work staffer Jedd Coburn, the editing of that letter by National Right to Work staffers Christian LeFer and Sarah Arnold, the development of the voter ID list for the entirety of Senate District 35 and delivery of that list to Art Wittich as a walking list.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">\u00b689 While the Commissioner was not properly reined in while on the stand, he did get to the meat of the matter, and offer proper factual information that Wittich had violated the law, as well as proper expert testimony informing the jury about the finance process. In the context here, including overlapping concepts of fact and law, I believe the Commissioner\u2019s statements about the law did not prejudice the outcome or otherwise undermine the propriety of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\u00b690 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
