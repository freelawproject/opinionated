Intervenors and current owners of the site, Stephen Wanderer and Georgia Filcher (Landowners), join that appeal and further appeal the District Court\u2019s related summary judgment that MEPA requires DEQ to identify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>owner or operator of the contemplated retail store. We reverse, in part, and affirm, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>1. Does MEPA require DEQ to consider non-water quality related environmental impacts of the construction and operation of a retail store facility as secondary impacts of the issuance of a Montana Water Quality Act (MW QA) permit to discharge facility wastewater into the ground from an onsite wastewater treatment </em>system?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>2. Does MEPA require DEQ to identify the actual owner or operator of a wastewater treatment facility prior to issuing a MWQA groundwater discharge </em>permit?</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">\u00b62 On April 3, 2014, DEQ received an application for a Montana groundwater pollution control system (MGWPCS) permit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to discharge Level 2 wastewater<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> into Class 1 groundwater on the site of a contemplated commercial development at the intersection of U.S. Highway 93 and Blood Lane near Hamilton, Montana. The contemplated discharge would occur via a proposed onsite wastewater treatment facility and drainfield designed to treat sanitary and floor drain discharges from a 156,529 square-foot retail store facility to be constructed on the site. The groundwater discharge would eventually migrate down-gradient to the nearby Bitterroot River in Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u00b63 DEQ received the application under submittal letter, dated March 31, 2014, from CT Consultants, an engineering firm in Columbus, Ohio. The letter bore the signature of John D. Zaleha, E.I., \u201cProject Engineer.\u201d The application consisted of DEQ standard Forms 1 and GW-1 with referenced attachments. As supplemented at DEQ\u2019s request, the application identified the type and nature of the contemplated facility or operation by reference to a Standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Industrial Code (SIC 5311) indicating a retail merchandise and grocery facility. An included project site map indicated a large retail facility and parking lot that would together cover approximately half of the 16.54 acre site. The application listed the various types of contemplated effluents with their respective characteristics. As proposed, the treatment system would on average handle 5,100 gallons of effluent from sanitary wastes (95%) and floor drains (5%). As supplemented, except for identification of the contemplated facility name and the actual contemplated owner or operator, the application included all standard information typically required by DEQ for issuance of a MGWPCS permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b64 The certification and signature sections of both DEQ application forms listed Ravalli County real estate broker Lee Foss (Foss) as the permit applicant. Section C of Form 1 also listed Foss as the \u201cFacility Contact.\u201d The \u201cFacility Information\u201d sections of both forms listed the property\u2019s state property tax identification number (Parcel #698800) as the \u201cFacility Name.\u201d Section F of Form 1 listed Foss as the \u201cApplicant (Operator)\u201d of the contemplated facility and that the listed \u201cOperator\u201d was not the property owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\u00b65 By correspondence to Foss dated April 21, 2014, DEQ identified and requested additional information regarding various application \u201cdeficiencies\u201d including, <em>inter alia, </em>clarification of the name of the facility and the name of the permitee who would be \u201cthe responsible entity\u201d to insure compliance with permit conditions for the authorized discharge. By subsequent correspondence, CT Consultants, through Project Engineer Zaleha, reiterated that the facility name was Parcel #698800 and that Foss would be the permitee, as originally listed. DEQ\u2019s Supplemental Responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 First Discovery Requests indicated that the agency\u2019s Director specifically \u201casked Mr. Foss to disclose the identity of the developer of the property\u201d but \u201cMr. Foss declined to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">\u00b66 It is undisputed on the record that real estate broker Lee Foss had no intention of actually owning or operating the contemplated facility. He requested the MGWPCS permit to facilitate the sale of the property to a particular third-party known to Foss and Landowners. Upon sale of the property, Foss would transfer the permit to the intended owner or operator who would construct and operate the retail store.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAc\">\u00b67 In May 2014, DEQ issued a Draft Checklist Environmental Assessment (draft EA), a draft wastewater discharge permit, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>permit fact sheet. The draft EA identified the proposed agency action as the issuance of a permit authorizing \u201cdischarge of treated domestic water via a subsurface drainfield [pursuant to] the Montana Groundwater Pollution Control System (MGWPCS) permit program\u201d established by Admin. R. M. Title 17, chapter 30, part 10. The draft EA stated that the limited purpose of the permit was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">to regulate the discharges of pollutants to state waters from the regulated facility. Issuance of an individual permit will require the applicant to implement, monitor and manage practices to prevent pollution and the degradation of ground water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The draft permit specified allowable discharge limits for total nitrogen and total phosphorus and specified ongoing water quality monitoring and reporting measures required by DEQ. The permit fact sheet described the wastewater treatment system, point of discharge effluent limits, site hydrogeology, and vicinity groundwater quality issues. The fact sheet further explained DEQ\u2019s rationale for the proposed terms and conditions of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u00b68 The draft EA concluded that, as treated and discharged beyond the \u201capproved mixing zone\u201d on the property, the contemplated wastewater discharge would not exceed applicable water quality standards and thus would have no \u201csignificant adverse effects [on] the human and physical environment.\u201d The draft EA referenced a similar lack of significant impact on various standard physical environment checklist factors. <em>Inter alia, </em>the draft EA included a statement that \u201cconstruction of the facility will alter\u201d the existing undeveloped use of the land but not impact any \u201clisted vegetative species.\u201d Though finding no significant adverse impact on various standard human environment checklist factors, the draft EA concluded that the construction and operation of \u201cthe facility\u201d would have the potential to increase commercial activity in the area, increase traffic in the area, create temporary jobs during construction, create permanent jobs post-construction, and increase local tax revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\u00b69 DEQ received written comments from approximately 160 individuals and members of local organizations. More than 80 people attended a public hearing on September 18,2014. Due to the high level of public interest and technical difficulties with its electronic public comment submission system, DEQ extended the public comment period until October 15, 2014. On November 17, 2014, DEQ released a final EA and associated fact sheet and concurrently issued the requested wastewater discharge permit to Foss as originally recommended in the draft EA.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">\u00b610 With a few exceptions, the final EA mirrored the draft EA. Based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>on new information provided by commenters regarding the existence of a down-gradient natural spring near the project area, the final EA noted that DEQ lowered the permissible level of phosphorous discharge from the proposed wastewater treatment facility. <em>Inter alia, </em>the document concluded that the treatment system and expected wastewater discharges to groundwater would result in \u201cno potential adverse impact to elk winter range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b611 DEQ organized public comments by topic and prepared 106 formal responses to address public concerns. The agency noted that most issues raised by commenters were \u201cbeyond the scope\u201d of the agency\u2019s EA analysis, and declined to address various stated public concerns about non-water quality related impacts of the construction and operation of the larger retail facility, including the potential spread of noxious weeds, \u201clight pollution,\u201d noise pollution, air pollution, soil pollution, permanent traffic increases, traffic safety, building aesthetics, scenic degradation, the risk of decreases in nearby residential property values, and the effect of marketplace competition on other local businesses and employees. The final EA further stated that DEQ had no authority to require the developer to build at an alternative site in Hamilton to allow connection to the city sewage treatment system and thereby eliminate the need for the contemplated groundwater discharge. The final EA did address questions regarding the adequacy of self-monitoring of the treatment facility by the owner or operator and public perception of a need for additional down-gradient water quality monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b612 The final EA referenced various secondary impacts identified in the draft EA, but this time more narrowly characterized them as impacts resulting from the construction of the subject wastewater treatment system rather than impacts of the larger construction and operation of the retail facility. The final EA ultimately concluded that MEPA did not require a formal environmental impact statement (EIS) \u201cbecause the project lacks significant adverse effects to the human or physical environment.\u201d With reference to DEQ\u2019s limited authority to regulate groundwater discharges \u201cto ensure the protection of the beneficial uses of state waters and compliance with the applicable water quality standards,\u201d the EA concluded that DEQ complied with all applicable MEPA requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b613 On January 14, 2015, Bitterrooters petitioned the Montana First Judicial District Court for judicial review on the asserted grounds that DEQ\u2019s wastewater discharge permitting process violated the Montana Water Quality Act (MWQA), MEPA, and the public\u2019s right to participate in governmental deliberations under Article II, Section 8 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 2-3-101, MCA, et seq. Bitterrooters alleged that the issuance of the wastewater discharge permit violated MWQA by failing to adequately consider the impact of the contemplated wastewater discharge on the water quality of the nearby Bitterroot River and tributaries. They alleged that the permit violated both MWQA and MEPA by failing to adequately consider the cumulative water quality impacts of wastewater discharges from the contemplated retail facility in conjunction with previously permitted discharges from the nearby Grantsdale subdivision. Bitterrooters asserted that the process further violated MEPA by failing to adequately consider the secondary impacts of the larger construction and operation of the retail facility unrelated to water quality. On May 16,2016, on consideration of the parties\u2019 respective motions to dismiss and for summary judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and 56, the District Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\">(1) dismissed Bitterrooters\u2019 right-to-participate claim as time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, \u00a7\u00a7 2-3-114 and - 213, MCA;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(2) granted summary judgment that DEQ violated MWQA by failing to adequately consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">(A) the effect of the contemplated discharge of nitrate-contaminated groundwater on the quality of nearby surface waters in violation of \u00a7 75-5-301(5)(d), MCA, and Admin.

M. 17.4.609(3)(d) (criteria for evaluation of cumulative and secondary impacts of state action on physical environment) required DEQ to identify the \u201cfacility operator if the operator\u2019s identity has the potential to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>impact vegetation, aesthetics, human health and safety, industrial and commercial activities, employment, tax revenues, demand for government services, or other environmental resources.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b614 DEQ appeals only the District Court\u2019s ruling that it violated ME PA by failing to consider environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the facility other than water quality impacts and impacts of the related construction of the required wastewater treatment system. Landowners join DEQ\u2019s appeal and further separately appeal the District Court\u2019s ruling that Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) requires disclosure of the identity of the actual contemplated owner or operator of the retail facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, and related conclusions of law, de novo for correctness. <em>Smith v. BNSF Railway, </em>2008 MT 225, \u00b6 10, 344 Mont. 278, 187 P.3d 639; <em>Montana Trout Unlimited v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. &amp; </em>Conserv., 2006 MT 72, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 483, 133 P.3d 224. The standard of review of the sufficiency of an agency\u2019s environmental review under MEPA is whether the decision was unlawful or arbitrary and capricious. Section 75-1-201(6)(a)(iii), MCA; <em>Montana Wildlife Fed. v. Mont. Bd. of Oil &amp; Gas </em>Conserv., 2012 MT 128, \u00b6 25, 365 Mont. 232, 280 P.3d 877. An agency decision is unlawful if it does not comply with governing laws and administrative rules. <em>North Fork Preservation Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of State Lands, </em>238 Mont 451, 459, 778 P.2d 862, 867 (1989). We will sustain an agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule \u201cso long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by\u201d the language of the rule. <em>Clark Fork Coal. v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Envt\u2019l Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 20, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b616 An agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if made without consideration of all relevant factors or based on a clearly erroneous judgment. <em>Clark Fork Coal., </em>\u00b6 21; <em>North Fork Preservation Ass\u2019n, </em>238 Mont at 465, 778 P.2d at 871. However, the arbitrary and capricious standard does not permit reversal \u201cmerely because the record contains inconsistent evidence or evidence which might support a different result.\u201d <em>Montana Wildlife Fed., </em>\u00b625. Rather, the decision \u201cmust appear to be random, unreasonable or seemingly unmotivated based on the existing record.\u201d <em>Montana Wildlife Fed., </em>\u00b625. We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the agency but will not defer to an agency decision without a searching and careful review of the record to verify that the agency made a reasoned decision. <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. Dep\u2019t of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number><em>Nat. Res. &amp; Conservation, </em>2000 MT 209, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 1, 6 P.3d 972; <em>North Fork Preservation Ass\u2019n, </em>238 Mont. at 465, 778 P.2d at 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b617 Mindful of the Legislature\u2019s constitutional duty to maintain and provide for a clean and healthful environment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and for the purpose of protecting our environment in balance with the right to use and enjoy private property free from undue government regulation, MEPA requires state agencies to conduct an environmental review of any contemplated agency action that may have an impact on the human environment. Sections 75-1-102, -201(1), and -220(5), MCA. Within the required scope of review, MEPA requires agencies \u201cto take a hard look\u201d at the environmental impacts of contemplated agency action. <em>Montana Wildlife </em>Fed., \u00b6 43. \u201cImplicit in the requirement that an agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences of its actions is the obligation to make an adequate compilation of relevant information, to analyze it reasonably, and to consider all pertinent data.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coal., \u00b6 </em>47.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b618 However, MEPA requirements are merely \u201cprocedural\u201d and do not require an agency to reach any particular decision in the exercise of its independent authority. Section 75-1-102(1), MCA; <em>Montana Wildlife Fed., </em>\u00b6 32. <em>See also, </em>\u00a7 75-1-102(3)(b), MCA (MEPA provides no additional regulatory authority to an agency and does not affect an agency\u2019s specific statutory duties to comply with environmental quality standards); \u00a7 75-1-201(4)(a), MCA (reviewing \u201cagency may not withhold, deny, or impose conditions on any permit or other authority to act based on\u201d MEPA). The essential purpose of MEPA is to aid in the agency decision-making process otherwise provided by law by informing the agency and the interested public of environmental impacts that will likely result from agency actions or decisions. Sections 75-2-102(1)(b) and (3)(a), MCA. Because the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>modeled MEPA on the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> federal authority construing NEPA is generally persuasive guidance in the construction of similar provisions of MEPA. <em>North Fork Preservation Ass\u2019n, </em>238 Mont. at 457, 778 P.2d at 866; <em>Ravalli County Fish &amp; Game Ass\u2019n v. Montana Dep\u2019t of State Lands, </em>273 Mont. 371, 377, 903 P.2d 1362, 1367 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 1: </em>Does MEPA require DEQ to consider non-water quality related environmental impacts of the construction and operation of a retail store facility as secondary impacts of the issuance of a Montana Water Quality Act (MWQA) permit to discharge facility wastewater into the ground from an onsite wastewater treatment system?</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b620 MEPA requires an agency to produce a formal environmental impact statement (EIS) if an agency action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iv), MCA; <em>Montana Wildlife </em>Fed., \u00b6 43. However, MEPA does not require an EIS if a preliminary EA determines that the agency action will <em>not </em>significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iv), MCA; Admin. R. M. 17.4.607(2) and .608 (general environmental review requirements); <em>Kadillak v. Anaconda Co., </em>184 Mont. 127, 134, 602 P.2d 147, 152 (1979). An EA thus serves as both the initial tool for determining whether a more intensive EIS is necessary and as the mechanism for required environmental review of agency actions that will likely impact the environment but not sufficiently to require an EIS. Sections 75-1-102(1) and (3)(a), -201(1)(a) and (b)(i)(B), and -220(5), MCA (EIS/EA purposes, definitions, legislative intent, and general requirements for \u201cadequate review\u201d of environmental impact of \u201cstate actions\u201d); Admin. R. M. 17.4.607(2) through (4) and 17.4.608, (environmental review requirements and significant impact evaluation criteria). On appeal, Bitterrooters do not contest DEQ\u2019s determination that an EA would suffice as the mechanism for required environmental review based on its threshold determination that issuance of the contemplated wastewater discharge permit will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bitterrooters similarly do not challenge DEQ\u2019s identification and evaluation of alternatives to the issuance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>discharge permit as required by \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-201(1)(b)(i)(B) and -220(1), MCA. Therefore, we review Bitterrooters\u2019 assertion of error only as it relates to the sufficiency of the final EA as the mechanism of required ME PA review.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b621 Except for requiring evaluation of cumulative impacts of a proposed project \u201cwhen appropriate,\u201d \u00a7 75-1-208(11), MCA, MEPAdoes not specify the required contents or scope of a preliminary EA. <em>See, </em>e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-102(1) and (3), -201(1)(b)(i)(B), and -220(5), MCA. In this context, the Legislature has directed the Montana Board of Environmental Review (BER) to promulgate rules specifying the general MEPA requirements for DEQ actions. Sections 75-5-103(3) and -201, MCA (BER rulemaking authority under MWQA); Admin. R. M. 17.4.102, .607(2) through (4), .608, and .609. An EA may be in a \u201cstandard checklist\u201d form for \u201croutine action with limited environmental impact.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(2). For other actions, an EA must be in a narrative form \u201ccontaining a more detailed analysis of specified criteria.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(2) and (3). In either form, an EA must include, inter alia, \u201can evaluation of the impacts, including cumulative and secondary impacts,\u201d on the \u201cphysical environment\u201d and on the \u201chuman population in the area to be affected by the proposed action.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e); see also, \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-102(1) and (3)(a), -201(1)(a), -208(11), and -220(5), MCA (in re cumulative impacts). Impacts may be adverse, beneficial, or both. Admin. R. M. 17.4.608(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b622 Relevant criteria for evaluation of secondary impacts of the proposed action on the physical environment include, \u201cwhere appropriate[,] terrestrial and aquatic life and habitats; water quality, quantity, and distribution; geology; soil quality, stability, and moisture; vegetation cover, quantity and quality; aesthetics; air quality; unique, endangered, fragile, or limited environmental resources; historical and archaeological sites; and demands on environmental resources of land, water, air and energy.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) (emphasis added). The term \u201chuman environment\u201d includes \u201cbiological, physical, social, economic, cultural, and aesthetic factors that interrelate to form the environment.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.603(12). Relevant criteria for evaluation of secondary impacts of a proposed action on the affected human population include, \u201cwhere appropriate, social structures and mores; cultural uniqueness and diversity; access to and quality of recreational and wilderness activities; local and state tax base and tax revenues; agricultural or industrial production; human health; quantity and distribution of employment; distribution and density of population and housing; demands for government services; industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>and commercial activity; locally adopted environmental plans and goals; and other appropriate social and economic circumstances.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(e) (emphasis added). By operation of the qualifying language \u201cwhere appropriate,\u201d the laundry lists of secondary impact evaluation criteria in Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e), are not mandatory evaluation criteria in every case. Rather, the relevance or propriety of particular criterion, if any, depends on the nature of the proposed state action in each particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b623 Though it mandates \u201cadequate review\u201d of potential environmental impacts of state actions, MEPA does not specifically define what constitutes a triggering state action.

In this case, the state action triggering MEPA review was the proposed issuance of a DEQ MGWPCS groundwater discharge permit pursuant to Title 75, chapter 5, part 4, MCA, and Admin. R. M.

R. M. 17.4.603(18). MEPA statutes and rules do not define the term \u201cdirect impact.\u201d By comparison, NEPA does not define a \u201cdirect impact\u201d but defines \u201cdirect effects\u201d as effects or impacts <em>\u201ccaused by the action </em>... at the same time and place.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.8(a) (emphasis added). In concluding that Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e) required DEQ to consider impacts of the construction and operation of the facility beyond those merely related to water quality or the construction of the required wastewater system, the District Court essentially concluded that those other impacts were secondary impacts of the issuance of the permit itself rather than of the permitted activity. In other words, the construction and operation of the retail store would not occur <em>\u201cbut for\u201d </em>the issuance of the wastewater permit. Thus, the District Court expansively shifted the focus of MEPA on impacts caused by the permitted action to the much broader and more attenuated action and resulting impacts that would not occur \u201cbut for\u201d the issuance of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s expansive tail-wagging-the-dog reasoning is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>backwards as a matter of fact and erroneous as a matter of law. Logically, the permitted wastewater discharge from the facility, and the related construction of its component wastewater treatment system, are not the causes-in-fact of the larger construction and operation of the retail store. Rather, the construction and operation of the retail store are the causes-in-fact of the wastewater discharge and related treatment system. MEPA, like NEPA, requires \u201ca reasonably close causal relationship\u201d between the subject government action and the particular environmental effect. <em>Department of Transportation v.

Ct. at 2212. The EA concluded that NEPA did not require the sub-agency to consider the broader environmental impacts of increased Mexican truck traffic in the U.S. because NAFTA, and related presidential action, was the cause of the traffic increase, not the sub-agency\u2019s safety regulations. <em>Public Citizen, </em>541 U.S. at 761, 124 S.

On review, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the environmental groups and unions that the sub-agency EA violated NEPA because, even though NAFTA was the cause of the traffic increase, Mexican trucks could not operate here unless they complied with the sub-agency\u2019s safety regulations. <em>Public Citizen, </em>541 U.S. at 761, 124 S.

The Supreme Court held that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s expansive \u201cbut for\u201d standard of causation was \u201cinsufficient to make an agency responsible for a particular effect\u201d because \u201cNEPA requires \u2018a reasonably close causal relationship\u2019 between the environmental effect and the alleged cause.\u201d <em>Public Citizen, </em>541 U.S. at 767, 124 S.

By analogy to the \u201cfamiliar doctrine of proximate cause from tort law,\u201d the Court characterized NEPA\u2019s more demanding causation standard as drawing a \u201cmanageable line between those causal changes that may make an actor responsible for an effect and those that do not <em>.\u2019\u2019Public Citizen, </em>541 U.S. at 767, 124 S.

The Supreme Court thus analyzed the requisite causal connection triggering NEPA review as a function of NEPA\u2019s essential purposes to ensure that (1) agencies adequately consider environmental impacts of their actions and (2) the interested public can monitor agency proceedings and \u201cplay a role\u201d in the agency decision-making process and the implementation of the decisions. <em>Public Citizen, </em>541 U.S. at 768, 124 S.

In that case, wilderness and environmental protection groups challenged the sufficiency of an EIS issued by DEQ\u2019s predecessor agency, the Department of Health and Environmental Services (DHES), incident to issuance of a certificate of approval of a proposed 95-acre subdivision in the Big Sky resort area for compliance with applicable water supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal regulations. <em>Montana Wilderness Ass\u2019n, </em>171 Mont. at 478-82, 559 P.2d at 1158-59. The plaintiffs asserted that DHES violated MEPA by failing to consider the potential environmental impacts of the proposed subdivision beyond the impacts of the water supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal issues within the scope of DHES\u2019 regulatory authority. <em>Montana Wilderness Ass\u2019n, </em>171 Mont. at 480-82, 559 P.2d at 1159. Reasoning that the proposed subdivision could not proceed without the requested water supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal regulation compliance certificate, the District Court concluded that MEPA required DHES to consider all potential environmental impacts of the subdivision regardless of the limited scope of its regulatory authority. <em>Montana Wilderness Ass\u2019n, </em>171 Mont. at 482-83, 559 P.2d at 1160. We reversed, holding that the District Court\u2019s reasoning erroneously extended DHES \u201ccontrol over subdivisions beyond\u201d the scope of its limited authority to enforce applicable water supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal regulations. <em>Montana Wilderness Ass\u2019n, </em>171 Mont. at 484-85, 559 P.2d at 1161.

More significantly, while MEPA and NEPA do indeed command agencies to comply with applicable environmental review requirements \u201cto the fullest extent possible,\u201d we cannot properly construe MEPA in isolation.

U.S. Postal Service, </em>516 F.2d 378 (2nd Cir. 1975) (requiring U.S. Postal Service to consider impacts of contemplated third-party construction of multi-story housing project on top of a contemplated ground floor postal vehicle maintenance facility as a secondary impact of construction of the postal facility); <em>City of Davis v.

With some variations and distinctions, the cases cited by the District Court are arguably consistent with Bitterrooters\u2019 expansive \u201cbut for\u201d theory of MEPA causation insofar as they focused on potential impacts of contemplated future development that would result beyond the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>authority over the action that triggered NEPA review in the first place. However, the federal Circuit Courts decided those cases longbefore the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the appropriate standard of NEPA causation in <em>Public Citizen. </em>Thus, in light of <em>Public Citizen, </em>prior inconsistent lower court decisions in <em>Chelsea, Davis, </em>and <em>Sierra Club </em>are distinguishable and insufficiently persuasive to overrule or limit <em>Montana Wilderness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b632 In apparent recognition of this problem, Bitterrooters cite <em>Save Our Sonoran, Inc. (SOS) v. Flowers, </em>408 F.3d 1113 (9th Cir. 2005) (requiring Corps of Engineers to consider impacts of private construction of gated community in Arizona desert as secondary impacts of issuance of permit to dredge and fill dry streambeds that collected and carried occasional heavy rain runoff) as additional support for the District Court\u2019s ruling. However, <em>SOS </em>is factually distinguishable because: (1) the Corps had authority to regulate the filling of dry streambeds in the Arizona desert; (2) dry capillaries to the streambeds inextricably permeated the entirety of the subdivision site; and (3) extensive filling of the entirety of the system on the subdivision site would impact plants and animals dependent on water collected by the system. <em>SOS, </em>408 F.3d at 1118-23. Despite loose dictum that NEPA required the Corps to consider environmental impacts \u201cwith no impact on [its] jurisdictional waters,\u201d the Ninth Circuit actually recognized <em>Public Citizen\u2019s </em>more stringent NEPA causation standard and merely held that the requisite \u201ccausal nexus\u201d existed on the unique facts of the case between the Corps\u2019 independent regulatory authority and the subject environmental impacts. <em>SOS, </em>408 F.3d at 1121-23. Consequently, <em>SOS </em>is not persuasive authority upon which to distinguish <em>Public Citizen </em>or overrule or limit <em>Montana Wilderness </em>.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW0z\">\u00b633  We hold that MEPA, like NEPA, requires a reasonably close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>causal relationship between the triggering state action and the subject environmental effect. We reject the unyielding \u201cbut for\u201d causation standard asserted by Bitterrooters to the effect that a state action is a cause of an environmental impact regardless of whether the agency, in the lawful exercise of its independent authority, can avoid or mitigate the effect. We hold that, for purposes of MEPA, an agency action is a legal cause of an environmental effect only if the agency can prevent the effect through the lawful exercise of its independent authority. As in <em>Public Citizen, </em>requiring a state agency to consider environmental impacts it has no authority to lawfully prevent would not serve MEPA\u2019s purposes of ensuring that agencies and the interested public have sufficient information regarding relevant environmental impacts to inform the lawful exercise of agency authority. Sections 75-1-102(3), -104(1), -201(4)(a), MCA. Section 75-1-201(1), MCA, merely requires state agencies to comply with applicable MEPA requirements \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d within the scope of the lawful exercise of their independent authority. <em>Accord, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 75-1-102(3), -104(1), -201(4)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b634 Contrary to the assertions of the dissent in <em>Montana Wilderness </em>and Bitterrooters here, our holdings in these cases do not gut MEPA. In accordance with its express language, MEPA still requires state agencies to adequately consider, \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d within the scope of their independent authority, all direct and secondary environmental impacts that will likely result from the specific activity conducted or permitted by the agency. The problem for Bitterrooters is that the broader environmental impacts of the larger construction and operation of the retail store are not subject to MEPA review because the Legislature has not placed general land use control in the hands of a state agency. As recognized in <em>Montana Wilderness </em>over 40 years ago, the Legislature has, with limited exceptions, placed general land use control beyond the reach of MEPA in the hands of local governments. <em>See, </em>Title 76, chapters 1-3, MCA (Subdivision and Platting Act and local zoning enabling Acts). Regardless of MEPA\u2019s manifest beneficial purpose and Bitterrooters\u2019 otherwise compelling public policy arguments, we simply cannot properly stretch MEPA beyond the limits of its language and stated purpose to fill an environmental review gap created by the Legislature and remaining within its domain to remedy if so inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\">\u00b635  In this case, the District Court did not conclude that DEQ failed to adequately consider the secondary environmental impacts, as defined by Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e), of the permitted wastewater discharge or related construction of the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>wastewater treatment system. Rather, the District Court concluded that DEQ violated Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e) by failing to consider other non-water quality related impacts of the larger construction and operation of the facility as secondary impacts of issuance of the contemplated MWQA wastewater discharge permit. Bitterrooters acknowledge that, had DEQ expanded the scope of its EA beyond its water quality regulatory authority to consider those impacts as demanded, it would have had no authority to deny or limit the requested MWQA wastewater discharge permit to prevent or mitigate those impacts. <em>See, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 75-1-102(3)(b), -104(1), and -201(4)(a), MCA. Thus, issuance of the requested MWQA wastewater permit was not a legal cause of environmental impacts of the larger construction and operation of the retail facility unrelated to water quality or the construction of the required wastewater treatment system. We hold that the District Court erroneously concluded that DEQ violated MEPA, in contravention of Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e), by failing to further consider the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the facility other than water quality impacts and impacts of the related construction of the required wastewater treatment system.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b636 <em>Issue 2: Does MEPA require DEQ to identify the actual owner or operator of a wastewater treatment facility prior to issuing a MWQA groundwater discharge </em>permit?</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b637 Incident to its MEPA secondary impacts ruling, the District Court further ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">When it reconsiders Foss\u2019 application, ... DEQ must identify the facility operator if the operator\u2019s identity has the potential to impact vegetation, aesthetics, human health and safety, industrial and commercial activities, employment, tax revenues, demand for government services, or other environmental resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">In context, and by comparison of similar language, we infer the unattributed source of the referenced criteria to be Admin. R. M. 17.4.603(12) and .609(3)(d) and (e) (cumulative and secondary impact evaluation criteria). Thus, the District Court essentially ruled that MEPA requires DEQ to identify the contemplated facility operator if the facility operator, in conjunction with the nature of the operation, is predisposed to operate the facility in a manner that has the potential to impact any of the evaluation criteria referenced in Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b638 Landowners assert that the District Court improperly crafted an unnecessary and unworkable test from whole cloth. They further assert that District Court\u2019s test is no test at all because it will always require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>DEQ to speculatively assess potential environmental impacts of a subject activity based on the identity, reputation, and past practices of the contemplated facility owner and operator. Landowners finally assert that the test is unnecessary in any event because all interested parties now know the identity of the contemplated owner and operator of the subject facility, <em>i.e., </em>Walmart, and that Admin. R. M. 17.30.1360 will ultimately require identification, and afford DEQ an opportunity for subsequent review of permit conditions, upon the eventual transfer of the permit to the actual contemplated owner or operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b639 Bitterrooters contrarily assert that the identity of the contemplated owner and operator of a permitted facility is information directly relevant to consideration of the potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the facility as a whole. Without citation to any statutory or administrative provision of MEPA or MWQA, Bitterrooters assert that \u201csecretive planning serves no legitimate public policy purpose\u201d and \u201cleaving the identity of the true applicant a secret violates the letter and spirit of MEPA.\u201d DEQ is strangely silent on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b640 At the crux of the matter, contrary to Landowners\u2019 assertion, the transfer of an agency permit to a new owner or operator generally will \u201cnot trigger [MEPA] review.\u201d Section 75-1-201(1)(d), MCA (permit transfer triggers MEPA only upon \u201ca material change in terms or conditions\u201d of the permit or as otherwise provided by law). Page 13, Section M, of the subject DEQ-Foss MGWPCS permit expressly provides that \u201c[t]his permit may be automatically transferred\u201d to a new permitee on thirty-day notice to DEQ, payment of applicable fees, and submittal of a written transfer agreement between Foss and the transferee \u201ccontaining a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between them.\u201d Thus, Landowners\u2019 assertion that subsequent identification of the actual owner or operator on transfer of the permit will remedy any legitimate environmental concern is somewhat disingenuous given that the contemplated transfer will not likely trigger MEPA review. By the same token, despite the facial appeal of Bitterrooters\u2019 concern that nondisclosure of the identity of the contemplated owner or operator of a facility could potentially result in inadequate review of an agency action otherwise subject to MEPA, the concern is unsubstantiated on the factual record in this case. More significantly, Bitterrooters\u2019 assertion, and the District Court\u2019s resulting ruling, is unsupported by any legal authority other than the general principle that MEPA requires an agency to adequately compile and assess all environmental data relevant to a particular agency action. <em>See, Clark Fork </em>Coal., \u00b6 47; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Ravalli County Fish &amp; Game Ass\u2019n, </em>273 Mont. at 381, 903 P.2d at 1369. Rather than follow the parties down the garden path into the public policy realm of the Legislature while DEQ stands quietly by, we more fundamentally and appropriately look to the largely overlooked governing requirements for MWQA permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b641 With its limited focus on identification and assessment of relevant environmental impacts of proposed state agency actions, MEPA does not govern what information an application must contain for issuance of an agency permit subject to MEPA review. For the sole purpose of determining the deadlines for agency completion of required environmental review under \u00a7 75-1-208(4)(a), MCA, and Admin. R. M. 17.4.620, MEPA defines a \u201ccomplete application\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-5\">an application for a permit, license, or other authorization that contains all data, studies, plans, information, forms, fees, and signatures <em>required </em>to be included with the application sufficient <em>for the agency to approve the application under the applicable statutes and rules.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Section 75-1-220(3), MCA (emphasis added). As contemplated by the highlighted language of \u00a7 75-1-220(3), MCA, MWQA governs what information an application must contain for issuance of an MGWPCS discharge permit. Sections 75-5-401 and -402, MCA (DEQ duty under MWQA to regulate wastewater discharge pursuant to BER rules); Admin. R. M.

M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>17.30.1304(5) and .1322(1)(a) and (b) (\u201call applicants shall submit applications\u201d on DEQ standard Form 1 available at http://perma.cc/MD4G-2XPW). For purposes of the applicable MWQA regulations and DEQ Form 1, the term \u201c \u2018owner or operator\u2019 means any person <em>who owns </em>..., <em>operates, controls, or supervises </em>a point source.\u201d Admin. R. M. 17.30.1304(48). MGWPCS rules specifically command that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\">No application will be processed by [DEQ] until <em>all </em>of the requested information is supplied and the application is complete. [DEQ] shall make a determination of the completeness of the information with 30 calendar days of receipt of an application. Admin. R. M. 17.30.1024(1) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b643 Here, the subject wastewater permit application identified real estate broker Lee Foss as the applicant and contemplated operator of the proposed retail facility and required wastewater treatment system. However, it is undisputed on the record that Foss was never going to be the actual owner or operator of the facility. He requested the MGWPCS permit to facilitate the sale of the property to a particular third-party known to Foss and Landowners who would then construct and operate the facility. Upon sale of the property, Foss would transfer the permit to the intended owner and operator. Thus, Foss was not the owner or operator, or even the contemplated owner or operator, of the subject facility as referenced in Admin. R. M. 17.30.1023(3) and DEQ Form 1.</p>\n<p id=\"atu-dedup-0\">\u00b644  DEQ\u2019s April 29, 2014 notice of application deficiencies and its Director\u2019s subsequent inquiry of Foss, clearly manifest that DEQ was aware of the standard requirement that a MGWPCS application identify the actual owner or operator of the subject facility responsible for the contemplated wastewater discharge. DEQ must \u201cissue, suspend, revoke, modify, or deny permits to discharge sewage ... into state waters ... <em>consistently with </em>[BER] <em>rules.\u201d </em>Section 75-5-402(1), MCA (emphasis added). Why or on what basis DEQ acquiesced to Foss\u2019 refusal to identify the actual contemplated owner or operator of the facility is unclear from the record on appeal. Regardless, we hold that, as implemented by DEQ Form 1 (Ver. 1.2 - Rev. 5/12), Admin. R. M. 17.30.1023(3) and .1024(1), requires DEQ to identify the actual owner or operator of the contemplated facility for which an applicant seeks the subject wastewater discharge permit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We will affirm a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>court ruling that reaches the right result even if for the wrong reason. <em>Earth Resources Ltd. Partnership v. North Blaine Estates, Inc., </em>1998 MT 254, \u00b6 29, 291 Mont. 216, 967 P.2d 376. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment that DEQ must identify and disclose the actual contemplated owner or operator of the facility for which the applicant seeks the subject wastewater discharge permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b645 We hereby reverse the District Court\u2019s summary judgment that DEQ violated MEPA, in contravention of Admin. R. M. 17.4.609(3)(d) and (e), by failing to further consider environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the facility other than water quality impacts and impacts of the related construction of the required wastewater treatment system. We further hereby affirm the District Court\u2019s summary judgment that DEQ must identify and disclose the actual contemplated owner or operator of the subject retail store facility.</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> Title 75, Chapters 1-3, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> Sections 75-5-401 through -405, MCA (DEQ duty to regulate wastewater discharge pursuant to Board of Environmental Review rules), and Admin.
