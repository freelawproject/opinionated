We affirm, and address the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by holding that the statute of limitations had run on Kingman\u2019s claim for conversion of property?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b62 On September 17, 2008, Kingman inflicted serious injuries upon another man in a drunken altercation outside a bar in Bozeman. Kingman fled the scene, but was arrested later that day. Bozeman City Police took Kingman to the Bozeman Deaconess Hospital, where photos were taken, apparently showing him wearing a wristwatch. Police took Kingman\u2019s personal property into custody, including the watch.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\u00b63 Kingman was charged with attempted deliberate homicide and convicted of aggravated assault, a lesser included offense, following a jury trial. The District Court sentenced Kingman to twenty years in Montana State Prison, imposed $183,115.45 in restitution, and ordered Kingman to register as a violent offender. On November 1, 2011, this Court upheld Kingman\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Kingman, </em>2011 MT 269, 362 Mont. 330, 264 P.3d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">\u00b64 On December 19,2013, Weightman, the senior evidence technician for the Bozeman Police Department, sent a letter informing Kingman his personal property was authorized to be released and that Kingman could arrange to have it picked up. The letter listed several items, including a watch. Kingman arranged for his aunt to have the watch shipped to her home. On March 13, 2014, Weightman sent another letter, which advised Kingman that the watch was not his. Kingman alleged that his public defender had contacted Weightman to arrange return of the watch, but that Weightman had told Kingman\u2019s public defender that he was not inclined to return the watch due to a nasty letter he received from Kingman.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">\u00b65 On July 9, 2015, Kingman initiated this action against Weightman, alleging that Weightman had failed to return Kingman\u2019s blue faced titanium Citizens wristwatch, which, according to the complaint, was valued at $800. The final Amended Complaint sought damages for \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201cmalicious intent.\u201d The District Court, with the approval of the parties, deemed the theft claim as one for conversion of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">\u00b66 Weightman moved for Summary Judgment, arguing the two-year statute of limitations for conversion had expired and that malicious intent was not a recognized cause of action in Montana. Reasoning that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Kingman had six months after the completion of his criminal proceedings to request return of his property, pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-305, MCA, and that he \u201cshould have been aware\u201d of any wrongful act by that time, the District Court held that the two-year limitation period on the conversion claim had expired prior to the filing of the suit, and entered judgment in favor of Weightman. Kingman appeals, arguing only the statute of limitations issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo, </em>applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the District Court. <em>Belanus v. Potter, </em>2017 MT 95, \u00b6 13, 387 Mont. 298, 394 P.3d 906. Summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Belanus, </em>\u00b6 13; M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Whether a district court correctly applied the statute of limitations is a question of law we review for correctness. <em>Belanus, </em>\u00b6 14 <em>(citing Ehrman v. Kaufman, </em>2010 MT 284, \u00b6 10, 358 Mont. 519, 246 P.3d 1048).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err by holding that the statute of limitations had run on Kingman\u2019s claim for conversion for property </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u00b69 \u201cWhen deciding which statute of limitations applies, this Court will look to the substance of the complaint.\u201d <em>Johnson Farms, Inc. v. Halland, </em>2012 MT 215, \u00b6 19, 366 Mont. 299, 291 P.3d 1096 (citations omitted). Kingman alleged an unauthorized exercise of dominion over his personal property by Weightman, which the District Court, with consent of the parties, properly treated as a claim of conversion. <em>See, e.g., Gebhardt v. D.A. Davidson &amp; Co., </em>203 Mont. 384, 389, 661 P.2d 855, 858 (1983) (defining elements of the tort of conversion).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b610 Section 27-2-207, MCA, provides a two-year period for commencement of property torts, including actions \u201cfor ... taking, detaining, or injuring any goods or chattels, including actions for the specific recovery of personal property....\u201d We have applied this section to conversion claims. <em>See Action Enters. by &amp; Through Lindeman v. McCalla, </em>259 Mont. 167, 170, 855 P.2d 111, 113 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b611 A statutory procedure governs the return of property seized as evidence. Section 46-5-312, MCA, provides that \u201c[a] person claiming the right to possession of property seized as evidence may apply to the judge for its return ... and [the judge] shall hold a hearing to determine the right of possession.\u201d However, \u201c[if] property seized as evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>not claimed within [six] months of completion of the case for which it was seized, it must be disposed of Section 46-5-305, MCA. Kingman\u2019s criminal case was completed on November 1,2011, when we affirmed his conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kingman did not apply for return of the property, either during or after his criminal case. The Police could have disposed of the property, under the process set forth by statute, on or after May 1, 2012, six months after the completion of Kingman\u2019s case. \u00b612 Under \u00a7 27-2-102(1)(a), MCA, a claim accrues \u201cwhen all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action ....\u201d The elements of conversion are: (1) the plaintiffs ownership and right of possession of the personal property; (2) its conversion by the defendant, meaning a \u201cdistinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over one\u2019s property in denial of, or inconsistent with, the owner\u2019s right,\u201d or an \u201cunauthorized assumption of dominion over [personal property] in hostility to the right of the owner\u201d; and (3) resulting damages. <em>Gebhardt, </em>203 Mont. at 389, 661 P.2d at 858 (1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b613 Kingman argues he did not discover the harm until March 2014, when Weightman notified Kingman he would not return the watch. The District Court stated that Kingman \u201cshould have become aware\u201d of the alleged wrongful act no later than May 2012, six months after his criminal case was completed, and it requires no speculation to conclude that Kingman was aware his property had been taken and held during his court proceedings. Regardless, under \u00a7 27-2-102(2), MCA, \u201c[l]ack of knowledge of the claim or cause of action, or of its accrual... does not postpone the beginning of the period of limitation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1-m\">\u00b614  We conclude that Kingman\u2019s claim accrued, at the latest, six months after the completion of Kingman\u2019s case, or May 1, 2012, because all three elements of conversion were then present. First, Kingman had some right or interest in the personal property, although, given that the City\u2019s statutory right to seek disposal of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>had ripened, Kingman\u2019s interest may have been compromised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Second, Weightman\u2019s dominion over the watch would have been inconsistent with Kingman\u2019s ownership. Finally, Kingman\u2019s damages, including the loss of his property, were present. However, Kingman\u2019s first complaint was not filed until July 9, 2015, well beyond the two-year limitations period provided in \u00a7 27-2-207, MCA, for conversion claims, which would have expired on May 1, 2014. The claim is thus time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b615 Kingman argues that we should apply the longer statute of limitations applicable to contract claims. However, this is a new theory raised on appeal, and we decline to address it. It is well-established, with a few exceptions, that we will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal as it would be fundamentally unfair to the trial court. <em>In re C.B., </em>2017 MT 83, \u00b6 16, 387 Mont. 231, 392 P.3d 598.</p>\n<p id=\"ARUs\">\u00b616  Although it would have been prudent for the Police Department to more closely adhere to the property disposition provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 46-5-301 et seq., MCA, in its handling of the watch, instead of sending Kingman a letter over two years after the close of his criminal case, any claim by Kingman for conversion accrued by May 1, 2012, and the period of limitation expired by May 1, 2014. Statutes of limitation, prescribed by the Legislature, serve the important purpose of suppressing stale claims that make mounting a defense difficult due to the passage of time. <em>E.W. v. D.C.H., </em>231 Mont. 481, 484, 754 P.2d 817, 818-19 (1988). The underlying policy is one of fairness and substantial justice to ensure both parties have the opportunity to fully present both sides of a controversy. <em>E.W., </em>231 Mont. at 484, 754 P.2d at 818-19. We conclude the District Court did not err in granting Weightman\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-8\">JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER, McKINNON and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> The District Court stated that Kingman\u2019s conviction was affirmed on November 21, 2011, but our opinion was published on November 1, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> A statutory discovery exception applies to this rule only if \u201cthe facts constituting the claim are by their nature concealed or self-concealing\u201d or \u201cthe defendant has taken action which prevents the injured party from discovering the injury or its cause.\u201d Section 27-2-102(3), MCA.
