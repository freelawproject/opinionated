In 2012, Folsom was one of many advocating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the Whitefish Police Protective Association (WPPA), a union of officers of the Whitefish Police Department, affiliate with MPEA. Following a contentious process that resulted in WPPA affiliating with MPEA, the City suspended Folsom on February 13, 2013, with notice of intent to terminate his employment for cause under the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) between the City and MPEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b64 At the time of the termination notice, MPEA was the exclusive bargaining agent for the WPPA under the CBA and the Montana Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The CBA provided a four-step employee grievance process. Either MPEA or the aggrieved employee could initiate Steps 1 and 2 of the process but only MPEA could initiate Steps 3 and 4. MPEA field representative Darcy Dahle timely initiated Steps 1 and 2 on Folsom\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b65 After the City denied Folsom\u2019s grievance at Steps 1 and 2, Dahle attempted to initiate Step 3 of the process by correspondence to the City Manager dated April 2,2013. The City Manager rejected the Step 3 grievance as untimely initiated beyond the ten-day deadline specified by the CBA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the condition that MPEA produce certain documentation, the City nonetheless offered to participate in the Step 3 process despite its assertion that it had no obligation to do so. Dahle refused the City\u2019s document request and proposed binding arbitration to resolve the Step 3 timeliness issue. Upon the City\u2019s rejection of the arbitration proposal, Dahle next proposed to resolve the issue by mediation through the Board of Personnel Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Standing on its assertion that MPEA failed to timely initiate Step 3, the City refused and declared Folsom\u2019s grievance rights exhausted pursuant to the terms of the CBA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b66 MPEA ultimately referred the matter for further action to in-house counsel, Carter Picotte, who was thereafter exclusively responsible for handling F olsom\u2019s grievance on behalf of MPEA. Picotte submitted a notice of appeal to the City Police Commission pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to CBA Step 4 and \u00a7 7-32-4155(1), MCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, the City reasserted that Folsom and MPEA waived the police commission remedy under the terms of the CBA by failing to timely initiate CBA Step 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b67 Over the next year, Picotte scheduled several meetings with Folsom to discuss the status and future course of his grievance but ultimately cancelled each meeting. Picotte nonetheless repeatedly assured Folsom that he was taking appropriate action to enforce his grievance rights. On or about October 25,2013, Picotte specifically told Folsom that he had filed and would aggressively prosecute a district court action against the City to enforce Folsom\u2019s CBA grievance rights. Picotte contemporaneously made a similar representation to MPEA\u2019s executive director, Quint Nyman. On at least one occasion, Nyman directed Picotte to proceed on Folsom\u2019s grievance without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b68 However, at some point in mid-2014, Folsom discovered that, contrary to earlier representations, Picotte had taken no action on his behalf. Upon this discovery, Folsom retained separate counsel and, on August 6, 2014, filed a district court complaint asserting a wrongful discharge claim against the City and DFR and common law fraud claims against MPEA. In essence, the claims alleged that: (1) the City wrongfully terminated him in violation of the CBA; (2) MPEA breached its duty to fairly represent him; and (3) MPEA, through Picotte, fraudulently induced Folsom to effectively waive his grievance rights through inaction. As compensatory damages on his claims against the union, Folsom prayed for lost wages and benefits as well as attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the action. Folsom also prayed for punitive damages on the fraud claim. Upon learning of the complaint from an MPEA field representative, Nyman spoke with Picotte, who assured Nyman that he would be taking appropriate action in defense of MPEA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and in furtherance of Folsom\u2019s grievance rights. Picotte made asimilar representation to Nyman on at least one occasion thereafter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Afp\">\u00b69 Upon service of the district court complaint, Picotte timely appeared and answered Folsom\u2019s claims against MPEA. On September 19, 2014, Folsom served comprehensive discovery requests on Picotte that included sixty-nine M. R. Civ. P. 36 (Rule 36) requests for admission of pertinent facts. Inexplicably, Picotte did not respond. Based on MPEA\u2019s Rule 36 deemed admissions by default and a supplemental affidavit showing, Folsom subsequently moved for M. R. Civ. P. 56 (Rule 56) summary judgment that MPEA was liable on his DFR and common law fraud claims. Folsom did not seek summary judgment on his wrongful discharge claim against the City or on the causation and damages elements of his claims against the union. The City separately moved for summary judgment on Folsom\u2019s wrongful discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b610 Without seeking relief from the Rule 36 deemed admissions, Picotte filed a response opposing Folsom\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the asserted grounds that: (1) the fraud claim failed to state a claim against MPEA; (2) MPEA\u2019s general pleading denials raised genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment; (3) as a non-party to the agreement, Folsom had no standing to enforce the CBA; and (4) Folsom failed to exhaust his contract grievance remedies, <em>i.e., </em>CBA Step 4 (police commission appeal). Picotte attempted no responsive factual showing to preclude summary judgment and inexplicably failed to appear and represent MPEA at the summary judgment hearing on May 26, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b611 On June 17, 2015, while the summary judgment ruling was still pending after hearing, Folsom entered into a settlement agreement with the City wherein he resigned his employment and released all claims against the City without compensation. The agreement included an express disclaimer of any City liability related to Folsom\u2019s claims. The agreement barred the City from \u201cactively challengl ingj\u201d Folsom\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>claims against MPEA but recognized that City witnesses could \u201ctestify truthfully in any proceeding if called to testify.\u201d The District Court ultimately dismissed the City from the action with prejudice pursuant to the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b612 On July 15, 2015, based on MPEA\u2019s Rule 36 deemed admissions, Folsom\u2019s supplemental affidavit showing, and no responsive factual showing from MPEA, the District Court granted summary judgment against MPEA on Folsom\u2019s DFR and common law fraud claims. On the DFR claim, the court decreed, <em>inter alia, </em>that the record facts showed that \u201cMPEA arbitrarily ignored Folsom\u2019s grievance or processed it in a perfunctory manner,\u201d thereby effectively extinguishing his CBA grievance rights. Concluding that Picotte\u2019s misrepresentations to Folsom on or about October 25, 2013, regarding the fictitious district court action against the City constituted both common law fraud and actual fraud, as defined by \u00a7 27-1-221(3) and (4), MCA, the District Court further granted summary judgment that MPEA was liable for punitive damages on Folsom\u2019s common law fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b613 On September 1, 2015, the District Court conducted a post-summary judgment evidentiary hearing to determine compensatory damages on Folsom\u2019s DFR claim and punitive damages on the fraud claim. Appearing on MPEA\u2019s behalf, Picotte acknowledged that he had \u201cmade some misrepresentations of scheduling and that sort of thing to Mr. Folsom because I got busy and I didn\u2019t have the courage to tell him that I just hadn\u2019t gotten it done.\u201d However, Picotte asserted that his false statements caused \u201cno real damages\u201d because Folsom \u201cwon\u2019t have lost his job until the grievance procedure and litigation fomented by it are concluded.\u201d Picotte further asserted that the City, not MPEA, was exclusively responsible for Folsom\u2019s discharge and any resulting wage loss. Based on the assertion that Picotte\u2019s failure to act after the City refused to participate in the Step 3 process in April of 2013 effected a waiver of his CBA grievance rights and caused him to have to sue the City and MPEA, Folsom requested compensatory damages for wages and benefits lost after April 1, 2013,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> emotional distress, and attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the action. Folsom also requested $50,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b614 On March 14,2016, prior to issuance of the District Court\u2019s ruling on the damages, MPEA appeared through new counsel and filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) (Rule 60(b)) requesting that the court delay its damages ruling to allow MPEA to file an appropriate motion for relief from the prior summary judgment rulings based on alleged gross neglect and misconduct by Picotte in his representation of MPEA. On March 16,2016, without reference to MPEA\u2019s motion, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgment on Folsom\u2019s DFR and common law fraud claims based on the court\u2019s prior grant of summary judgment and the post-summary judgment hearing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\u00b615 On the ground that he failed to meet his threshold burden of proving that the City wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of the CBA, the District Court denied Folsom\u2019s claim for lost wages and benefits. The court also denied Folsom\u2019s claim for emotional distress damages due to lack of proof of related emotional distress. However, on the ground that MPEA\u2019s failure to fairly represent him in the grievance process \u201cforced [him] to hire a lawyer in order to obtain representation that the MPEA should have provided in the first place,\u201d the court awarded Folsom $47,550 in compensatory damages for attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the district court action. The court also awarded him $50,000 in punitive damages on his common law fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b616 Folsom and MPEA respectively filed alternative M. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60(b) motions for post-judgment relief. On the asserted grounds of unfair surprise and that the District Court erroneously interjected lack of evidence as an affirmative defense <em>sua sponte, </em>Folsom requested a new trial to allow him to present evidence proving that the City discharged him in violation of the CBA. MPEA sought relief on the asserted ground of prejudicial gross neglect and misconduct by Picotte in the representation of MPEA. MPEA supported its motion with exhibits and affidavits showing its reliance on Picotte and its belated discovery of his alleged gross neglect and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b617 The District Court effectively denied the parties\u2019 cross-motions by allowing them to time-out without action pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59(f) and 60(c)(1). Upon entry of final judgment on June 15,2016, both parties timely appealed. MPEA asserts that the District erroneously awarded Folsom attorney fees and punitive damages and erroneously denied its alternative motions for post-judgment relief. Folsom asserts that the District Court erroneously denied his claim for lost wages and benefits as compensatory damages on his DFR claim and erroneously denied his alternative motion for related post-judgment relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b618 The standard of review of district court findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous on the pertinent evidentiary record. We review conclusions of law de novo for correctness. The standard of review of district court rulings on motions for post-judgment relief under M. R. Civ. P. 59 and 60(b) is an abuse of discretion. <em>Lee v. USAA Cas. Ins. Co., </em>2001 MT 59, \u00b6 27, 304 Mont. 356, 22 P.3d 631 (Rule 59); <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451 (Rule 60(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b619 <em>1. Is Folsom\u2019s common law fraud claim independently cognizable distinct from his DFR claim on the record in this </em>case?</p>\n<p id=\"Alp\">\u00b620  The question of whether separately pled claims for relief are independently cognizable on the record in the same action is a question of law. The District Court granted summary judgment against MPEA on Folsom\u2019s separate DFR and common law fraud claims. Conflating common law fraud with \u201cactual fraud,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA, the District Court concluded that \u201cFolsom has established that MPEA committed the tort of fraud so, pursuant to [\u00a7] 27-1-221, MCA, [he] is entitled to seek punitive damages as a consequence thereof.\u201d On the ground that \u201call of attorney Picotte\u2019s conduct related exclusively to his handling of Folsom\u2019s grievance,\u201d MPEA asserts that Folsom\u2019s common law fraud claim is legally and factually subsumed in his DFR claim and thus not independently cognizable in this action. Folsom contrarily asserts that his common law fraud claim is cognizable independent of his DFR claim based on a different factual predicates. The parties\u2019 briefing and the District Court\u2019s judgments clearly indicate that Folsom separately pled DFR and common law fraud claims to circumvent a perceived per se federal law ban on recovery of punitive damages on DFR claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b621 A plaintiff generally has a choice of any remedy cognizable at law or equity and may generally plead alternative claims even if based on the same predicate facts. <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Center, </em>2008 MT 283, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111; <em>Glacier Campground v. Wild Rivers, Inc., </em>182 Mont. 389, 403, 597 P.2d 689, 696 (1978); M. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A plaintiff may recover under both alternative claims if the remedies are consistent. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 40. However, a plaintiff \u201cmay not recover on more than one theory for the same injury\u201d or damages. <em>Regions Bank v. Griffin, </em>217 S.W.3d 829, 832 (Ark. 2005); <em>Olympic Hotels Corp. v. Johnson Wax Dev. Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1363, 1371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>(7th Cir. 1990) (distinguishing between superseded procedural pleading and still viable substantive equity aspect of election of remedies doctrine). If alternative remedies are inconsistent, the plaintiff must elect one or the other and cannot obtain judgment on both. <em>Kaufman Bros. v. Home Value Stores, Inc., </em>2012 MT 121, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20, 365 Mont. 196, 279 P.3d 157; <em>Parsons v. Rice, </em>81 Mont. 509, 521, 264 P. 396, 401 (1928). Alternative claims grounded on the same conduct are consistent and independently cognizable only if the claims are based on independent legal duties and the same or related conduct constitutes a breach of each independent legal duty. <em>Dewey v. Stringer, </em>2014 MT 136, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 14-15, 375 Mont. 176, 325 P.3d 1236 (discussing conceivably coexistent fraud, constructive fraud, and contract claims based on independent legal duties related to real estate purchase agreement); <em>Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co., Inc. v. Addink, </em>2013 MT 319, \u00b6 33, 372 Mont. 334, 312 P.3d 451 (discussing coexistent contract and tort remedies for breach of professional services contract and negligent performance of services); <em>Tin Cup Co. Water v. Garden City Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2008 MT 434, \u00b6 25, 347 Mont. 468, 200 P.3d 60 (discussing coexistent contract and tort remedies based on professional services contract); <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 49 (fraud claim not necessarily precluded by contract claim based on same facts).</p>\n<p id=\"Aepq\">\u00b622  If the facts support either type of claim and neither applicable statute of limitation has expired, a plaintiff may elect either coexistent remedy regardless of whether the claim may be more akin to one type of claim than the other. <em>Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co., Inc., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-36. However, regardless of characterization, alternative claims based on the same breach of the same legal duty are merely duplicative or subsumed in one or the other and, thus, not independently cognizable in the same action. <em>May v. ERA Landmark Real Estate, </em>2000 MT 299, \u00b6\u00b6 41-43, 302 Mont. 326, 15 P.3d 1179 (claim for breach ofreal estate agent fiduciary duty essentially duplicative of other asserted tort claims based on same predicate facts); <em>Joyce v. Garnaas, </em>1999 MT 170, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 295 Mont. 198, 983 P.2d 369 (claim for breach of lawyer fiduciary duty not distinctly cognizable from professional negligence claim on same predicate facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b623 Implied from their federal or state labor law status as the exclusive bargaining agents of their memberships, labor unions have a common law duty to fairly represent all of their members in the enforcement of grievance rights provided by collective bargaining agreements. <em>E.g., Ford v. University of Montana, </em>183 Mont. 112, 121-22, 598 P.2d 604, 608-10 (1979), <em>overruled on other grounds by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Teamsters Local No. 45 v.

Ct. 2121, 2125 (1979); <em>Woods v. Graphic Communications, </em>925 F.2d 1195, 1203 (9th Cir. 1991). However, due to the broad discretion that unions must have to balance the often competing interests of individual members and the union as a whole, mere negligence is insufficient alone to constitute a breach of the duty of fair representation. <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 191-92, 87 S. Ct. 903, 917-18 (1967) (union not required to exhaust all grievance remedies in every case); <em>Woods, </em>925 F.2d at 1203 (\u201cunion need not process meritless grievances\u201d); <em>Robesky v.

A breach of the duty of fair representation thus requires proof of fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, or other arbitrary or unlawful disregard or discrimination in the enforcement of grievance rights. <em>Ford, </em>183 Mont. at 121-23, 598 P.2d at 609-10; <em>Teamsters Local No. 45 v. State ex rel. Bd. of Personnel Appeals (Teamsters II), </em>223 Mont. 89, 96, 724 P.2d 189, 193 (1986); <em>Amalgamated Ass\u2019n of St., Elec. Ry. &amp; Motor Coach Employees v.

Civ. Code). Thus, the essential legal duty underlying common law fraud is the duty to be truthful in material representations of fact intended to induce another\u2019s reliance thereon. <em>Kindsfather, </em>\u00b6 17; \u00a7 27-1-712, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b625 On the Rule 56 factual record in this case, Folsom attempted to plead, and the District Court found, distinct factual bases supporting his separately pled DFR and common law fraud claims. The court granted summary judgment on Folsom\u2019s DFR claim based on MPEA\u2019s arbitrary disregard or perfunctory handling of his grievance as evidenced by its failure to either timely invoke grievance Step 3 or \u201ctake advantage of the City\u2019s offer\u201d to proceed with Step 3 regardless of timeliness. The District Court separately granted summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>judgment on Folsom\u2019s common law fraud claim based on Folsom\u2019s detrimental reliance on Picotte\u2019s false representation on or about October 25, 2013, that he had instituted and was actively prosecuting litigation against the City to enforce Folsom\u2019s grievance rights. In effect, Folsom and the District Court parsed the continuum of Picotte\u2019s handling of Folsom\u2019s grievance rights into two separate parts to support two separate claims: (1) the failure to timely initiate, or subsequently accept the City\u2019s offer to participate in, grievance Step 3 and (2) Picotte\u2019s ensuingfailure, and related misrepresentations, to file an appropriate action against the City to enforce Folsom\u2019s grievance rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b626 Regardless of this artificial parsing of the Rule 56 factual record, the District Court\u2019s summary judgment analysis, and its subsequent findings and conclusions on damages, clearly manifest an indivisible continuum of conduct and directly related misrepresentations by Picotte in the handling of Folsom\u2019s grievance rights. The course of Picotte\u2019s conduct spanned his alleged failure to timely exercise or enforce the Step 3 process in April 2013 through the time that Folsom discovered in mid-2014 that Picotte had not instituted enforcement litigation against the City as represented. MPEA\u2019s duty of fair representation included the duty to fairly represent Folsom in the CBA grievance process and in the enforcement of those grievance rights in the face of any breach of the agreement by the City. Picotte\u2019s <em>misrepresentation </em>to Folsom that he had instituted and was prosecuting enforcement litigation against the City was inseparable as matters of fact and law from his <em>failure to act as represented. </em>On this record, Picotte\u2019s alleged mishandling of Folsom\u2019s grievance rights, and his related misrepresentations in regard thereto, were part and parcel of the union\u2019s alleged breach of duty of fair representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b627 In <em>May, </em>a real estate seller asserted multiple tort and contract claims against his real estate agent based on the agent\u2019s drafting and tender of a seller counteroffer to the buyers that included language that exposed the seller to environmental clean-up liability on a former gas station property. <em>May, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-12.

To circumvent the absolute bar of the applicable ten-year statute of repose barring the malpractice claim after 1994, the former client asserted that a subsequent misrepresentation by the lawyer that the client\u2019s claim was proceeding in active litigation was an independent breach of the lawyer\u2019s fiduciary duty, separate from the lawyer\u2019s initial negligence and silence regarding the missed service deadline, thus giving rise to an independent tort claim not barred by the applicable statutes of limitation and repose. <em>Joyce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18. In affirming the dismissal of the malpractice claim pursuant to the ten-year statute of repose, we concluded that the lawyer\u2019s breach of professional duty occurred at the time of his initial malpractice, \u201cnot years later\u201d when he continued to conceal it by subsequent misrepresentation. <em>Joyce, </em>\u00b6 19.

As in <em>May </em>and <em>Joyce, </em>Folsom is attempting to creatively cleave two independent tort claims out of one and, as in <em>Joyce, </em>for an ulterior purpose, <em>i.e., </em>creating a predicate for punitive damages perceived to be unavailable on a DFR claim. However, similar to the claims at issue in <em>May </em>and <em>Joyce, </em>Folsom\u2019s separately pled common law fraud claim is not based on a breach of legal duty independent of the breach of legal duty that is the basis of his DFR claim. As manifest by his claim for lost wages, the alleged harm resulting from MPEA\u2019s breach of duty is the same on both claims\u2014loss of his employment and resulting wages in violation of the CBA.

To prove that a union\u2019s breach of duty caused harm and resulting damages, the employee must prove (1) that the employer disciplined or discharged the employee in violation of the collective-bargaining agreement, <em>see Hines v.

Contrary to Folsom\u2019s assertion, the court\u2019s conclusion was not a <em>sua sponte </em>interjection of an unpled affirmative defense; it was a judgment rendered on an issue squarely before it on the claim pled. Further, though he presented evidence that MPEA\u2019s breach of duty caused him to incur attorney fees and costs in excess of lost wages, Folsom presented no evidence or argument at the post-summary judgment evidentiary hearing to satisfy his burden of proving that the City terminated his employment in violation of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b635 The Rule 56 record was similarly insufficient to establish proof of causation. Folsom did not seek, and the District Court did not grant, summary judgment on the causation or damages elements of his DFR claim. He merely sought and obtained summary judgment that MPEA breached its duty of fair representation, committed fraud, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>liable for damages to be proven later. The issue of whether the City wrongly terminated his employment in violation of the CBA was not properly before the court on the summary judgment record. MPEA thus had no responsive Rule 56(e)(2) burden to raise a genuine issue of material fact to defeat Folsom\u2019s cursory assertion that the City terminated him in violation of the CBA. Folsom further presented no authority for the proposition that a district court must or may take judicial notice of facts on the Rule 56 record as evidence in a subsequent evidentiary hearing absent a prior adjudication of those facts pursuant to Rule 56(c)(3) and (d)(1) (adjudication of established facts not subject to genuine material dispute on Rule 56 record).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b636 Contrary to F olsom\u2019s further assertion, the terms of his settlement agreement with the City did not preclude a factual question as to whether the City discharged him in violation of the CBA. The agreement affirmatively acknowledged the right and duty of City witnesses to subsequently testify under process as to the facts and circumstances of Folsom\u2019s discharge. The agreement expressly disclaimed any City liability or wrongdoing and fully discharged and released the City without compensation to Folsom.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b637 F olsom\u2019s assertion that MPEA judicially admitted to causation on his DFR claim is similarly unsound. A judicial admission is an express waiver made to the court by a party or counsel conceding the truth of an alleged fact for purposes of trial. <em>Bilesky v. Shopko Stores Operating Co., LLC, </em>2014 MT 300, \u00b6 12, 377 Mont. 58, 338 P.3d 76. \u201cJudicial admissions have the effect of stipulations\u201d and have \u201cconclusive effect\u201d on \u201cthe party making the admission,\u201d thus precluding presentation of further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact. <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 12. Judicial admissions apply only to statements of fact, not statements of opinion or law. <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 13. Whether a court should view a party\u2019s statement or assertion of fact as a judicial admission is a question of law dependent on whether giving it conclusive effect will (1) \u201cfacilitate judicial efficiency and save the parties time, labor, and expense\u201d and (2) \u201cprotect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing parties from unfairly playing fast and loose with the facts to suit the exigencies of self-interest.\u201d <em>Bilesky, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b638 In its answer to Folsom\u2019s complaint, MPEA admitted that the City discharged him without just cause in violation of the CBA. While the existence of a legal duty is a question of law, whether a party breached a legal duty is generally an ultimate question of fact. <em>Garza v. Forquest Ventures, Inc., </em>2015 MT 284, \u00b6 38, 381 Mont. 189, 358 P.3d 189. In that regard, out of context, MPEA\u2019s pleading admission was seemingly an assertion of ultimate fact. However, in context, Picotte made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>admission, however unnecessarily or improvidently, only in response to the wrongful discharge claim pled <em>against the City. </em>In response to the DFR claim against MPEA, its answer generally denied, with exceptions not pertinent here, Folsom\u2019s pertinent factual averments and affirmatively prayed that he \u201ctake nothing\u201d against MPEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b639 Just as plaintiffs may plead inconsistent claims for relief, defendants may plead inconsistent defenses. M. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3). In accordance with its duty to fairly represent Folsom and consistent with the position previously taken on Folsom\u2019s behalf during the CBA grievance process, MPEA made its seemingly adverse pleading admission in alignment with Folsom\u2019s breach of contract claim against the City. However, in defense of itself, MPEA pled a seemingly inconsistent general denial in response to the DFR claim. Read as a whole in context, MPEA\u2019s pleading admission in response to the claim pled against the City was not an adverse admission to the DFR claim pled against MPEA.</p>\n<p id=\"AaW\">\u00b640  As an admission in response to Folsom\u2019s claim <em>against the City, </em>MPEA\u2019s pleading admission was also more akin to a preliminary statement of opinion based on anticipated proof than an express waiver or concession of an adverse material fact. <em>See Weaver v. State, </em>2013 MT 247, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, 371 Mont. 476, 310 P.3d 495 (statement in brief that State \u201cacted reasonably\u201d in fighting a fire merely a preliminary assertion based on anticipated proof); <em>DeMars v.

Under these circumstances, giving the statement conclusive effect against MPEA was not necessary to promote judicial economy or to protect the integrity of the judicial process. Therefore, the District Court did not err in failing to give conclusive effect to MPEA\u2019s pleading admission. We hold that, on the state of the record before it, the District Court correctly concluded that Folsom did not meet his burden of proving that MPEA\u2019s breach of duty caused his claimed damages. Thus, we hold that the District Court did not err in declining to grant Folsom\u2019s alternative motion for post-judgment relief under Rules 59(a)(2) and 60(b)(1) and \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u00b641 <em>3.

Allstate Ins. Co. (Jacobsen I), </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649. The District Court awarded Folsom $47,550 as compensation for attorney fees incurred in prosecuting this action pursuant to <em>Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1275-76. The court reasoned that MPEA\u2019s failure to fairly represent him \u201cin the grievance proceeding forced Folsom to hire a lawyer in order to obtain representation that the MPEA should have provided in the first place.\u201d Pursuant to <em>Petaja v. Montana Public Employees\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>2016 MT 143, 383 Mont. 516, 373 P.3d 40, MPEA asserts that a plaintiff may not recover attorney fees as compensatory damages on a DFR claim. Folsom asserts that MPEA procedurally waived any substantive objection to the attorney fees award by failing to challenge it before the District Court. Since MPEA raised this issue before the District Court in its motion for post-judgment relief, Folsom\u2019s procedural argument turns on our resolution of Issue 6. We address MPEA\u2019s assertion of substantive error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b643 Under the common law \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d the prevailing party is not entitled to recover attorney fees incurred in prosecuting or defending an action unless otherwise expressly provided by contract or statute. <em>Petaja, \u00b625; Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 97, 303 Mont. 274, 16 P.3d 1002. The essence of the American Rule is that each party to a dispute \u201cpays its own attorney fees.\u201d <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n, </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 29, 331 Mont. 421, 133 P.3d 190. We have consistently construed the American Rule to preclude not only same-suit fee shifting, but to also preclude recovery of attorney fees incurred in a prior dispute but claimed as compensatory damages, or as a new exception to the American Rule, in a subsequent action <em>between the same parties. E.g., Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-23; <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b644 In <em>Jacobsen I, </em>an insurer refused to rescind a premature settlement of a third-party automobile liability claim until after the injured party retained and pressed the issue through counsel. <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 2. Upon finding the insurer liable on the third party\u2019s ensuing common law bad faith claim, the jury awarded compensatory damages that included the cost of attorney fees previously incurred by the third party to force the insurer to re-open and re-adjust the claim prior to the bad faith litigation. <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 6. In the absence of a contract or statutory attorney fees provision, we reversed the attorney fees award on the grounds that no recognized exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>American Rule applied, recognition of a new exception for third-party common law bad faith claims would be inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s failure to provide similar relief on statutory bad faith claims, and in deference to the Legislature\u2019s prerogative \u201cto rectify\u201d any such \u201cunfair gap in existing law.\u201d <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b645 In <em>Petaja, </em>after her public employer terminated and then temporarily reinstated her in a lesser position with a substantial pay cut, an employee asserted an age discrimination claim against the employer and a DFR claim against her union (MPEA). <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-8. The employee claimed the union breached its duty of fair representation by unilaterally settling her grievance after the employer reassigned her. <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6-8. At trial, the jury determined the discrimination claim against the employer was time-barred but returned a $100,000 verdict against MPEA on the DFR claim. <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6 10. Pursuant to <em>Jacobsen I </em>and despite the union\u2019s \u201cincomprehensible [default] admission\u201d to an attorney fees award, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s denial of the employee\u2019s post-trial motion for attorney fees absent a contract or statutory attorney fees provision, an applicable recognized exception to the American Rule, or a showing of sufficient cause to recognize a new exception. <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26. To preserve it as \u201ca foundation of our jurisprudence,\u201d we must continue to broadly construe the American Rule to avoid its consumption by a multitude of exceptions. <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Petaja, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b646 However, without offense to the American Rule, attorney fees and costs incurred in legal action <em>against a third party </em>may be a permissible element of compensatory damages in an action <em>against a tortfeasor </em>where the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct caused the plaintiff to have to resort to legal action to protect his or her interests against the third party. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 914(2) (1979). <em>See also, </em>Annotation, <em>Right to Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees Incurred in Earlier Litigation with a Third Person Because of Involvement Therein Through a Tortious Act of Present Adversary, </em>45 A.L.R.2d 1183 (1956 &amp; Supp. 2015). Recovery of attorney fees in this limited context does not violate or undermine the American Rule because the recovery does not constitute a direct or indirect shifting or allocation of attorney fees between the same litigating parties. Thus, federal and state courts have long recognized that, as an element of compensatory damages on a DFR claim, an employee may recover attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the employee\u2019s collective bargaining agreement rights <em>against an employer </em>if incurred as a result of the union\u2019s failure to represent the employee in breach of its duty of fair representation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Dutrisac, </em>749 F.2d at 1275-76 (requiring union to compensate employee for cost of representation union failed to provide not contrary to American Rule); <em>Rogers v.

However, we distinguish <em>Petaja </em>and clarify that the American Rule does not bar an employee from recovering, as an element of compensatory damages on a DFR claim against a union, attorney fees incurred by the employee to enforce grievance rights <em>against an employer </em>if caused by the union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation. Where, as here, the employee asserts a claim against the employer on the contract and a DFR claim against the union in the same action, the employee has the burden of proving the amount of attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the claim against the employer, as distinct from those incurred in prosecuting the DFR claim against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"AxM\">\u00b648  As an element of compensatory damages on his DFR claim against MPEA, Folsom can recover attorney fees and costs incurred in pressing his wrongful discharge claim against the City upon proof that: (1) MPEA breached its duty of fair representation; (2) the City wrongfully discharged him in violation of the CBA; and (3) the union\u2019s breach caused him to incur attorney fees and costs to enforce his CBA rights against the City. However, in the manifest absence of a contrary statutory or contract provision or an applicable exception to the American Rule, he cannot recover attorney fees incurred in prosecuting claims against MPEA. The District Court awarded Folsom $47,550 as compensation for attorney fees incurred in prosecuting this action despite his adjudicated failure to meet his burden of proving that the City discharged him in violation of the CBA and without distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>between fees incurred in prosecuting his claim against the City and those incurred in prosecuting his claims against MPEA.

Thus, independent of administrative remedies available under the RLA and NLRA, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a DFR claim as an independent federal common law tort claim to provide a remedy for individual employees in the event that a union fails to represent them fairly, impartially, and in good faith without arbitrary or unlawful discrimination. <em>Foust, </em>442 U.S. at 47-49, 99 S.

Attempting to balance the purpose of federal labor law to protect and maintain the vitality of labor unions as the guardians of employee rights with the potentially competing public policy interest in providing individual workers with a remedy for union misconduct, the U.S. Supreme Court has decreed, as a matter of federal common law, that punitive damages are not available on federal DFR claims. <em>Foust, </em>442 U.S. at 46-52, 99 S.

Rule 60(b)(6) relief is available to remedy alleged neglect or misconduct by a party\u2019s counsel only upon a showing: (1) of extraordinary gross neglect or actual misconduct by counsel; (2) that the party sought relief within a reasonable time; and (3) that the moving party was not at fault for the alleged neglect or misconduct. <em>Orcutt, </em>\u00b6 12. The standard of review of a grant or denial of a motion for Rule 60(b) relief based on alleged gross neglect or misconduct of counsel is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Orcutt, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">\u00b661 Here, MPEA alternatively moved the District Court for Rule 59(e) or 60(b)(6) relief from its summary judgment rulings and its resulting compensatory attorney fees and punitive damage awards. MPEA sought relief under both rules on the asserted ground that the liability judgments and resulting damages awards were based on manifest errors of law and fact resulting from the \u201cgross neglect and misconduct\u201d of its former counsel. MPEA asserted that counsel\u2019s gross neglect and misconduct effectively caused it to suffer a default judgment on liability which, in turn, became the basis of the erroneous compensatory and punitive damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b662 MPEA retained new counsel after the damages hearing and shortly before the District Court issued its post-summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>order on damages. MPEA timely asked the District Court to delay its damages ruling to afford MPEA an opportunity to file an appropriate motion for relief. After the District Court issued its damages ruling in apparent disregard of MPEA\u2019s initial motion, MPEA moved for particularized post-judgment relief with supporting affidavits, exhibits, and briefing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b663 The record reflects that MPEA\u2019s counsel seriously compromised its litigation posture on the merits by failing to respond to critical requests for admission, failing to subsequently seek relief from the resulting admissions deemed by default, and failing to make any affirmative factual showing to oppose Folsom\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Though he appeared at the subsequent damages hearing, counsel manifestly made no competent attempt to effectively represent MPEA\u2019s interests through briefing, oral argument, or motion practice. He failed to present critical legal authority and argument opposing Folsom\u2019s claims, to present proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or to seek relief from his earlier neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"AcX0\">\u00b664  MPEA made a prima facie showing that it was not substantially at fault for Picotte\u2019s neglect or misconduct under the circumstances. Apart from general assertions that MPEA had knowledge that Picotte was \u201cburnt-out\u201d and that MPEA could and should have more closely supervised him and acted sooner, Folsom made no compelling showing of specific contributory fault by MPEA.</p>\n<p id=\"A5B5\">\u00b665  Under these circumstances, MPEA made a reasonably diligent and compelling showing for post-judgment relief under Rules 59(e) and 60(b)(6). From the outset of this litigation, Folsom asserted that the City wrongfully terminated his employment in violation of the CBA. The alleged breach of the CBA by the City was also at the core of Folsom\u2019s ancillary DFR and subsumed common law fraud claims. Yet, seizing the opportunity to exploit the manifest extraordinary gross neglect of MPEA\u2019s counsel, F olsom made the tactical decision to release the alleged primary wrongdoer, without compensation or admission of liability, to instead pursue the compromised MPEA for the entirety of his asserted compensatory and punitive damages. Under the totality of the circumstances, this was truly an extraordinary situation where fundamental fairness and equity warranted relief under Rule 59(e) or 60(b)(6) to remedy a lack of full presentation and inaccurate determination of the merits as a result of the extraordinary gross neglect of counsel. We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant MPEA\u2019s alternative motion for relief from its summary judgment and resulting attorney fees and punitive damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b666 In summary, we hold that: (1) Folsom\u2019s separately pled common law fraud claim is necessarily subsumed in his DFR claim and thus not independently cognizable in this case; (2) the District Court\u2019s ruling that F olsom did not meet his burden of proving that MPEA\u2019s breach of duty caused his claimed damages was not erroneous and, thus, the District Court did not err in declining to grant his motion for post-judgment relief under Rules 59(a)(2) and 60(b)(1) and \u00a7 25-11-102(3), MCA; (3) the District Court erred in awarding Folsom $47,550 in attorney fees; (4) the District Court erroneously awarded punitive damages without a compensatory damages predicate as required by \u00a7 27-1-220(1), MCA; and (5) the District Court abused its discretion in refusing to grant MPEA\u2019s alternative Rule 59(e) or 60(b)(6) motion for relief from its summary judgment and resulting attorney fees and punitive damage awards. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s <em>Order on Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, </em>filed July 15, 2015, and its subsequent <em>Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on Damages, </em>filed March 16, 2016, and remand for further proceedings on the merits of Folsom\u2019s DFR claim in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b667 This remand necessarily returns Folsom and MPEA to the procedural posture that they were in upon F olsom\u2019s service of discovery requests on MPEA.

After careful consideration of a wide range of federal and state public policy concerns, the New Mexico Court ultimately affirmed the ruling of its intermediate Court of Appeals and rejected adoption of the rule of <em>Foust </em>as contrary to New Mexico law and public policy. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 747-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b670 The New Mexico Supreme Court acknowledged without dispute the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cassessment of national needs\u201d and the policy and purpose of federal labor laws to protect and maintain the vitality of private sector labor unions. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749. As to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s particular concern that \u201cwindfall recoveries against labor unions could deplete union treasuries and impair the effectiveness of unions as collective bargaining agents,\u201d the New Mexico Court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">nothing ... indicates that such fears are presently warranted in New Mexico\u2019s public sector. Despite <em>Foust\u2019s </em>holding in the DFR context, unions... are currently subject to punitive damages under a variety of federal laws, such as the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (2006). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 411(a)(4), 412 (2006) (right to sue and civil action/jurisdiction provisions of the LMRDA); <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Boilermakers v. Braswell, </em>388 F.2d 193, 200 (5th Cir. 1968) (punitive damages available under LMRDA); <em>Woods, </em>925 F.2d at 1204 (\u201cUnder \u00a7 1981, the common law rule is that punitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>damages may be awarded in appropriate cases.\u201d). Unions have also, up to now, been subject to punitive damages for breach of the state duty of fair representation. Thus, to adopt a per se ban here would be to <em>depart </em>from the status quo. Despite the potential for exposure to punitive damages from several angles, the Union cannot point to a single example where runaway punitive damages awards substantially debilitated a labor union in New Mexico.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 750 (emphasis original). The New Mexico Court further noted that the compelling public policy concern \u201cfor the vitality of unions as collective bargaining agents\u201d of workers is already reflected in a higher standard of DFR liability which \u201cshields\u201d unions from liability \u201cfor merely negligent\u201d conduct \u201cat no small cost\u201d to the subordinated interests of individual union members. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749. \u201cTo now go further and shield even the most egregious conduct from punitive damages, would ... undermine the interests of both Unions and their members.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b671 Contrasting federal policy to state policy, the New Mexico Court observed that <em>\u201cFoust </em>was developing an area of interstitial federal common law to effectuate distinct congressional goals set forth in federal statutes governing unions in the private sector.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749 (citing <em>Foust, </em>442 U.S. at 47-48, 99 S. Ct. at 2125-26 and <em>Woods, </em>925 F.2d at 1203). The Court acknowledged that New Mexico DFR claims further a similar state policy as enacted in NMPEBA, but noted that the primary purpose of federal and state common law DFR claims is to provide individual workers an effective remedy for enforcement of collective bargaining rights not otherwise provided by statute. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749. To that end, the New Mexico Court agreed with the concurrence in <em>Foust </em>that recognition of a common law enforcement remedy for that purpose should avail the enforcing party of \u201cthe full panoply of tools traditionally\u201d available at common law \u201cto do justice between the parties,\u201d including punitive damages. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749 (citing <em>Foust, </em>442 U.S. at 53, 99 S. Ct. at 2128 (Blackmun, J., concurring)). The New Mexico Court concluded that existing procedural, substantive, and constitutional due process protections are more than adequate to protect unions, like other tortfeasors, from excessive punitive damages awards. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 752-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b672 Turning to other provisions of state law, the New Mexico Court noted that punitive damages serve the important state public policy of punishing reprehensible conduct and deterring similar conduct in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>future. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749-50. The court noted that those policy objectives are of particular critical import \u201cwhere unions appropriately enjoy broad discretionary authority and the employee has little recourse outside of the grievance process.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 749-50. The New Mexico Court thus concluded that \u201cpunitive damages are the best means of deterring\u201d egregious union misconduct in the DFR context where \u201ccompensatory damages may be <em>de minimis </em>or difficult to quantify.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b673 Ultimately, the Court noted that \u201cNew Mexico law reflects a preference for holding individuals and institutions accountable for their actions regardless of status.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 751. \u201c[W]e are aware of no New Mexico common-law cause of action in tort where we have [declared] that punitive damages are unavailable as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 752. \u201cAbsent a more compelling policy consideration than that presented by the Union, we make no exception for DFR claims.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 752. The New Mexico Court instead adhered \u201cto the general common law principle in New Mexico that punitive damages should be available as long as the wrongdoer\u2019s conduct is willful, wanton, malicious, reckless, fraudulent, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 752. Because \u201cthe Legislature is capable of making exceptions to general tort principles when public policy so counsels,\u201d the Court deferred \u201cto the Legislature for such a drastic departure\u201d from existing state law and public policy, if so inclined. <em>Akins, </em>237 P.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b674 I find <em>Akins' </em>reasoning even more compelling under Montana law and public policy considerations. By following the federal model and consistent with the public policy of MPECBA to provide for the continued vitality of public employees\u2019 unions, we, too, have adopted a higher standard of liability that shields public employees\u2019 unions from liability for merely negligent conduct, thus subordinating the interests of individual workers to those of the union collective. However, on balance with MPECBA\u2019s important public policy of facilitating effective collective bargaining in the public sector, Montana statutory and common law embodies an equally important policy of holding individuals and entities accountable for their tortious conduct regardless of status. To that end, punitive damages are available in Montana \u201cfor the sake of example and for the purpose of punishing\u201d defendants who engage in \u201cactual fraud\u201d or \u201cactual malice,\u201d as narrowly defined. Sections 27-1-220(1) and -221(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b675 The Legislature has mandated that punitive damages are available as a supplemental tort remedy \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>expressly </em>provided by statute.\u201d Section 27-1-220(1), MCA (emphasis added). While this Court is certainly free to fashion the contours of Montana DFR claims absent contrary statutory provision, <em>see Miller v. Fallon County, </em>222 Mont. 214, 217-18, 721 P.2d 342, 344 (1986) (judicial discretion to determine or revise common law as necessary \u201cto prevent great injustice\u201d or conform common law to \u201cchanging needs of society\u201d); <em>accord, Brookins v. Mote, </em>2012 MT 283, \u00b6 57, 367 Mont. 193, 292 P.3d 347; \u00a7 1-1-108, MCA (common law is \u201cthe law and rule of decision\u201d except where in conflict with statute), our adoption of a per se Montana common law rule barring punitive damages as a supplemental remedy on a DFR claim would contravene the unqualified mandate of \u00a7 27-1-220(1), MCA, that punitive damages are an available supplemental tort remedy except as otherwise expressly provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b676 As in <em>Akins, </em>the assertion that punitive damages exposure will weaken unions is no more valid in regard to unions than to other benevolent entities subject to punitive damages liability. Punitive damages awards are subject to federal due process limitations and various procedural and substantive protections and limitations provided by \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-220 and -221, MCA. Since 1985, Montana has had an even higher standard of punitive damages liability than the common law standard articulated in <em>Akins. </em>Punitive damages are available under Montana law only upon proof of \u201cactual fraud\u201d or \u201cactual malice\u201d by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d Section 27-1-221(1), (5), and (6), MCA. In contrast to the nine elements of common law fraud under Montana law, \u201cactual fraud\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">(1) knowingly making a false representation to another who has \u201ca right to rely on the representation\u201d and suffers injury as a result of reliance thereon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">(2) causing injury to another by \u201cconceal[ing] a material fact with the purpose of depriving the [other] of property or legal rights\u201d or otherwise causing injury to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Section 27-1-221(3) and (4), MCA. Contrary to the District Court\u2019s apparent conflation of \u201cactual fraud\u201d and common law fraud in this case, common law fraud, tortious bad faith, or other unlawful or arbitrarily discriminatory conduct subsumed as a matter of law in the elements of a tortious DFR claim do not necessarily equate as a matter of law with \u201cactual fraud\u201d or \u201cactual malice,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 27-1-221(2) through (4), MCA. The question of whether facts constituting common law fraud, tortious bad faith, or other unlawful or arbitrarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>discriminatory conduct by a mere preponderance of the evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the DFR context may also constitute \u201cactual fraud\u201d or \u201cactual malice\u201d by clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221(3) and (4), MCA, is a question of fact for separate determination by the finder of fact upon proper instruction under the circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00b677 As in <em>Akins, </em>I am aware of no case in which this Court has exempted a particular class of tortfeasor from punitive damages liability by judicial fiat. Whether punitive damages should be available as a supplemental remedy on a Montana common law DFR claim is a question of pure public policy upon which the Legislature has unequivocally spoken in its exclusive domain. <em>See, </em>\u00a7 27-1-220(1), MCA. For these reasons, I would reach Issue 5 and hold that <em>Foust\u2019s </em>per se bar of punitive damages on federal common law DFR claims is not consistent with existing Montana law and public policy. Thus, I would hold that MPEA is not exempt as a matter of law from punitive damages under \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-220 and -221, MCA, on Folsom\u2019s Montana DFR claim.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-4\">JUSTICE WHEAT joins in the special concurring Opinion of JUSTICE SANDEFUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-5\"> <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-403(1), MCA (general civil burden of proof).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-6\"> Note further that Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 909 (1979) limits a principal\u2019s vicarious liability for punitive damages by requiring proof that the principal, apart from the agent, is directly culpable under the applicable standard of punitive damages liability. <em>See similarly, Campen v.
