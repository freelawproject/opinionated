He challenges his sentence on appeal, raising the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-24\"><em>Did the District Court violate Otto\u2019s constitutional rights by basing his sentence on his refusal to answer a question in the presentence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>investigative </em>report?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b62 In June 2014, Great Falls police responded to the Rescue Mission to locate a 13-year-old girl, D.R., who had run away from her home in Shelby, Montana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D.R. was found in the company of Otto, a 28-year-old male. D.R. informed police she had arrived in Great Falls the preceding week and had been with Otto, staying in his vehicle and tent. She acknowledged having sexual relations with Otto nearly every night, explaining that when she and Otto were engaged in vaginal intercourse, they usually stopped when it became too painful. After each attempt at vaginal intercourse failed, D.R. would perform oral sex on Otto until he ejaculated. When interviewed, Otto initially minimized his actions, but ultimately admitted to some intercourse and to \u201callow[ing] D.R. to give me oral sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b63 Otto was initially charged with two counts of Sexual Intercourse Without Consent, and thereafter entered a nonbinding plea agreement under which he pled guilty to the count premised upon oral sex with D.R. The State agreed to dismiss the second count. The plea agreement recommended a 50-year commitment to Montana State Prison (MSP), with 35 years suspended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the sentencing hearing, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">The Court also considers that its sentence must protect the public. And this case is disturbing. The defendant, twice the victim\u2019s age, deceived and lured a young girl to run away from home, some 90 miles away, to engage in sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAqAE\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"40\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANkAAAAoAQAAAABbC2JnAAAAWklEQVR4nGP8z4ATNDLhlmNgGJUclaSG5N8GKOcJTHQCQvLPAajYPZhkBZHGsjhAOUow0Q4o/f///3//oeA7jHH///////83MDEwMDDCNHDAGApE2jkqSbYkAJE8JCTHFemtAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"217\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">This young victim ... faces alifetime of recovery from this assault. She\u2019s already been hospitalized for the psychological effects of what occurred. The physical and psychological harm Mr. Otto inflicted on this young victim will never go away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\u00b64 The District Court also stated, \u201cI am not impressed with Mr. Otto\u2019s lack of cooperation in the presentence investigation, his refusal to answer certain questions, his ... total minimization and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>rationalization of his sexually predatory conduct. Mr. Otto has demonstrated to this Court no appreciation and no accountability whatsoever .... \u201d Departing from the sentence recommendation of the plea agreement, the District Court sentenced Otto to a 60-year commitment at MSP, with 10 years suspended. Otto appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b65 If an offender is eligible for sentence review pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-903, MCA, as here, we review the sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 320 Mont. 490, 87 P.3d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court violate Otto\u2019s constitutional rights by basing his sentence on his refusal to answer a question in the presentence investigative </em>report?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u00b67 Otto argues the District Court violated his rights to silence and against self-incrimination by basing his sentence, at least in part, on his refusal to answer a question in the presentence investigative report (PSI)- In the \u201cDefendant\u2019s Statement\u201d section of the PSI, on page 3, a standard question asked, \u201cWhat reason do you have for your involvement in this offense?\u201d In response, Otto wrote, \u201cThe Defendant did not answer this question at the request of [my attorney].\u201d Referencing the comment made by the District Court during the oral pronouncement about a failure to answer questions, Otto asserts the District Court imposed a longer sentence than recommended by the plea agreement for this reason, thereby violating his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">\u00b68 The State argues Otto\u2019s unresponsive answer simply demonstrated his lack of remorse, which was properly considered by the District Court as an indicator of his attempt to (1) obscure the psychological injuries he inflicted on D.R., (2) maximize his assertion that he would successfully complete rehabilitation, and (3) minimize the danger he posed to society. The State urges us to resist examining the oral pronouncement line-by-line, and instead to consider all the relevant sentencing information considered by the District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>including the statutory factors provided in Title 46, Chapter 18, MCA. The State further asserts that Otto \u201cwas not silent, and he did not assert the privilege with respect to every aspect of his offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b69 Our case law is clear\u2014district courts cannot infringe upon a defendant\u2019s rights to silence and against self-incrimination when imposing a sentence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, \u00b6 20, 313 Mont. 252, 60 P.3d 991; <em>State v. Cesnik, </em>2005 MT 257, \u00b6\u00b6 18-25, 329 Mont. 63, 122 P.3d 456; <em>State v. Rennaker, </em>2007 MT 10, \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 335 Mont. 274, 150 P.3d 960; <em>State v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, \u00b6 56, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111. We once again caution sentencing courts that these rights must be protected during sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b610 Here, we first must consider that \u201c[a] person claiming the protection of the Fifth Amendment generally must affirmatively invoke it.\u201d <em>State v. Fuller, </em>276 Mont. 155, 160, 915 P.2d 809, 812 (1996); (citing <em>United States v. Monia, </em>317 U.S. 424, 427, 63 S. Ct. 409, 410-11 (1943)); <em>State v. Plouffe, </em>2014 MT 183, \u00b6 23, 375 Mont. 429, 329 P.3d 1255; <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 11. The right can be waived if a defendant fails to assert the privilege. <em>Cesnik, </em>\u00b6 19 <em>(citing Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 160, 915 P.2d at 812). At no point during the sentencing process did Otto affirmatively invoke his rights to silence and against self-incrimination. During his plea colloquy, Otto answered each of the District Court\u2019s questions and provided information about his crime. When completing the PSI process, Otto answered many questions, including those about his crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\n<em>In your own words, what did you do to get arrested on this charge?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">I had an online relationship with the victim for two months ... I allowed the victim to perform oral sex on me in my tent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmU\">(Emphasis in original.) At no time did Otto affirmatively invoke his right to remain silent when he answered the PSI questions. Even his \u201cnon-answer\u201d to the subject question did not specifically invoke a constitutional right, but rather simply stated he was not answering at his attorney\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b611 District courts \u201cmay consider any relevant evidence relating to the nature and circumstances of the crime, the character of the defendant, the defendant's background history, mental and physical condition, and any evidence the court considers to have probative force.\u201d <em>Driver v. Sentence Review Div. in the Sup. Court of Mont., </em>2010 MT 43, \u00b6 17, 355 Mont. 273, 227 P.3d 1018; <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 63, 919 P.2d 376, 387 (1996); <em>Rennaker, </em>\u00b6 49; <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13. Here, the record demonstrates that the District Court extensively considered the relevant evidence, as reflected in excerpts of its comments, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>places the contested comment into context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">[I]n considering the nature and degree of harm [caused] by the offender, sexual intercourse without consent is one of the most serious [] offenses in our criminal justice system. Because minors are particularly [vulnerable] to sexual exploitation, the Montana Legislature has enacted heightened penalties for sex crime involving those under the age of consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApS\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANkAAAAeAQAAAACJKIbXAAAAWElEQVR4nGP8z4ATNDLhlmNgGJUcmpJ/G6C8JzDhCQjJPwegYvdgkhVEGsviAOUpwYQ7INT///////sPBd9hjPv/////38DEwMDAwAjTwAFjKBBp55CRBAAUDiQQQnjOEAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"217\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">Under the plea agreement, the parties agreed that Mr. Otto only would admit to having sexual intercourse without consent on the victim\u2019s 13th birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAq9-\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"40\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAOAAAAAoAQAAAADP7cuVAAAARUlEQVR4nGP8z4AbMOGRG5UclRyykp9gnAlQ+r8DjPH//4P/UMAOpf/IQ2iCxgrCOB0wQQWEJBdMMgBKM0LtZBzNggwMALEkIEwwNUNAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"224\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Given the facts alleged in the Information about an ongoing sexual relationship with the victim, the Court is deeply skeptical that the sexual intercourse began on the victim\u2019s 13th birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzX\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANEAAAAjAQAAAAAiG9JQAAAAWUlEQVR4nGP8z4ALNDLhlGJgGJUb5nIToJy/DVDGJ4RcBVTozwEo4z1xZnZAOSwOUIYghPr/////+/8h4B+U/v/7/////xuYGBgYGBSgyhlhprEQZ98IlQMArKojKWjcoRAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"209\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">The Court\u2019s sentence must hold Mr. Otto accountable for his crime. I am not impressed with Mr. Otto\u2019s lack of cooperation in the presentence investigation, his refusal to answer certain questions, his provision of edited and handwritten answers to other questions, and his total minimization and rationalization of his sexually predatory conduct. Mr. Otto has demonstrated to this Court no appreciation and no accountability whatsoever for the harm that he inflicted on this victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">The Court also considers that its sentence must protect the public. And this case is disturbing. The defendant, twice the victim\u2019s age, deceived and lured a young girl to run away from home, some 90 miles away, to engage in sexual intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAhd\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"32\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANgAAAAgAQAAAABYmos0AAAAP0lEQVR4nGP8z4ATMOGWGpUbsXL/HaDMTzCxE3C5fw+gzPcwuT1EmcmkAGUKwsRc4HKMMPu4YHIaUJpxGKRdAG2RCamUU8tAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"217\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">This young victim ... faces a lifetime of recovery from this assault. She\u2019s already been hospitalized for the psychological effects of what occurred. The physical and psychological harm Mr. Otto inflicted on this young victim will never go away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAenu\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARAAAAAeAQAAAADMDHx8AAAARUlEQVR4nGP8z0AIMBFUMapk0Cj5BGNMgNL/HWAi/6HgAYzBDqX/yEMZpFgkCGN0wGQU0JVwwRgBUJoR5hbG0VQ36JUAAGLhJjJMLCnhAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"272\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">The Court has considered that this is Mr. Otto\u2019s first felony, and although the Court does not find he has been accountable for the harm that he caused, the Court does recognize that he has taken responsibility for his crime, and spared the victim from further trauma at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">In balancing each of these factors, and weighingthe sentencing policies of Montana, I do not find that the sentence recommended by the State for Mr. Otto appropriately takes into account the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sentencing policy of the State of Montana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">Otto\u2019s written sentence again highlighted the sentencing factors referenced in the oral pronouncement and stated, \u201c[a] lengthy term of incarceration will hopefully provide the victim with some solace knowing that the Defendant will be harshly punished, and he will not be in a position to harm others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aa-\">\u00b612  It is clear, from the record, that the District Court carefully considered Montana\u2019s sentencing policies, statutory factors, and other relevant evidence in fashioning Otto\u2019s sentence. The District Court\u2019s reference to Otto\u2019s unresponsive answer, which did not affirmatively invoke a constitutional right, was made in passing and was part of a much larger assessment of Otto\u2019s attitudes and character. We perceive no impact upon Otto\u2019s sentence by reason of this singular comment. Further, \u201ca court can sentence a defendant based on lack of remorse,\u201d <em>Rennaker, </em>\u00b6 49 <em>(citing Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20), and the District Court based this concern on various aspects of the record. As Otto was clearly advised in his plea agreement, \u201csentencing in this matter is entirely within the discretion of the presiding District Court Judge, subject only to the limits of statutory and case law.\u201d Otto\u2019s sentence was within the statutory limits, and was supported by the totality of the District Court\u2019s appropriately stated reasons for the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, BAKER and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\"> D.R. was 12 years old when she ran away, but during the week she spent with Otto she turned age 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\"> The plea agreement contained an inconsistency, recommending \u201cA fifty (50) year commitment to the Montana State Prison with thirty (35) years suspended.\u201d Neither party references this discrepancy, and both argue on the assumption that the agreement recommended a sentence with 35 years suspended. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> Otto did not object to the District Court\u2019s comment during the sentencing hearing, and seeks review of the issue pursuant to <em>State v.
