At sentencing, the State introduced recordings of telephone conversations in which Lehrkamp threatened physical violence against his public defender and the prosecutor. The prosecutor recommended a sentence of twenty years in prison with ten years suspended, stating that such a sentence would give him and his family \u201csolace.\u201d The District Court sentenced Lehrkamp to ten years in prison and included a number of conditions in the written judgment. Lehrkamp appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">\n<em>1. Whether Lehrkamp is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks amount to plain error;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">\n<em>2.

A subsequent jail search uncovered two hydrocodone pills in his pocket. The State charged Lehrkamp with felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA. The State filed a notice of intent to seek persistent felony offender (PFO) status under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, based on Lehrkamp\u2019s previous convictions in 2008 for felony criminal endangerment and in 2014 for felony assault with a weapon. A Lewis and Clark County jury found Lehrkamp guilty in June 2015. Lehrkamp does not appeal the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u00b65 At Lehrkamp\u2019s August 2015 sentencing hearing, the State introduced excerpts of recorded telephone conversations Lehrkamp had with his family while he was in jail. The conversations had occurred in the two days leading up to trial and on the day of trial. In the recordings, Lehrkamp discussed his thoughts about attacking his then-counsel, Mariah Eastman, and the prosecutor, Jeff Sealey, when they all were in the courtroom together. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">That\u2019s what I figure, punch the fuck\u2019n bitch right in the throat. Won\u2019t let me fire her in two different courts. Won\u2019t let me fuck\u2019n get rid of her through her boss or nobody else. Just look at her, smile, and punch her right in the throat, watch her drop. There you go, guilty. Then go after the prosecutor. After a year in here Pa I really don\u2019t give a fuck what happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAtq\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAANAAAAAeAQAAAAB1Pa0dAAAAQ0lEQVR4nGP8z4ALMOGUGZUaSKknMLYClP7bAJO6BxX5/wHK+HOACAOVoExGASiDxQFqzP/v/6FgP5T+B6EYR16yAQAwVSNVy7KR0gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"208\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">He\u2019s a fuck\u2019n cheap piece of shit, he\u2019s a vindictive little cock sucker.

In explaining the State\u2019s recommendation, the prosecutor told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">I\u2019ve actually been thinking about this for a while. Short of you letting me dispatch Mr. Lehrkamp in a permanent sort of way, which is my natural inclination after listening to that audio, and I know we can\u2019t do that, I think he does need to be on supervision after a minimum of 10 years in prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">So I would ask that you impose a sentence of 20 years to the Montana State Prison and suspend 10 of those years. I would ask you to run that consecutive to the sentence in [Lehrkamp\u2019s 2014 assault case]. That\u2019s basically the minimum prison time with a 10-year period of supervision afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">That will give myself and my family some solace that someone will be watching Mr. Lehrkamp for a very long time after he gets out of prison. So that\u2019s my recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Lehrkamp\u2019s counsel did not object to the introduction of the recorded conversations or to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\u00b67 Lehrkamp presented no witnesses at the sentencing hearing. His mother and sister had been present at the hearing, ostensibly to testify in support of Lehrkamp. They left the hearing early, however, and did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">\u00b68 Both parties agreed that Lehrkamp should be sentenced as a PFO due to his previous felony convictions. They disagreed, however, on which subsection of the PFO statute should apply. Lehrkamp argued that he should be sentenced under \u00a7 46-18-502(1), MCA, which applies to first-time PFOs and requires a minimum sentence of five years in prison. The State urged the court to sentence Lehrkamp under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, which applies to repeat PFOs and provides a minimum sentence of ten years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">\u00b69 The court designated Lehrkamp as a PFO and sentenced him to ten years in prison with no time suspended, to run consecutively to his separate sentence for felony assault. The court stated that it read the PFO statute \u201cmore in line with what the state has presented,\u201d indicating that it was sentencing him under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA. The court stated, however, that its sentence would be the same under either application of the PFO statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">\u00b610 In its subsequent written judgment, the court listed twenty-three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>conditions that should apply \u201c[a]t any time the defendant is placed in a community setting.\u201d The judgment also included a handwritten note, stating in part, \u201cDefendant is not currently appropriate for community supervision. He is a repeat felony offender, and his actions and statements demand consequences.\u201d The court had not mentioned any parole restrictions or conditions on community placement in its oral pronouncement of sentence. Lehrkamp appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\u00b611 We generally do not address issues of prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at trial. <em>State v. Walton, </em>2014 MT 41, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 38, 318 P.3d 1024. We may review such issues, however, under the plain error doctrine. <em>Walton, </em>\u00b6 10. We invoke plain error review only in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>Walton, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>State v. McDonald, </em>2013 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 369 Mont. 483, 299 P.3d 799. The decision to invoke plain error review is a discretionary one that is to be used sparingly, on a case-by-case basis. <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 77, 342 Mont. 1, 180 P.3d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u00b612 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed issues of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Cheetham, </em>2016 MT 151, \u00b6 14, 384 Mont. 1, 373 P.3d 45. We review for legality a criminal sentence that includes at least one year of actual incarceration. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59. Our review is confined to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59. This determination is a question of law; as such, our review is de novo. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether Lehrkamp is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks amount to plain error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">\u00b614 Lehrkamp argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct when he said during the sentencing hearing that he wished to \u201cdispatch Mr. Lehrkamp in a permanent sort of way\u201d and that a twenty-year sentence with ten years suspended would \u201cgive [him] and [his] family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>some solace that someone will be watching Mr. Lehrkamp for a very long time after he gets out of prison.\u201d Lehrkamp contends that the statements were improper and prejudiced the defense. Even though his attorney did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements during the hearing, Lehrkamp urges this Court to review them under the plain error doctrine as a violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"ArJ\">\u00b615  Prosecutorial misconduct constitutes reversible error only when it prejudices a defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>State v. Otto, </em>2014 MT 20, \u00b6 15, 373 Mont. 385, 317 P.3d 810; <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. 430, 445, 949 P.2d 239, 249 (1997). We measure prosecutorial misconduct \u201cby reference to established norms of professional conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Ugalde, </em>2013 MT 308, \u00b6 43, 372 Mont. 234, 311 P.3d 772 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We do not infer prejudice from a prosecutor\u2019s improper comments; \u201crather, the defendant must demonstrate, from the record, that the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements prejudiced him.\u201d <em>State v. Dobrowski, </em>2016 MT 261, \u00b6 28, 385 Mont. 179, 382 P.3d 490 (citation and internal quotations omitted). Absent a timely objection, we will not review the prosecutor\u2019s actions on appeal unless they implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights. <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 59, 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\u00b616 It is improper for a prosecutor to express a personal opinion as to a defendant\u2019s culpability. <em>See Dobrowski, </em>\u00b6 30 (noting that \u201cclosing arguments which reflect a prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to the guilt of the defendant are improper\u201d (citation and internal quotations omitted)); <em>State v. Stringer, </em>271 Mont. 367, 380, 897 P.2d 1063, 1071 (1995) (\u201c[W]e have recognized that the Rules of Professional Ethics prohibit a lawyer from asserting personal opinions as to ... the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d); M. R. Prof. Cond. 3.4(e) (providing that, in the context of a trial, a lawyer shall not \u201cstate a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause ... or the guilt or innocence of an accused\u201d). This principle applies not only at trial, but also in the context of sentencing hearings. <em>See State v. Kingman, </em>2011 MT 269, \u00b6 58, 362 Mont. 330, 264 P.3d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u00b617 <em>InKingman, </em>the prosecutor explained the State\u2019s rationale for its recommended sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment by stating, \u201cSome animals need to be caged ... [Kingman] does not need to be treated with any sort of respect or admiration.\u201d <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 54. We held that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and \u201cimproper.\u201d <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 58. We reasoned that \u201ctreatment which degrades or demeans persons, that is, treatment which deliberately reduces the value of persons, and which fails to acknowledge their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>worth as persons, directly violates their dignity.\u201d <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 58. We concluded, however, that Kingman was not entitled to resentencing because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not affect the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\u00b618 A \u201cprosecutor\u2019s role is to vindicate the public\u2019s interest in punishing crime, not to exact revenge on behalf of an individual victim.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 114. A lawyer generally must not \u201cact as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness.\u201d M. R. Prof. Cond. 3.7(a). In <em>Stock v. State, </em>2014 MT 46, 374 Mont. 80, 318 P.3d 1053, we relied on the Comments to Rule 3.7(a) of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which mirrors M. R. Prof. Cond. 3.7(a). The Comments explain that combining \u201cthe roles of advocate and witness can prejudice the tribunal and the opposing party.\u201d <em>Stock, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal quotations omitted). They state also that a \u201cwitness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an analysis of the proof.\u201d <em>Stock, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AlQ\">\u00b619  The prosecutor\u2019s remarks in the present case amounted to a personal plea that the court adopt the State\u2019s sentencing recommendation in order to provide \u201csolace\u201d to the prosecutor and his family. The prosecutor requested a lengthy sentence based not on the severity of the crime for which Lehrkamp was convicted\u2014possession of dangerous drugs\u2014but on the prosecutor\u2019s personal feelings about Lehrkamp\u2019s threatening comments in the recorded telephone conversations. By advocating for a sentence based on his personal feelings regarding Lehrkamp, the prosecutor exceeded his scope of \u201cvindicat[ing] the public\u2019s interest in punishing crime.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 114. In invoking the protection of his own interests\u2014his own safety and that of his family\u2014the prosecutor stepped into the role of crime victim and witness, thereby undermining \u201cthe objective detachment that should separate a lawyer from the cause being argued.\u201d <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 114. If the prosecutor planned to provide personal testimony on the basis of Lehrkamp\u2019s threats against him, a different attorney should have argued the case at sentencing. Instead, the prosecutor wrongly combined \u201cthe roles of advocate and witness.\u201d <em>Stock, </em>\u00b6 14 (internal quotations omitted); see M. R. Prof. Cond. 3.7(a). His remarks violated \u201cestablished norms of professional conduct\u201d and were therefore improper. <em>Ugalde, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b620 The prosecutor\u2019s improper comments implicated Lehrkamp\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>fundamental rights. If the remarks impacted the court\u2019s sentencing of Lehrkamp, failing to review for plain error could \u201cresult in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 8. We therefore use our discretion to review the claimed error in this case. <em>See Rosling, </em>\u00b6 77. Accordingly, we address whether the comments prejudiced Lehrkamp and constitute reversible error. <em>See Otto, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 445, 949 P.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b621 The State recommended a sentence of twenty years with ten years suspended. The court declined to adopt the State\u2019s requested sentence. It instead imposed a sentence of ten years in prison with no time suspended. The court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">Mr. Lehrkamp, you are a serious persistent felony offender. And the attitude expressed in this phone call does seem to permeate throughout your behavior here. On the other hand, I\u2019m not\u2014because I am looking at the [underlying] offense, I\u2019m not going to go with what [the State] wants, which is 20 years with 10 suspended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApC\">\u00b622  The court did not accept the prosecutor\u2019s plea for a lengthier sentence; on the contrary, it explicitly rejected the State\u2019s recommendation. The record demonstrates that the court based its decision on other factors, taken largely from the information in the Pre-Sentence Investigation report. That report includes not only the recorded telephone conversations, but also Lehrkamp\u2019s prior criminal record for felony assault, felony criminal endangerment, and two convictions of partner or family member assault from 2006 and 2007. The report describes Lehrkamp\u2019s behavior while under supervision for his 2008 criminal endangerment conviction and notes that he violated the terms of his supervision by using drugs and quitting his job without permission. The court properly took this information into account in fashioning Lehrkamp\u2019s sentence. <em>See Rosling, </em>\u00b6 72 (stating that a court may \u201cconsider any evidence relevant to a defendant\u2019s sentence, including evidence relating to the crime, the defendant\u2019s character, background history, mental and physical condition, and any other evidence the court considers to have probative force\u201d). Lehrkamp has failed to \u201cdemonstrate, from the record,\u201d that the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks prejudiced him by influencing the court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>Dobrowski, </em>\u00b6 28. Because Lehrkamp has not shown prejudice, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments do not constitute reversible error. <em>See Otto, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Whitlow, </em>285 Mont. at 445, 949 P.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b623 <em>2. Whether Lehrkamp received ineffective assistance of counsel at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>the sentencing hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b624 Lehrkamp argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to request a continuance of the sentencing hearing so that his mother and sister could testify. He asserts that these two witnesses \u201cwould have provided testimony to ameliorate the damaging effects\u201d of the recorded telephone conversations. In his view, the inability of these witnesses to testify might have adversely affected his sentence. He argues that his counsel had \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for failing to request a continuance so that they could testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">\u00b625 \u201cThe United States and Montana Constitutions guarantee criminal defendants the right to effective counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Weber, </em>2016 MT 138, \u00b6 21, 383 Mont. 506, 373 P.3d 26. We analyze claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-part test developed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>McGarvey v. State, </em>2014 MT 189, \u00b6 24, 375 Mont. 495, 329 P.3d 576. In order to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show \u201c(1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.\u201d <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b626 In order to show under the first prong \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d the defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms, and in the context of all circumstances.\u201d <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 25. \u201c[T]he defendant must overcome a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s defense strategies and trial tactics fall within a wide range of reasonable and sound professional decisions.\u201d <em>State v. Turnsplenty, </em>2003 MT 159, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 275, 70 P.3d 1234. Under the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, the defendant must \u201cestablish prejudice by demonstrating that there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 14. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cmust be grounded on facts in the record and not on mere conclusory allegations.\u201d <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\u00b627 Lehrkamp\u2019s sentencing hearing was scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. on August 13,2015. The hearingbegan forty minutes late, at 3:40 p.m. Lehrkamp\u2019s sister and mother initially were present at the hearing. According to Lehrkamp, they were prepared to testify about the recorded telephone conversations. When the court asked Lehrkamp\u2019s counsel if the defense had any witnesses, counsel answered, \u201cNo, Your Honor. Mr. Lehrkamp\u2019s sister and mother were present, but they needed to go to work at 4:00, so when we ran late, they had to leave.\u201d The court then asked Lehrkamp if he wished to \u201csay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>anything before sentencing,\u201d to which Lehrkamp responded, \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d Lehrkamp\u2019s counsel later urged the court not to take Lehrkamp\u2019s threatening statements into consideration, asserting that he was merely \u201cventing\u201d when he made the remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b628 The record contains no evidence regarding the potential content of the witnesses\u2019 testimony. It is conceivable that Lehrkamp\u2019s counsel determined, as a matter of strategy, that the court would not grant a continuance, or that the witnesses\u2019 testimony would not materially affect the sentence. We cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"aq8-dedup-0\">\u00b629  In addition, Lehrkamp cannot demonstrate prejudice\u2014i.e., \u201cthat there was a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Turnsplenty, </em>\u00b6 14. As noted, the District Court based its sentence largely on Lehrkamp\u2019s prior record and behavior. The court also explicitly rejected the State\u2019s lengthier recommended sentence. The record suggests that any testimony explaining context for Lehrkamp\u2019s explicit language in the recordings would not materially have impacted the length of Lehrkamp\u2019s sentence. Lehrkamp thus has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he might have received a shorter sentence had his counsel sought a continuance for his mother and sister to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b630 <em>3. Whether the District Court imposed an unlawful sentence by misapplying the persistent felony offender statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b631 Lehrkamp argues that the District Court incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA\u2014pertaining to repeat PFOs\u2014and wrongly designated him as a PFO under that subsection of the statute. Lehrkamp contends that for \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, and its ten-year minimum sentence to apply, the State was required to show that Lehrkamp was previously designated as a PFO, which he was not. Lehrkamp argues that even though he legally could have been designated as a PFO at the time of his 2014 assault conviction, he does not qualify as a repeat PFO under \u00a7 46-18-502(2), MCA, because the State did not seek a PFO designation for the prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b632 Section 46-18-502(1), MCA, provides, with exceptions, that \u201ca persistent felony offender shall be imprisoned in the state prison for a term of not less than 5 years or more than 100 years.\u201d Section 46-18-502(2), MCA, provides, with exceptions, that \u201can offender shall be imprisoned in a state prison for a term of not less than 10 years or more than 100 years\u201d if, in part, the offender was a persistent felony offender \u201cat the time of the offender\u2019s previous felony conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u00b633 Lehrkamp\u2019s sentence of ten years falls within the statutory range of both \u00a7 46-18-502(1) and (2), MCA. The court explained at the hearing, \u201cI don\u2019t care even if you take it to the Montana Supreme Court and say, it could have been 5, I think 10 years is an appropriate amount given the entire circumstances here.\u201d In its written judgment, the court stated that it had made clear to the parties at the sentencing hearing that the sentence \u201cwould be the same whether the defendant was sentenced under Section 46-18-502(1), MCA, or Section 46-18-502(2), MCA.\u201d Regardless of which of the two subsections of the PFO statute applied, the court intended to sentence Lehrkamp to ten years in prison. The court\u2019s ten-year sentence therefore fell \u201cwithin the parameters set by\u201d \u00a7 46-18-502(1) and (2), MCA. <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59. The District Court\u2019s ten-year sentence was not unlawful. <em>See Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"AYnN\">\u00b634 <em>4. Whether certain terms of the District Court\u2019s written judgment should be stricken for conflicting with the oral pronouncement of sentence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b635 Lehrkamp argues that the written judgment\u2019s twenty-three recommended conditions for community supervision should be stricken because the court did not include them in its oral pronouncement of sentence. He contends similarly that the handwritten note on the written judgment constitutes a parole restriction, that the court did not mention a parole restriction in the oral sentence, and therefore that the note should be stricken from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b636 The State concedes that the twenty-three recommended conditions are unlawful because the court did not include them in its oral pronouncement of sentence. The State argues, however, that the court\u2019s handwritten note did not constitute a parole restriction, but rather explained the court\u2019s reasoning for the sentence imposed. In the State\u2019s view, the handwritten note did not add any terms not included in the oral sentence and is therefore not unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b637 \u201cThe oral pronouncement of a criminal sentence in the presence of the defendant is the legally effective sentence and valid, final judgment. In the event of a conflict between the oral pronouncement and the written judgment, the oral pronouncement of a sentence controls.\u201d <em>State v. Harrison, </em>2016 MT 271, \u00b6 9, 385 Mont. 227, 383 P.3d 202 (citation and internal quotations omitted). In assessing whether such a conflict exists, we examine \u201cwhether a written judgment had, without notice, substantively increased a defendant\u2019s criminal sentence which had been previously imposed in open court.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>2017 MT 107, \u00b6 8, 387 Mont. 339, 394 P.3d 197 (citation and internal quotations omitted). When a portion of a sentence is illegal and cannot be corrected, we remand with instructions to strike the illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>provision. <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b638 In pronouncing its oral sentence, the District Court noted that Lehrkamp was a \u201cserious persistent felony offender,\u201d that the attitude he expressed in the recorded phone conversations \u201cpermeate[d] throughout\u201d his behavior, and that he had \u201cearned [his] way to prison.\u201d The court\u2019s handwritten note in the judgment stated that Lehrkamp was \u201cnot currently appropriate for community supervision\u201d and that he was a \u201crepeat felony offender\u201d whose \u201cactions and statements demand consequences.\u201d The court placed the note near the end of the judgment, immediately after the sentence, \u201cIn imposing the foregoing sentence, the Court considered the pre-sentence investigation report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b639 We disagree with Lehrkamp\u2019s interpretation that the court\u2019s handwritten note constituted a restriction on parole and that it therefore conflicted with the oral sentence, which included no such restriction. The court\u2019s sentence, according to its statements at the hearing, was based in large part on Lehrkamp\u2019s status as a PFO and on his prior behavior. The note merely provides further explanation for the court\u2019s sentence, and it largely mirrors the reasons for the sentence that the court gave in its oral pronouncement. The note does not \u201csubstantively increase! ]\u201d Lehrkamp\u2019s sentence and thus does not unlawfully conflict with the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence. <em>Thompson, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b640 The parties agree that the twenty-three recommended conditions listed in the written judgment were not included in the oral pronouncement of sentence, that they are unlawful, and that they must be stricken. We agree that the proper remedy is to remand with instructions that the District Court strike the recommended conditions. <em>See Heafner, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b641 The prosecutor\u2019s remarks at sentencing were improper, but they did not prejudice Lehrkamp and therefore did not constitute reversible error. Lehrkamp has not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court\u2019s sentence was not unlawful. The judgment is affirmed in part, but we remand to the District Court with instructions to strike the twenty-three recommended conditions for community supervision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICE WHEAT, SANDEFUR and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
