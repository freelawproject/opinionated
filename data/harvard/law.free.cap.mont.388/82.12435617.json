Kirscher, Bankruptcy Judge. The certified question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-22\">Whether, under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, Debtor may claim an exemption in a health savings account (HSA) pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(d) or (f), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-23\">We answer that question \u201cyes\u00bb\u201d the Debtor may claim an exemption for a health savings account under Montana law within the constraints imposed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-24\">\u00b62 The undisputed facts of this matter, supplied by the Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Court, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">1. The Debtor filed his Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on January 22,2016.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">2. The case was converted to a Chapter 7 on July 22, 2016, and Joseph V. Womack was appointed Trustee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">3. The Debtor filed an Amended Schedule A/B on August 23,2016, detailing the property owned at the time that the Debtor filed his bankruptcy case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">4. The Debtor answered Question No. 17 on Form 106A/B by checking \u201cYes\u201d indicating that he owned checking, savings, and other financial accounts. On Line 17.2 the Debtor listed \u201cother financial account\u201d \u201cBANK OF AMERICA HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNT.\u201d The Debtor stated that the balance of the account was $14,319.61.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">5.

To date the Debtor\u2019s withdrawal of funds from the Health Savings Account has been applied exclusively to qualified medical expenses and for no other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">The Bankruptcy Court states that there is no appellate decision in Montana on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b107-15\">\u00b63 The parties agree that this case presents a question of law certified to this Court pursuant to M. R. App. P. 15(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-17\">\u00b64 <em>Whether, under Montana\u2019s liberal construction of exemptions, Debtor may claim an exemption for a health savings account pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(d) or (f), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">\u00b65 An estate in bankruptcy consists of all legal and equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the date of filing. The debtor is allowed to exempt some property from the estate, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 541(a)(1) and 522, and States may \u201copt out\u201d of the exemptions provided under Federal law, as Montana has done. <em>In re Zimmerman, et al., </em>2002 MT 90, \u00b6 7, 309 Mont. 337, 46 P.3d 599; \u00a7 31-2-106, MCA. Article XIII, Section 5 of the Montana Constitution requires the Legislature to enact \u201cliberal\u201d exemptions, and Montana courts construe such exemptions liberally in favor of the debtor. <em>In re Archer, </em>2006 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>82, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 1, 136 P.3d 563. The intent of the exemptions and of the principle of liberal construction is to prevent the debtor and dependents from becoming destitute. <em>In re Glass, </em>164 B.R. 759, 764 (Bankruptcy Panel, 9th Cir.). The exemptions provided by Montana law are in Title 25, chapter 13, part 6, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b66 Long ago this Court described the liberal application of exemptions as a \u201cwise and humane policy\u201d required by the Montana Constitution, which should not be \u201cfrittered away by construction so as to destroy their value.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Speith, </em>13 Mont. 487, 493, 34 P. 1020, 1021 (1893). In accordance with the Constitution, Montana case law requires that statutory exemptions be \u201cliberally construed in favor of debtors <em>.\u2019\u2019 Zimmerman, </em>\u00b6 15. <em>In MacDonald v. Mercill, </em>220 Mont. 146, 714 P.2d 132 (1986) this Court liberally construed the exemption for tools and implements necessary to carry on a trade as covering the debtor\u2019s backhoe and flatbed trailer. Where the Legislature has expressly included an item in the list of statutory exemptions, it will be liberally construed in favor of the debtor to allow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b67 Section 25-13-608(l)(d), MCA, allows ajudgment debtor to exempt from execution \u201cdisability or illness benefits\u201d while \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA, exempts \u201cbenefits paid or payable for medical, surgical, or hospital care to the extent that they are used or will be used to pay for the care.\u201d The parties have focused their arguments on \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA, and the issue here is whether that exemption applies to the Debtor\u2019s health savings account.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b68 In <em>Archer </em>we described the statutory exemptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">Section 25-13-608, MCA, provides an extensive list of exemptions from execution, including prescribed health aids, Social Security benefits, veterans\u2019 benefits, individual retirement accounts, maintenance and child support, burial plots and certain types of statutory retirement system payments. The common denominator in all these exemptions is their specificity\u2014all are unique types of support created for specific purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"><em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 18. An HSA is an account recognized by Federal law, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223, and by Montana law, \u00a7\u00a7 15-61-201 through -205, MCA. It is funded by the Debtor and provides the Debtor a \u201cbenefit\u201d that may be used to pay for medical, surgical or hospital care. This falls within the term \u201cbenefits\u201d in \u00a7 25-13-608(1)\u00a9, MCA. This Court concluded that \u201cbenefits\u201d under that statute are those \u201cexpressly earmarked for the sole purpose of paying medical, surgical, or hospital bills.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 19. It is plain that a debtor\u2019s HSA provides him with a unique benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>earmarked to pay for medical care and expenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">\u00b69  Following the constitutional and statutory considerations outlined above, we conclude that \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA, applies to an HSA as presented in this case, to the extent that it is \u201cused or will be used to pay for the care\u201d described in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b610 The Dissent asserts that we should follow our decision in <em>Archer </em>and hold that there is no exemption for the HSA. The debtor in <em>Archer </em>did not seek exemption for an HSA, but rather sought exemption for the proceeds from the sale of stock that the debtor intended to use for medical expenses. The fund in <em>Archer </em>was very different from an HSA, which is a specific account recognized by both state and federal law that provides incentives for use of the funds for medical expenses and penalties if they are used for other purposes. Clearly the accounts are created specifically to be \u201cpayable for medical\u201d care. The funds in an HSA are unique and easily distinguishable from the proceeds from a sale of shares of stock held by the debtor, as in <em>Archer. </em>The Bankruptcy Court would not have certified the present question to this Court had the issue been settled in <em>Archer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b611 We observed in <em>Archer </em>that the \u201ccommon denominator\u201d in the exemptions listed in \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA, \u201cis their specificity\u2014all are unique types of support created for specific purposes.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 18. Health Savings Accounts likewise were created for a specific purpose: to support the payment of medical costs. The language of \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, is sufficiently descriptive of the nature of HSAs to include them within its coverage. But unlike most of the specific exemptions listed in the statute, the Legislature included a fact-based qualifier in subsection (l)(f), providing explicitly that medical, surgical, or hospital benefits be exempt \u201cto the extent they are used or will be used to pay for the care.\u201d This leaves open the distinct possibility that some funds set aside in the HSA will not be exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b612 In the case of <em>In re Joseph Berdecia-Rodriguez, </em>2016 Bankr. LEXIS 3582 (Bank. D. Mont. 2016), the Bankruptcy Court reached the same conclusion. The Court determined that the HSA is a \u201cbenefit\u201d paid or payable to the Debtor, and that it is intended to pay for medical, surgical or hospital care as provided in \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>MCA. While the proceeds of an HSA may be used for other purposes upon payment of a statutory penalty, the Court determined that this is accounted for in the Montana statute, which provides an exemption only <em>\u201cto the extent\u201d </em>that the HSA funds are used for the described medical purposes. Both federal and Montana law restrict withdrawals from HSA accounts, and thus limit the permissible uses for the funds. Both impose penalties for other uses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223; \u00a7\u00a7 15-61-203, - 205, MCA. In the present case, as in <em>Berdecia-Rodriguez, </em>the Debtor has applied the HSA funds \u201cexclusively to qualified medical expenses and for no other purpose.\u201d The Bankruptcy Court held that the debtor was entitled to an exemption for the HSA funds \u201cso long as\u201d he applies them to qualified medical expenses under \u00a7 25-13-608(1)\u00a9, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b613 The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s construction of the exemption in \u00a7 25-13-608(1)\u00a9, MCA, furthers the established principles of Montana law, noted above, to liberally construe specific statutory exemptions in favor of the debtor. While the funds might be used for a non-medical purpose, such use is subject to a statutory penalty. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(f)(2), (4). Any such use would disqualify those funds from exemption and, under <em>Berdecia-Rodriguez, </em>the Trustee could recover those funds from the Debtor. In addition, under Montana law a false claim to funds in an HSA is subject to criminal penalties for theft. Section 15-61-205, MCA. The Bankruptcy Court can impose such safeguards as it deems prudent to monitor an exempt fund to ensure that the money is used for a proper purpose consistent with the statutory restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b614 We note that the Montana Legislature in its last session also amended \u00a7 25-13-608, MCA. Senate Bill No. 216, signed by the Governor on May 4, 2017 (Ch. 298, Laws of 2017). That legislation specifically adds contributions to certain health or medical savings accounts to the list of exemptions a judgment debtor is allowed to exclude from execution. That enactment provides much more clarification of how and under what circumstances an HSA will be exempt, and it will supersede the applicability of \u00a7 25-13-608(1)\u00a9, MCA, to such accounts. We construe the existing language of the statute for application to this case, which arose before the recent amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b615 We hold that a Debtor may claim an exemption for a health savings account (HSA) pursuant to \u00a7 25-13-608(1)\u00a9, MCA, to the extent that it is \u201cused or will be used to pay for the care\u201d described in the statute.</p>\n<judges id=\"b110-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, BAKER, SHEA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\"> We decline to apply \u00a7 15-61-202(7), MCA, so as to overcome the plain exemption described in \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA. That provision applies to the personal tax liability of an account holder for withdrawals from the account. In addition, as discussed further below, that subsection has been repealed by the Montana Legislature, Senate Bill No. 216, signed by the Governor on May 4, 2017 (Chapter 298, Laws 2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b111-5\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"ALj\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b616 In <em>Archer, </em>virtually the same arguments were made as here. Archer suffered from significant, ongoing medical expenses. The proceeds from a sales contract he held were \u201cused exclusively to pay for [Archer\u2019s] end-of-life medical, surgical or hospital care and medications.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 6. Like Giacometto argues here, Archer argued that the proceeds should be exempted under \u00a7 25-13-608(1)(f), MCA, \u201cto the extent those proceeds are used for [his] medical care,\u201d and because \u201cexemption statutes must be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"aio-dedup-0\">\u00b617 We rejected those arguments, and held that the term \u201cbenefits\u201d under \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA, \u201cincludes only those payments to a debtor which are <em>expressly earmarked </em>for the <em>sole purpose </em>of paying medical, surgical or hospital bills.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 19 (emphasis added). Because there were \u201cno contractual restrictions\u201d on Archer\u2019s use of the proceeds that would prohibit him from using the funds for something other than the \u201csole purpose\u201d of medical costs, we held that the proceeds could not be exempted under \u00a7 25-13-608(l)(f), MCA. We also noted that the principle of liberal construction of bankruptcy exemptions \u201cmay not disregard plain legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u00b618 The Court plows much ground in an effort to distinguish the HSA here from the contract in <em>Archer, </em>but misses the most salient point: that the account holder of an HSA is no more required to spend the funds on medical care than the contract holder was in <em>Archer. </em>Quite simply, the funds in an HSA are not \u201cexpressly earmarked for the sole purpose\u201d of medical costs. <em>Archer, </em>\u00b6 19. Indeed, the Court\u2019s emphasis on the State and Federal regulation of the account is mere window-dressingbecause it is nonetheless expressly permissible for Giacometto to use the account for any purpose of his choosing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-61-203(1), MCA (an account holder \u201cmay withdraw money from the individual\u2019s medical care savings account for any purpose other than an eligible medical expense ....\u201d). The true distinguishing point between the Court\u2019s decision and our decision in <em>Archer </em>is that the account here has \u201chealth\u201d in its title, while the contract in <em>Archer </em>did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u00b619 The account holder\u2019s ability to spend the funds in the HSA for any purpose necessitates the adoption of a new rule by the Court for later \u201cdisqualification\u201d of the exemption if the money is spent for other purposes. Such \u201cdisqualification\u201d could require the bankruptcy trustee to chase down debtors years after cases have closed, when the trustee discovers that the HSAs have \u201clost\u201d their exempt status. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>has, in effect, legislated a special process for administration of an exemption, one that could be elongated over many years. This should be a legislative call. \u201c \u2018In the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u2019 Section 1-2-101, MCA.\u201d <em>In re Golz, </em>2015 MT 318, \u00b6 13, 381 Mont. 385, 360 P.3d 1142 (holding that inherited IRAs are not exempt from the bankruptcy estate).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b620 Busy with its own legislating, the Court overlooks the obvious implication of the real Legislature\u2019s recent enactment of SB 216 in the 2017 Legislative Session. The bill was entitled \u201cAn Act Exempting ... Medical Savings Accounts from Bankruptcy,\u201d creating for the first time an exemption for HSAs. As we are to presume \u201cthat the Legislature does not pass meaningless or useless legislation,\u201d <em>Lucas Ranch, Inc. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>2015 MT 115, \u00b6 15, 379 Mont. 28, 347 P.3d 1249, the effect of the legislation was to change the prior status of HSAs. This effect is confirmed by SB 216\u2019s corresponding repeal of \u00a7 15-61-202(7), MCA, which, as the Trustee notes, was a prior statutory indication that such accounts would <em>not </em>be considered exempt in a bankruptcy proceeding. The repeal of this section was necessary to make HSAs exempt in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b621 Based upon our precedent interpreting the subject statutes, I would answer the question in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
