We affirm, and address the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\"><em>1. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by not objecting to the mental-state jury instruction </em>?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">\n<em>2. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by not objecting to evidence regarding Golie\u2019s \u201cbrothers\u201d or \u201cModern Outlaw\u201d?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\"><em>3. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by revealing that Golie was on </em>probation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">\n<em>4. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by not objecting to the admission of testimony that vouched for the testimony of others?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\u00b62 In January 2011, a Hamilton, Montana, pawn shop was burglarized. Among the items taken was a unique necklace with a broken clasp. Law enforcement investigated, but identified no suspects. In March 2011, Josh Edmondson (Edmondson) attempted to pawn the necklace with the broken clasp at the same pawn shop. The shop owner recognized the necklace and confronted Edmondson, who said that a friend named Andrew had given the necklace to him, but claimed to not know Andrew\u2019s last name. Edmondson telephoned Golie, who acknowledged the necklace was stolen and told Edmondson he was stupid for having tried to pawn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">\u00b63 The following day, Golie and a friend, Wilkins, appeared at Edmondson\u2019s home around 10:30 p.m. Golie instructed Edmondson to confess to authorities that Edmondson had stolen the necklace, and told Edmondson that he knew where Edmondson\u2019s child slept, his dog slept, and where he lived. Fearing for his family\u2019s safety, Edmondson contacted law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u00b64 Golie was charged with felony intimidation, \u00a7 45-5-203(l)(a), MCA, and felony tampering with witnesses and informants, \u00a7 45-7-206(1), MCA. Sasha Brownlee (Brownlee) represented Golie throughout the trial proceedings, in which the jury acquitted Golie of intimidation, but convicted him on the witness tampering charge. Golie appealed, arguing to this Court that Brownlee was ineffective for failing to object to a jury instruction. Reasoning that the claim could not be reviewed on direct appeal, we affirmed Golie\u2019s conviction without prejudice to his pursuit of postconviction relief. <em>State v. Golie, </em>2013 MT 321N, No. DA 12-0454, 2013 Mont. LEXIS 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b65 Golie filed a PCR petition in January 2014, stating eight claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) by Brownlee. In a 75-page order, the District Court extensively analyzed and denied all claims. Golie appeals four of those claims. Additional facts as necessary are cited herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s denial of postconviction relief to determine if the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and if its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Lacey v. State, </em>2017 MT 18, \u00b6 13, 386 Mont. 204, 389 P.3d 233 (citing <em>Kenfield v. State, </em>2016 MT 197, \u00b6 7, 384 Mont. 322, 377 P.3d 1207). We review de novo the mixed questions of law and fact presented by claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Whitlow v. State, </em>2008 MT 150, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (citing <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u00b67 A defendant\u2019s right to counsel is guaranteed both by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10. Ineffective assistance claims are evaluated under the two-prong test articulated in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Lacey, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. \u201cA defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT 35, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 63, 153 P.3d 601). As such, \u201cif an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 11 (citing <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b68 Under the first prong, a defendant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. Although strategic decisions may be considered sound, and thus effective, categorizing actions as strategic or tactical \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the conduct was objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 18. Accordingly, whether counsel\u2019s actions come within the \u201cwide range of professionally competent assistance\u201d is determined by \u201cthe facts of the particular case, viewed at the time of counsel\u2019s conduct\u201d and must be viewed \u201cin light of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\u00b69 The second prong requires demonstration that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. To prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b610 \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. There is a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel\u2019s actions \u201c Tall[] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitlow, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065); <em>accord Lacey, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Taylor v. State, </em>2014 MT 142, \u00b6 12, 375 Mont. 234, 335 P.3d 1218. We thus turn to Golie\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did counsel provide ineffective assistance by not objecting to the mental-state jury instruction </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">\u00b612 In his direct appeal, Golie argued Brownlee was ineffective by failing to object to the conduct-based mental state instructions given to the jury. <em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 5. We affirmed in a non-cite opinion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">The record here simply does not allow us to undertake an adequate review of Golie\u2019s IAC allegation and, therefore, he must seek postconviction relief (PCR). It is unclear from the record why Brownlee did not object to the conduct-based \u201cknowingly\u201d jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>instruction. Brownlee\u2019s actions may well have been taken within her tactical discretion; inquiry into the reasons for her decision may properly occur in PCR.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><em>Golie, </em>\u00b6 7. Golie argues that the \u201cobvious implication\u201d of this language is that witness tampering is a result-based offense, which became binding law of the case upon remand. However, as the District Court concluded, Golie reads too much into our opinion, which merely held that the issue could not be reviewed on direct appeal, but could be pursued in postconviction proceedings. We did not reach the merits of the instructional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b613 The District Court instructed the jury that a person \u201cacts knowingly when the person is aware of his conduct,\u201d and \u201cacts purposely when it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d Golie claims that Brownlee was ineffective by not objecting to these conduct-based instructions, because witness tampering is a result-based offense that criminalizes causing someone to \u201ctestify or inform falsely\u201d or \u201cwithhold any testimony, information, document or thing,\u201d which are results. Golie argues the statute does not particularize conduct, which could be a wide variety of actions, but rather particularizes results, and required result-based mental state instructions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b614 In <em>State v. Lambert, </em>280 Mont. 231, 929 P.2d 846 (1996), upon which Golie relies, we considered whether the offense of criminal endangerment, \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, was a conduct-based or result-based crime. Under the statute, a person who \u201cknowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another,\u201d commits the crime. Section 45-5-207(1), MCA. The district court in <em>Lambert </em>gave the jury an instruction defining \u201cknowingly\u201d as a conduct-based offense. <em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont, at 234, 929 P.2d 847. We held the district court erred by giving a conduct-based mental intent instruction, because \u00a7 45-5-207(1), MCA, \u201cemphasizes result over conduct,\u201d and explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">The portion of the statute that we are reviewing here does not particularize the conduct that, if engaged in, results in the commission of the offense. Rather, a person may engage in a wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>variety of conduct and still commit the offense of criminal endangerment, provided that the conduct creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm. <em>It is the avoidance of this singular result, </em>the risk of death or serious harm, that the law attempts to maintain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Lambert, </em>280 Mont. at 236, 929 P.2d at 849 (emphasis added). Without creating the result of substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, one has not committed the crime of criminal endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b615 In contrast, witness tampering, \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA, criminalizes conduct, not a result. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">A person commits the offense of tampering with witnesses and informants if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, the person purposely or knowingly attempts to induce or otherwise cause a witness or informant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">(a) testify or inform falsely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">(b) withhold any testimony, information, document, or thing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">(c) elude legal process summoning the witness or informant to testify or supply evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">(d) not appear at any proceeding or investigation to which the witness or informant has been summoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Section 45-7-206(1), MCA. The statute criminalizes, when one believes an official proceeding or investigation is pending, an <em>attempt </em>to \u201cinduce or otherwise cause a witness or informant\u201d to lie, withhold information, elude process, or not appear. Section 45-7-206(1), MCA. Under the text, the crime does not require a witness or informant to actually be induced to carry through with the action\u2014a particular result is not criminalized. As the State correctly notes, the statute has \u201cno requirement that any particular result actually be achieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5e\">\u00b616  The District Court\u2019s conduct-based instructions defining \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cpurposely\u201d were correct, and Brownlee\u2019s lack of an objection did not constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">\u00b617 <em>2. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by not objecting to evidence regarding Golie\u2019s \u201cbrothers\u201d or \u201cModern Outlaw\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">\u00b618 Breanna Chaffin (Chaffin), Edmondson\u2019s wife at the time of the incident, testified at trial that when Golie appeared at their home, he stated, \u201cI\u2019m not getting in trouble for this. So you better figure out how to fix it because I have people in this town that I know and I have brothers that you know what we\u2019re capable of.\u201d This was the first mention of Golie\u2019s \u201cbrothers,\u201d but the topic was addressed during redirect examination of Shawna Cantrell (Cantrell), Golie\u2019s wife. Cantrell stated that Golie had only one, biological brother, but that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>referred to \u201c[h]is friends\u201d as his \u201cbrothers.\u201d When asked about \u201cModern Outlaw,\u201d Cantrell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">Q. Have you ever heard of Modern Outlaw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">A. Yeah, I\u2019ve heard of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Q. What\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">A. It\u2019s a family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Q. It\u2019s a family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">Q. Family, what\u2014of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">A. I\u2019m not really sure about the whole thing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">She later added that it was not a gang, but a \u201cfamily of people\u201d that included Golie.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">\u00b619 Detective Steven Brunner-Murphy (Brunner-Murphy) testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a-b-dedup-0\">Q. Mr. Golie made a statement about brothers. Do you understand the significance of that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-15\">A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-16\">Q. What is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-17\">A. In Mr. Golie\u2019s position, the term \u201cbrothers\u201d is one that I\u2019ve heard him refer to other people as. Not commonly just your blood family members or stepbrothers or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-18\">I\u2019ve listened to a number of Mr. Golie\u2019s phone calls while he\u2019s been incarcerated. And during a number of these calls he makes reference to brothers and having contact with brothers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-19\">He makes reference to Modern Outlaw along those same lines as\u2014speaking of his brothers and Modern Outlaw and talks about it as if it\u2019s some sort of group or association or gang of some sort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKj\">Q. Is it a family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-20\">A. To the best of my knowledge, I haven\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m aware of most of Mr. Golie\u2019s family members, and I have not been able to make any of those connections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-21\">\u00b620 Brownlee did not object to this testimony regarding Golie\u2019s \u201cbrothers\u201d or the references to \u201cModern Outlaw,\u201d but questioned Golie about the references during his direct examination. Golie denied that he was involved in a gang, and explained that the term \u201cModern Outlaws\u201d was one he used in the past in conjunction with the music he performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">\u00b621 Golie argues that Brownlee\u2019s failure to object to this evidence was ineffective because evidence of gang affiliation was prejudicial to him and eroded the presumption of innocence, encouraging the jury to find him guilty upon a purported gang affiliation. The State argues that the evidence was proper because Golie first invoked the term \u201cbrothers\u201d when he spoke to Edmondson and his wife in their home, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>\u201chighly relevant to proving that Golie was in fact attempting to influence\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqyp\">\u00b622  Golie\u2019s reference to \u201cbrothers\u201d during his confrontation with Edmondson made the term a permissible area of inquiry for the State. However, no testimony or argument was offered to associate Golie with gang membership or activity, and both Golie and his wife testified that he was not part of a gang. No rebuttal was offered to Golie\u2019s testimony that the term \u201cModern Outlaw\u201d was related to his performance of music. Golie has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that Brownlee\u2019s decision to not object, and instead elicit explanatory testimony from Golie, fell outside the range of professional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"A3i\">\u00b623 <em>3. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by revealing that Golie was on </em>probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b624 During a discussion between Brownlee, prosecutor Ryan Weldon, Detective Brunner-Murphy, and the District Court, involving the chain of evidence for Golie\u2019s cell phone, Brunner-Murphy stated the phone was in police possession at the time he executed a search warrant, but it may have been released thereafter. Brownlee replied, \u201cYour Honor, that has\u2014actually, Mr. Golie told me that was released to his probation officer and given back to him ....\u201d Brownlee later acknowledged that she should not have mentioned Golie\u2019s status as a probationer, and elicited the following testimony from Golie:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Brownlee: One other real quick question: I mentioned, which I shouldn\u2019t have, but you were on probation in Missoula. That was a misdemeanor probation for DUI, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Golie: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">Brownlee: Thank you. No further questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">\u00b625 Golie argues that Brownlee\u2019s statement revealed he had been on probation and prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury because \u201cit aroused the jury\u2019s sympathy and negative feelings toward convicted criminals and DUI without regarding to its utter lack of probative value.\u201d The State counters that reference to \u201ca nonviolent traffic offense requiring no criminal intent\u201d did not cause prejudice because the jury would have no difficulty distinguishing a DUI from the current charge, and was instructed generally about permissible uses of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">\u00b626 In her postconviction testimony, Brownlee acknowledged she had sought and been granted a motion in limine regarding Golie\u2019s prior criminal history, and that it was error for her to reference Golie\u2019s status as a probationer. She explained her decision to recall Golie to the stand to address the issue, stating \u201c[a]t the time it was a strategy in my head to maybe mitigate what they were thinking about Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Golie, because I thought if their mind raised then about [sic] what he had done before, I thought it was better to maybe get it on the record that it was a misdemeanor and it was something\u2014not a serious offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">\u00b627  We agree with the District Court that Golie was not prejudiced by the brief reference to his probationer status. Unlike the crimes of witness tampering and intimidation, misdemeanor DUI is a nonviolent traffic offense that was clearly distinguishable from the allegations at issue. Any potential prejudice of the disclosure was mitigated by the instruction limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of other crimes, wrongs, or acts. We conclude that Golie has not demonstrated that the reference affected the outcome of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b628 <em>4. Did counsel render ineffective assistance by not objecting to the admission of testimony that vouched for the testimony of others?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u00b629 When Brunner-Murphy was on the stand, the State elicited the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">Q. When you discussed or began to investigate the threats made toward Josh Edmondson from Mr. Golie, did you take those seriously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">A. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">Q. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">A. For several reasons. The interviews that were conducted separately with [Edmondson], [Chaffin], and Logan [Brown] provided a lot of credibility because, you know, although their statements were given separately, there was a lot of consistency to what they had to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">The other part of that is Mr. Edmondson was clearly extremely afraid. Mr. Edmondson\u2014you know, I believe that during his interview with Officer Auch I think he had said that he was tearing up. And the fears\u2014the statements that he provided that he was afraid of things weren\u2019t\u2014they weren\u2019t what I would commonly expect somebody to say if they weren\u2019t telling the truth. All someone has to do to accuse someone of intimidating them, for instance, is say he threatened to kill me. Okay, that would probably meet the element of that crime given the situation. Mr. Edmondson\u2019s statements were very detailed down to I believe he had stated that Mr. Golie had even threatened his dogs. And his fears were very articulated as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">Breanna talked about going out and taking her keys out of her vehicle and locking the doors. They talked about locking their doors for the first time in a long time. These are things that struck me as being truthful statements because it\u2019s not commonplace for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>somebody that\u2019s fabricating that kind of events to come up with all the details that you do when you are actually living a chain of events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u00b630 Brownlee had sought and obtained an order in limine prohibiting the State\u2019s witnesses from offering \u201ctestimony regarding the credibility of another witness,\u201d but offered no objection to Brunner-Murphy\u2019s testimony. In her postconviction testimony, she acknowledged that Brunner-Murphy was vouching for the witnesses, and explained she had a tactical reason for not objecting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">[Golie] and I were writing notes and looking at each other because, to be honest, at the time we felt like at the time Detective Murphy was looking less and less credible by saying this, because the testimony of those individuals was very poor and they didn\u2019t seem credible at all. And again, it seemed like the State kept saying we are not lying, we are not lying, really, really, we are not lying, and they didn\u2019t seem credible on the stand at all. And so when Detective Murphy was saying these guys are really, really credible, I was letting him go with it, because it seemed like he was making himself look less credible by saying that over and over again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b631 Golie argues that Brunner-Murphy\u2019s statements constituted vouchingfor the credibility of the State\u2019s witnesses and prejudiced him because credibility is a determination left solely to the jury, and Brownlee should have objected. The State responds that Brownlee had attacked the credibility of the witnesses in her opening statement, so the prosecution was justified in providing rebuttal credibility evidence. Further, even if the testimony was improper, Brownlee had a \u201creasonable strategic explanation for her decision not to object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6\">\u00b632  We agree with the District Court that Brownlee\u2019s decision to not object was objectively reasonable. \u201cThe decisions on the timing and number of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Matson, </em>227 Mont. 36, 47, 736 P.2d 971, 978 (1987). It is not unreasonable for counsel to refrain from objecting if she reasonably believes that withholding an objection serves a defense purpose. Brownlee did not render ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u00b633 We conclude the District Court did not err in denying Golie\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b285-11\">JUSTICES WHEAT, McKINNON, SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-9\"> \u201cKnowingly\u201d is alternatively defined as follows: \u201cA person acts knowingly with respect to the <em>result of conduct </em>described by a statute defining an offense when the person is aware that it is highly probable that the result will be caused by the person\u2019s conduct.\u201d Section 45-2-101(35), MCA (emphasis added). \u201cPurposely\u201d is likewise alternatively defined.
