After a jury trial, Mitchell was convicted of assault with a weapon upon Heather, and acquitted of the two counts involving Tanner. Mitchell appeals his conviction. We affirm, addressing the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\"><em>1. Did defense counsel provide ineffective assistance by failing to request a bystander justifiable use of force jury </em>instruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\"><em>2. Did the District Court impose illegal parole </em>conditions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\u00b62 On November 19, 2014, police responded to an emergency call at the residence of Paula and Jeff Comer. Comers\u2019 daughter, Heather Conway, and her husband, Tanner Conway, lived with Comers and slept in a second-floor bedroom. Additionally, Comers\u2019 other daughter, Courtney Comer, and her boyfriend, Mitchell, lived with them and slept in a basement bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\u00b63 The emergency call was spawned by an altercation, which eventually involved the entire family. Mitchell and Courtney began the day with an argument and continued squabbling throughout the day. Mitchell got drunk and high, returned home later in the day, and passed out in the kitchen. Courtney arrived home after work, and found Mitchell passed out and covered in vomit. She woke him and cleaned him; thereafter, they commenced a loud verbal argument. Meanwhile, Tanner and Heather were attempting to sleep in their upstairs bedroom, and, at one point, Tanner went downstairs to ask Mitchell and Courtney to be quiet. Mitchell began to argue with Tanner, stating he had never liked Tanner and calling him a \u201chonky\u201d and a \u201ccracker.\u201d In response, Tanner called Mitchell a \u201cnigger.\u201d The verbal fight between Tanner and Mitchell escalated until Tanner headed back upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">\u00b64 Meanwhile, Heather, Courtney, and Jeff tried to physically remove Mitchell from the house. Tanner returned to the landing at the base of the stairs with a baseball bat and shouted at Mitchell, telling him to leave. While Heather called emergency services, Courtney and Jeff tried to shove Mitchell out the door, but he pushed his way into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Courtney and Jeff disarmed Mitchell. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Paula entered the fray and told Mitchell to leave. However, instead of leaving, Mitchell grabbed a second knife and engaged Tanner. Courtney and Heather placed themselves between Tanner and Mitchell. In the ensuing fight, Mitchell cut Heather with the knife, stabbed Tanner in the chest, and bit Tanner\u2019s finger. Tanner hit Mitchell with the baseball bat. Their fight ranged from the kitchen, down the basement stairs, and back up the stairs. Finally, Courtney and Heather shoved Mitchell out the front door. Locked out of the house, Mitchell began to pound on the door and shout threats until police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b65 Mitchell was charged with one count of assault with a weapon and one count of aggravated assault upon Tanner, and one count of assault with a weapon upon Heather, all felonies. Mitchell asserted the defense of justifiable use of force. Defense counsel did not seek, and the jury was not given, any instructions designating Heather as a \u201cbystander\u201d or addressing her status as such. The jury found Mitchell guilty of assaulting Heather with a weapon, and acquitted him of the two charges involving Tanner. Mitchell appeals, primarily challenging the effectiveness of his counsel regarding the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b66 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are mixed questions of fact and law, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Whitlow, </em>2008 MT 140, \u00b6 9, 343 Mont. 90, 183 P.3d 861 (citing <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\u00b67 Criminal sentences are reviewed for legality. <em>State v. Tam Thanh Le, </em>2017 MT 82, \u00b6 7, 387 Mont. 224, 392 P.3d 607 (citing <em>State v. Patterson, </em>2016 MT 289, \u00b6 9, 385 Mont. 334, 384 P.3d 92).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">\u00b68 <em>1. Did defense counsel provide ineffective assistance by failing to request a bystander justifiable use of force jury </em>instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">\u00b69 The State argues the record does not indicate why trial counsel did not request an instruction applying Mitchell\u2019s justifiable use of force defense to an injured bystander, and thus, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim should instead be addressed in a postconviction proceeding. However, because we determine there was no ineffectiveness, regardless of counsel\u2019s reasons for not requesting the instruction, we take up the merits of the claim for reasons of efficient resolution and judicial economy. <em>See State v. Aker, </em>2013 MT 253, \u00b6 34, 371 Mont. 491, 310 P.3d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">\u00b610 To prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, the defendant must satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the two-pronged <em>Strickland, </em>test. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). The defendant must prove \u201chis counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and establish prejudice by demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>2015 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 380 Mont. 445, 358 P.3d 127 (citing <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095). If a petitioner fails to establish either prong, we need not address both prongs. <em>Williams, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Golden v. State, </em>2014 MT 141, \u00b6 15, 375 Mont. 222, 326 P.3d 430).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b611 Mitchell argues his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a bystander instruction directing jurors that, if they transferred Mitchell\u2019s criminal intent from stabbing Tanner to cutting Heather, then they must also transfer his self-defense justification as well. In other words, Mitchell argues the jury should have been explicitly instructed that Mitchell\u2019s justifiable use of force defense applied to the count involving Heather.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b612 Mitchell\u2019s argument is premised upon his interpretation of the State\u2019s theory offered to the jury. His briefing states: \u201cThe State\u2019s theory of guilt as to the assault on Heather was that although Edward did not mean to cut Heather, he was guilty just the same because he had done so while meaning to stab her husband Tanner.\u201d Mitchell claims the State sought and received a \u201ctransferred intent instruction,\u201d Instruction #29, which enveloped this theory. He further asserts that \u201cbased upon that transfer of intent mechanism, the jury found [Mitchell] guilty of assault for an undisputedly unintentional cut to Heather\u2019s finger.\u201d Consequently, his briefing offers extensive authority concerning the proposition that a justifiable use of force defense must also transfer with charges involving \u201cinnocent bystanders\u201d who are injured by the defendant. <em>See, i.e., California v. Mathews, </em>91 Cal. App. 3d 1018, 1024, 154 Cal. Rptr. 628, 631-32 (1979) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of self-defense is available to insulate one from criminal responsibility where his act, justifiably in self-defense, inadvertently results in the injury of an innocent bystander.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b613 However, Mitchell\u2019s interpretation of the State\u2019s theory, including his assumption that Heather was a bystander, conflicts with the law given to the jury in the instructions. Mitchell uses a partial quote from Instruction #29 to imply the jury was instructed concerning the transfer of his criminal intent to injure Tanner to Heather. However, a complete reading of Instruction #29 indicates otherwise. Instruction #29 explained that Mitchell could be convicted of assaulting Heather even if the particular injury she sustained was not within Mitchell\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>contemplation or purpose, if the result \u201cinvolves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated but... was different or occurred in a different way.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the instruction permitted the jury to convict Mitchell of assaulting Heather if Heather had sustained a similar kind of injury, even if it was not the particular harm Mitchell had contemplated when acting. Instruction #29 concerned the transfer of intent to cause the <em>injury </em>originally contemplated to the <em>injury </em>actually inflicted. It was not about the transfer of intent to injure the <em>party </em>originally contemplated to the <em>party </em>actually injured. Instruction #29 solely concerned Heather, not Tanner.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b614 In actuality, Mitchell is attempting to challenge his counsel\u2019s actions regarding an instruction proposed by the State and labelled in the record as Instruction #30, but which was never given to the jury, as Mitchell acknowledges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Proposed Instruction #30 was broader in scope than Instruction #29 and addressed, <em>inter alia, </em>the transfer of intent when \u201cthe result differs from that contemplated only in respect that a different <em>person </em>... is affected.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This instruction would have enveloped a theory transferring an intent to assault Tanner to Heather, but because the instruction was not given, the jury was never provided the option of deciding the case under this theory. Rather, in what may have been a lost opportunity by the State, the jury was instructed to decide the three counts \u201cstraight up\u201d as separate, independent counts, with separate verdict forms for each: two assault counts involving Tanner, and one assault count involving Heather. Under the instructions, Heather was never deemed an innocent bystander. This became the law of the case, despite any trial arguments made to the contrary. <em>See State v. Schmidt, </em>2009 MT 450, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70, 354 Mont. 280, 224 P.3d 618. The jury was separately instructed on each of the three counts, with the elements of assault with a weapon upon Heather set forth in Instruction #16. The jury was likewise instructed on Mitchell\u2019s defense of justifiable use of force. The jury was thus asked to decide whether Mitchell had purposely or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>knowingly caused bodily injury to Heather with a weapon, and whether he had used force justifiably. The jury obviously rejected Mitchell\u2019s positions that he had either unintentionally injured Heather or had used force against her justifiably, and convicted him on that count. As the prosecutor argued, Heather received a knife wound to her hand \u201cbecause she blocked [the knife], otherwise it would have impaled itself on her chest.\u201d Regarding the counts involving Tanner, the jury apparently accepted Mitchell\u2019s justifiable use of force defense and acquitted him.</p>\n<p id=\"AQqd\">\u00b615  Consequently, defense counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to ask for an instruction to supplement a theory that the State did not preserve for the jury\u2019s consideration under the law of the case. Mitchell has not established that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cwas deficient or fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d under the first prong of <em>Strickland. Williams, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b616 <em>2. Did the District Court impose illegal parole </em>conditions?</p>\n<p id=\"AAs4\">\u00b617  Mitchell was sentenced to ten years at the Montana State Prison, with three years suspended. The judgment entered by the District Court states, \u201cIt is further ordered that for any period of community supervision, the following conditions of probation will apply ....\u201d This phrase was followed by a list of 35 conditions. Mitchell contends the District Court violated its statutory sentencing authority by effectively imposing parole conditions by employing the language \u201cfor any period of community supervision.\u201d The State replies the District Court did not impose illegal parole conditions because the statement \u201cfor any period of community supervision\u201d was qualified by the language that followed applying \u201cconditions of probation.\u201d We agree. The District Court specified it was imposing \u201cconditions of probation,\u201d which will apply during any period of community supervision during the suspended portion of Mitchell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b444-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> Instruction #29 stated, in full: \u201cIf purposely or knowingly causing Assault with a Weapon against [Heather] was not within the contemplation or purpose of the Defendant, either element can nevertheless be established if the result involves the same kind of harm or injury as contemplated but the precise harm or injury was different or occurred in a different way, unless the actual result is too remote or accidental to have a bearing on the Defendant\u2019s liability or on the gravity of the offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> Instruction 30 is marked as \u201cgiven,\u201d but the transcript demonstrates it was never read to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
