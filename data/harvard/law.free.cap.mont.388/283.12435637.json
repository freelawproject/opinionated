Walker argues the court correctly preserved his partnership interest before ordering the partnership\u2019s dissolution. He counterclaims, however, on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, arguing that although the partnership agreement provided for an award of such fees to the party prevailing in litigation concerning partnership matters, Ballou\u2019s motion to recover those fees was deemed denied 60 days after the motion was filed. He claims the District Court was deprived of authority to consider the motion once it was deemed denied, but nevertheless awarded the fees to Ballou. This litigation thus presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-16\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court erred by concluding Walker was not subject to the buy-out provisions of the partnership agreement and dissolution was necessary.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\n<em>2. Whether the District Court was divested of its authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees more than 60 days after the motion for fees was filed.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b62 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\u00b63 Twin siblings Bonnie Ballou and William Walker were the principals in L 0 Ranch Limited Partnership (L O), a family partnership meant at its inception to steward a family ranch and its real property located in eastern Montana for multiple generations. L O\u2019s substantial holdings consist primarily of approximately 14,800 acres of real property near Alzada, Montana. The twins\u2019 interests in the partnership were uneven. When this litigation began, Walker held a 1.00% general partner interest and a 52.25% limited partner interest, for a total holding of 53.25%. Ballou\u2019s interests were a 0.50% general partner interest and a 46.20% limited partner interest,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a total holding of 46.70%. They acquired their partnership interests from inheritance, capital contributions, intervivos gifts from their mother, and litigation against their brothers. When she died, the twins\u2019 mother, Eunice Walker, held her shares of the partnership in trust. Her will directed that the trust shares be distributed equally between her five children. After Eunice Walker died and her shares were distributed according to her testamentary wishes, Ballou and Walker wanted the partnership to continue holding the land and operating the ranch. The other siblings wanted to liquidate their holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u00b64 Following litigation, the siblings entered into an agreement whereby Ballou and Walker would buy out the remaining siblings\u2019 interests by securing a loan from Pinnacle Bank (Pinnacle) for $737,986.06. Pinnacle approved the loan with a promissory note payable over 25 years, and with Ballou and Walker named individually as the borrowers, since they were receiving the partnership interests purchased. Pinnacle secured the note through a mortgage on lands L 0 owned in Carter County, Montana and through a continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>commercial guaranty that listed Ballou and Walker individually as borrowers, and L 0 as the guarantor. The guaranty gave Pinnacle the right of setoff against any accounts the Partnership maintained at Pinnacle. Accordingly, L 0 established a Pinnacle account for partnership operations. Ballou and Walker each had full access to this account, including account statements, online access, deposits, and withdrawals. The note was to be paid in 49 equal semi-annual installments of $24,738.60 and a slightly higher final payment. Ballou and Walker agreed that each was to pay one-half of the note\u2019s semiannual installment, resulting in a semi-annual payment per person of $12,369.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b65 The timing of the note intentionally coincided with payments L 0 was to receive under a lease agreement L 0 had recently negotiated with Ballou\u2019s alter-ego sheep-ranching business, Ballou Angus. Walker anticipated that income from the lease and from L O\u2019s other operations would provide him and Ballou both with sufficient partnership distributions to pay the note. L 0 deposited the annual Ballou Angus lease payment on February 27, 2013, for $42,988.50. Walker wrote a check to himself for $22,891.38 on July 3, 2013, from the L O account at Pinnacle, to pay, among other things, his part of the semi-annual installment due on the Pinnacle promissory note. Based on his L O 53.25% partnership interest, Walker considered this amount to be his rightful distributive draw since the draw reflected exactly 53.25% of Ballou Angus\u2019s total lease payment in February.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b66 The partnership agreement (Agreement) that created L O governed partner draws. The Agreement distinguished between general partners and limited partners, giving general partners management powers and responsibilities that limited partners did not have. The Agreement noted in its Definitions section that references to a \u201cPartner,\u201d were meant to encompass both limited and general partners. Section 9.8 of the Agreement governed \u201cPartner Draws,\u201d and provided that \u201c[a] Partner, with the consent of the General Partners, may take a draw upon the Partner\u2019s share of anticipated distributions from the Partnership. Such draws may be taken after a determination of distributions for Partners ... if the General Partners agree.\u201d Section 9.5 governed distributions and established that \u201cGeneral Partners may ... distribute to the Partners Partnership Net Profits and net proceeds ... as the General Partners, in the exercise of their reasonable judgment find appropriate. ... [A]ll distributions ... shall be made in proportion to their respective Percentage interest.\u201d Ballou did not agree to Walker\u2019s $22,891.38 draw and no evidence in the record shows Walker ever informed Ballou he was withdrawing these funds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Although Walker\u2019s withdrawal accorded with his percentage interest, Walker did not withdraw and distribute a payment to Ballou proportional to her partnership interest percentage. Neither did he offer to do so. Although Walker held a majority interest in the partnership and the District Court determined that he acted completely in good faith, never attempting to hide or misrepresent this payment, the court found in two separate Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that his self-payment without notice to Ballou constituted self-dealing, and should be considered a \u201cWithdrawal Event\u201d under the Agreement. Walker did not dispute the finding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b67 Ballou discovered Walker\u2019s payment in November of 2013, when she reviewed the partnership account with L O\u2019s banker at Pinnacle. Up to that point, she and Walker had continued operating L 0 by engaging in various enterprises suitable to its holdings: ranching, haying, pasture leasing, and the like. She did not ask Walker about his payment when she discovered it, but instead continued operating L 0 with him through July of 2014. The twins\u2019 relationship as partners deteriorated steadily. Their internecine quarreling caused the District Court to find their actions were the product of an \u201cinability of the two general partners ... to communicate with each other on issues, openly discuss resolution of the issues, and arrive at a mutually agreeable result .... [Their actions] were the product of distrust, unilateral actions, non-communication, and jockeyingfor advantageous positions, and indicative of a dysfunctional partnership relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u00b68 Ballou, acting as both a limited and general partner, commenced proceedings to remove her brother on July 10,2014, by written consent in lieu of a formal partnership meeting. She meant to remove Walker as general partner under section 12.8 of the Agreement. That section allowed for the removal of a general partner for \u201cimproper self-dealing with the Partnership assets!.]\u201d Section 12.8 instructed that removed general partners would have no further responsibility for the management of the partnership. She then approved a transfer of a 0.5% limited partnership interest to her son, Doran Priewe, which the District Court upheld as a valid stratagem under the Agreement. That same day, she acted again by written consent, this time to expel her brother from the partnership as a limited partner and pay him $1.00 for his 53.25% interest. The District Court, in its first Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, concluded that Ballou\u2019s efforts to divest her brother of his limited partnership interest and pay him only a dollar for it had failed, but that she had successfully removed him as a general partner and converted his general partnership interest into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>limited one. The court reasoned in part that Ballou had not strictly complied with Section 12.8 of the Agreement, which stated that \u201cUnless all the other Partners also vote to expel the General Partner from the Partnership [after removal], <em>the removed General Partner shall automatically become a Limited Partner of the </em>Partnership.\u201d (Emphasis added). The court concluded that Ballou\u2019s omission of such a vote to expel Walker did not comply with Section 12.8\u2019s requirements for a general partner\u2019s expulsion. Instead, her Consent to Action, the document drafted to formalize Walker\u2019s expulsion, purported to expel him under Section 15.3 of the Agreement. Section 15.3, the court found, required Ballou to meet a burden of proof that Walker had violated the Agreement. The court concluded that since Walker was now only a limited partner, and since the Agreement did not impose duties or responsibilities on limited partners, he no longer had a fiduciary duty or obligation to the partnership or to any other partner under the Agreement. Absent a violation of fiduciary duty under the Agreement, grounds did not exist for Ballou to expel Walker as a limited partner and her Consent to Action under Section 15.3 had no effect. The court further found that Ballou\u2019s tender of $1.00 for Walker\u2019s interest, and the Agreement\u2019s provision upon which it was based, was an unconscionable and void attempt to fix liquidated damages, in violation of\u00a7 28-2-721, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s final findings again noted the acrimony between Walker and Ballou, particularly that their relationship had deteriorated beyond repair since the two of them had assumed ownership of L 0 in 2013. Walker and Ballou\u2019s acrid relationship had degenerated into \u201cmoves and countermoves, claims and counterclaims, distrust, non-communication, and each party attempting to operate the partnership to best meet their own personal interest.\u201d The court also found that Ballou, in her capacity as sole general partner, was now in \u201ca position to dominate the Partnership to the detriment of [Walker],\u201d even though he retained a majority interest in the partnership. As an example, the District Court observed that Ballou had withheld previously planned distributions despite having funds available to make them, causing Walker to default on his Pinnacle loan payments. Accordingly, the court found L 0 should be dissolved and ordered its dissolution in its Order, Judgment and Decree, as it was no longer reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership\u2019s activities in conformity with the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u00b610 Following the District Court\u2019s Order, Judgment and Decree, Ballou filed two relevant motions on behalf of L 0. The first was a Rule 54 Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs. The other was a Rule 52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Motion for Amended or Additional Findings. She filed both of these motions after the resignation of Judge Huss, who had presided over the prior stages of this matter and written both sets of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and the court\u2019s Order, Judgment and Decree mandating dissolution of the partnership. The motions thus came before Judge Hayworth, who replaced Judge Huss. Judge Hayworth granted Ballou\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees and denied the motion to amend. Each motion will be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed on appeal for correctness. A district court\u2019s interpretation of a contract is a question of law that we also review for correctness. We review the factual findings of a trial court sitting without a jury to determine if the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Total Indus. Plant Servs. v. Turner Indus. Grp., Ltd. Liab. Co., </em>2013 MT 5, \u00b6 22, 368 Mont. 189, 294 P.3d 363. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Pankratz Farms, Inc. v. Pankratz, </em>2004 MT 180, \u00b6 44, 322 Mont. 133, 95 P.3d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b612 We review an order concerning attorneys\u2019 fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Total Indus., </em>\u00b6 22. But whether a district court has jurisdiction to rule on a matter is a question of law that we review to determine whether the district court had authority to act. A court exceeds jurisdiction through acts in excess of the defined power of a court, whether that power be defined by constitutional provisions, express statutes, or rules developed by the courts. <em>Green v. Gerber, </em>2013 MT 35, \u00b6 12, 369 Mont. 20, 303 P.3d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b613 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred by concluding Walker was not subject to the buy-out provisions of the partnership agreement and dissolution was necessary.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b614 Ballou argues that Judge Hayworth\u2019s analysis in his Order Denying Partnership\u2019s Rule 52(b) Motion for Amended or Additional Findings (Denial of Amended Findings) is flawed and merits our review. In its Denial of Amended Findings, the District Court addressed possible shortcomings in Judge Huss\u2019s order because it \u201cdid not explicitly set forth the analysis after concluding that Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>became a limited partner whom Ballou failed to expel.\u201d The court reasoned that Judge Huss\u2019s findings need not be amended because Section 16 of the partnership Agreement did not come into play unless and until a <em>withdrawing </em>Partner [Walker] requests a buyout under Section 16 by giving written notice of a Withdrawal Event. Under this reasoning, the withdrawing partner has the option to trigger a buyout of his own interest. Thus, even though Walker was found to have participated in a Withdrawal Event under Section 15.2, Ballou could not forcibly buy him out because he had never provided L 0 with written notice that he wanted his interest purchased. In the court\u2019s analysis, Walker\u2019s interest following the withdrawal event and his subsequent removal as general partner was therefore that of a limited partner who could be bought out, but only when he so chose and so indicated by written notice. The court made no further findings on the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b615 An existing partnership agreement controls the rights and duties of partners in a partnership. <em>In re Estate of Bolinger, </em>1998 MT 303, \u00b6 50, 292 Mont. 97, 971 P.2d 767; <em>see also </em>\u00a7 35-10-106, MCA. \u201cA partnership agreement is essentially a contract between the partners ... to be interpreted and applied in accordance with principles of contract law.\u201d <em>Bolinger, </em>\u00b6 54. A contract must be interpreted in such a way that it is lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and practicably effectual without contravening the intention of the parties. Section 28-3-201, MCA. The language of a contract governs its interpretation when the language is clear, explicit, and without absurdity. <em>Whary v. Plum Creek Timberlands, L.P., </em>2014 MT 71, \u00b6 10, 374 Mont. 266, 320 P.3d 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b616 The District Court incorrectly interpreted the Agreement\u2019s language in Section 15.2 governing Withdrawal Events, which led to an unreasonable result, an untenable positioning of the parties, and the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the partnership must be dissolved. The relevant portion of Section 15.2 is critical to our analysis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">A \u201cWithdrawal Event\u201d occurs when a General Partner is removed as a General Partner .... If a Withdrawal Event occurs with respect to a Partner, the withdrawing Partner ceases to be a Partner of the Partnership and will be treated as an Assignee under this Agreement until the withdrawing Partner\u2019s Partnership Interest is valued and purchased as provided in Section 16 of this Agreement or the withdrawing partner is readmitted as a full Partner with the written consent of all the General Partners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The District Court stated that \u201cthe finding of a Withdrawal Event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>under Section 15.2 does not inevitably lead to a conclusion of law (interpretation of the Partnership Agreement) that Ballou has the option to buy Walker out under Section 16.\u201d We disagree. Section 15.1 provides that \u201c[i]f a Withdrawal Event occurs with respect to a General Partner, its General Partnership Interest shall be converted to a Limited Partnership Interest.\u201d We agree with the court\u2019s analysis that removal of a General Partner is thus a Withdrawal Event that converts the General Partner to a Limited Partner. The District Court found, and it is not disputed on appeal, that Walker engaged in self-dealing, which ultimately led to his removal as a general partner. We disagree, however, with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that 15.2 does not support a mandatory buyout of that partner\u2019s interest. The relevant portion of Section 15.2 states that, \u201c[i[f a Withdrawal Event occurs with respect to a Partner, the withdrawing partner <em>ceases to be a Partner of the Partnership </em>and will be treated as an Assignee under this Agreement until the withdrawing Partner\u2019s Partnership Interest is valued and purchased as provided in Section 16 of this Agreement!.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Section 15.2 does not distinguish between Limited Partners and General Partners; it applies to all partners and thus focuses on the cessation of the individual\u2019s involvement in the enterprise, not simply removing their role in management. We conclude that this language demonstrates that removal of the individual from partnership is compulsory.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b617 The District Court concluded that this clause is given effect by looking to Section 16 to determine the withdrawing partner\u2019s status, observing that determining whether a removed General Partner is treated as a Limited Partner or as an Assignee requires a close reading of Section 16, which \u201cdoesn\u2019t come into play unless and until a withdrawing Partner requests a buy-out under Section 16 by giving written notice!.]\u201d But an analysis of the language in Section 15.2 reveals that is not an accurate interpretation. The clause operates independently of Section 16 and specifies that a withdrawing partner ceases to be a \u201cPartner of the Partnership,\u201d and that his interest is then to be valued and sold in accordance with Section 16. He is additionally to be treated as an assignee while the interest is valued. Section 15.2 thus contemplates Section 16 as the mechanism for determining the value of the withdrawing Partner\u2019s interest, not for determining whether he may be bought out at all. Section 15.2\u2019s designation of Section 16 as the means of determining value is conclusive\u2014there would be no need to set a valuation mechanism if the withdrawing partner\u2019s buyout were not anticipated as part of the withdrawal process and mandatory as applied to the withdrawing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>partner\u2014and optional only as applied to the partnership. This reasoning comports with the language of Section 16.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">If a Withdrawal Event occurs with respect to a Partner, the Partnership shall have the right to liquidate the withdrawing Partner\u2019s Partnership Interest or the remaining Partners shall have the right to purchase such Partnership Interest. This Section 16 provides the Partner\u2019s agreed terms for such liquidation or purchase. If this right to purchase is exercised, <em>the withdrawing Partner </em>or such Partner\u2019s estate ... <em>must liquidate or sell the withdrawing Partner\u2019s Partnership Interest to the Partnership or remaining </em>Partners. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b618 The clear language of the clause requires the withdrawing partner to sell or liquidate his interest to the partnership or partners. The District Court\u2019s determination that Section 16 does not apply \u201cunless and until a withdrawing Partner requests a buy-out under Section 16 by giving written notice upon a Withdrawal Event\u201d is therefore premised on a misinterpretation of the agreement. Walker is not entitled to withhold written notice of the Withdrawal Event to maintain his interest as a limited partner, as the District Court concluded. Rather, he must tender his interest for valuation and subsequent purchase in compliance with Sections 15.2 and 16.1, using Section 16 for valuation of the interest. To that end, we agree with the District Court that Walker was not expelled and so is not subject to the $1.00 buyout provision of Section 16.7. His interest is instead subject to the terms of Sections 16.1 and 16.6, which together require, among other things, that his interest is to be valued at fair market value at the time the Withdrawal Event occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AJE\">\u00b619  Having found that Walker\u2019s interest is subject to the Agreement\u2019s buyout provisions, we conclude that judicial dissolution of the partnership is not necessary. The District Court\u2019s order requiring dissolution envisioned a future for the partnership, if it remained intact, in which Walker would have remained a majority limited partner with standing to further litigate his grievances with Ballou and as such, an impediment to the partnership\u2019s operations and management. The District Court foresaw culpability for Ballou too, observing that she had now, as the sole general partner, the unchecked ability to aggrieve Walker by withholding distributions, especially those originally contemplated for use as payments on the Pinnacle promissory note. Walker\u2019s buyout would remove not only his standing to litigate a potential breach of duty by Ballou, but would also curtail any further acrimony between the siblings over how the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>should be run\u2014Walker would no longer have any interest in the partnership. With one of the partners removed and the accompanying acrimony between the partners gone, operating the partnership in conformity with the partnership agreement becomes practicable, which obviates the need for judicial dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b620 <em>2. Whether the District Court was divested of its authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees more than 60 days after the motion for fees was filed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AlA\">\u00b621 Although Judge Hayworth issued an order on March 8, 2016, to stay the timeline for ruling on the motion, the District Court did not rule on L O\u2019s motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs until more than 60 days had passed from the day the motion was entered. Walker argues on appeal that the passage of 60 days without a ruling following the entry of a motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees filed subsequent to a judgment deprives a district court of the jurisdiction necessary to rule on the motion. Walker asks that we void the District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees entered on May 16, 2016, since the passage of more than 60 days deprived the court of jurisdiction to issue the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u00b622 A judgment is effectively entered when the clerk of court files it. <em>Chase v. Bearpaw Ranch Ass\u2019n., </em>2006 MT 67, \u00b6 19, 331 Mont. 421, 133 P.3d 190. This Court treats a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees that is filed after a judgment is entered as a motion to alter or amend the judgment. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 <em>18; Associated Press v.

A court must not extend the time to act under Rule 59(e). M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2). \u201cRule 59, M. R. Civ. P. contains a mandatory jurisdictional time limitation, to which this Court strictly adheres.\u201d <em>Associated Press, </em>\u00b6 37. A district court need not hold all required hearings within 60 days of the motion, and need not specify how the judgment will be amended within sixty days of the motion, but it must rule, within sixty days, on whether it will amend the judgment. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 20. When Rule 59 applies, this Court considers whether the district court was divested of its authority to award attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Chase, </em>\u00b6 20. When the District Court fails to rule on a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees within the time limitations of Rule 59, it has no jurisdiction to enter a later award on the matter. <em>Associated Press, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\u00b623  Ballou filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(d) on January 14, 2016, after the judgment was entered and filed on December 30, 2015. Since the motion was entered subsequent to judgment, her motion is treated on review as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment. Although the District Court entered an order staying the timeline for ruling on the motion, M. R. Civ. P. 6(b)(2) prohibits the court from extending the time to act on a Rule 59(e) motion. The court\u2019s order staying the timeline did not include a ruling on whether it would amend the judgment. Without a ruling the parameters of Rule 59 thus apply to the motion; more than 60 days had passed without a ruling and the motion was deemed denied. Operating beyond the parameters and time limitations of Rule 59, the District Court did not possess the requisite jurisdiction and was therefore divested of its authority to enter the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b624 The judgment of the District Court determining Walker\u2019s partnership interest in L 0 could not be liquidated and bought out until he provided written notice to the partnership is reversed. The matter is remanded to the District Court for a hearing on the value of Walker\u2019s complete interest, subject to the parameters of the Partnership Agreement and consistent with this Opinion. The District Court\u2019s order mandating dissolution of L 0 and the winding up of its affairs is reversed. The partnership is permitted to continue operations subject to its compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the terms of its Partnership Agreement. The District Court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees is reversed. The remainder of the District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b318-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, SHEA and SANDEFUR concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> Lawyers though we are, our math is correct. The percentages do not equal 100, but the missing interest was lost in the course of succession and litigation, not our error. The District Court, in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, noted that, \u201c[s]omewhere, a .5% general partner interest has disappeared.\u201d Careful readers will of course realize that the District Court correctly noted the discrepancy, but erred in its mathematical expression of the amount. The missing interest is in fact 0.05%\u2014five hundredths of a percent, not five tenths of a percent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\"> Effective July 1, 2017, Rule 59(f) has been amended to allow the court to extend the time to rule to 120 days from the motion\u2019s filing date.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
