Skinner (Skinner) appeals and the City of Helena (Helena or City) cross-appeals from the order of the Montana Water Court, Upper Missouri Division, partially reversing and partially adoptingthe Water Master\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal and cross-appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-13\"><em>Issue One: Is \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, as applied to the City\u2019s water rights claim, impermissibly </em>retroactive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-14\"><em>Issue Two: Did the Water Court err in reinstating 7.35 cfs of Helena\u2019s Tenmile Creek water </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-15\"><em>A.

Upon reaching U.S. Highway 12, the stream turns east towards Helena and flows northeast, just beyond the City\u2019s northwest boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b64 In the mid-1800\u2019s, miners appropriated water from the stream for use in their mining operations. By 1886, the mines had become depleted and some of the miners sold their water rights to the Helena Water Works Company (Company). In 1903, a decree entitled <em>Whitcomb v. Helena Water Works </em>(Decree)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> declared the Company to be the owner of the first two rights on the stream. The first right had a priority date of November 5, 1864, and entitled the Company to an appropriation of225 miner\u2019s inches (MI) (claim number 41189074-00). The second right had a priority date of February 10, 1865, and entitled the Company to an appropriation of325 MI (claim number 411890745-GO). Taken together, the two rights to the stream total 550 MI, or 13.75 cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b65 At the time of the Decree, the Company used two points of diversion for the stream. The first point diverted 225 MI through an open ditch, running near Rimini, into a water treatment facility, and then into Helena through two sixteen-inch pipelines. The precise date of the pipeline\u2019s construction is unknown, but is thought to be around 1903. The second point diverted 325 MI four miles downstream from the treatment facility through an open channel known as the \u201cYaw Yaw\u201d ditch. The City acquired the Company\u2019s facility and water rights in 1911. In 1919, the City ceased using the Yaw Yaw ditch for municipal purposes, but continued to lease the water for agricultural use and maintain the facilities for emergency purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b66 In 1921, the City replaced the open ditch running near Rimini <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>with an eighteen-inch concrete diversion pipeline known as the \u201cRimini Pipeline,\u201d and added five new points of diversion along Tenmile Creek. After the City ceased using the Yaw Yaw ditch for municipal purposes, all of the creek\u2019s diversions flowed through the Rimini Pipeline. The pipeline has a capacity of 13.15 cfs, 0.60 cfs less than the combined total of Helena\u2019s two Tenmile Creek water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b67 The City continued to rely on the two sixteen-inch pipelines to deliver water from the treatment facility to Helena. By 1929, the City had identified the two sixteen-inch pipelines as the limiting factor in the Tenmile system; specifically, an engineering report from that year found that leakage, waste, and other factors restricted the capacity of the pipelines to 5.50 cfs. The report recommended construction of a new transmission pipeline. In 1948, the City installed a new twenty-four-inch pipeline. The pipeline enabled the City to transmit 13.15 cfs from the Rimini Pipeline, but has a capacity of 13.75 cfs.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b68 Skinner owns junior water rights on Tenmile Creek. Both Skinner and the Community of Rimini objected to Helena\u2019s Tenmile Creek water right claims and the subsequent procedural background concerning the Water Court\u2019s adjudication of the City\u2019s claims spans two decades. In a report filed July 28,2011, and a supplemental report filed January 13, 2012, Water Master Hugh B. McFadden, Jr. (the Master) found that the City abandoned 7.35 cfs of its water rights to Tenmile Creek and imposed specific place of use restrictions on the City\u2019s water rights. On November 8,2013, Water Judge Ted L. Mizner held that the Master erred in failing to apply Montana\u2019s presumption of municipal nonabandonment statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and restored the full decreed right of 13.75 cfs to the City. Judge Mizner also adopted the Master\u2019s place of use finding. Skinner appealed to the Montana Supreme Court and, on February 24, 2015, this Court remanded the case for further proceedings due to procedural errors and ambiguities in the Water Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b69 On remand, Water Judge Loren Tucker adopted the Master\u2019s finding that the City had abandoned 7.35 cfs of its water rights claims under the common law. However, the Water Court then ordered the parties to brief whether the City may avoid abandonment under \u00a7 85-2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>227(4), MCA, including whether the statute is constitutional.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 29, 2016, the court found that: 1) under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, the \u201cevidence established a presumption that the City did not intend to abandon 7.35 cfs,\u201d which Skinner failed to rebut; and 2) the City abandoned 0.60 cfs in the Rimini Pipeline, the difference between the 13.15 cfs capacity of the pipeline and 13.75 cfs, the capacity decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"A8x\">\u00b610 Skinner now appeals, and the City cross-appeals, the Water Court\u2019s order. Additional facts will be provided as necessary to dispose of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b611 In a case involving both a water master and the water court, two standards of review are applicable: the standard the water judge applies to the master\u2019s report and the standard we apply to the water court\u2019s opinion. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc. v. Pondera Cnty. Canal &amp; Reservoir Co., </em>2014 MT 167, \u00b6 25, 375 Mont. 327, 328 P.3d 644. The water court reviews the master\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the master\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 25. Applying these standards of review, the water judge may adopt, modify, or reject the master\u2019s report, in whole or in part, or may receive further evidence or recommit it with instructions. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b612 We review the water court\u2019s order de novo, to determine whether it correctly applied the clear error standard of review to the master\u2019s findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were correct. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 26. Whether the standard of review was applied correctly is a question of law. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 26. We review the water court\u2019s findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b613 Clear error can be found by one of three ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">A factual finding may be clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence. Even if supported by substantial evidence, the finding may be clearly erroneous if the trier of fact misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Even if supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>substantial evidence and the effect of the evidence is not misapprehended, a finding may be clearly erroneous if, in light of the evidence as a whole, the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><em>In re Eldorado Coop Canal Co., </em>2016 MT 94, \u00b6 17, 383 Mont. 205, 369 P.3d 1034 <em>(citing Marks v. 71 Ranch, LP, </em>2014 MT 250, \u00b6 12, 376 Mont. 340, 334 P.3d 373). Substantial evidence is evidence that a \u201creasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if the evidence is weak or conflicting.\u201d <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 27. To find substantial evidence there must be more than a scintilla of evidence but a preponderance of the evidence is not required. This standard is deferential, and not synonymous with the clear error standard. A reviewing court may still find a factual finding is clearly erroneous even though there is evidence to support it. <em>Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b614 <em>Issue One: Is \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, as applied to the City\u2019s water rights claim, impermissibly </em>retroactive?</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b615 The City of Helena first argues that Skinner\u2019s appeal should be dismissed because he failed to comply with M. R. Civ. P. 5.1 and M. R. App. P. 27,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> requiring that he notify the Attorney General of his constitutional challenge of \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA. Skinner contends that he is not challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, and, as such, the procedural notice requirements do not apply in this case. Specifically, Skinner argues that since \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, does not contain a retroactivity clause as required by \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, it cannot be retroactively applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b616 In 2005, the Montana Legislature amended \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, to create a presumption of nonabandonment for all water rights claimed for municipal use. As amended, \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">(4) In a determination of abandonment made under subsection (3), the legislature finds that a water right that is claimed for municipal use by a city, town, or other public or private entity that operates a public water supply system, as defined in 75-6-102, is presumed to not be abandoned if the city, town, or other private or public entity has used any part of the water right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>municipal water supply and there is admissible evidence that the city, town, or other public or private entity also has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">(a) obtained a filtration waiver under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300(f), et seq.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">(b) acquired, constructed, or regularly maintained diversion or conveyance structures for the future municipal use of the water right;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">(c) conducted a formal study, prepared by a registered professional engineer or qualified consulting firm, that includes a specific assessment that using the water right for municipal supply is feasible and that the amount of the water right is reasonable for foreseeable future needs; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">(d) maintained facilities connected to the municipal water supply system to apply the water right to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">(i) an emergency municipal water supply;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">(ii) a supplemental municipal water supply; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">(iii) any other use approved by the department under Title 85, chapter 2, part 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Section 85-2-227(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">\u00b617 Assuming, arguendo, that Skinner is not making a constitutional argument in this case, we nevertheless conclude that the Water Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, to Skinner did not create a retroactive application of the law under \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, because the effect of the 2005 amendments are procedural, not substantive, and thus fall outside the contemplation of \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA. Section 1-2-109, MCA, provides that \u201cNo law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\u201d However, a statute is not retroactive within the meaning of \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, \u201cmerely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.\u201d <em>Mordja v. Mont. Eleventh Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2008 MT 24, \u00b6 18, 341 Mont. 219, 177 P.3d 439 (quoting State <em>v. Coleman, </em>185 Mont. 299, 317, 605 P.2d 1000, 1012 (1979)). Rather, we have repeatedly held that \u201cI a llthough the general rule of law is that a statute is not to be applied retroactively, an exception to that rule is a change in a law that is merely procedural rather than substantive.\u201d <em>Saint Vincent Hosp. &amp; Health Ctr. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>261 Mont. 56, 61, 862 P.2d 6, 9 (1993); see <em>Mordja, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">\u00b618 Here, the Water Court found that since the amendments to \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, merely changed the burden of proof as to the municipal abandonment inquiry, it created a procedural change which did not affect the vested rights of Skinner. We agree. In <em>In re Application for Change of Appropriation Water Rights Nos. 101960-41S &amp; 101967-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>41S, </em>249 Mont. 425, 816 P.2d 1054 (1991) (hereinafter Royston), senior water rights holders, the Roystons, applied for a change in the place of use of water rights and a change of use from flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 426, 816 P.2d at 1056. Three junior water rights holders filed objections. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 427, 816 P.2d at 1056. The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) denied the Roystons\u2019 application after conducting a contested case hearing wherein both the Roystons and the objectors introduced evidence on the effects of the proposed change of use. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 427, 816 P.2d at 1056. The district court affirmed the DNRC\u2019s denial, finding that under a 1985 amendment to \u00a7 85-2-402, MCA, the applicant for a change of appropriation right has the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of adverse impact. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 427, 816 P.2d at 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b619 The Roystons appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s application of the amended statute to them as an impermissible retroactive application of a statute. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 429, 816 P.2d at 1057. In upholding the district court, we held that because the 1985 amendment to \u00a7 85-2-402, MCA, \u201cmerely modifie[d] the procedure for exercising a vested right\u201d and because \u201c[a] water right recognized by the 1972 Constitution does not include the right to not have to carry a burden of proof,\u201d the statute was not impermissibly retroactive. <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 429, 816 P.2d at 1057-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b620 We conclude that <em>Royston </em>is directly on point to the case at bar. As in <em>Royston, </em>the 2005 amendments to \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, merely change the assignment of the burden of proof; thus, it is a procedural change rather than a substantive one. Specifically, if the City can establish that is has used \u201cany part\u201d of the water right and also satisfies one of the four additional requirements under \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(a)-(d), MCA, the City is presumed not to have abandoned its water right. This creates a disputable presumption that Skinner may rebut. As such, because the statute only modifies the way in which abandonment is proved and does not directly affect a vested right, we conclude that it is a procedural modification that does not constitute a retroactive application of the law. The Water Court correctly determined that the Master\u2019s conclusion as to the retroactive application of \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, was clearly erroneous. We now consider whether the Water Court correctly applied the statute to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b621 <em>Issue Two: Did the Water Court err in reinstating 7.35 cfs of Helena\u2019s Tenmile Creek water </em>rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b622 Skinner also appeals the Water Court\u2019s finding that the City did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>not intend to abandon 7.35 cfs under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA. The City contends that the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous because Skinner produced no direct evidence showing the City intended to abandon any portion of its Tenmile Creek water rights. Given our disposition of the first issue above and, consequently, the Master\u2019s failure to analyze whether the City met the statutory criteria for the presumption of municipal nonabandonment, we now need to determine if: 1) the Water Court\u2019s findings as to the application of \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b)-(d), MCA, to this case are clearly erroneous; and 2) whether the Water Court correctly rejected the Master\u2019s findings as to whether Skinner successfully established an intent to abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\"><em>A. Did the Water Court err in finding that \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, should be applied to create a presumption of nonabandonment for the City </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"AcR\">\u00b623 \u201cAbandonment of a water right requires both non-use and intent to <em>abandon.\u201d Skelton Ranch, </em>\u00b6 52 (citing <em>79 Ranch v. Pitsch, </em>204 Mont. 426, 432, 666 P.2d 215, 218 (1983)). However, under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, a municipal water user is entitled to create a presumption of nonabandonment if \u201ca city, town, or other public or private entity that operates a public water supply system\u201d shows that it has: 1) \u201cused any part of the water right\u201d; and 2) met the requirements of one of the four criteria set forth in subsection 4(a) through 4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b624 The Water Court found, and the parties do not dispute, that the City has continuously and partially used each water right since the date of the Decree. The Water Court then found that the City satisfied the criteria of \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b)-(d), MCA, and that the Master erred in finding that Skinner had rebutted the presumption of nonabandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b625 The Water Court first determined that the City met the requirements under subsection (4)(b) of \u00a7 85-2-227, MCA, because the court found that the City\u2019s construction of the diversion pipeline in 1921 evidenced an intention to plan for future growth. A municipal water user can establish a presumption of nonabandonment if there is admissible evidence that a city has \u201cacquired, constructed, or regularly maintained diversion <em>or </em>conveyance structures for the future municipal use of the water right.\u201d Section 85-2-227(4)(b), MCA (emphasis added). The Water Court considered the fact that the larger capacity diversion pipeline fed into two, smaller capacity transmission lines, thus restricting the City\u2019s beneficial use to 5.50 cfs. The court found the construction of the diversion pipeline sufficient to meet the statute and determined that it was unnecessary for a municipal water user to construct both a diversion structure and a conveyance structure for future use given that the statute is written in the disjunctive, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>emphasized above.</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u00b626  We conclude that the Water Court did not err in finding that the construction of the Rimini Pipeline established a presumption of municipal nonabandonment under subsection (4)(b) of \u00a7 85-2-227, MCA. The court found that the City built the 1921 diversion pipeline, knowing that the two 1903 transmission pipelines could only deliver a portion of its capacity for beneficial use. As the Water Court stated, \u201cThe most reasonable inference from this conduct is that the City was planning for future growth; otherwise the City could have saved taxpayer money by constructing a smaller diversion pipeline.\u201d We conclude that the Water Court did not err in finding that the construction of the Rimini Pipeline in 1921 established that the City intended to use the municipal water right in the future, thus creating a presumption of nonabandonment under \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b627 The Water Court also found that the City met the requirements of subsection (4)(c) of \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(c), MCA, because the City commissioned a 1929 engineering report which recommended construction of a new transmission pipeline to allow the City to make full use of its water rights. Under \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(c), MCA, the presumption of municipal nonabandonment may also be established if a city has \u201cconducted a formal study, prepared by a registered professional engineer or qualified consulting firm, that includes a specific assessment that using the water right for municipal supply is feasible and that the amount of the water right is reasonable for foreseeable future needs.\u201d While the Water Court found that the report did not contain specific terms relating to the City\u2019s \u201creasonable for foreseeable future needs,\u201d the court nevertheless found ample evidence in the report to indicate that \u201cthe engineers believed the water right to be reasonable for foreseeable future needs.\u201d Because the report concluded that a new transmission line was needed to make full use of the City\u2019s water rights, to meet both the City\u2019s future growth and its current demand under certain circumstances,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we conclude that the Water Court did not err in finding that the report met the requirements of \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b628  Finally, the Water Court found that the City also met the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>criteria under subsection (4)(d)(i) of \u00a7 85-2-227, MCA, because the court determined that the City maintained the Yaw Yaw ditch for other purposes, including emergency use. A municipal water user qualifies for the presumption of nonabandonment if it \u201cmaintained facilities connected to the municipal water supply system to apply the water right to ... an emergency water supply.\u201d The court relied on a 1925 report on fire defense which indicates that the City reserved use of the Yaw Yaw pumping station for fire defense purposes. The court also cited to the report\u2019s finding that the City maintained a pipe connecting the pumping station to a \u201cflume and open ditch from Ten Mile Creek.\u201d As such, the Water Court found that the City met the criteria of \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(d)(i), MCA, because the evidence demonstrated that the City maintained facilities connected to the water supply to use in emergency situations. We conclude that the Water Court did err in finding a presumption of municipal nonabandonment based on the 1925 fire defense report.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\n<em>B. Did the Water Court correctly reject the Master\u2019s finding that Skinner had rebutted the presumption of nonabandonment?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b629 In his July 28, 2011 report, the Master found that, despite his conclusion that \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, did not apply in this case, Skinner had nonetheless rebutted any presumption of nonabandonment because the evidence established that the City: 1) constructed transmission lines that could not carry all of its water; 2) abandoned the Yaw Yaw ditch; and 3) declared that it had \u201cample water for as long a time as the needs of the city can forecast with any degree of accuracy.\u201d The Water Court determined that the Master\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">\u00b630 \u201cA disputable presumption may be overcome by a preponderance of evidence contrary to the presumption. Unless the presumption is overcome, the trier of fact must find the assumed fact in accordance with the presumption.\u201d M. R. Evid. 301(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">\u00b631 The Water Court first determined that the Master erred in his determination regarding the persuasive effect of the transmission lines capacity because: 1) the City continued to use water from the Yaw Yaw ditch for various purposes, even after the lines were constructed; and 2) as cited above, the 1929 engineering report attributed the pipelines\u2019 limited capacity to friction, leakage, waste, and other losses that the City could not have predicted when it constructed the pipelines in 1903. The Water Court also determined that the Master erred in concluding that the agricultural leases on the ditch and the use of the water for emergency purposes were irrelevant to whether the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>intended to abandon the Yaw Yaw ditch.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lastly, the Water Court concluded that the Master misapprehended the effect of a 1935 report entitled the \u201cCondensed Report of the Helena Water Works System.\u201d While the Master attempted to use the report to support its finding that the City did not require or foresee the need to use more than just a portion of its water rights,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Water Court clarified that \u201c[t]he statement that the City had \u2018ample water\u2019 referred to the sources of supply, not its distribution.\u201d The court went on to discuss the distribution section of the report which describes the two transmission lines as \u201cthe limiting factor in the Ten Mile system\u201d and details conditions under which the current water supply would be insufficient to meet the demand of both domestic and fire use. Based on the court\u2019s comprehensive review of the report, it concluded that the report \u201cdoes not suggest intent to abandon because of undersized delivery system components.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b632  Upon review of the record and based on the Water Court\u2019s reasoning above in its thorough consideration of the evidence presented to rebut the City\u2019s presumption of nonabandonment, we agree with the court that the Master erroneously relied upon, or misapprehended the effect of, the evidence in this case and thus clearly erred in determining that the City abandoned a portion of its water rights. As such, the Water Court correctly applied the clear error standard of review in concluding that Skinner failed to rebut the City\u2019s presumption of nonabandonment by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Anp\">\u00b633 <em>Issue Three: Did the Water Court err in finding that the City had abandoned 0.60 cfs of its Tenmile Creek water </em>rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b634 The Master also determined that the City abandoned 0.60 cfs, the difference between the amount decreed, 13.75 cfs, and the capacity of the Rimini Pipeline, 13.15 cfs. The Water Court determined the Master\u2019s findings to be correct. On cross-appeal, the City now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>challenges these determinations on the ground that the Water Court erred in failing to apply \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, to the entirety of the Tenmile Creek water rights. Skinner contends that the court\u2019s determination was correct because the Master\u2019s report properly recognized that, despite \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, evidence of conveyance capacity and beneficial use limitations necessarily limit the City\u2019s water rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b635 The Water Court found that the Master did not err in finding that the City was not entitled to a presumption of nonabandonment under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, because the City presented no evidence that it ever intended to increase its diversion capacity, either in the Rimini Pipeline or in the form of additional diversions, as required to create the presumption under \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b), MCA. Consequently, the court upheld the Master\u2019s application of the common-law test of abandonment and his finding that the period of nonuse between 1948 and 2011 was sufficient to raise a presumption of intent to abandon. The Water Court erred in its review of the Master\u2019s findings and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b636 By way of background, the 1999 amendments to \u00a7 85-2-227, MCA, as introduced by Senate Bill 235, gave municipalities protection from abandonment similar to the current statute, but limited the provisions therein to A-closed waters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1999 Mont. Laws 689-90. During the discussion of SB 235 in the Committee on Natural Resources, the bill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>sponsor, Senator Jack Wells, stated that the bill \u201crecognizes certain activities by municipal organizations that would suffice to guarantee their water rights in future years\u201d and that \u201cthe major concern is long term protection.\u201d S. Comm. on Natural Res., <em>Hearing on SB 235, </em>56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. Jan. 25, 1999). Additionally, one of the bill\u2019s proponents, Representative Cindy Younkin, further explained that \u201cSB 235 will ... partially codify what is known as the <em>great and growing cities doctrine </em>which has been espoused by the Supreme Court of other states. It originally came out of Colorado\u2019s Supreme Court. ...\u201d S. Comm. on Natural Res., <em>Hearing on SB 235, </em>56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Mont. Jan. 25, 1999) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b637 In 2005, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 20, \u201cremoving the requirement that a municipality diverts its water from an A-Closed water body in order to qualify for the consideration for nonabandonment of a municipal water right. ...\u201d 2005 Mont. Laws 33-34. Thus, the 2005 amendments expanded the growing communities doctrine to class A-l drainages such as Montana\u2019s Tenmile. We note that the purpose of the doctrine, as it was developed in Colorado, was to \u201cassure an adequate [water] supply to the public which it serves\u201d and, according to that state\u2019s highest court, \u201cit is not speculation but the highest prudence on the part of the city to obtain appropriations of water that will satisfy the needs resulting from a normal increase in population within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>Denver v. Sheriff, </em>96 P.2d 836, 841 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b638 Section 85-2-227(4), MCA, comports with the purpose of the growing communities doctrine by creating a presumption of nonabandonment when a city is planning for its future water needs and requires flexibility in such planning efforts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, if a city takes the affirmative steps prescribed by the statute, such efforts are protected and apply to the entirety of a municipality\u2019s water right, despite a period of non-use. Indeed, as the Water Judge stated in his order, \u201cthe whole purpose of [\u00a7] 85-2-227(4), MCA, is to presume nonabandonment in precisely those circumstances when intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>abandon would otherwise be presumed (e.g. based on a long period of nonuse).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKH\">\u00b639  In this case, the Water Court erred in failing to recognize that both the City\u2019s construction of the diversionary structure in 1921 <em>and </em>its construction of the twenty-four-inch conveyance structure in 1948 created a presumption of nonabandonment under \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b), MCA. As the Water Court stated earlier in its order, \u201cNothing in the statute requires the City to construct both diversion structures and conveyance structures.\u201d Accordingly, just as the court found the City\u2019s construction of the 1921 Rimini Pipeline sufficient to create a presumption of nonabandonment under subsection (4)(b), even though it was unable to carry the 13.75 cfs decreed, the City\u2019s construction of the twenty-four-inch conveyance structure is likewise sufficient to create the same presumption, especially given that it was built to transmit the entire 13.75 cfs decreed. Indeed, in constructing a conveyance structure large enough to transmit the entire 13.75 cfs, it can be inferred that the City sought to make use of the entirety of its water right, in contemplation of the City\u2019s future growth. As discussed above, Montana\u2019s codification of the growing communities doctrine seeks to ensure that municipalities may appropriate water for future needs and we find that the City was planning for its anticipated requirements. As such, we conclude that the Water Court erred in upholding the Master\u2019s determination and further conclude that the City met the criteria for the presumption of nonabandonment as it applies to the whole system stemming from Helena\u2019s water right on Tenmile Creek.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u00b640 <em>Issue Four: Did the Water Court err in imposing specific place of use restrictions on Helena\u2019s decreed Tenmile Creek water </em>rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b641 The City also contends on cross-appeal that the Water Court erred in affirming the Master\u2019s conclusion placing geographical limitations on the City\u2019s rights which, as decreed in 1903, have a place of use element that is constitutionally protected. The Master dismissed the constitutional challenge because the City failed to comply with M. R. Civ. P. 5.1(a), requiring that a party challenging the constitutionality of a state statute promptly notify the Attorney General of his constitutional challenge.

P. 5.1(a), a party challenging the constitutionality of a statute is required to give notice to the Attorney General of the existence of the constitutional issue. The failure to file a timely notice of a constitutional challenge results in a party failing to \u201cprocedurally comply with an essential condition precedent, thus precluding this Court from reaching the constitutional challenge.\u201d <em>Russell v. Masonic Home of Mont., Inc., </em>2006 MT 286, \u00b6 20, 334 Mont. 351, 147 P.3d 216 (quoting <em>Boettcher v. Mont. Guar.

However, the City\u2019s reply brief states that it \u201cbrings an \u2018as applied\u2019 challenge based on the state\u2019s requirements for a specific place of use for the City\u2019s unique decreed rights.\u201d In turn, Montana\u2019s \u201crequirements for a specific place of use\u201d is found in \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(e), MCA, which states that a final water rights decree must include a place of use.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> M. R. Civ. P. 5.1(a) does not distinguish between as-applied and facial constitutional challenges, but rather states that when a party \u201cfiles a pleading, written motion, or other paper challenging the constitutionality of a state statute,\u201d the party \u201cmust promptly file a notice of constitutional question stating the question and identifying the paper that raises it, and serve the notice and paper on the state attorney general. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u00b644 The Master found the following in his July 28, 2011 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">Beginning in 2010, the City contended that specifying a place of use for its claims is in violation of its constitutional rights. If the City\u2019s quarrel is with \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(e) (\u201cthe final decree must state ... the place of use ...\u201d), either as written or as applied, then the City must give notice to the court and to the attorney general as required by [M. R. Civ. P. 5.1(a)]. No such notice has been filed. The court should not speculate as to what constitutional provisions are alleged to have been violated, when and how; nor will the court search the record for facts to support the City\u2019s contention or locate legal authority to make the City\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">\u00b645 While the City contends that its appeal is \u201climited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>argument that its rights as decreed in 1903 have a place of use element that is constitutionally protected,\u201d the City cannot make this argument without also arguing why it is unconstitutional for \u00a7 85-2-234(6)(e), MCA, to apply to their 1903 decreed rights. As such, we cannot say that the Master and the Water Court erred in finding that the City failed to procedurally comply with M. R. Civ.

The Court\u2019s analysis indicates that the changes brought about by the statute are not significant and thus concludes that the statute is not retroactive. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 17-20. However, a proper analysis demonstrates clearly that the statute has changed the law substantively and decisively, far beyond the burden-of-proof issue deemed to be a procedural change in <em>Royston, </em>and has impacted established prior rights in a manner that renders it an impermissible retroactive provision under \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA, and our case law. Any possible doubt about that proposition is resolved by the Court\u2019s declaration that the statute adopts, for the first time in the history of Montana water law, the Growing Communities Doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"AxqB\">\u00b648 The question of whether a statute is retroactive appears initially to be a simple inquiry, but the appearance is deceptive, and can lead to an inadequately analyzed decision. Determining whether a law creates a procedural or substantive impact upon established rights requires an understanding of the nature and operation of those rights, which, under Montana water law, draws into the discussion our precedent addressing constitutional principles governing water rights. About that, a clarifying word is necessary at the start. I agree with the Court that we are not here presented with a constitutional challenge to \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA. Skinner did not give notice of a challenge and insists he has not brought one. Consequently, I do not address or reach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>any conclusions about the constitutionality of the statute. However, reference to constitutional precedent herein is necessary to explain the legal nature of water rights for purposes of determining whether the statute has impacted those rights substantively, and is therefore retroactive in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b649 As decreed in the same litigation that decreed the water rights now held by the City, Skinner holds undivided interests in four water rights totaling 10.02 CFS, dating from March 31, 1865 to April 30, 1870, in Ten Mile Creek downstream from the City\u2019s diversions. <em>Whitcomb v. Helena Water Works </em>, No. 4989, Mont. 1st Jud. Dist. Ct. (Mar. 28, 1903).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Skinner\u2019s water rights, like the City\u2019s, are decreed and vested rights that existed upon ratification of the 1972 Constitution, which provided: \u201cAll existing rights to the use of any waters for any useful or beneficial purpose are hereby recognized and confirmed.\u201d Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(1). This constitutional provision is \u201cself-executing,\u201d <em>Gen. Agric. Corp. v.

I, sec. 17.\u201d <em>In re Powder River Drainage Area, </em>216 Mont. 361, 375-76, 702 P.2d 948, 957 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b650 Importantly, there are \u201ctwo components to the Montana Constitutional guaranty: there must be an <em>existing right </em>to the use of water, and the use must be for a <em>beneficial purpose.\u201d McDonald v. State, </em>220 Mont. 519, 525, 722 P.2d 598, 601 (1986) (emphasis added). As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">Montana has always protected, by law and the decisions of this Court prior to 1972, and by the Montana Constitution since 1972, any beneficial irrigation right within the original appropriation of water. <em>It is quite apparent from all the pre-1973 water cases in Montana that the courts look to beneficial use as the essential criterion in determining suits between water claimants.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcO\"><em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 525, 722 P.2d at 602. (Emphasis added.) Made clear from the entirety of our precedent, including cases applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>1972 Constitution, is that protected water rights consist of those rights existing prior to 1973 for which the water was put to a <em>beneficial use. E.g., Murray v. Tingley, </em>20 Mont. 260, 268-69, 50 P. 723, 725 (1897); <em>Mettler v. Ames Realty Co., </em>61 Mont. 152, 159-60, 201 P. 702, 703-04 (1921); <em>Kelly v.

The beneficial use requirement is a cornerstone, pre-1973 legal concept that the law continues to enforce, now by statute. A pre-1973 water right is a \u201cright to the use of water that would be protected <em>under the law as it existed prior to July 1, 1973.\u201d </em>Section 85-2-102(12), MCA. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b651 Further, a water right is a property right. <em>Brennan v. Jones, </em>101 Mont. 550, 567, 55 P.2d 697, 702 (1936) (\u201c[I]tis settled by the decisions of this court that such a right is property which may be disposed of apart from the land on which it has been used.\u201d). Both the <em>amount </em>of water and the <em>priority </em>for its use are substantive parts of that property right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Property rights in water consist not alone in the amount of the appropriation[,] but, also, in the priority of the appropriation. It often happens that the chief value of an appropriation consists in its priority over appropriations in the same natural stream.

We have held that nonuse, in and of itself, is sufficient evidence to prove an intent to abandon. <em>79 Ranch, </em>204 Mont. at 432, 666 P.2d at 218 (\u201c[T]he evidence clearly shows at least forty years of continuous nonuse of the water rights ... such a long period of nonuse is <em>strong evidence of an intent to abandon </em>the water rights.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Smith v.

Thus, in addition to holding that nonuse can be sufficient, even if \u201cit stood alone,\u201d to prove abandonment, we have explained that the concept of abandonment is linked to the defining element of a water right, beneficial use. The law of abandonment is an inherent part of the law of beneficial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b654 With this understanding of the nature of water rights, I turn to \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, and the dispositive question of whether it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>retroactive. The statute is not expressly retroactive, but \u201cI i Impermissible retroactive application of a statute occurs when it is applied to divest or impair vested rights acquired under prior law, or when it creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions already passed.\u201d <em>Bull Lake Fire Dist. v.

Laws that <em>\u201cproduce a different legal result\u201d </em>are retroactive and, as such, inapplicable to claims rising prior to the statute\u2019s enactment. <em>Porter v.

In contrast, merely \u201cprocedural\u201d changes are not retroactive. <em>Saint Vincent Hosp. &amp; Health Ctr. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., </em>261 Mont. 56, 61, 862 P.2d 6, 9 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b655 Section 85-2-227(4), MCA, creates a new presumption of non-abandonment for a city (or a privately owned utility serving a city) when it \u201chas used <em>any part </em>of the water right... and there is admissible evidence\u201d the city or other entity took one of several other nonuse actions, such as conducting a formal study of the municipal water system. Section 85-2-227(4)(c), MCA (emphasis added). The Court concludes that this statute is not retroactive because it has the same effect as the statute in <em>Royston, </em>which we held was procedural, not substantive. In <em>Royston, </em>the Roystons challenged the Water Use Act\u2019s provision that shifted the burden of proof regarding a change of appropriation from the objector (to prove adverse impact) to the applicant (to prove no adverse impact). <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 427-29, 816 P.2d at 1056-57. They argued that \u201cbecause their water rights are existing water rights recognized by the 1972 Montana Constitution, construing the statute as changing the burden of proof and placing it on the applicant is an impermissible retroactive application of a statute because it impairs vested rights acquired pursuant to the 1972 Montana Constitution.\u201d <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 428-29, 816 P.2d at 1057. We rejected that argument, holding that \u201c[a] water right recognized by the 1972 Constitution does not include the right to not have to carry a burden of proof. This Court has held that the application of statutory procedures to water rights vested under the 1972 Montana Constitution is not unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 429, 816 P.2d at 1057. We thus concluded that the burden change was not a retroactive law because \u201cI s Itatutes that modify the procedure for exercising a vested right or carrying out a duty do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>constitute retroactive 1 <em>egisiation.\u201d Royston, </em>249 Mont. at 429, 816 P.2d at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b656 <em>Royston </em>involved purely a shift of the burden of proof in a water case. Neither the substance of the law nor the kind or quantum of evidence necessary to prevail was altered by the statute at issue in <em>Royston. </em>Although the burden of proof was shifted between the parties, the substantive issue remained the same: whether there had been an adverse impact. Here, much more is at issue. Beyond merely shifting a burden of proof by granting a presumption in favor of the city under certain circumstances, \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, also alters the substantive law of abandonment and the evidence necessary to prevail on the issue of abandonment, when a city is a party. The substantive law has been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b657 Setting aside the mere change in the presumption and the burden of proof from one party to another\u2014held permissible as a procedural change in Royston\u2014\u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, alters the substantive law of abandonment by permitting a municipality to acquire its favorable presumption even though it has used only <em>part </em>of its water right. As explained above, the common law had long held that partial use of a water right could trigger partial abandonment of the right\u2014regardless of other actions taken by the water right holder supportive of the right. <em>Power, </em>21 Mont. at 528-31, 55 P. at 34-35 (noting evidence that plaintiff had allowed excess water diverted, through no intentional means, to naturally flow through dryland hay and thus increased the crop, showed no actual intent to use it beneficially, thus the plaintiff only retained the part of the water right put to beneficial use, the domestic uses); <em>Holmstrom Land Co., </em>185 Mont. at 424, 605 P.2d at 1069 (holding only 80 miners inches of an originally 337 miners inch water right was retained because, for seventy-five years, the irrigated land could only accommodate and put to beneficial use 80 miners inches); <em>Deer Lodge, </em>254 Mont. at 16, 833 P.2d at 1123 (\u201cDeer Lodge\u2019s evidence that it carried the water rights as assets on its books is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of abandonment [established by 23 years of nonuse].\u201d). This was, as noted above, because the common law of abandonment is inextricably linked to the key principle of beneficial use\u2014all of the water must be beneficially used. <em>Power, </em>21 Mont. at 529, 55 P. at 35 (\u201c[W]hen the appropriator, or his successor in interest, abandons and ceases to use the water for such [a beneficial] purpose, the right ceases.\u201d); <em>McDonald, </em>220 Mont. at 525, 722 P.2d at 601 (\u201cThere are two components to the Montana Constitutional guaranty: there must be an existing right to the use of water, and the use must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>be for a beneficial purpose.\u201d). Section 85-2-227(4), MCA, alters these cornerstone beneficial use principles in the substantive law, replacing them with a hybrid principle that requires only partial use of the water, in combination with a non-water use action, to create the presumption and to preserve the water right.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u00b658 One of these non-water use actions listed in \u00a7 85-2-227(4)(b), MCA, is the construction of a \u201cdiversion or conveyance\u201d structure. Thus, as the Water Court held and the Court affirms, the construction of a structure of sufficient size to merely <em>accommodate </em>the City\u2019s full water rights is sufficient to obtain the presumption (along with partial use of water), without actually using the full water right. Likewise, this is a change in the substantive law of abandonment and beneficial use.</p>\n<p id=\"Avfm\">\u00b659 This is incredibly significant to Skinner. Beyond the mere shifting of the burden of proof to him, the substantive law, and the evidence permitted thereunder, that Skinner formerly could have used to rebut the City\u2019s presumption and prove abandonment has now been altered dramatically, in the City\u2019s favor. Specifically, as we have repeatedly held throughout our entire history of water law, cited in the cases above, evidence of nonuse of water by a water right holder was \u201cpotent,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d or \u201cclear\u201d evidence of intent to abandon. Now, under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, this same evidence will no longer be sufficient to prove an intent to abandon. As the City\u2019s briefing explains, and the Court holds, once a municipality satisfies the statute and the new presumption arises, \u201cthe burden of showing abandonment [is] on the challenger, <em>regardless of period of non-use.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Consequently, under the statute, what we have repeatedly held to be the most critical evidence in a common law abandonment case\u2014nonuse of the water\u2014has, as a matter of law, been stripped of its evidentiary significance, thus essentially creating a <em>conclusive, </em>not rebuttable, presumption in the City\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">\u00b660 Such a conclusive presumption was clearly applied in the Water Court\u2019s decision that the Court today affirms. After first holding that the City had obtained the presumption under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, the Water Court ruled that Skinner\u2019s evidence of many years of nonuse simply did not apply because, as it explained, \u201cthe whole purpose of Section 85-2-227(4), MCA[,] is to presume nonabandonment in precisely those circumstances when intent to abandon would otherwise be presumed (e.g. based on a long period of nonuse).\u201d It could not be any clearer that the very evidence this Court has held, for more than a century, was the best evidence of an intention to abandon a water right is simply no longer effective in cases involving municipalities. The Water Court used the statute to disallow Skinner\u2019s strongest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>evidence\u2014the fact the City <em>could not put to beneficial use </em>large chunks of its water rights for significant periods of time. Indeed, the Water Court reached the incredible conclusion that Skinner had presented <em>\u201cno evidence </em>that Helena intended to abandon 7.35 cfs of its water rights during the period from 1919 to 1948.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Evidence that we have declared for over a century as \u201cpotent,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d and \u201cclear\u201d proof of abandonment under the common law has now been deemed to be \u201cno evidence\u201d whatsoever, as a matter of law. This is illustrated in the extreme by the Court\u2019s reversal of the Water Court\u2019s holding that the City abandoned the .6 CFS that it did not use for some 60 years. Skinner could not even prevail on his abandonment claim by showing six decades of nonuse!</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">\u00b661 These changes, which the Court explains is the codification of the Growing Communities Doctrine, go far beyond simple \u201cprocedural\u201d changes. The statute \u201ctakes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, attaches a new disability in respect to transactions already passed, or gives a transaction a different legal effect from that which it had when it occurred.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>275 Mont. at 185, 911 P.2d at 1150 (citation omitted). It will \u201cproduce a different legal result.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>275 Mont. at 185, 911 P.2d at 1150. Property rights are protected by the Montana Constitution as a fundamental right. Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. Section 85-2-227(4), MCA, has dramatically eroded the pre-1973 common law under which Skinner\u2019s water rights were established, and also eroded the standing of his water rights against a municipality. His common law right to claim the use of water as a junior water user, upon proving abandonment of some water by a senior water user, has now been effectively impaired. This impacts his priority status, which we have declared to be a property right. All of the changes to Skinner\u2019s rights, discussed above, combine to cause a \u201csubstantive\u201d impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u00b662 I am not objecting to the Legislature\u2019s right to change the common law\u2014it is entitled to change the common law when it wishes, and it has clearly done so. Nor am I saying that the statute violates the Constitution\u2019s protection of pre-1973 rights. That issue is not before us in this case. Further, I well understand the need to ensure that communities are able to protect sufficient supplies of water as they grow. However, that goal should not be obtained at the expense of the law, properly applied. Section 85-2-227(4), MCA, has clearly effectuated substantive changes in the law that have greatly impacted Skinner, and others who are situated similarly. Skinner\u2019s rights have been significantly devalued from the status they held under the common law. The statute effectuating these changes should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>whitewashed with a can of procedural Kalsomine. The changes rendered are clearly substantive, making the statute impermissibly retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b663 I would reverse the Water Court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings for application of the common law principles of abandonment and beneficial use.</p>\n<judges id=\"b49-6\">JUSTICE MCKINNON and JUSTICE BAKER join in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\"> Skinner, along with Carol A.
