Before the case went to trial, Poat was appointed a guardian and a conservator. The conservator secured rulings in a separate case divesting Strang of assets Poat had conveyed to him. The jury found Strang guilty of the charges. The District Court denied Strang\u2019s request for a new trial and sentenced him to prison. Strang appeals the court\u2019s admission of certain evidence at trial and its refusal to order a new trial for juror misconduct. He argues for the first time on appeal that the presiding judge should have been disqualified because the judge entered orders against Strang\u2019s interests in the guardianship and conservatorship case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\n<em>1. Whether Strang is entitled to a hearing on his request to disqualify the trial judge;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-12\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed the State to present certain documents and witness testimony that the prosecutor disclosed shortly before trial;</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-13\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that juror misconduct did not warrant a new trial.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">\u00b63 Strang met Ben Poat in 2007. Poat was in his late seventies, was unmarried, had no children, and lived alone. Strang began helping Poat with odd jobs around Poat\u2019s house, and over time he began assisting Poat with his finances. Poat gave Strang a durable power of attorney in 2012 and a specific power of attorney over Poat\u2019s bank account in 2013. Poat also made Strang the primary beneficiary of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>will and transferred property to Strang, including vehicles and real property. Approximately thirty-five checks were issued to Strang from Poat\u2019s bank account, totaling over $142,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b64 In September 2013, Rena Ayers\u2014a social worker with the Adult Protective Services Division of the Department of Public Health and Human Services\u2014met with Poat at his home in response to a complaint from Poat\u2019s sister. Ayers noted, among other things, that Poat had untreated melanomas, that he had trouble remembering facts such as his own birthdate and his siblings\u2019 names, and that the only food in the house was peanut butter and milk. Due in part to Ayers\u2019s concerns about Poat\u2019s inability to care for himself and his susceptibility to exploitation, Adult Protective Services initiated guardianship and conservatorship proceedings in September 2013. Poat subsequently was diagnosed with dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b65 The guardianship and conservatorship proceedings took place in the Fourth Judicial District Court, with Judge John Larson presiding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the case register for those proceedings lists only Judge Larson as the presiding judge, Judge Ed McLean also participated in the case. Judge McLean issued an order in November 2013 that invalidated Poat\u2019s 2012 will naming Strang as the beneficiary, invalidated Poat\u2019s power of attorney to Strang, and required the return of certain property that had been transferred from Poat to Strang.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b66 The State charged Strang in May 2014 with Abuse or Exploitation of an Older Person, in violation of \u00a7 52-3-825, MCA. The State contended that Strang took financial advantage of Poat and that he failed to take reasonable steps to maintain Poat\u2019s health. Judge McLean presided over the case. The State\u2019s Affidavit and Motion for Leave to File Information stated that Judge McLean had appointed a guardian and a conservator for Poat and that the court had issued an order invalidating Poat\u2019s will and power of attorney to Strang and ordering the return of some of Poat\u2019s property from Strang. Strang did not object to Judge McLean presiding over the criminal case or request his disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\u00b67 A jury trial began on January 12,2015. Poat died in August 2014, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>before the start of trial. Ten days before trial, on January 2, the State disclosed two new potential witnesses, Michelle Parkin and Lori Dove. The witnesses were employees of First American Title Company, and they were present when Strang inquired at that company about executing a quitclaim deed to transfer some of Poat\u2019s property to him. The witnesses allegedly heard Strang claim falsely that Poat had \u201cno living relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b68 On January 9, 2015, three days before trial, the State received documents from Wells Fargo in response to a December 2014 subpoena relating to Poat\u2019s bank account. The documents included copies of canceled checks made out to Strang. The State transmitted these records to the defense within hours after it received them.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b69 Strang filed a motion in limine and request for sanctions in which he asked the court to exclude Parkin and Dove from testifying and to prohibit the State from using the newly-produced bank records. The court denied the motion and allowed the State to introduce the bank records and to call Parkin as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court reasoned that the State had fulfilled its duty to promptly disclose all evidence and witnesses to the defense as soon as it was able. At the close of trial, the jury found Strang guilty of purposely or knowingly abusing or neglecting Poat and of exploitation of an older person.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\u00b610 Strang moved for a new trial. He argued that the court wrongfully allowed the State to call Parkin as a witness and to introduce the Wells Fargo bank records. He asserted further that he was deprived of a fair trial due to juror misconduct. He alleged that one juror was present with her husband in a restaurant when the husband made a statement suggesting that he believed Strang to be guilty. Strang alleged further that another juror improperly commented on Strang\u2019s guilt to the Bailiff during trial and that the Bailiff expressed his agreement with the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b611 The District Court denied Strang\u2019s motion for a new trial. It reasoned that the State had acted reasonably with regard to its late disclosures of witnesses and evidence and that Strang had failed to demonstrate prejudice from either the late disclosures or the alleged juror misconduct. The court sentenced Strang to a total of twenty years in prison with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u00b612 Strang appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b613 We review judicial disqualification questions de novo. <em>Draggin\u2019Y Cattle Co. v. Junkermier, </em>2017 MT 125, \u00b6 10, 387 Mont. 430, 395 P.3d 497 (hereafter, <em>Draggin\u2019 Y III). </em>Our inquiry requires an objective examination of the circumstances surrounding potential judicial disqualification and an accurate interpretation of the Montana Code of Judicial Conduct. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b614 A district court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>State v. Lozon, </em>2012 MT 303, \u00b6 9, 367 Mont. 424, 291 P.3d 1135. We will not disturb a district court\u2019s determination on the admissibility of evidence absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 9. Abuse of discretion occurs if a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Lozon, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b615 This Court reviews motions for new trial based on juror misconduct for abuse of discretion. A district court will not be overturned unless a defendant demonstrates that he was deprived of a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. MacGregor, </em>2013 MT 297, \u00b6 15, 372 Mont. 142, 311 P.3d 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b616 <em>1. Whether Strang is entitled to a hearing on his request to disqualify the trial judge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b617 Strang argues for the first time on appeal that Judge McLean should have recused himself from this case because he ruled on matters in Poat\u2019s guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. Strang claims that the same issues were dispositive of Strang\u2019s guilt in the criminal case. He asserts that Judge McLean \u201chad personal knowledge of the facts in dispute, had expressed bias against [Strang], and presided as a judge in Poat\u2019s guardianship proceedings which involved a matter that went to the heart of the State\u2019s case against [Strang].\u201d He argues that his disqualification claim is not untimely because it is based on Judge McLean\u2019s bias or prejudice and because Strang was unaware of Judge McLean\u2019s involvement in the prior proceedings until after Strang\u2019s criminal proceedings concluded. Strang urges this Court to remand for a disqualification hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u00b618 We generally do not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y III, </em>\u00b6 15. We may consider such issues, however, if they \u201caffect] ] the substantial rights of a litigant\u201d or if \u201cextenuating circumstances justify the party\u2019s failure to assert [its] legal theory at trial.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019 YII, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations and internal quotations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u201cA claim for disqualification of a judge must be brought within a reasonable time after the moving party learns the facts forming the basis for a claim that the judge should be disqualified.\u201d <em>State v. Dunsmore, </em>2015 MT 108, \u00b6 20, 378 Mont. 514, 347 P.3d 1220. If it is not brought within a reasonable time, the claim is waived. <em>Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">\u00b619 The State\u2019s Affidavit and Motion for Leave to File Information, which it filed in May 2014, stated, \u201cThe Honorable Ed P. McLean, Montana Fourth Judicial District Judge, appointed a guardian and a conservator for [Poat] on October 21, 2013.\u201d It stated further, \u201cThe Court entered an order invalidating [Poat\u2019s 2012] will, ordering the return of [Poat\u2019s] personal property, invalidating the power of attorney granted to STRANG, and invalidating the quitclaim deed providing STRANG an interest in [Poat\u2019s] real property on November 8, 2013.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3L\">\u00b620 The explicit reference to Judge McLean\u2019s involvement in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings put Strang on notice that the Judge in his criminal case had presided in a civil case touching on Strang\u2019s relationship with Poat. Strang did not bring any concern to Judge McLean, but waited until after his final conviction to raise his disqualification claim. He did not bring his claim \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d after learning of \u201cthe facts forming the basis for a claim that the judge should be disqualified.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 20. In <em>Draggin\u2019Y, </em>the complaining party did not learn of the judge\u2019s potential conflict until after the judge had made key rulings in the case. We determined that this presented \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d warranting remand for a hearing under \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA, which provides the ordinary method for seeking a judge\u2019s disqualification. <em>Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 31. Here, in contrast, the initiating documents in the State\u2019s case against Strang put in the record Judge McLean\u2019s participation in the related civil action, and Strang could have raised his concerns with the judge or invoked the procedure prescribed by \u00a7 3-1-805, MCA. There were no \u201cextenuating circumstances\u201d justifying Strang\u2019s failure to assert a disqualification claim. <em>Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6 15. He did not make his claim timely, and we conclude that he waived it. <em>See Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"AC6Q\">\u00b621 Strang asserts, however, that the timeliness requirement does not apply to his disqualification claim because the claim is based on Judge McLean\u2019s actual bias or prejudice. The Code of Judicial Conduct \u201cdoes not allow parties to waive disqualification for bias or prejudice, and thus the timeliness requirement does not apply when a disqualification claim is based on bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b622 A fair trial\u2014which is \u201ca basic requirement of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>process\u201d\u2014requires \u201cthat any judge who is biased or partial with regard to a particular matter or party be disqualified from hearing the case.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations and internal quotations omitted). The Montana Code of Judicial Conduct provides, \u201cA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A); <em>Reichert v. State, </em>2012 MT 111, \u00b6 50, 365 Mont. 92, 278 P.3d 455. This includes situations in which the \u201cjudge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or a party\u2019s lawyer, or personal knowledge of facts that are in dispute in the proceeding.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(1). It includes also situations in which the judge \u201cpreviously presided as a judge over the matter in another court.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b623 In <em>Draggin\u2019Y, </em>the District Court Judge presided over a stipulated settlement agreement that two parties entered into without the authorization or participation of one party\u2019s insurer. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 6. The insurer subsequently intervened and challenged the settlement\u2019s reasonableness, and the judge determined that the settlement was reasonable. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 6. At the same time that he was presiding over the case, the judge entered into a similar stipulated settlement agreement in a personal matter without his insurer\u2019s participation or authorization. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 22. The Office of the Court Administrator, which acted as the judge\u2019s \u201cinsurer\u201d in his personal case, contested the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 22. The judge did not disclose to the parties the existence of his own stipulated settlement or the fact that the insurer in his case had contested the settlement\u2019s reasonableness. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 23. We held that the judge \u201ccontinued to have a present and immediate interest in his own personal stipulated settlement\u201d while presiding over the case. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 25. We determined that the judge\u2019s \u201cimpartiality in deciding the stipulated settlement\u2019s reasonableness might reasonably be questioned\u201d and therefore that he should have been disqualified. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 26 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b624 <em>Draggin\u2019 Y </em>was a case in which the judge had \u201ca present and immediate interest in his own <em>personal </em>[litigation]\u201d that involved issues substantially similar to those over which the judge was then presiding. <em>Draggin\u2019Y III, </em>\u00b6 26 (emphasis added). Strang has not shown how this case bears any similarity. He does not establish that Judge McLean had any <em>personal </em>bias or prejudice against him. The question as to the judge\u2019s impartiality in <em>Draggin\u2019Y </em>stemmed from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>involvement in a personal dispute that bore a strong resemblance to the dispute over which he was presiding. <em>Draggin\u2019 Y III, </em>\u00b6 22. By contrast, Strang\u2019s disqualification claim arose only from Judge McLean\u2019s rulings in a related court proceeding and not from any of Judge McLean\u2019s personal statements or actions outside of his judicial role.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b625 Strang points only to Judge McLean\u2019s adverse rulings against him to support his allegation of Judge McLean\u2019s bias or prejudice. Yet a judge\u2019s previous adverse rulings against a party do not constitute sufficient evidence to demonstrate a judge\u2019s personal bias or prejudice against that party. <em>See In re Marriage of Gahr, </em>212 Mont. 481, 486, 689 P.2d 257, 260 (1984) (holding that defendant failed to meet his burden of demonstrating a presumption of bias based on the judge\u2019s denial of several of defendant\u2019s motions); <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 1157 (1994) (\u201c[JJudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\u201d); <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 1710 (1966) (\u201cThe alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\u201d); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 3-1-805(1)(b), MCA (stating that an affidavit alleging a judge\u2019s personal bias or prejudice \u201cwill be deemed not to have been made in good faith if it is based solely on rulings in the case which can be addressed in an appeal from the final judgment\u201d). Judge McLean\u2019s adverse rulings against Strang\u2019s interests in the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings do not establish personal bias or prejudice against Strang. Because Strang\u2019s disqualification claim was not \u201ca claim of actual bias or prejudice,\u201d the timeliness requirement applies. <em>Dunsmore, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b626 Moreover, the knowledge that Judge McLean obtained in Poat\u2019s guardianship and conservatorship proceedings does not constitute \u201cpersonal knowledge of facts that are in dispute\u201d in Strang\u2019s criminal case sufficient to warrant disqualification under M. C. Jud. Cond.,Rule 2.12(A)(1). \u201cMontana\u2019s Code of Judicial Conduct is based on the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct.\u201d <em>Draggin\u2019Y II, </em>\u00b6 26. Under the Model Code of Judicial Conduct,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Knowledge about matters in a proceeding that has been obtained by a judge within the proceeding itself <em>or within another legal proceeding </em>is permissible and does not call for disqualification. Therefore, presiding over a civil case does not disqualify the judge from presiding over the criminal case even if it is the same matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjF\">Charles Gardner Geyh et al., Judicial Conduct and Ethics \u00a7 4.10, 4-42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>(5th ed. 2013) (emphasis added) (citing Lee <em>v. State, </em>735 N.E.2d 1169 (Ind. 2000), and <em>Santisteban v. State, </em>72 So.3d 187 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2011)). \u201cTo be disqualifying, the knowledge must be obtained extrajudicially rather than in the judge\u2019s official capacity during the course of a proceeding.\u201d Arthur H. Garwin et al., Annotated Model Code of Judicial Conduct 308 (3d ed. 2016) (citing <em>Los v. Los, </em>595 A.2d 381 (Del. 1991), <em>Poorman v. Commonwealth, </em>782 S.W.2d 603 (Ky. 1989), and <em>In re T.L.S., </em>481 A.2d 1037 (Vt. 1984)). Strang is incorrect in asserting that Judge McLean should have been disqualified under M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b627 Strang\u2019s argument that Judge McLean should have been disqualified on the ground that he \u201cpreviously presided as a judge over the matter in another court\u201d similarly is not correct. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d). This provision of the Code is intended to bar a judge from hearing a case on appeal when the judge presided over that same case in a different court. <em>See </em>Arthur H. Garwin et al., Annotated Model Code of Judicial Conduct 332 (3d ed. 2016) (\u201cTrial judges sometimes sit by designation on courts of appeal, and vice versa. Such judges should not hear cases over which they presided in a different court, and this Rule makes that clear.\u201d). This provision does not prevent a judge from presiding over a case simply because the judge previously presided over a related case. <em>See In re Aubuchon, </em>309 P.3d 886, 890 (Ariz. 2013) (holding that, in a disciplinary proceeding in which the presiding judge had previously participated in cases related to, but distinct from, the disciplinary proceeding, the judge had not \u201cpreviously presided as a judge over the matter in another court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\u00b628 Here, Strang\u2019s criminal case constitutes \u201cthe matter\u201d at hand. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d). Judge McLean did not preside over Strang\u2019s criminal case \u201cin another court.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d). Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d) therefore does not apply. Strang cites to <em>Bullman v. State, </em>2014 MT 78, 374 Mont. 323, 321 P.3d 121, in support of his assertion that Rule 2.12(A)(5)(d) required Judge McLean\u2019s recusal. Our holding in <em>Bullman </em>relied on Rule 2.12(A)(5)(a), which requires disqualification when a judge \u201cserved <em>as a lawyer </em>in the matter in controversy.\u201d <em>Bullman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-17 (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotations omitted). Judge McLean did not serve \u201cas a lawyer in the matter in controversy.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A)(5)(a). <em>Bullman </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b629 Judges frequently hear cases involving parties against whom they have ruled in previous cases. If judges had to recuse themselves from every such case, they could not, as a practical matter, fulfill their duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>to \u201cbe available to decide matters that come before the courts.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.7 cmt. [1]. Judge McLean\u2019s involvement in both the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings and Strang\u2019s criminal case constituted a routine execution of his professional duties as a judge. As such, it did not cause Judge McLean\u2019s impartiality to \u201creasonably be questioned.\u201d M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"A4Vu\">\u00b630  Because Strang\u2019s disqualification claim was untimely, because he did not establish a valid claim of personal bias or prejudice, and because he has not raised a colorable claim that Judge McLean\u2019s impartiality might \u201creasonably be questioned,\u201d we conclude that his request for a disqualification hearing lacks merit. M. C. Jud. Cond., Rule 2.12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b631 2. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed the State to present certain documents and witness testimony that the prosecutor disclosed shortly before trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b632 Strang contends that the State \u201cambushed\u201d him by disclosing Parkin as a witness ten days before trial and by producing the Wells Fargo bank records just three days before trial. He argues that the State gave him almost no time to prepare proper rebuttals to these late disclosures. Strang asserts that the State knew or should have known about the content of Parkin\u2019s testimony and about the bank records well in advance of trial. He urges us to hold that the District Court\u2019s admission of Parkin\u2019s testimony and the bank records at trial was error that warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b633 Montana law requires the prosecution, upon request, to make available to the defendant certain \u201cmaterial and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control,\u201d including documents it plans to introduce and information about witnesses it plans to call at trial. Section 46-15-322(1), MCA. If, after its initial disclosure, the State \u201cdiscovers additional information or material that would be subject to disclosure had it been known at the time of disclosure,\u201d it must \u201cpromptly notify\u201d the defendant \u201cof the existence of the additional information or material and make an appropriate disclosure.\u201d Section 46-15-327, MCA. The purpose of these statutes is to \u201cprevent surprise\u201d at trial. <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, \u00b6 22, 303 Mont. 507, 16 P.3d 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">\u00b634 A district court may, within its discretion, impose sanctions for discovery violations. <em>State v. Pierce, </em>2016 MT 308, \u00b6 20, 385 Mont. 439, 384 P.3d 1042; \u00a7 46-15-329, MCA. \u201cSuch discretion allows the court to consider the reason why disclosure was not made, whether noncompliance was willful, the amount of prejudice to the opposing party, and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 20 <em>(citing State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>v. Golder, </em>2000 MT 239, \u00b6 11, 301 Mont. 368, 9 P.3d 635). \u201cAbsent a clear abuse of discretion, the decision of the district court must be upheld.\u201d <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11. A district court does not abuse its discretion in declining to impose discovery sanctions when the State\u2019s failure to disclose evidence \u201cwas not willful and no prejudice resulted.\u201d <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>accord State v. Van Voast, </em>247 Mont. 194, 202, 805 P.2d 1380, 1385 (1991) (upholding the District Court\u2019s decision to allow late disclosure of a witness because the reason for the late disclosure was the State\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge of which [the witness] would be testifying,\u201d there was \u201cno indication of willful noncompliance with the discovery statutes,\u201d and the defendant knew the identity of the witness twenty-four days before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">A. The State\u2019s Disclosure of Parkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b635 Long before the State disclosed its intent to call Parkin as a witness, Parkin approached the prosecutor\u2019s office and asked to make an appointment. She told a receptionist that Strang had inquired with her company about obtaining a quitclaim deed to transfer Poat\u2019s property to him. The receptionist informed Parkin that the prosecutor already had evidence of the property transfer to which Parkin referred. Parkin did not mention that she had overheard Strang state falsely that Poat had \u201cno living relatives.\u201d Parkin left without meeting with the prosecutor. The State first learned of Parkin\u2019s knowledge of Strang\u2019s statement on January 2, 2015, when, during a conversation at the courthouse between Parkin\u2019s coworker, Dove, and the prosecutor\u2019s assistant, Dove informed the assistant about the statement. At that point the prosecutor promptly notified Strang that the State intended to call Parkin and Dove as witnesses. Strang did not contact Parkin in the ensuing ten days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b636 The District Court reasonably determined, given the evidence, that the State\u2014through no fault of its own\u2014was unaware until January 2, 2015, that Parkin knew about Strang\u2019s comment that Poat had \u201cno living relatives.\u201d Prior to that date, the State did not possess \u201cknowledge of [facts to] which [Parkin] would be testifying.\u201d <em>Van Voast, </em>247 Mont. at 202, 805 P.2d at 1385. Once the State became aware of Parkin\u2019s knowledge of Strang\u2019s statement, it \u201cpromptly\u201d notified the defense and made \u201can appropriate disclosure.\u201d Section 46-15-327, MCA. Although Parkin approached the prosecutor\u2019s office well before trial, she did not alert that office to her knowledge of Strang\u2019s comment. The District Court reasonably concluded from this that the State\u2019s late disclosure of Parkin \u201cwas not willful.\u201d <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11. As the court noted, Strang had ten days between Parkin\u2019s disclosure and the time of trial to interview her and seek possible rebuttal witnesses. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>did neither. The District Court properly considered \u201cthe reason why disclosure was not made, whether noncompliance was willful, the amount of prejudice to the opposing party, and any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 20. Strang cannot show a \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d; therefore, the court\u2019s decision not to exclude Parkin or to grant a new trial \u201cmust be upheld.\u201d <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">B. The State\u2019s Disclosure of Poat\u2019s Bank Records.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b637 The State\u2019s Information alleged that Strang exploited Poat \u201cbetween August 1, 2012 and September 27, 2013\u201d in order to obtain his \u201cmoney, assets, or property.\u201d The Affidavit and Motion for Leave to File Information stated that \u201cbetween July 10,2013 and September 19, 2014, STRANG wrote at least six checks to himself totaling $13,800\u201d and that Strang \u201cwrote a significant number of other checks on [Poat\u2019s] account.\u201d During the initial discovery, the State provided Strang with all of Poat\u2019s bank records that it had received during the guardianship and conservatorship proceedings. These records included six checks made out to Strang from Poat\u2019s account. The prosecutor had received the records from the conservator and informed the court during discussions on Strang\u2019s motion in limine that she believed at the time that this set of documents constituted a complete record of Poat\u2019s bank account during the period of Strang\u2019s alleged financial exploitation. The State learned later that it had not gotten all of the bank records, and it subpoenaed Wells Fargo to obtain the remainder. The additional Wells Fargo records that the State received and transmitted to the defense on January 9 included dozens of additional checks made out to Strang.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b638 After Strang filed his motion in limine, the court questioned him about his prior knowledge of the bank records that the State disclosed on January 9. Strang informed the court that the bank had issued online statements for Poat\u2019s account and that Strang had been the recipient of those statements. The court determined that Strang had been aware of the existence of the canceled checks well before January 9 and that the prosecution had complied with its duty to promptly disclose all the evidence in its possession or control.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u00b639 The record supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Strang was aware of other checks and had access to the bank records in question well before the State disclosed them three days before trial. The checks were made out to Strang. Strang did not present evidence to counter the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he had access to Poat\u2019s bank statements during the time that the checks in question were issued. The bank statements that the State provided Strang during initial discovery\u2014even though they included copies of only six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>checks\u2014encompassed the same time period in which the dozens of additional checks were issued to Strang from Poat\u2019s account. The State\u2019s production of six checks from Poat\u2019s account during initial discovery put Strang on notice that it intended to introduce checks that were issued to Strang from Poat\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b640 The State initially provided Strang with all of Poat\u2019s bank records that it had within its \u201cpossession or control.\u201d Section 46-15-322(1), MCA. The State did not withhold any bank records. Once it \u201cdiscover[ed] additional information or material that would be subject to disclosure had it been known at the time of disclosure,\u201d it \u201cpromptly\u201d notified Strang \u201cof the existence of the additional information or material and ma[d]e an appropriate disclosure.\u201d Section 46-15-327, MCA. In <em>Pierce, </em>the State disclosed six days before trial a police officer\u2019s report that mistakenly had not been included in the County law enforcement department\u2019s investigative file. <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 11. As soon as the State discovered the report, it provided a copy of it to the defense. <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 21. Here, as in <em>Pierce, </em>the State\u2019s immediate disclosure of the bank records once it \u201cbecame aware of them\u201d did not violate the State\u2019s discovery obligations. <em>Pierce, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b641 Further, Strang\u2019s defense was that his care helped Poat stay in his home and that Poat chose freely to make Strang the recipient of his property and the beneficiary of his will. Strang did not argue that he did not receive money from Poat\u2019s account. Instead, he argued that Poat gave money to Strang out of gratitude for Strang\u2019s assistance and that Strang did not deceive or manipulate Poat into giving him this money. The introduction of additional checks made out to Strang did not compel Strang to alter his defense at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"a4v-dedup-0\">\u00b642  Strang has failed to show that any \u201cprejudice resulted\u201d from the State\u2019s late disclosure of the additional bank records. <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11. Given that the late disclosure \u201cwas not willful and no prejudice resulted,\u201d we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Strang\u2019s motion in limine or his motion for a new trial on the basis of the State\u2019s late disclosures. <em>Golder, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">\u00b643 <em>3. Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it determined that juror misconduct did not warrant a new trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\u00b644 Strang alleged in his motion for a new trial that he had been denied a fair trial due to juror misconduct. He claimed first that a juror and her husband were discussing the case at a restaurant near the courthouse, and that the husband was heard telling others that they were at \u201ca trial for a guy who stole an old guy\u2019s money and property.\u201d Strang alleged that, in a separate incident, another juror was heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>telling the Bailiff during the course of trial, \u201cNext stop ... the gallows\u201d\u2014an apparent reference to Strang. Strang claimed that the Bailiff expressed his agreement with the juror\u2019s statement. Strang relied on eyewitness affidavits to support these claims of juror misconduct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argued in his motion for a new trial that these incidents exposed the jurors to \u201cextraneous information\u201d concerning his guilt and that the jurors involved violated the court\u2019s directive to not discuss the case with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b645 Strang argues on appeal that these jurors\u2019 acts of misconduct entitle him to a new trial. Strang explains that the alleged juror misconduct, \u201c[wjhile perhaps not sufficient in its own right to support a new trial,\u201d was sufficient to warrant a new trial \u201cwhen combined with the other bases raised\u201d in the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A4x\">\u00b646  A District Court may grant the defendant a new trial \u201cif required in the interest of justice\u201d and \u201cif justified by law and the weight of the evidence.\u201d Section 46-16-702, MCA. A defendant may assert juror misconduct as a basis for a new trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cooksey, </em>2012 MT 226, \u00b6\u00b6 8-11, 366 Mont. 346, 286 P.3d 1174; <em>State v. Dunfee, </em>2005 MT 147, \u00b6\u00b6 13-18, 327 Mont. 335, 114 P.3d 217; \u00a7 25-11-102(2), MCA (stating that, in the context of civil procedure, \u201cmisconduct of the jury\u201d constitutes a ground for a new trial). \u201cJuror misconduct based on extraneous communications must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and in the context of the entire record. The trial court is uniquely qualified to appraise whether extraneous information resulted in prejudice, and we accord substantial weight to that determination.\u201d <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 19. Although a juror\u2019s exposure to extraneous information creates a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, this \u201cpresumption is not absolute, and arises only when the information shows a natural tendency to prejudice.\u201d <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"An_P\">\u00b647 As the District Court noted in denying Strang\u2019s motion for a new trial, the juror whose husband made the remarks in the restaurant was an alternate juror who did not participate in the jury\u2019s deliberations. She did not comment at the restaurant on the trial or respond to her husband\u2019s remarks. Even if the alternate juror was exposed to extraneous information, the District Court was \u201cuniquely qualified to appraise whether [that] extraneous information resulted in prejudice.\u201d <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"AWU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u00b648  As to the other juror\u2019s alleged statement to the Bailiff, Strang presented no evidence that the Bailiff expressed his agreement with the comment. The witness affidavit describing the incident said nothing of the Bailiffs reaction. The Bailiff submitted an affidavit disavowing any knowledge of the juror\u2019s alleged comment. The court reasonably determined that the juror was not exposed to extraneous information and that the juror\u2019s lone comment did not have \u201ca natural tendency to prejudice.\u201d <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 20. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Strang\u2019s motion for a new trial as it pertained to the alleged juror misconduct. <em>See MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b649 Strang\u2019s disqualification claim was untimely, and he failed to establish a valid claim of bias or prejudice. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in its evidentiary rulings or in denying Strang\u2019s motion for a new trial.
