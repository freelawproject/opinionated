The bill was filed to foreclose a mortgage executed by Jacob I. Maybee to the complainants. Maybee claimed title to the mortgaged premises under an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ordinary deed of bargain and sale from the four children of B. Evesson, who formerly owned the same as tenants in common. At the time of the execution of the deed two of the grantors were under twenty-one ; but they had never done any act to avoid the deed after they became of age, and the grantee and his assigns had continued in the undisturbed possession of the property. In February, 1828, Maybee conveyed the premises to G, Cozine, one of the defendants, in fee, subject to the complainants\u2019 mortgage. And Cozine subsequently obtained from H&lt; Evesson, one of the grantors of Maybee, who was then of age, a conveyance of all his interest and claim to the prepiises. The defendant-Cozine insisted, in his answer, that by reason of the infancy of two of the grantors at the time of the conveyance to Maybee, only one half of the premises passed by that conveyance or by the mortgage to the complainants. The vice chancellor decreed a sale of the whole premises for the satisfaction of the complainants\u2019 mortgage; but directed that the master should sell subject to the right of the other grantor, who was an infant at the time of the conveyance to Maybee, to disaffirm the conveyance, if any such right existed. From this decree the defendant Cozine appealed, <em>(See 1 Edward\u2019s Ch, Rep. </em>SOI.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-8\"><em>S. P. Staples &amp; W. S. Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_s\">The complainants\u2019 mortgage covers only one undivided moiety of the mortgaged premises, as to which a foreclosure is prayed by the bill. Henry Evesson and Benjamin Eves-son, who were infants when the mortgage was made, should have been made parties to the suit. The claims of the creditors of the defendant Ferdon, as against the defendant Cozine, cannot be litigated in this stage of the suit. The defendant Cozine is not accountable to the complainants for any portion of the rents and profits of the mortgaged premises received by him,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b636-9\"><em>George Wood, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdT\">A mortgage or deed in fee by infants is voidable, and is valid until it is in due form avoided. The sale of the equity of redemption being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>subject to the mortgage, the mortgage in equity formed a part of the consideration, and of course the payment thereof by the purchaser is a part of the contract under which he so purchased. And the purchaser holding the premises is bound in equity to pay off the mortgage and to relieve the mortgagor from his liability, on his bond. The purchaser of the equity of redemption having got from one of the infant grantors after he came of age a further conveyance of the equity of redemption of a part of the premises, such conveyance is a <em>confirmation </em>of his previous voidable title to such part, and not a new or distinct title. The confirmatory conveyance operates to establish not only the antecedent title but the consideration and the entire contract under which the antecedent voidable title was obtained, and of course the lien of the mortgage thereupon, and thereby to render the lien no longer voidable, but absolutely valid\u00bb None but the infant could avoid the mortgage or the assignment of the equity of redemption. The infant does not avoid it. On the contrary, he affirms the previous sale of the equity of redemption, and the terms upon which the sale was made.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b637-3\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AXm\">As the defendant Cozine went into possession of the premises as purchaser of the equity of redemption from the mortgagor, and subject to the complainants\u2019 mortgage, he cannot set up an adverse title in a stranger for the purpose of preventing a sale of the whole mortgaged premises for the satisfaction of the mortgage. It was therefore unnecessary and would have been improper for the complainants to make the infant grantor, in whom the outstanding title to one fourth of the premises is supposed by Cozine to be, a party to this suit. And if B\u00bb Evesson had been made a party he might have demurred to the bill, upon the ground that the complainants had no right to bring him into this court to try the validity of the legal title or claim to one fourth of the mortgaged premises. So far as mere legal rights are concerned, upon a bill of foreclosure, the only proper parties to the suit are the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and those who have acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>rights or interests under them subsequent to the mortgage. And the mortgagee has no right to make one who claims adversely to the- title of, the mortgagor, and prior to the mortgage, a party defendant, for the purpose of trying the validity of his adverse claim of title in this court. The case is analogous in principle .to making one who claims adversely to the vendor, a party to a bill filed by the vendee for the specific performance of the contract of sale., In which case it is held that such adverse claimant cannot.be made a party for the purpose Of having the validity of his claim settled by a decree of this court, which shall thereafter be binding upon him in relation to his claim of title. <em>(Lange </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 <em>Leigh\u2019s.Rep. 192.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">It appears, however, from the answer in this case, and the deed produced upon the hearing, that H. Evesson, one of the infant grantors of Maybee, has conveyed all his right and interest in the premises to Cozine since the latter has become the owner of the equity of redemption therein. It becomes necessary,therefore, to inquire whether the conveyance of the infant grantors to Maybee was absolutely void, or merely voidable by them; for the purpose of ascertaining whether the subsequent \"deed-from H. Evesson-to the defendant Cozine passed an absolute title to him of one fourth of the premises discharged of the mortgage, or was a mere confirmation of the title which he had previously acquired under the deed from Maybee. And upon this point I perfectly concur in the opinion of the vice chancellor, that the deed of an infant purporting to be founded upon a valuable consideration'is not absolutely void, but merely voidable. <em>(See 2 Kents Comm. </em>234; 10 <em>Peter\u2019s Rep. </em>71.) \u2019 As. the deed to Maybee conveyed the legal title, subject to the right of .the infant to disaffirm the contract, it is perfectly clear, from the subsequent deed to Cozine, that the latter deed was intended to operate as a mere confirmation of the former title, and not as a disaffirmance of the previous deed. To render a subsequent conveyance by an infant an act of dissent to his prior deed, it must be inconsistent therewith, so that both cannot properly stand together. . Here, if the allegations of Cozine in his answer are true, and as between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>him and the complainants they must be taken to be so, he was at the time of the second conveyance the legal owner of the premises, subject to the payment of the mortgage. A quit claim of all the right and title of the former grantor to him, therefore, previous to the doing of any act disaffirming the first deed was nothing more or less than a release of the right to disaffirm such former conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">What will be the legal effect of the second conveyance as between Cozine and those claiming under Ferdon\u2019s title, if it shall hereafter appear that the equity of redemption was not in Cozine but in Ferdon, must be left for the future decision of the court in settling the right to the surplus proceeds of the sale ; if there should be any surplus after paying the complainants\u2019 debt and costs. All that is intended to be decided here is, that upon the facts as they now appear upon the bill and on the answer of the appellant, the mortgage is a lien upon the whole premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The decree appealed from is therefore right, and must be affirmed with costs to the complainants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
