Though both parties urge us to recognize this exception, they disagree on whether it was properly applied in this case. In the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of resolving this dispute, we will take this opportunity to more clearly illustrate when and how the exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Eugene D. Zook (\u201cthe Decedent\u201d) died on December 24, 2008, after succumbing to prostate cancer at age 81. At the time of his death, the Decedent had three living adult children: Dennis Eugene Zook, Susan M. Pesce (\u201cRespondent\u201d), and Mary Caroline Zook (\u201cPetitioner\u201d). On November 20, 2007, the Decedent, with the help of attorney, Thomas P. Downs (\u201cDowns\u201d), set up the Eugene D. Zook Living Trust (\u201cthe 2007 Living Trust\u201d). The Decedent amended the Living Trust on December 2, 2008 (\u201cthe 2008 Living Trust\u201d), twenty-two days before his death. The instrument designated Respondent as the trustee of the Living Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Article Seven of the 2008 Living Trust specified that each of the Decedent\u2019s three children were to receive a one-third share of all remaining trust property. Although the distribution of the trust assets was equal, each heir\u2019s access to his or her share was not. Whereas the 2008 Living Trust directed the trustee to distribute the shares of Dennis Zook and Susan Pesce outright and free of trust, the trustee was directed to maintain in trust Petitioner\u2019s share according to specific terms and conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">On August 10, 2010, Petitioner, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a \u201cComplaint For Inspection Of Records\u201d (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Pesce, Downs, Dennis Zook, and Catherine Zook, Dennis\u2019s wife. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Complaint offered 18 counts, appearing to question the validity of the 2008 Living Trust.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pesce admitted the allegations of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, and 13, denied 4-6, 8-12, and 14-18, and requested the Complaint be dismissed for, among other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>reasons, failure to state a claim. A re-filed version of the motion to dismiss also claimed that the Complaint improperly joined parties who were not part of the administration of the Trust or Estate \u2014 namely, Downs, Dennis Zook, and Catherine Zook. This motion was granted for all parties except Pesce.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Trial took place on December <em>5, </em>2011. The court interpreted the Complaint as alleging that the 2008 Living Trust must be set aside as invalid because the Decedent was not of sound mind to enter the new agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After some discussion moderated by the court, Respondent agreed to provide an audit of the accounting of the trust assets. Notwithstanding this agreement, Petitioner requested access to a copy of the 2007 Living Trust. Downs, responding to Petitioner\u2019s subpoena for records, asserted that the 2007 Living Trust was a privileged communication with his deceased client, and that he would assert that privilege on the Decedent\u2019s behalf, as well as on the behalf of the trustee of the Living Trust, Pesce. The court honored that privilege and refused to allow Petitioner access to the 2007 Living Trust or allow any questions about its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The court then moved on to the question of the soundness of the Decedent\u2019s mind at the time that the 2007 Living Trust was amended. After hearing from four witnesses called by Petitioner, the court found the revisions to the 2007 Living Trust \u201cfair, proper and reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d The court then ruled that \u201cMs. Zook does not have a claim for relief based on paragraph 5 of her complaint.\u201d The court ordered the agreed-to audit of trust assets and dismissed the remainder of the complaint against Pesce.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, again appearing <em>pro se. </em>In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court affirmed the Circuit Court. Petitioner, having acquired counsel, petitioned this Court for <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted to consider the following questions:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">1. Does the testamentary exception to the attorney-client privilege exist in Maryland?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">2. Did the trial court err by recognizing the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to the unamended Living Trust?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Although the litigants present the first question as an unresolved issue, this Court has already recognized the existence of the testamentary exception, and we will not depart from our previous holding. <em>See Benzinger v. Hemler, </em>134 Md. 581, 107 A. 355 (1919). With this Court\u2019s previous ruling in mind, we hold that the testamentary exception does not grant Petitioner the relief she seeks. Thus, we answer the second question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">\n<em>The Testamentary Exception To The Attorney-Client Privilege</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">. [1,2] The attorney-client privilege<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is \u201ca rule of evidence that prevents the disclosure of a confidential communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>made by a client to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 414, 718 A.2d 1129, 1138 (1998). \u201cThe privilege is based upon the public policy that \u2018an individual in a free society should be encouraged to consult with his attorney whose function is to counsel and advise him and he should be free from apprehension of compelled disclosures by his legal advisor.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 520, 398 A.2d 421, 423 (1979) (quoting <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 135, 345 A.2d 830, 838 (1975)). It has been recognized as \u201cthe oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). Indeed, for over 150 years, this Court has recognized that \u201c[n]o rule is better established than \u2018that communications which a client makes to his legal adviser for the purpose of professional advice or aid shall not be disclosed, unless by the consent of the client for whose protection the rule was established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fulton v. Maccracken, </em>18 Md. 528, 542-43 (1862). This privilege is reflected in the Maryland Code, as well. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The privilege survives even after the client\u2019s death. Invoking the purpose of fostering free communication between attorney and client, the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7-s\">Knowing that communications will remain confidential even after death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure during the client\u2019s lifetime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 399, 407, 118 S.Ct. 2081, 2086, 141 L.Ed.2d 379 (1998). Thus, even though the client may be deceased, the communication remains privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Nevertheless, the privilege is not absolute. Only those communications \u201c \u2018pertaining to legal assistance\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018made with the intention of confidentiality\u2019 \u201d are covered by the privilege. <em>E.I. du Pont, </em>351 Md. at 416, 718 A.2d at 1138 (quoting <em>Burlington Industries v. Exxon Corp., </em>65 F.R.D. 26, 37 (D.Md.1974)). Additionally, this Court has explained that the privilege does not \u201c \u2018extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud\u2019 or a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neuman v. State, </em>384 Md. 285, 309, 863 A.2d 321, 335 (2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Zolin, </em>491 U.S. 554, 563, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 2626, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Petitioner advocates that we recognize a testamentary exception to the attorney-client privilege, and Respondent concurs. Under this exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">[Confidential communications between attorney and client for the purpose of preparing the client\u2019s will ... are privileged during the testator\u2019s lifetime and, also, after the testator\u2019s death <em>unless sought to be disclosed in litigation between the testator\u2019s heirs, </em>legatees, devisees, or other parties, all of whom claim under the deceased client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>United States v. Osborn, </em>561 F.2d 1334, 1340 (9th Cir.1977) (emphasis added). The rationale underlying this exception is that in the context of a contested estate, such disclosure \u201chelps the court carry out the decedent\u2019s estate plan.\u201d Edward J. Imwinkelried, <em>The New Wigmore, A Treatise on Evidence: Evidentiary Privileges </em>\u00a7 6.13.2(b) (Richard D. Friedman ed., 2d ed. 2010). Were a court to exclude such evidence, \u201cthe court administering the will might reach an erroneous conclusion about the decedent\u2019s donative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, some states have elected to allow this exception to the attorney-client privilege based on the idea that \u201c \u2018the deceased client would presumably want his communications disclosed in litigation between such claimants so that his desires in regard to the disposition of his estate might be correctly ascertained and carried out.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting California Law Revision Comm\u2019n Comment, Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 957, Imwinkelried and Hallahan <em>California </em>Evidence Code Annotated 160 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Happily for both parties in this case, Maryland recognized the wisdom of the testamentary exception about a century ago.</p>\n<p id=\"AJd\">As this Court explained in <em>Benzinger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">The rule, we think, is well stated in the note <em>In re Young[\u2019s Estate </em>], 17 L.R.A. (N.S.) 108 [33 Utah 382, 94 P. 731] in which it is said: \u201cIt may be laid down as a general rule of law, gathered from all the authorities, that, unless provided otherwise by statute, communications by a client to the attorney who drafted his will, in respect to that document, and all transactions occurring between them leading up to its execution, are not, after the client\u2019s death, within the protection of the rule as to privileged communications, in a suit between the testator\u2019s devisees and heirs at law, or other parties who all claim under him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">134 Md. at 586, 107 A. at 357 (quoting Burdett A. Rich and Henry P. Farnham, editors, Annotation, <em>Privilege of communications to attorney during preparation of will, </em>17 L.R.A.N.S. 108 (1909)). The <em>Benzinger </em>Court held that the trial court erred by not permitting the attorney who drafted the will \u201cto testify as to the transactions, circumstances, and instructions given by the testatrix to him in connection with the will and its preparation, as well as what was said by her at such time relative thereto.\u201d 134 Md. at 588, 107 A. at 357-58. The Maryland rule is consistent with that adopted in a majority of states. <em>See </em>E.S. Stephens, Annotation, <em>Privilege as to communications to attorney in connection with drawing of will, </em>66 A.L.R.2d 1302 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">As evidenced by this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Benzinger, </em>the testamentary exception has existed in Maryland for close to a century, despite never having been formally named. Nonetheless, it has been some time since this Court has spoken on the testamentary exception. For this reason, we reaffirm that in a dispute between putative heirs or devisees under a will or trust, the attorney-client privilege does not bar admission of testimony and evidence regarding communication between the decedent and any attorneys involved in the creation of the instrument, provided that evidence or testimony tends to help clarify the donative intent of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\n<em>The Applicability Of The Testamentary Exception In This Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Our next step is to consider how the testamentary exception applies in this case. Petitioner argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow her to examine the 2007 Living Trust. Petitioner claims that she was prejudiced because her complaint alleged both that the Decedent was of unsound mind and subject to undue influence, and the content of the 2007 Living Trust was necessary to support this allegation. She relies on this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Moore v. Smith, </em>321 Md. 347, 353-54, 582 A.2d 1237, 1239 (1990) in which this Court held that a change from a former will or trust can be a factor in finding undue influence. In Petitioner\u2019s view, because the 2007 Living Trust document could demonstrate that the Living Trust had been changed, we should remand the case for a new trial in which she may introduce the 2007 Living Trust, and examine Downs and Pesce about that Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Competency Of Decedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">To evaluate this argument, we look first to the detail of the trial court\u2019s substantive rulings on the issue of whether decedent demonstrated unsound mind or undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">The court questioned Decedent\u2019s lawyer on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">THE COURT: Well, I have a couple of things I want to ask. On the day that this amendment was made to the trust that was \u2014 did Mr. Zook voluntarily make these changes or amendments?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">[Downs]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">THE COURT: And did he sign them without any undue influence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">[Downs]: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">THE COURT: And as far as you know, because you said you have prepared a trust for him previously, were you present when his \u2014 when he signed the December 2nd document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">[Downs]: I believe I\u2019m the notary, Your Honor, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>THE COURT: And do you recognize his signature? You notarized the document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">[Downs]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">THE COURT: It is, in fact, his signature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">[Downs]: It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">THE COURT: Okay. Now, you said that Mr. Zook was not feeling well, but he was coherent, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">[Downs]: Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">THE COURT: Did the fact that he didn\u2019t feel well in any way affect his ability to know and understand what was going on when he was in your office at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">[Downs]: No. I had no doubt that he understood what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-12\">THE COURT: And I might have asked you this already\u2014 did I ask you \u2014 I think I asked you did anyone influence him in any way to get him to sign it? If not, I\u2019m asking you that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">[Downs]: No, Your Honor. I met with him individually on that day. His daughter brought him there, but I excluded her from the meeting concerning what he wanted to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">The Judge later explicitly ruled that Petitioner did not have a claim for relief under paragraph 5, which alleges incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">The law governing a challenge to a will or trust based on the decedent\u2019s lack of capacity or competency has long been settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">\u201cWhether a testator had sufficient mental capacity is determined by a consideration of his external acts and appearances. It must appear that at the time of making the will he had a full understanding of the nature of the business in which he was engaged; a recollection of the property of which he intended to dispose and the persons to whom he meant to give it, and the relative claims of the different persons who were or should have been the objects of his bounty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>Sellers v. Qualls, </em>206 Md. 58, 66, 110 A.2d 73, 77 (1954) (quoting Philip L. Sykes, <em>Contest of Wills in Maryland </em>\u00a7 61 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The burden is imposed on the person challenging the instrument to prove a <em>lack </em>of capacity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">The law presumes that every man is sane and has capacity to make a valid will, and the burden of proving the contrary rests upon those who allege that he lacked mental capacity. Moreover, in the absence of proof of prior permanent insanity, it must be shown that the testator was of unsound mind at the time the will was executed in order to overcome the presumption of sanity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Arbogast v. MacMillan, </em>221 Md. 516, 523, 158 A.2d 97, 101 (1960) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">It is clear from the record that Petitioner was allowed to question witnesses regarding the Decedent\u2019s mental state and condition on the date the Living Trust was amended in 2008. Petitioner first asked Respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">[Petitioner:] Was he well or was he sick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">[Respondent:] He was of sound mind. He was doing things. He might not have been feeling well, but he was living, enjoying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Petitioner posed the same question to Respondent\u2019s husband, who shared a home with the Decedent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">[Joseph Pesce:] He was extremely alert and aware of everything he did and he was still cantankerous and bossy and opinionated, like he always was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">Finally, Petitioner questioned Downs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">[Petitioner:] What was the health of Eugene D. Zook when he came to your office on December 2nd, [20]08?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">[Downs:] He was seriously ill with cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">[Petitioner:] Seriously ill with cancer? How was his \u2014 how was he acting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-17\">[Downs:] He was coherent and \u2014 just a second. He said he was not feeling well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Petitioner did not testify herself, and the questions above constituted all of her evidence regarding her father\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Evidence that the Decedent was seriously ill with cancer is not sufficient, by itself, to show a lack of competency. That is all that Petitioner was able to produce in this case. Indeed, her questions produced testimony that Decedent was coherent at the date and time that he signed the 2008 Living Trust. We have no hesitancy in affirming, as did the Court of Special Appeals, the trial court ruling that Petitioner produced insufficient evidence to establish a lack of competence on the part of Decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Undue Influence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Relying on the evidence described above, and the Decedent\u2019s act of revising the 2007 Living Trust via execution of the 2008 Living Trust, Petitioner also claims that her father took the actions under the undue influence of her sister and sister\u2019s spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">At trial, Petitioner was able to present witness testimony that established that the 2007 Living Trust had indeed been changed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner alleged that the 2008 Living Trust was not a faithful representation of the Decedent\u2019s true testamentary intent. Consistent with the testamentary exception, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>trial court allowed questions to ascertain whether the revised Living Trust was indeed an embodiment of the Decedent\u2019s testamentary intent. After considering all the evidence presented, the court concluded \u201cthat the transaction of \u2014 that Mr. Eugene Zook made with respect to that December 2nd, 2008 document was fair, proper and reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d From this the court concluded that \u201cMs. Zook does not have a claim for relief based on paragraph 5 of her complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Relying on our holding in <em>Moore </em>that a change in a will or trust can be a factor in a finding of undue influence, Petitioner asks for a new trial, implying that the 2007 Living Trust, together with the circumstances already described, would demonstrate grounds to throw out the 2008 Living Trust. We conclude that Petitioner overestimates the efficacy of the evidence she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In <em>Moore, </em>the Court held that \u201c[generally, undue influence amounts to physical or moral coercion that forces a testator to follow another\u2019s judgment instead of his own.\u201d 321 Md. at 353, 582 A.2d at 1239 (citation omitted). The Court then recognized the following list of elements characteristic of undue influence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">1. The benefactor and beneficiary are involved in a relationship of confidence and trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">2. The will contains substantial benefit to the beneficiary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">3. The beneficiary caused or assisted in effecting execution of will;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">4. There was an opportunity to exert influence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">5. The will contains an unnatural disposition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">6. The bequests constitute a change from a former will; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">7.

The trial court explained its understanding of the applicable law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>When it\u2019s a confidential relationship, which is what you have here because Ms. Pesce is related, the daughter of Mr. Zook, the caretaker of Mr. Zook before he died[,] ... the burden shifts to [the defendant\u2019s] side to show that the ... change in the trust ... was deliberate and voluntary ... and that the transaction was fair, proper and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">[H]e must understand the nature of his act and its effect and the person to whom he means to give his property, the manner in which he disposes of it, and the relative claims of the persons who are or should be the objects of his bounty. The crucial time concerning capacity is the time of the execution of the deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The trial court\u2019s summary of the applicable law was right, except that the burden to prove incapacity or undue influence was on Petitioner, not Respondent. The doctrine of confidential relations will not shift the burden of proof from the caveator to the caveatee in a devise or bequest from a parent to a child. <em>Koppal, </em>189 Md. at 351, 56 A.2d at 50. Thus, in making its ruling, the trial court applied a burden of proof that was overly generous to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The trial court proceeded to make factual findings and apply this law, in a thorough explication. It addressed both competency and undue influence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">What was Mr. Eugene Zook\u2019s capacity at the time that these changes were made in this trust, that is, at the time of December 2nd, 2008. And I know Ms. Zook really wanted to proceed along the lines that he was on medication, he was heavily medicated, that he\u2019s dying of cancer, that he, in other words, couldn\u2019t have been of the mind to execute this amendment. That\u2019s really what\u2019s [sic] she\u2019s getting at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">But what I heard that really is relevant to resolving the issue is that Ms. Pesce drove Mr. Eugene Zook to Mr. Downs\u2019 office on December 2nd; that Mr. Downs as his counsel advised him, Mr. Eugene Zook, rather, met with him separately, advised him outside the presence of Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Pesce; that even though Mr. Eugene Zook was not feeling well, as Mr. Downs testified, he was coherent, and the fact that he didn\u2019t feel well did not affect his ability to understand everything; that he understood everything; and that he voluntarily entered this amendment; and that he was not influenced in any way in doing so; and that it is, in fact, his signature, and that he was familiar with his signature because he had prepared the trust previously, which was the one in \u2014 ... in '07. Plus, he said he had met with him three times, August [sic] 23rd, '07, November 20th '07, December 2nd, 2008, so two previous occasions before, so he was obviously familiar with Mr. Eugene Zook and felt that he was of the mind to execute this December 2nd, 2008 document. And he did do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">He also said that there was [sic] only a few changes, three or four paragraphs that were changed. And even though he didn\u2019t read everything, didn\u2019t sit there and watch him read everything, he read the portions that the amendments were made. And obviously, counsel was satisfied, Mr. Downs, that is, and he said he even notarized the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">So with that in mind, the Court certainly believes Mr. Downs. He is the officer of the Court. I don\u2019t think he would come here and not be truthful. I believe he is truthful, and I accept his testimony. And I find that the transaction of \u2014 that Mr. Eugene Zook made with respect to that December 2nd, 2008 document was fair, proper and reasonable under the circumstances. And I find that that being the case and having been shown in Ms. Zook\u2019s case, that the burden upon Defendant has been satisfied and that Ms. Zook does not have a claim for relief based on paragraph 5 of her complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The court did not consider the terms of the 2007 Living Trust or allow Downs to be questioned about it. Given our longstanding, if not oft-repeated, recognition of the testamentary exception to the attorney-client privilege, it appears that the trial court should have allowed Petitioner to discover and introduce the 2007 Living Trust. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>In resolving this appeal, however, we keep in mind that, in a civil case, a petitioner must not only show error but must demonstrate that the error was prejudicial. <em>Barksdale v. Wilkowsky, </em>419 Md. 649, 657, 20 A.3d 765, 769-70 (2011) (\u201c \u2018It has long been the policy in this State that this Court will not reverse a lower court judgment if the error is harmless.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716, 719 (2007))). As we saw above, a modification to a will or trust is one of several factors that may be considered in a caveat proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The fundamental problem with Petitioner\u2019s argument is that she has produced no evidence, other than this change in the terms of his Living Trust, to support a claim that Decedent was subject to undue influence. And we would be unwise indeed to hold that a mere change in a will or trust, even by someone of advanced age and in ill health, is sufficient to create a prima facie case for establishing undue influence or unsound mind. Such a rule would not only induce more litigation, but could discourage people from making desired and appropriate revisions to their wills or trusts. As we explain below, applying traditional <em>Moore </em>standards for undue influence, we do not see how Petitioner could establish undue influence, even if she could have introduced the 2007 Living Trust and questioned Downs and Pesce about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Moore Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The <em>Moore </em>factors stated above may vary in significance, depending on the case, but here, the most significant is the fifth factor, which we discuss first \u2014 that \u201c[t]he will contains an unnatural disposition.\u201d Here, Petitioner received a share of her father\u2019s assets equal to her siblings, including Respondent, who provided a home for the Decedent, and drove him to the attorney\u2019s office. The only difference between Petitioner\u2019s share and her siblings\u2019 shares was that her share was held in trust and distributed to her in twenty payments over a period of ten years. If she died within that period, her descendants received the remaining principal, including accrued income. Although Ms. Zook evidently would prefer to receive her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>share outright, it cannot be said that placing one child\u2019s equal share in trust is an \u201cunnatural disposition\u201d \u2014 such a devise is generally used for the protection of the beneficiary. Even if the trial court had seen the 2007 Living Trust, and that Trust had given Ms. Zook her share outright, there is no reason to think that the trial court would have or should have been swayed into thinking that the Decedent\u2019s 2008 Living Trust contained \u201can unnatural disposition.\u201d Certainly, it is natural for a father to decide, at some point, that one of his children will not preserve and protect her own bequest, and for that reason, exercise his judgment to maintain that share in trust for the child\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">By the same token, there is no showing that the second <em>Moore </em>factor, that \u201c[t]he will contains substantial benefit to the beneficiary,\u201d is established in this case. The Respondent receives the same share of the residuary estate as Petitioner and the other children. Respondent received no additional benefit from the Decedent\u2019s decision to maintain Ms. Zook\u2019s share in trust.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not see how the trial court\u2019s consideration of the terms of disposition of the 2007 Living Trust, whatever it said, would have, or should have, influenced its decision on the first or second factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">As to the third factor, that \u201c[t]he beneficiary caused or assisted in effecting execution of the will,\u201d the only evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>was that Respondent drove Decedent to his lawyer\u2019s office. Mr. Downs testified that she was excluded from the room when the will was discussed and executed. Downs also said that he \u201chad no doubt that [Decedent] understood what he was doing.\u201d Knowing the contents of the 2007 Living Trust or the circumstances of its execution would not have influenced the trial court in applying this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Nor did Petitioner introduce any evidence to support the seventh <em>Moore </em>factor: \u201cthe testator was highly susceptible to the undue influence.\u201d Illness alone is not sufficient to support this factor. In response to Petitioner\u2019s question, Joseph Pesce answered that Decedent \u201cwas still cantankerous and bossy and opinionated, like he always was.\u201d Petitioner chose not to testify, and offered no evidence that Decedent was \u201chighly susceptible to undue influence.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s evidence on this point falls short.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">To be sure, Respondent and the Decedent may have been in a confidential relationship (factor one) and Respondent may have had an opportunity to exert influence over him (factor four). But, as explained above, under these circumstances, we are confident that even with the presence of these two factors, the trial court would not have ruled differently on the issue of undue influence had it known the exact terms of the trust modification. Petitioner, therefore, is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In sum, the testamentary exception to the attorney-client privilege is alive and well in Maryland. With its refusal to recognize that exception, the trial court erred by failing to require that Downs produce the 2007 Living Trust. Yet, Petitioner has the burden to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s error was prejudicial. <em>Barksdale, </em>419 Md. at 657, 20 A.3d at 769-70. We have carefully considered the test for mental competency, and the seven-factor <em>Moore </em>test for undue influence, to determine whether, <em>had </em>the trial judge considered the terms of the 2007 Living Trust, it might have changed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ruling on either competency or undue influence. After due consideration, we conclude that admission into evidence of the 2007 Living Trust, or evidence relating to its execution, would not have persuaded the trial court to rule any differently. Accordingly, we hold that Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">In her brief, Petitioner requests:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">[T]hat this Court find that the trial court erred in excluding as [ajttorney-client [p]rivileged, the production and all questioning surrounding various [djocuments including the November 20, 2007 Original Trust document, to the Petitioner, as an entitled beneficiary under the testamentary exception, and Remand the case back to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a [n]ew [t]rial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">For the above reasons, we decline to grant this relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
