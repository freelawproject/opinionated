Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed.2009). Maryland recognizes two types of receiverships; a chancery receivership, the receivership which was developed in the chancery courts and which became part of our common law, as well as a statutory receivership that is \u201cpurely the creature! ] of statutes and without which statutes no receiver could be appointed ....\u201d Ralph E. Clarke, <em>A Treatise on the Law and Practice of Receivers </em>22 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Prior to 1868,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> only \u201cequitable\u201d or \u201cchancery\u201d receiverships existed or those that had their genesis in the chancery courts of England.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clarke, <em>supra, </em>at 6, 18. As initially created by the English chancery courts, the appointment of a receiver was a \u201cremedy\u201d designed to protect property that was subject to a claim between two parties from being dissipated, because injunctive relief had not proven to be effective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The chancery court would appoint a \u201creceiver,\u201d who would act as an officer of the court and take possession or custody of the property to preserve it for the person or entity to which it was entitled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The first reported Maryland opinion to substantially discuss the law of receiverships, <em>Williamson v. Wilson, </em>1 Bland 418 (Md.Ch.1826), an opinion by the High Court of Chancery of Maryland,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> traced the roots of the power to appoint a receiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>back to the chancery courts of England. The authority to appoint a receiver in Maryland, therefore, was derived as part of Maryland\u2019s adoption of the English common law in existence in 1639.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such authority, apparently, had become \u201cquestionable\u201d in the time period between the adoption of the English common law and the High Court of Chancery\u2019s opinion in <em>Williamson. See id. </em>at 420. The Chancery Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Williamson, </em>however, put to rest any such doubts and was explicit that the appointment of a receiver was a power that inhered to equity courts in Maryland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">That this Court should have the power in unusual and pressing emergencies, at the instance of a party interested, effectually and without delay to put its hand upon property, so far as to prevent waste, inextricable confusion, or total destruction, seems to be admitted by all to be clearly right, or at least highly beneficial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Although the law applicable to receiverships continued to develop in the High Court of Chancery, this Court first had occasion to seminally explicate and apply the law applicable to the appointment of a receiver in <em>Blondheim v. Moore, </em>11 Md. 365 (1857). In <em>Blondheim, </em>Moore sued Blondheim, alleging that Blondheim was heavily indebted and insolvent and that Blondheim had made a number of conveyances intended to delay and defraud his creditors. The complaint sought to set aside the allegedly fraudulent conveyances and also sought the appointment of a receiver. The circuit court appointed a receiver, and in considering the propriety of that decision, this Court looked to the \u201cleading decisions\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the chancery court, \u201cwherein the doctrine applicable to the appointment of a receiver\u201d was \u201cclearly laid down\u201d and derived the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">1st. That the power of appointment is a delicate one, and to be exercised with great circumspection. 2nd. That it must appear the claimant has a title to the property, and the court must be satisfied by affidavit, that a receiver is necessary to preserve the property. 3rd. That there is no case in which the court appoints a receiver merely because the measure can do no harm. 4th. That \u201cfraud or imminent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>danger, if the intermediate possession should not be taken by the court, must be clearly proved;\u201d and 5thly. That unless the necessity be of the most stringent character, the court will not appoint until the defendant is first heard in response to the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 374. We determined, ultimately, that there were insufficient allegations of fraud to justify the appointment of a receiver and, thus, reversed the order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Since <em>Moore, </em>chancery receivers have been appointed in a myriad of situations, including partnership disputes, <em>Lust v. Kolbe, </em>31 Md.App. 483, 356 A.2d 592 (1976), to collect rents and profits in a dispute between a mortgagor and a mortgagee, <em>Baker v. Baker, </em>108 Md. 269, 70 A. 418 (1908), and even to preserve disputed properties in a divorce proceeding, <em>Greenpoint v. Schlossberg, </em>390 Md. 211, 216, 888 A.2d 297, 300 (2005). Despite its diverse application, however, consistent with our pronouncement in <em>Blondheim, </em>the appointment of a chancery receiver has been limited to \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances, <em>Lipskey v. Voloshen, </em>155 Md. 139, 144, 141 A. 402, 404 (1928), in which \u201cthere is fraud, danger of spoliation, or imminent prospect of loss or injury to property.\u201d <em>Del-Mar-Va Hardware Corp. v. Boss Mfg. Co., </em>230 Md. 477, 480, 187 A.2d 693, 694 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The legislative creation of the corporation posed a unique problem for courts in establishing receiverships, because a chancery or equity court could not dissolve a corporation absent statutory authority. <em>Mason v. Supreme Court of Equitable League, </em>77 Md. 483, 484, 27 A. 171, 171 (1893); <em>see also </em>Clark, <em>supra, </em>at 236 (observing that a corporation \u201cis created by the legislature and a court of equity without direct power by statute from the legislature has no power to wind up or dissolve that which the legislature has created.\u201d). As we explained in <em>Mason, </em>the appointment of a receiver by a court would effectively result in dissolution of the corporation, thereby accomplishing indirectly what a judge had no direct authority to do:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Apart from statutory power, a Court of equity cannot dissolve a corporation. \u201cIt is true,\u201d says Mr. <em>High </em>in his book on <em>Receivers, </em>(section 288,) \u201cequity may properly compel officers of corporations to account for any breach of trust in their official capacity; yet, in the absence of statutes extending its jurisdiction, it will usually decline to assume control over the management of the affairs of a corporation upon a bill * * * * alleging fraud, mismanagement, and collusion on the part of the corporate authorities, since such interference would necessarily result in the dissolution of the corporation, and the Court would thus accomplish indirectly what it has no power to do directly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">\u201cThe remedial power exercised by Courts of equity, in such cases, ordinarily extends no further than the granting of an injunction against any special misconduct on the part of the corporate officers; and, although the facts shown may be sufficient foundation for such an injunction, the Court will not enlarge its jurisdiction by taking the affairs of the corporation out of the management of its own officers, and placing them in the hands of a receiver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Mason, </em>77 Md. at 484-85, 27 A. at 171; <em>see also Harford Agr. &amp; Breeders\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Somerville, </em>120 Md. 572, 87 A. 937, 940 (1913); <em>Barton v. Fraternal Alliance, </em>85 Md. 14, 36 A. 658 (1897).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The Legislature did, however, empower courts to dissolve corporations and appoint receivers with the enactment of Section 189 of Chapter 471 of the Maryland Laws of 1868, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">That if the court shall upon consideration of the bill, or of the bill, answers and proof, if any answers have been filed or proof taken, be of opinion that the corporation is insolvent, or that for any reason a dissolution of the said corporation will be beneficial to the stockholders, and not injurious to the public interests, a decree shall be entered dissolving the said corporation, and appointing one or more receivers of estate and effects, and such corporation shall thereupon be dissolved; any of the Directors, Trustees, Managers or other officers, or any of the stockholders of any corporation, may be appointed its receivers, or such other person or persons as the courts may select.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Section 8-411 of the Corporations and Associations Article, Maryland Code (1975, 2007 RepLVol.), now provides for the appointment of a receiver when a corporation chooses to voluntarily dissolve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">(a) <em>Who may file petition. </em>\u2014 A director, stockholder, or creditor of a Maryland corporation which is dissolving voluntarily may petition a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the liquidation of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(b) <em>Power of court. </em>\u2014 After notice and hearing, the court for good cause shown may order the corporation liquidated under court supervision either by the directors or by one or more receivers appointed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>(c) <em>Effect of appointment of receiver. </em>\u2014 The authority of the directors terminates when a court appoints a receiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvK\">Similarly, Section 3-414 of the Corporations and Associations Article<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> permits the Circuit Court to appoint a receiver to, <em>inter alia, </em>dissolve and wind down the affairs of the corporation, should a petition be filed for involuntary dissolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\">(b) <em>Action by court. </em>\u2014 In a proceeding for the involuntary dissolution of a corporation, after notice and hearing, the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">(2) Shall determine whether the corporation should be dissolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">(c) <em>Order of dissolution. </em>\u2014 If it appears that the corporation should be dissolved, the court shall enter a final order dissolving the corporation, and direct that it be liquidated under court supervision by one or more receivers appointed by it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(d) <em>Powers of receiver or trustee. </em>\u2014 A receiver, temporary receiver, or trustee has all the powers of a receiver provided in this subtitle and any other powers provided in the order of the court, including the power to continue the corporate business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Receivers appointed pursuant to statutory authority to wind up the affairs of a corporation after dissolution, originally referred to as \u201cliquidators\u201d in England, are considered \u201cstatutory receivers\u201d, because their appointment exceeds that which generally was permitted in equity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(m) Statutory Receivers, as distinguished from equitable receivers, are those who are purely the creatures of statutes and without which statutes no receiver could be appointed, even by a chancery court or court having general chancery jurisdiction. The only true statutory receivers are liquidators, as the term is used in England, who are given power by the laws of England and by the laws of our own states, to wind up a corporation after it has been dissolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Clarke, <em>supra, </em>at 22; <em>see also Del-Mar-Va Hardware Corp., </em>230 Md. at 480, 187 A.2d at 694 (referring to the involuntary dissolution statute providing \u201cstatutory power to an equity court \u2014 which otherwise it would lack \u2014 to dissolve a corporation and thereafter appoint a receiver\u201d); <em>Ghingher v. Pearson, </em>165 Md. 273, 295, 168 A. 105, 113 (1933) (observing the \u201ccreation of a statutory receivership for the liquidation of the affairs of an insolvent corporation and its dissolution as a corporation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Since the inception of the statutory receivership, we have recognized the co-existence of chancery and statutory receiverships. In <em>Del-Mar-Va Hardware Corp., </em>creditors of the Del-Mar-Va Hardware Corporation filed a complaint against the corporation seeking the appointment of a receiver pursuant to the predecessor statute to Section 3-114 of the Corporations and Associations Article, that being Article 23, Section 80 of the Maryland Code (1957),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which permitted a stock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>holder or creditor of an insolvent corporation to petition a court for involuntary dissolution and the appointment of a receiver. The trial court had appointed a receiver; we reversed, determining that the appointment was \u201clegally unjustified.\u201d <em>Del-Mar-Va Hardware Corp., </em>230 Md. at 479, 187 A.2d at 694. We first determined that the receivership was not statutorily authorized, because there had been no proof of insolvency. We then opined that the trial court had not acted pursuant to its statutory authority to appoint a receiver, but rather, \u201cits inherent power to appoint a receiver where there is fraud, danger of spoliation, or imminent prospect of loss or injury to property\u201d and concluded that, the general creditors, who had brought the action lacked standing to seek the appointment of a receiver. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 187 A.2d at 694; <em>see also First Fed. Com. Trust Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Sec., </em>272 Md. 329, 335, 322 A.2d 539, 543 (1974) (observing the \u201ccircuit court\u2019s inherent <em>or </em>statutory power sitting in equity to issue an injunction or to decree the appointment of a receiver for an insolvent corporation\u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Although these types of receiverships continue to coexist, a statutory receivership does differ from a chancery receivership. A chancery receivership is ancillary to a dispute between two parties, which may or may not involve a corporate entity, and is entered to preserve the disputed property, <em>Tatelbaum v. Pantex Mfg. Corp., </em>204 Md. 360, 372, 104 A.2d 813, 820 (1954), whereas when a petition for voluntarily dissolution is filed under the statute, no dispute necessarily exists. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1975, 2007 RepLVol.), Section 3-411 of the Corporations and Associations Article. While chancery receivers are generally appointed by a court only in \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d including fraud or imminent loss of property, a corporation may petition for voluntary dissolution and the appointment of a receiver by a resolution of its board of directors and a two-thirds vote of the shareholders, absent any allegations of wrongdoing. Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 3-403 of the Corporations and Associations Article.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>It is against this backdrop that we consider the appealability of an order denying a motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver on the grounds that the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Trans Healthcare, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Sparks, Maryland filed on January 7, 2009 an \u201cEmergency Voluntary Petition for Appointment of Receiver\u201d pursuant to Section 3-411 of the Corporations and Associations Article and Title 13 of the Maryland Rules in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The emergency petition requested the entry of an order appointing Michael Sandnes as well as his firm, Executive Sounding Board Associates, Inc., as receivers over Trans Healthcare and 43-related entities.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Petition alleged that Mr. Sand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>nes was qualified to serve as a receiver, because he had \u201cextensive experience in both the health care industry and serving as crisis manager and advisor to insolvent entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aaqa\">The purpose of the receivership, Trans Healthcare alleged, would be to \u201cwind up their affairs and dissolve their corporations and limited liability companies\u201d and its basis for the appointment of a receiver and dissolution was Trans Healthcare\u2019s poor financial situation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, it alleged that \u201cthe appointment of Mr. Sandnes as receiver would be the most cost-effective method of preserving the value of the THI Entities\u2019 assets ... and maximizing the return to the THI Entities\u2019 creditors.\u201d Each of the boards of directors for the THI entities had \u201cadopted resolutions authorizing each THI Entity\u201d to join in the petition seeking the appointment of a receiver and dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">An \u201cOrder Appointing Receiver,\u201d was entered on January 9, 2009 in which certain actions involving the Trans Healthcare entities were stayed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">2.

Pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent equitable authority, the receiver argued that the circuit court had jurisdiction to appoint a receiver over the out-of-state entities, because \u201call of the entities\u2019 assets and operations were located and based in Maryland.\u201d The receiver asserted, moreover, that it would be \u201cgrossly unfair, prejudicial and inequitable to the creditors of the THI Entities, the THI Entities and this Court to declare the Receivership Order void and require that all transactions and actions taken in reliance on the Receivership Order be undone,\u201d because \u201c[f]or well over two years, the Movant sat idly by as the Receiver .... dissolved all 43 of THI\u2019s subsidiaries, settled hundreds of Medicare and Medicaid cost reports in Maryland and Ohio, collected nearly all of the THI Entities\u2019 accounts receivable, liquidated the estate\u2019s operating assets, paid administrative claims and wound down the THI Entities\u2019 business affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Judge Vicki Ballou-Watts of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County held a hearing on the motion and, ultimately, determined that the court had authority to appoint a receiver pursuant to the \u201cgeneral equitable power of the court to take charge of the estate,\u201d in an order providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">Section 3-418 of the Md Code Annotated Corporations and Associations Article, provides that \u201ca director, stakeholder or creditor of a <em>Maryland Corporation </em>which is dissolving voluntarily may petition a court of equity to take jurisdiction of the liquidation of the corporation.\u201d Trans Healthcare, Incorporated was incorporated in Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">However, the introductory paragraph of the Order Appointing Receiver and successive paragraphs numbered one (1) and two (2) are silent with respect to whether the receiver was appointed pursuant to Section 3-418 \u2014 which would have been in error \u2014 or, in the alternative, pursuant to <em>Maryland Rule </em>13-102(a)(2). Although paragraph three (3) of the Order cites Section 3-418 when identifying the receiver\u2019s powers, the court had authority to appoint a receiver under the aforementioned <em>Maryland Rule. </em>This authority is consistent with the general equitable power of the court to take charge of an estate and thus grant the same powers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and authority listed in paragraph three (3) of the Order.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] The fact that the wrong statute was cited in listing the powers and authority of the receiver under paragraph three (3) does not affect the court\u2019s authority to grant the requested relief nor does the wrong citation render the receiver\u2019s powers invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">The Court of Appeals has upheld the court\u2019s authority to appoint a receiver pursuant to equitable subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See First Federal [Federated </em>] <em>Commodity Trust Corp. v. Comm\u2019r of Sec., </em>272 Md. 329 [322 A.2d 539] (Md.1974). In addition, the Court has upheld the appointment of a receiver, even when the court lacked statutory basis. <em>See id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Ms. Spivery-Jones, thereafter, noted an appeal from the order denying her motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The receiver, however, moved to dismiss the appeal, alleging that the order denying her motion to vacate was not a final appealable judgment and was not appealable pursuant to Section 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which authorizes the appeal of certain interlocutory orders, including an order appointing a receiver. Ms. Spivery-Jones disagreed, contending that the appeal was from an order appointing a receiver, and alternatively, was appealable under the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, dismissed the appeal, reasoning that the order denying the motion to vacate the receivership was not a final judgment under Section 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> nor was it appealable under Section 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or under the collateral order doctrine. After disposing of the appeal under the final judgment rule, because the court concluded that an order challenging the subject matter jurisdiction of a court is not appealable, the Court of Special Appeals held that Section 12-303 did not authorize an appeal, because Ms. Spivery-Jones was not appealing from an order appointing a receiver, but rather, was appealing from the denial ,of a motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">CJP \u00a7 12-303(3)(iv) ... authorizes an interlocutory appeal of an order \u201c[a]ppointing a receiver but only if the appellant has first filed his answer in the cause.\u201d .... But Ms. Spivery-Jones is not appealing from an order appointing a receiver; she is appealing from the denial of the motion to vacate the appointment of a receiver. If Ms. Spivery-Jones had desired to pursue an appeal under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>exception provided in CJP \u00a7 12-803(3)(iv), she would have had to appeal from the January 9, 2009, order appointing the receiver or the July 28, 2010, order appointing a substitute receiver. She did not note an appeal within 30 days of either of these two orders appointing a receiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The Court of Special Appeals then determined that there is no right of appeal from an order refusing to rescind the appointment of a receiver, citing our decision in <em>Hull v. Caughy, </em>66 Md. 104, 6 A. 591 (1886). The intermediate appellate court also determined that the order denying the motion to vacate was not an appealable collateral order, reasoning that the order was not effectively unreviewable on appeal because an appellate court is capable of reviewing subject-matter jurisdiction at the time the receivership is terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Ms. Spivery-Jones filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted, to consider the following questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals wrongly deny Ms. Jones\u2019 appeal rights granted pursuant to CJP \u00a7 12-303(3)(iv) from a Circuit Court order which converted the receivership from a statutory to an equitable receivership?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">2. Should the Court of Special Appeals have applied the collateral order doctrine to Ms. Jones\u2019 appeal of the Circuit Court order when all of the receivership estate\u2019s assets will be distributed and/or dissipated by the time a final judgment is entered and resolution of Ms. Jones\u2019 substantive arguments will conclusively deteimine the propriety of the receivership?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\"><em>Spivery-Jones v.

The collateral order doctrine is a \u201cvery narrow exception\u201d to the final judgment rule, which \u201ctreats as final and appealable a limited class of orders which do not terminate the litigation in the trial court.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Baltimore Police, </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115, 118 (2003) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Under this doctrine, a party may appeal from an order if the order being appealed satisfies four criteria: \u201c(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) it must resolve an important issue; (3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Addison, </em>411 Md. at 284-85, 983 A.2d at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Determining whether the order denying Ms. SpiveryJones\u2019s motion to vacate the receivership is an interlocutory order and appealable under Section 12-303(3)(iv) is our first endeavor, which, necessarily, requires us to ascertain whether it is an order \u201cappointing a receiver.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> There was an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>appointing a receiver when Mr. Sandnes was appointed a receiver. The order appointing Mr. Grochal as a substitute receiver may also have been appealable by Ms. Spivery-Jones as an appointment of a receiver, although case law from other jurisdictions suggests otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Parker v. Farish, </em>241 Ala. 127, 1 So.2d 596, 599 (1941). In any event, Ms. Spivery-Jones did not note an appeal from either of those orders. Rather, she suggests that the denial of her motion to vacate the receivership equals an appointment of a receiver because the receivership, she alleges, was converted from a statutory receivership to a chancery receivership. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The order denying the motion to vacate the receivership, rather, was not appealable, pursuant to Section 12-303(3)(iv) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>under a plain meaning analysis of the statutory language. Section 12 \u2014 303(3)(iv) authorizes an appeal from an order \u201c[a]p-pointing a receiver but only if the appellant has first filed his answer in the cause.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The word \u201cappoint\u201d involves the act of designating a person or entity to act in a particular capacity. Webster\u2019s Dictionary, for example, defines \u201cappoint\u201d as to \u201cname to fill an office or position.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 55 (1999). The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, likewise, defines \u201cappoint\u201d as \u201cto name or assign to a position, an office, or the like; designate.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 102 (2d ed.1987). We also have had occasion to define what the word \u201cappoint\u201d means in the context of determining whether a trustee was appointed by the court in <em>Corbett v. Hospelhorn, </em>172 Md. 257, 191 A. 691 (1937), in which we opined that the \u201caccepted\u201d and ordinary meaning of \u201cappoint\u201d is \u201cto designate some person to occupy an office or perform some function.\u201d <em>Corbett, </em>172 Md. at 257, 191 A. at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Applying the accepted meaning of appoint in the present case compels the conclusion that the order in which Mr. Sandnes was appointed a receiver, from which Ms. SpiveryJones did not take an appeal, was the order from which an appeal was authorized. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the order denying the motion to vacate the receivership altered the receivership from a statutory to a chancery receivership,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>it did not equate to an order appointing a receiver under Section 12-303(3)(iv); it did not designate any person or entity to take control of the Trans Healthcare entities. In so concluding, we find succor in our long-standing jurisprudence in which we have opined that orders denying motions to rescind previous appointments of a receiver are not appealable interlocutory orders.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>See Monumental Ins. Co. v. Wilkinson, </em>100 Md. 31, 32, 59 A. 125, 126 (1904) (\u201cThe appeal in this case was taken from two orders of Circuit Court No. 2, of Baltimore City, the first of which appointed receivers of the assets of the defendant corporation and the second refused to rescind their appointment. No appeal lies from the order refusing to rescind the appointment.\u201d); <em>Hull v. Caughy, </em>66 Md. 104, 105, 6 A. 591, 591 (1886) (\u201c[Wjhile an appeal is given from an order appointing a receiver, no appeal is given from an order refusing to rescind the appointment, or to discharge the receiver.\u201d) Section 12-303(3)(iv), then, does not permit an appeal in this case.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Whether the order denying the motion to vacate the receivership was an appealable collateral order at common law is our next inquiry. For an order to be appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine, it must satisfy four criteria: \u201c(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question; (2) it must resolve an important issue; (3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u201d <em>Addison v.

In <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission v.

The reality of a receivership in Maryland, whether chancery or statutory, however, is that under our Rules, she will have an opportunity to challenge the appropriateness of any complete or partial distribution plan and have that decision reviewed on appeal, should one be appropriately noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Under Rules 13-501 through 13-503, the receiver is required to file an accounting with the court detailing any proposed complete or partial distribution plan, which the court must refer to an auditor before approving any distribution. All creditors who have filed a claim in the receivership proceedings receive notice of the audit and may file exceptions to the accounting, Rule 13-502(c); Rule 2 \u2014 543(g), which would be renewable on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Cohill v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Canal Co., </em>177 Md. 412, 424, 10 A.2d 316, 322 (1939); <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co. v.

Peat, </em>284 Md. at 95, 394 A.2d at 806 (rejecting Petitioner\u2019s, Peat &amp; Co.\u2019s, argument that review of an order denying its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>motion to disqualify counsel is unreviewable upon appeal because the Petitioner must bear the costs of trial, concluding that, \u201csuch a burden does not present a better case for the effective unreviewability of an order denying disqualification than could be made for all interlocutory orders.\u201d). To permit an appeal based on the collateral order doctrine solely because administrative and legal fees will be expended in the litigation would eviscerate existing limitations on appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Because Ms. Spivery-Jones has no right of appeal pursuant to Section 12 \u2014 303(3)(iv) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article or under the collateral order doctrine, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The fact that the wrong statute was cited in listing the powers and authority of the receiver under paragraph three (3) does not affect the court\u2019s authority to grant the requested relief nor does the wrong citation render the receiver\u2019s powers invalid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">The Circuit Court had authority to grant THI Entities\u2019 Emergency Voluntary Petition for Appointment of Receiver pursuant to <em>Maryland Rule </em>13-102(a)(2) which was cited in the Emergency Voluntary Petition filed on January 7, 2009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">.

Dudley, </em>662 F.3d 284 (4th Cir.2011), to support her contention that the order denying the motion to vacate is an appealable collateral order. <em>McDow, </em>however, is a bankruptcy case in which the Fourth Circuit did not apply the collateral order doctrine, but rather determined that an order denying a United States Trustee\u2019s motion to dismiss a bankruptcy case was appealable under Section 707 of Title 11 of the United States Code, which authorizes appeals from \"final orders\u201d of the bankruptcy court to the United States District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
