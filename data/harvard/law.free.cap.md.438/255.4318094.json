Both cases origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>nated in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore City. The plaintiffs filed small claim actions for money damages and demanded judgment on affidavit at the time of filing the complaint commencing the actions. Md. Rule 3-306 (\u201cJudgment on Affidavit\u201d); Md. Rule 3-701 (\u201cSmall Claim Actions\u201d). The defendants filed timely notices of intention to defend, pursuant to Md. Rule 3-307. Rule 3-306, which addresses judgments on affidavit, was amended in 2011 to include special provisions related to cases involving assigned consumer debt (\u201cdebt buyer cases\u201d). <em>See </em>One Hundred Seventy-First Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, 6-9 (July 1, 2011). Rule 3-307(e) requires that a defendant file a timely notice of intention to defend to avoid, on the date set for trial, the court\u2019s determination of liability and assessment of damages based on the plaintiffs ex parte proof. In other words, timely filing of a notice of intention to defend entitles the defendant to a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The intersection between Rules 3-306 and 3-701 involves two competing interests. First, Rule 3-306, as amended in 2011, is designed to raise the bar for plaintiff debt buyers who desire to obtain a judgment on affidavit by requiring them to establish a prima facie case on the basis of evidence that would satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule. For example, if the consumer debt is an unpaid credit card balance, the plaintiffs evidence must show that the plaintiff owns the debt sued upon and that the defendant debtor owes that debt. Second, small claim actions, by definition, shall be \u201cinformal\u201d and the rules of evidence are not applicable to these proceedings, in order to enable all parties to adequately participate in the proceedings without the benefit of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>With these principles in mind, we address the following questions:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">1. Does the evidentiary standard under Md. Rule 3 \u2014 806(d), which contemplates that the documents submitted to support a judgment on affidavit pass muster under the business records exception, apply to a contested small claim proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">2. Did the trial courts abuse their discretion when they considered business records and hearsay evidence in entering judgment for the plaintiffs in the present cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">3. Did the trial courts commit clear error when they found in favor of the Plaintiffs in the present cases?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We shall hold that in pursuing a judgment on affidavit, involving a small or large claim, a debt buyer plaintiff must produce certain documents, as contemplated by Rule 3 \u2014 306(d), sufficient to pass muster under the business records exception. Once a small claim action is contested and proceeds to a trial on the merits, the parties are not constrained by the Rules of Evidence, as contemplated by Rule 3-701.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Generally, in debt buyer cases, the debts sued upon arise from consumer credit, such as credit card accounts and other unsecured debts. In the typical debt buying situation, a debtor has an account with a large bank or credit card company (the \u201coriginal creditor\u201d), and at some point the debtor ceases to make payments on the account. Although the original creditor may intend to collect on the delinquent account, in cases where the amount owed is relatively small or unlikely to be paid without collection efforts, the original creditor may \u201ccharge off\u2019<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that account. In other words, the original creditor may not desire to prosecute a claim against the debtor because it deems the debt \u201cuncollectible.\u201d A \u201cdebt buyer\u201d can buy these \u201ccharged-off\u2019 debts from the original creditor at a low price, often mere pennies on the dollar, and often in bulk, and then go about collecting the account balance from the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In Maryland, many debt buyers file their collection actions in the District Court, seeking a judgment on affidavit pursuant to Rule 3-306. According to one study, in 99% of debt collection cases surveyed, the debt buyer plaintiff obtained a judgment against a defendant debtor without a trial. <em>See </em>Peter A. Holland, <em>Junk Justice: A Statistical Analysis of U,JJ)0 Lawsuits Filed by Debt Buyers, </em>26 Loy. Consumer L.Rev. 179, 187 (2014). Similar studies have found that many debt buyer plaintiffs lack adequate proof and obtain improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>uncontested judgments as a result, leading to calls for substantial debt collection reform in the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S. Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, <em>Repairing a Broken System: Protecting Consumers in Litigation and Arbitration </em>(2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">In response to this growing problem, in 2011, this Court\u2019s Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (\u201cthe Rules Committee\u201d) proposed amendments to Rule 3-306, to become effective January 1, 2012. The Rules Committee\u2019s 171st Report explained that \u201c[t]hese amendments [to Rule 3-306 were] designed to address a problem that has received national attention ..., namely, the flood of thousands of judgment by affidavit cases filed-in the District Court by companies that purchase, usually in bulk and with little supporting documentation, consumer debt that has been charged off by the original creditor.\u201d Specifically, the Rules Committee explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">The major thrust of the proposed amendments is in a new section (d), which deals specifically with claims arising from assigned consumer debt. With respect to those claims, (1) the affidavit must contain averments or be accompanied by documents that (i) more adequately establish the existence and identification of the debt and the plaintiffs ownership of the debt and (ii) provide specific information if the account was charged off, other information if the account was not charged off, particular information if the claim is based on a future services contract, and information regarding the licensure of the plaintiff debt buyer, and (2) subject to an exception, if there was a document evidencing the terms and conditions to which the consumer debt was subject, a certified or authenticated copy of that document must be attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Accordingly, the Rule as amended was intended to raise the requirements for debt buyer plaintiffs to prove their claim before the trial judge grants a judgment on affidavit. It is this Rule and subsequent amendment, adopted by the Court, that is the primary subject of the instant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">A. <em>Bartlett v. Portfolio Recovery Associates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Respondent Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC (\u201cPRA\u201d) filed a small claim action in the District Court, sitting in Baltimore City, on October 3, 2012, to recover $2,897.88 against Petitioner Rainford G. Bartlett (\u201cBartlett\u201d), arising originally from a delinquent credit card account with Chase Bank USA, N.A. (\u201cChase\u201d). Bartlett\u2019s account became delinquent after he failed to make monthly payments or honor special payment arrangements offered to him by Chase. Bartlett\u2019s purchases on his Chase credit card were in excess of the $2500 limit by January 2009, at which time a 90 day payment delinquency notice was mailed to his home as part of his monthly credit card statement. From February to October 2009, Bartlett made several $40 monthly payments to Chase under a special payment program. After Bartlett\u2019s failure to make any payments after October 2009, Chase charged-off Bartlett\u2019s account. In June 2011, PRA purchased Bartlett\u2019s delinquent account as part of a package of debts sold directly to it by Chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Along with its complaint, PRA filed a form affidavit and Assigned Consumer Debt Checklist, and attached three exhibits. Exhibit One was entitled \u201cProof of Existence of the Debt or Account, Rule 3-306(d)(l),\u201d and consisted of Chase monthly credit card account statements bearing Bartlett\u2019s name, address, and original account number that reflected credit card charges, payments, finance charges and late fee charges on the account. Exhibit Two was entitled \u201cProof of the Plaintiffs Ownership, Rule 3-306(d)(3)\u201d and consisted of a copy of the Bill of Sale memorializing the June 28, 2011 sale of delinquent accounts from Chase to PRA and an excerpt from the Final Data File referenced in the Bill of Sale and printed from the electronic records PRA received from Chase when it purchased Bartlett\u2019s account. Exhibit Three was titled \u201cAccount Charge Off Information, Rule 3-306(d)[ (6) ]\u201d and consisted of PRA\u2019s Statement of Account and Interest Worksheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Subsequently, Bartlett filed a notice of intention to defend, and following a District Court trial on the merits, judgment was entered in favor of PRA. Bartlett filed a timely notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 7-112, and his appeal was heard <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on April 24, 2013. Prior to the commencement of trial on the merits in that court, the following colloquy, relevant to this appeal, took place between Bartlett\u2019s counsel and the trial judge concerning the applicability of the Rules of Evidence and Md. Rule 3-306 to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">[Trial Judge]: Is this a small claim action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: Yes, Your Honor, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">[Trial Judge]: So, the Rules of Evidence don\u2019t apply, do they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: Well, we have a different view of that, Your Honor. All of the Rules of Evidence may not apply, except for the basic rule of competency. And competency, at its heart, requires evidence that\u2019s reliable, and can be supported by firsthand knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">[Trial Judge]: I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s anything goes [if the Rules of Evidence don\u2019t apply], but maybe there\u2019s an alternative here because the rules that were created earlier \u2014 I guess, last year \u2014 for affidavit judgments; one could say, even though they don\u2019t apply once we go to trial \u2014 perhaps furnish some guidelines as to what the Court of Appeals thought would be appropriate benchmarks or milestones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACM\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: You know, your Honor is absolutely right, and this is an argument we make all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">[Trial Judge]: Um-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: That at trial the standard of proof in a purchased debt account, can be no less than the standard of proof under 3-306, to obtain an Affidavit of Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">[Trial Judge]: [Having sat through all the rule making] proceedings, it\u2019s my recollection \u2014 and I apologize for taking up all this time \u2014 but you know part of the concern [of] the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Rules Committee, and I emphasize \u201cpart of the concern,\u201d but certainly, a major part of the concern was to establish a standard for judges to make these determinations on affidavit judgments because at that point, there\u2019s nobody opposing the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: The defendant is not present, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[Trial Judge]: Right. Now, here, the defendant is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Sp\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: And the standard can be no less\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfWy\">[Trial Judge]: Well, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: \u2014 for that very reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">[Trial Judge]: \u2014 don\u2019t know about that. I\u2019m saying, if the standard was adopted for the purpose of protecting someone who\u2019s not there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">[Petitioner\u2019s Counsel]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">[Trial Judge]: \u2014 maybe it doesn\u2019t apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">[Trial Judge]: I think what makes sense, is for me to hear all the testimony, and then assess what I think is reliable and probative. And I may be talking about admissibility at that point; I may be talking about weight at that point, but I think it will be faster if we do it that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Once the judge proceeded with trial, PRA offered into evidence all the attachments to the original complaint, as well as an Affidavit of Sale from Chase memorializing the sale of Bartlett\u2019s debt to PRA, as well as additional credit card statements from January 2009 to May 2010. David Sage, PRA\u2019s custodian of records, testified about the documents included as exhibits at trial, his knowledge of the business practices of PRA, that he was taught how Chase maintains their records, and the process by which PRA purchased the portfolio of delinquent accounts from Chase. Bartlett also testified at the merits trial, and confirmed that he had a Chase credit card and that he previously received monthly credit card statements at the mailing address reflected in the statements. He further indicated that he recalled receiving a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>letter from PRA stating that it now owned his Chase account and that he had to go to court for the money he owed Chase. Bartlett testified that at one time, the balance on his account was \u201c$2,800 and some dollars.\u201d Following the conclusion of the trial on the merits, the trial judge made his evidentiary rulings and entered judgment in favor of PRA, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">I think ultimately that the rule says that it depends upon the amount of the claim. And given the amount of the claim, that we\u2019re under 3-701____So ultimately, as I say, I am going to admit Plaintiffs Exhibits 1 and 2. And I have, as I say, scrutinized them and compared them to what Rule 3 \u2014 306(d) requires. And I don\u2019t have any question that the Plaintiff has proved by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of the account. The Chase records, and I\u2019ve determined that they are admissible, do reflect, in accordance with 3 \u2014 306(d)(1), the existence of the account and the balance. And as has been averted [sic] to, it is corroborated by Mr. Bartlett\u2019s candid testimony. And I appreciate his candor. That he did have an account with Chase, and they did send him statements, and the balance was something like what was claimed here today. The more difficult question, it seems to me, is the proof of Plaintiff\u2019s ownership. And I\u2019ve gone back and forth on this, but ultimately I conclude that the Bill of Sale does comply with 3-306(d)(3)____So, for those reasons, I find that the Plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to recover having proven both the existence of the debt and its ownership of the debt. And I will enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff for $2,789.18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Thereafter, Bartlett filed a petition for certiorari,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which this Court granted on July 3, 2013. <em>Bartlett v. Portfolio Recovery Assoc., </em>432 Md. 466, 69 A.3d 474 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>B. <em>Townsend v. Midland Funding, LLC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Respondent Midland Funding, LLC (\u201cMidland\u201d) filed a small claim action in the District Court, sitting in Baltimore City, on December 22, 2011,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to recover $1,905.21 plus interest against Petitioner James Townsend (\u201cTownsend\u201d), arising from an unpaid balance on a consumer credit account that Midland purchased from Chase. In support of its claims, Midland attached to its complaint the Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski, a legal specialist with access to the account records of Midland Credit Management, Inc., the account servicer for Midland, stating the amount of the debt owed by Townsend, that Midland is the owner of the debt, and that the account records are maintained in the regular course of business. In addition, Midland attached a copy of a redacted \u201cBill of Sale\u201d from Chase to Midland indicating that Midland purchased certain accounts from Chase, which included an express warranty as to the accuracy of the documents, but did not specify which accounts were transferred to Midland during this transaction. Midland also attached photocopies of credit card statements from Chase to Townsend, showing the balance due on the account, itemized transactions and previous payments made on the account, and Townsend\u2019s name and address.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Townsend was served with a copy of the complaint and filed a notice of intention to defend on January 23, 2012. A merits trial was to be held in the District Court on November 7, 2012. Counsel for both parties appeared at trial, however Townsend was not present. At trial in the District Court, Midland argued that judgment should be entered in favor of Midland based on the affidavit and supporting documents attached to the complaint, which it offered as evidence at trial. To the contrary, Townsend argued that the case should be dismissed because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Midland had provided insufficient identification of his account and the documents submitted by Respondent were inadmissible as evidence to prove its claim. The District Court judge issued an Opinion &amp; Order on January 16, 2013, granting judgment in favor of Midland. In its Opinion &amp; Order, the court determined that (1) the account statements were admissible because they were sufficiently authentic, based on the corporate logo and that they were issued to Townsend\u2019s address, and because Rule 3-306 contemplates the use of third party business records, <em>ie., </em>records from the original creditor; and (2) the affidavit plus the account statements from the original creditor established by a preponderance of the evidence that Townsend\u2019s account was transferred to Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Thereafter, Townsend filed a timely notice of appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City pursuant to Md. Rule 7-112. A <em>de novo </em>trial was held in the Circuit Court on May 2, 2013. Counsel for both parties appeared at the <em>de novo </em>trial, however Townsend did not appear and no witnesses were called at trial. Midland submitted as \u201cExhibit 1\u201d the documents attached to the original complaint. Townsend objected to the admission of the documents based on Rule 3-306, hearsay, and lack of personal knowledge. He further argued that because Rule 3-701 cross-references Rule 5-101, the rules regarding competency still apply even in small claims, and in this case Midland needed a competent witness to introduce documents, which it failed to do because the affiant lacked personal knowledge. Midland responded that the Rules of Evidence do not apply in this small claim case, and therefore the documents are admissible in evidence for the trial judge to consider. At the conclusion of counsel\u2019s arguments, the judge announced that the court would hold the matter <em>sub curia </em>and issue a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The Circuit Court filed its Order on May 15, 2013, entering judgment for Midland. In its Order, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">1. Pursuant to Md. Rules 3-701 and 7-112(d), the Maryland Rules of Evidence (Title 5) do not apply to these small claim proceedings. See Rule 5-101. This [cjourt has deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>mined to receive and consider the Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski (Plaintiffs Exhibit 1) pursuant to the instruction and guidance of Md. Rule 3-306.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">2. With the contents and attachments of [Midland]\u2019s Exhibit 1, over [Townsend]\u2019s objection(s), [Midland] has proven its claim by a preponderance of evidence. Specifically, the Affidavit conforms to the requirements of Md. Rule 3-306 in this \u201cdebt buyer\u201d case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">3. [Midland] was \u201cassigned all the rights, title and interest\u201d to [Townsend]\u2019s credit card account with Chase Bank. The account is a consumer debt account at issue as defined in Md. Rule 3-306(a)(3). [Midland] is not the \u201coriginal creditor\u201d but its claim arises from consumer debt (Rule 3-306(d)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">4. The Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski is expressly found to have established:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">a. The existence of [Townsend]\u2019s account and debt by certifying photocopies of several monthly statements showing payments on the account by [Townsend]. Rule 3-306(d)(l);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">b. The existence of an unpaid balance due on [Townsend]^ credit card account with Chase Bank in the amount of $1,905.21, without any claim for interest or fees. Rule 3-306(d)(2)(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">c. [Midland]\u2019s ownership of [Townsend]\u2019s consumer debt upon transfer of the ownership of that debt by the original creditor, Chase Bank, to [Midland], on June 30, 2011, according to the certified copy of the Bill of Sale attached to the Affidavit. Rule 3 \u2014 306(d)(3);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">d. The Ashley Lashinsky Affidavit (with account documents) properly includes: the name of the original creditor (Chase Bank); [Townsend]\u2019s full name as it appeared on the original credit card account; the last four digits of [Townsend]\u2019s social security number; the original account number; the nature of the credit card account; and the itemization of money claimed and payments credited from [Townsend]. Rules 3-306(d)(4), (d)(7)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Townsend thereafter filed a petition for certiorari with this Court, which we granted on August 14, 2013. <em>Townsend v. Midland Funding, </em>433 Md. 513, 72 A.3d 172 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">In the present cases, we discuss three standards of review. The three standards of review coincide with the three questions before this Court. Our first inquiry, whether the Rules of Evidence apply in debt buyer small claim proceedings, is a question of law. It is well established that pure conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. See Nesbit v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004); <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 92, 792 A.2d 288, 300 (2002). Accordingly, we shall review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether Md. Rule 3-306(d) requires documentary evidence to pass muster under the business records exception in a small claim proceeding once the case is contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Next, we review the Circuit Court judges\u2019 \u201cevidentiary rulings\u201d involving weighing the reliability and probative value of the evidence to determine its admissibility pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603, 616 (2005); <em>McCormack v.

Because, as we shall explain, the Rules of Evidence do not apply in a small claim proceeding, the admissibility of evidence in such circumstances is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Goodman v.

A trial court only \u201cabuses its discretion when it acts without reference to any guiding principles or rules of law or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the court.\u201d <em>Matoumba v. </em>State, 390 Md. 544, 552, 890 A.2d 288, 293 (2006); <em>Bern-Shaw Ltd.

We point out that \u201ca ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031-32 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Finally, we review the judgments of the trial courts for clear error. As stated in our rules, an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside a judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous[.]\u201d Md. Rule 8-131(c); <em>Marwani v.

Thurston, </em>276 Md. 390, 392, 347 A.2d 834, 835-36 (1975). Ultimately, we conclude that the judges conducting trials <em>de novo </em>in the present cases neither erred nor abused their discretion in entering judgment in favor of Respondents, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">A. Small Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Historically, the purpose of small claims courts is to provide greater access to justice for the public by allowing claims for small amounts of money to be litigated inexpensively and efficiently. <em>See </em>Eric H. Steele, <em>The Historical Context of Small Claims Courts, </em>6 Am. B. Found. Res. J. 293 (1981) (providing a broad historical background and analysis of small claims courts in the United States). To achieve this goal, small claim cases in Maryland proceed \u201cinformally.\u201d That is, \u201cthe rules of evidence and procedure in small claims cases are simplified to make it easier for individuals to represent themselves.\u201d Maryland Courts, <em>Small Claims: How to File a Small Claim in the District Court of Maryland, </em>http://www.courts.state.md.us/ district/forms/civil/dccvOOlbr.pdf (last visited April 1, 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">By statute, small claims are defined as claims for monetary judgments not exceeding $5,000, and are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the District Court. Md.Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 4-405 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Title 3 of the Maryland Rules governs civil procedure in District Court. Chapter 700 of Title 3 deals with \u201cspecial proceedings,\u201d which includes small claims. Specifically, Md. Rule 3-701 governs \u201cSmall Claim Actions.\u201d Rule 3-701(a) specifies and explains that \u201c[t]he rules of this Title apply to small claim actions, except as provided in this Rule.\u201d Nothing in Rule 3-701 exempts small claims from Rule 3-306 regarding judgments on affidavit, so the <em>procedures </em>outlined therein certainly apply in small claim actions as well as large claim actions. Conduct of trials for small claim actions is governed under subsection 3-701(f), however. It provides that \u201c[t]he court shall conduct the trial of a small claim action in an informal manner. Title 5 of these rules [ (Rules of Evidence) ] does not apply to proceedings under this Rule.\u201d Subsection (f) is plain and unambiguous: the rules of evidence do not apply to a trial in a small claim proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Under Md. Rule 7-112(d)(2), a judgment entered in the District Court is subject to an appeal to be heard <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court. Like a small claim action in the District Court, the <em>de novo </em>trial in the circuit court \u201cshall [be] conducted] ... in an informal manner, and Title 5 of these rules does not apply to the proceedings,\u201d Rule 7-112(d)(2), \u201cother than those [rules] relating to the competency of witnesses.\u201d Md. Rule 5 \u2014 101(b). Accordingly, the Rules of Evidence codified in Title 5 of the Maryland Rules, except for the rules of competency, do not apply to trial in small claim proceedings, either in the District Court or on <em>\u201cde novo </em>appeal\u201d in the circuit court, provided the claim does not exceed the jurisdictional amount of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">B. Judgment on Affidavit: Rule 3-306</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Maryland Rule 3-306 governs the procedure for judgment on affidavit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant to Rule 3-306, a plaintiff may file a demand for judgment on affidavit with the complaint, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>must provide an accompanying affidavit and supporting documents showing that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Sections (b) and (c) of Rule 3-306, as amended and recodified in 2011, codify the general requirements of the documents needed to support a demand for judgment on affidavit. Specifically, Rule 3 \u2014 306(b) provides that \u201c[i]n an action for money damages a plaintiff may file a demand for judgment on affidavit at the time of filing the complaint commencing the action. The complaint shall be supported by an affidavit showing that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in the amount claimed.\u201d Subsection (c) then outlines the general requirements for an affidavit and supporting documents, applicable to all types of cases, which must be submitted along with the complaint.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Goodman, </em>364 Md. at 489, 773 A.2d at 530 (stating that subsection (a), which is now codified as subsection (c), \u201cprescribes the pleading prerequisites\u201d for a judgment on affidavit).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Next, new subsection (e) provides the procedures for \u201csubsequent proceedings,\u201d and explains how the case will proceed if the action moves beyond the demand for judgment on affidavit stage. Whether the action proceeds beyond the purview of Rule 3-306 depends on how the defendant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>sponds. <em>See </em>Rule 3-306(e). This procedure was described in <em>Goodman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">The effect of the filing of, or the failure to file, a notice of intention to defend is the subject of [Rule 3-306(e) ]. Subsection [ (e)(1) ] requires the plaintiff to appear in court on the trial date prepared for a trial on the merits. It also prescribes what happens when the defendant fails to appear in court on the trial date, \u2018the court may proceed as if the defendant failed to file a timely notice of intention to defend.\u2019 When the defendant does not file a notice of intention to defend, subsection [ (e)(2) ] excuses the plaintiff from appearing for trial on the trial date, permits the court to determine liability and damages on the basis of the complaint, affidavit, and supporting documents and, if they are sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to judgment, requires the court to grant the demand for judgment on affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aivu\"><em>Goodman, </em>364 Md. at 489-90, 773 A.2d at 530-31 (footnote omitted). In other words, if the defendant fails to file a notice of intention to defend pursuant to Rule 3-307,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>evaluates the merits of the plaintiffs case based solely on the complaint, affidavit, and accompanying documents. The Rule also provides that the court may proceed as if no notice of intention to defend was filed if the defendant fails to appear at trial, despite filing a timely notice of intention to defend. <em>See </em>Rule 3-306(e)(l). Under those circumstances, then, if the trial judge is satisfied that the documents establish the merits of the plaintiffs claim and the defendant\u2019s liability, the judge may grant judgment on affidavit in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">On the other hand, if the defendant files a timely notice of intention to defend under Rule 3-307, he or she is entitled to a trial on the merits and Rule 3-306(e)(l) expressly requires the plaintiff to \u201cappear in court on the trial date prepared for a trial on the merits.\u201d The matter then proceeds to trial pursuant to the applicable rules. For small claim actions, the trial is conducted pursuant to Rule 3-701. As required by Rule 3 \u2014 701(f), \u201c[t]he court shall conduct the trial of a small claim in an informal manner[, and] Title 5 of these rules does not apply\u201d (except for the rules regarding competency of witnesses). Therefore, once the small claim action proceeds to trial, the parties are not constrained by the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\n<em>Rule 3-306 in Debt Buyer Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The 2011 amendment to Rule 3-306 added a special provision relating to debt buyer cases. <em>See </em>One Hundred Seventy-First Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and Procedure, 8 (July 1, 2011) (\u201cThe major thrust of the proposed amendments is in a new section (d), which deals specifically with claims arising from assigned consumer debt.\u201d). The new subsection (d) requires debt buyer plaintiffs to provide additional documents with its complaint and affidavit to satisfy the \u201cAssigned Consumer Debt Checklist.\u201d Rule 3-306(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">(d) If Claim Arises from Assigned Consumer Debt. If the claim arises from consumer debt and the plaintiff is not the original creditor, the affidavit also shall include or be accompanied by (i) the items listed in this section, and (ii) an Assigned Consumer Debt Checklist, substantially in the form prescribed by the Chief Judge of the District Court, listing the items and information supplied in or with the affidavit in conformance with this Rule. Each document that accompanies the affidavit shall be clearly numbered as an exhibit and referenced by number in the Checklist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">(1) Proof of the Existence of the Debt or Account. Proof of the existence of the debt or account shall be made by a certified or otherwise properly authenticated photocopy or original of at least one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">(A) a document signed by the defendant evidencing the debt or the opening of the account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">(B) a bill or other record reflecting purchases, payments, or other actual use of a credit card or account by the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">(C) an electronic printout or other documentation from the original creditor establishing the existence of the account and showing purchases, payments, or other actual use of a credit card or account by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In essence, subsection (d) provides \u201cheightened pleading and evidentiary requirements\u201d for the documents submitted in all assigned consumer debt cases. <em>See </em>Jan I. Berlage, Ronald S. Canter <em>&amp; </em>William M. Rudow, <em>Nuts and Bolts of Collection Law </em>65 (2012). In order to succeed by judgment on affidavit in a debt buyer case, the plaintiff must submit the documents required by the Rule. Specifically, the plaintiff must produce a \u201ccertified or otherwise properly authenticated photocopy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>original\u201d document proving the existence of the debt. Md. Rule 3-306(d). Based on the language of the Rule and a comment by Judge Wilner, Chairman of the Rules Committee, during this Court\u2019s adoption of the amendment to Rule 3-306, requiring a \u201ccertified or otherwise properly authenticated\u201d document means that those documents must satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Transcript of Rules Committee Meeting July 1, 2011, at 94-95 (\u201cWhat we mean by certified or authenticated copy, is what would pass muster under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d). As expressed in the Rules Committee\u2019s Report, the purpose of the 2011 amendment was to prevent debt buyers from obtaining a judgment without properly serving debtors and to make it more difficult for debt buyers to prove their case when it is uncontested, <em>ie., </em>when judgment on affidavit is the preferred procedure. Therefore, the amendment to Rule 3-306 not only set forth a heightened pleading requirement in that specific documents must now be presented in order for a debt buyer plaintiff to obtain a judgment on affidavit, but also in that those specific documents must pass muster under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">To be clear, Rule 3-306 is a rule of procedure, not a rule of evidence. In assigned consumer debt cases, subsections (b), (c), and (d) describe the burden on the plaintiff to prepare and submit the complaint, demand for judgment on affidavit, and required supporting documentation in order to be successful in obtaining a judgment on affidavit. As we have explained, the next step in the case depends on whether the defendant files a notice of intention to defend. <em>See </em>Rule 3-306(e). If the defendant fails to respond by filing a timely notice of intention to defend, or the defendant files a timely notice of intention to defend but fails to appear at trial,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the trial judge will evaluate the merits of the debt buyer plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>case based on the affidavit and accompanying documents under the purview of Rule 3-306(d). If the judge is satisfied that the plaintiff met its burden, the court may then grant judgment on affidavit in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">On the other hand, if the defendant files a notice of intention to defend and contests the case, the case proceeds to a trial on the merits. In a small claim action, as here, the trial proceeds pursuant to Rule 3-701. As required by Rule 3-701(f), the \u201ccourt shall conduct the trial of a small claim in an informal manner[, and] Title <em>5 of </em>these rules does not apply\u201d (except for the rules regarding competency of witnesses). Therefore, once the small claim action moves beyond the demand for judgment on affidavit stage, the plaintiff will have to present evidence at trial to prove that the defendant owes the debt to the plaintiff, but will not be constrained by the Rules of Evidence in doing so. This is true for all small claims, including a debt buyer case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, in a debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>buyer small claim action, once the case is contested, the plaintiff need not conform its proffer to the Rules of Evidence. Specifically, in this context, hearsay evidence need not pass muster under the business records exception in order to be admissible.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the pleading requirements of Rule 3-306(d) as they relate to the grant of a judgment on affidavit, the evidence must satisfy the trier of fact (in a small claim proceeding in District Court or in Circuit Court pursuant to a <em>de novo </em>appeal) that it possesses sufficient indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As we previously noted, the purpose of Rule 3-701\u2019s informality requirement is to make small claim actions accessible for all, whether represented by counsel or self-represented. To require otherwise would make it substantially more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>difficult for self-represented defendants to participate in debt buyer proceedings such as these. If we were to require that evidence introduced at a small claim merit trial must satisfy a hearsay exception, this would call for the unrepresented public to be familiar with, and apply, the Rules of Evidence. This would be in contradiction to the very purpose underlying small claim proceedings, <em>i.e., </em>that they be conducted in an informal manner to simplify the proceedings for self-represented parties. This Court should not draw a distinction in the contested small claims context between an institutional plaintiff and an unsophisticated defendant, and therefore, we will not require only one of the parties to introduce into evidence documents that satisfy the business records exception. Accordingly, the admissibility of evidence in a small claim action, including debt buyer cases, is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who is able to weigh, in an informal manner, the reliability and probative value of the evidence before him or her, as well as the arguments and defenses presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">V. MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In the instant cases, the defendants both filed a notice of intention to defend, and each case proceeded to a trial on the merits. Either the defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel appeared at the separate trials. The trial judges, respectively, rendered judgment after hearing arguments and accepting evidence on the merits. Thus, the prevailing plaintiffs did not obtain judgments on affidavit under Rule 3-306, but rather, prevailed under the procedural rules governing small claim actions (Rule 3-701 in District Court and Rule 7-112 in Circuit Court pursuant to a <em>de novo </em>appeal). Because the Rules of Evidence do not apply in the instant situations and because of the informal nature of a small claim proceeding, a trial court is tasked only with weighing the reliability and credibility of the evidence before it, and then considering such evidence on a discretionary basis when making its determination. <em>See Goodman, </em>364 Md. at 491, 773 A.2d at 531 (\u201cNecessarily, when there is no hard and fast rule governing the situation, in arriving at a decision, the trial judge must exercise his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>judicial discretion and the resulting decision is reviewed for the soundness and reasonableness with which the discretion was exercised.\u201d); <em>In re Billy </em>W., 387 Md. at 434, 875 A.2d at 751 (holding that, where the Rules of Evidence were not strictly applied, the trial judge \u201cmust evaluate whether evidence proffered for admission is sufficiently reliable and probative prior to its admission\u201d); <em>cf. Della Ratta v. Dyas, </em>414 Md. 556, 583-84, 996 A.2d 382, 398 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533-34, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003) (\u201cWeighing the credibility of witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder.\u201d)). We review the judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence here for an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">To address the contention that the trial judges abused their discretion in considering some of the evidence before them, we note that a significant portion of the evidence before the respective courts consisted of bank records submitted by Respondents. We recognize generally that bank records are a form of business records, and that \u201c[t]he trustworthiness and reliability of any business record arises from the fact that entries recording an act or event are made in the regular course of business and it is the regular course of business to record those entries at the time of that act or event or soon thereafter.\u201d <em>State v. Garlick, </em>313 Md. 209, 222, 545 A.2d 27, 33 (1988) (quotations omitted) (noting that the business records exception applies to both civil and criminal cases). This Court has recognized that bank records, particularly when the bank has no stake in the outcome of the litigation, have a strong indicia of reliability, <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 459, 628 A.2d 676, 682 (1993), so it follows that such documents could carry substantial weight with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Moreover, it is well-established that a custodian of business records does not have to be the custodian \u201cwho was such at the time the record was made.\u201d <em>Killen v. Houser, </em>251 Md. 70, 76, 246 A.2d 580, 583 (1968). To be sure, \u201cthere is no requirement that the witness have first-hand knowledge of the matter reported or that the witness actually have prepared or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>observed the preparation of the report.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Cole, </em>342 Md. 12, 29, 672 A.2d 1115, 1123 (1996). If this were not the case, the business records exception \u201cwould lose much of its utility and effectiveness.\u201d <em>Killen, </em>251 Md. at 76, 246 A.2d at 583. Because the admissibility of the evidence in these small claims cases is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, the outcomes in the two cases under review depends on the reliability and credibility of the evidence presented at trial. We also review the judgments rendered by the Circuit Courts for clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">A. <em>Bartlett v. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">PRA filed its complaint against Bartlett after the effective date of the amendments to Rule 3-306(d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In order to succeed on a demand for judgment on affidavit, then, the documents filed by PRA with its complaint, namely the form affidavit and Assigned Consumer Debt Checklist and supporting documents, had to comply with the heightened pleading requirements set forth in the amendment to Rule 3-306(d). Bartlett filed a timely notice of intention to defend, however; hence the case proceeded as a contested small claim action rather than as a demand for judgment on affidavit. Both the plaintiff and defendant appeared at the merit trial before the District Court judge and again at the trial <em>de novo </em>on the merits in the Circuit Court. We shall hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion and that there was no clear error in entering judgment for the plaintiff in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">As detailed extensively in Section II.A. of this opinion, the evidence before the Circuit Court judge was as follows: documents including (1) an Affidavit of Sale from a Chase attorney stating Bartlett\u2019s account was sold to PRA, (2) a Bill of Sale, (3) a Final Data File, (4) Chase monthly credit card statements from January 2009 to May 2010, and (5) PRA\u2019s Account Charge Off Information; and testimony from (1) David Sage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>PRA\u2019s custodian of records (\u201cSage\u201d), and (2) the debtor, Rainford Bartlett.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">To be sure, at a minimum, Bartlett\u2019s monthly credit card statements are considered bank records. Not only do such records have a strong indicia of reliability, but the trial judge evaluated the documents before him under the \u201cguideposts\u201d of Rule 3-306. He stated that \u201cone could look to the provisions of [Rule] 3-306(d) as sort of a guidepost for what the proof has to show [a]nd I\u2019ve been considering the evidence in light of that.\u201d Under that standard, the judge concluded that the documents produced were in fact admissible in accordance with 3 \u2014 306(d), despite the fact that they need not be admissible in accordance with this Rule in the small claims context. He elaborated that the more difficult question to satisfy was whether PRA owned the debt in question, but ultimately concluded that the Bill of Sale complied with 3-306(d) as well, and this document was also considered when making his determination. Although compliance with Rule 3-306(d) is not required in either a trial on the merits in a small claim proceeding in District Court or appeal of a small claim action to be heard <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court, there was no abuse of discretion when the Circuit Court judge considered the heightened pleading standard in order to guide his review of the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Moreover, the judge noted that while he did not find some aspects of Sage\u2019s testimony persuasive, the parts of Sage\u2019s testimony that demonstrated \u201ca more precise knowledge\u201d of some of the data provided \u201cwas credible and persuasive, and satisfied the preponderance of the evidence test.\u201d Indeed, while Sage did not have personal knowledge of all aspects of the debt buying process he was testifying about, personal knowledge is not always necessary in this context. The judge clearly exercised his discretion when considering the reliability of such testimony. Even if the documents and Sage\u2019s testimony alone were not sufficient, the addition of Bartlett\u2019s testimony was sufficient to satisfy PRA\u2019s burden of proof. The judge compared Bartlett\u2019s \u201ccandid testimony\u201d to support facts put forth in the documents and in Sage\u2019s testimony in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>weigh their credibility. Because the judge referenced \u201cguiding principles or rules of law\u201d and a reasonable person could reach the same conclusion, we hold that there was no abuse of discretion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">We shall also hold that in light of the evidence presented, there was no clear error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The court determined that Bartlett was liable for payment of the debt at issue based on the evidence before the court, which included the documents submitted by PRA and the testimony of both PRA\u2019s custodian of records and of the debtor himself. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court in <em>Bartlett v. PRA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">B. <em>Townsend v. Midland Funding, LLC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">As a threshold matter, Midland filed its complaint prior to January 1, 2012, and therefore, the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 3 \u2014 306(d) as amended did not apply. Nevertheless, the judges in both the District Court trial and the <em>de novo </em>trial in the Circuit Court indicated that they considered Rule 3-306 as a guideline and further concluded that the documents satisfied the requirements of Rule 3-306 as amended in 2011.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In any event, as explained below, because the action proceeded to a trial on the merits, we shall hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence offered at trial and did not commit error in entering judgment for the plaintiff after weighing the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this case, Midland filed with its complaint and demand for judgment on affidavit, (1) the Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski, legal specialist with access to account records of Midland Credit Management, Inc., the account servicer for Midland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>stating the amount of the debt owed, that Midland is the owner of the debt, and that the records are maintained in the regular course of business; (2) a copy of a redacted Bill of Sale from Chase to Midland; and (3) copies of credit card statements from the original creditor showing the balance due and Townsend\u2019s mailing address. Townsend filed a notice of intention to defend and the case proceeded to a trial on the merits. Although Townsend did not attend, his counsel appeared on his behalf at the District Court trial and again at the Circuit Court trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">At the trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court, Midland offered as evidence the documents attached to its complaint, namely, the Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski, the \u201cBill of Sale\u201d from Chase to Midland, and the photocopies of Townsend\u2019s credit card account statements. The court correctly concluded that \u201cthe Maryland Rules of Evidence (Title 5) do not apply to these small claim proceedings\u201d and \u201cdetermined to receive and consider\u201d the evidence offered by Midland. As we have discussed, in this small claim case the admission of the evidence was within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. We conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to admit Midland\u2019s affidavit and supporting documents, where the court had \u201cdetermined to receive and consider [the affidavit and supporting documents] pursuant to the instruction and guidance of Md. Rule 3-306.\u201d To be sure, a \u201creasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court\u201d and would conclude that the rulings were not \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031 (1994) (citations and quotations omitted). Contrary to the views espoused in the dissenting opinion in this case, it would be inappropriate for this Court to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court simply because members of this Court would not reach the same conclusions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Although the signed but redacted \u201cBill of Sale\u201d was not reliable evidence of the purchase of the Chase account, the Affidavit of Ashley Lashinski was sufficiently reliable evidence. Her affidavit was \u201cbased upon personal knowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>[the] account records maintained on [Midland\u2019s] behalf\u201d by Midland Credit Management, Inc., the account servicer. In addition, Lashinski\u2019s affidavit references Townsend\u2019s Chase account and the account number. The last four digits of that account number appear in each of the eighteen separate billing statements attached to Midland\u2019s Exhibit One and issued by Chase to Townsend. The statements show the account summary and account activity, including the payment date, new balance, past due amount, and minimum payment due. We note further that the defendant did not attend or participate in the trial. Had he participated, the judge would have had the additional benefit of any evidence the defendant wished to present. Under the circumstances, however, all the judge had to consider was the plaintiffs evidence and the argument of defense counsel. Accordingly, the plaintiff should not be penalized because the defendant failed or refused to participate in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Townsend contends that because Ashley Lashinski\u2019s assertions are hearsay, the Circuit Court committed reversible error by admitting Exhibit One (Affidavit and supporting documents).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This is not correct. Hearsay evidence is ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>missible in small claim proceedings. A live witness at trial seems to be always preferable, but, in the context of small claims, the presence of a witness is not always necessary. The trial judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, must weigh the reliability of the evidence in the case. We are satisfied that the evidence before the Circuit Court judge taken as a whole, with the exception of the Bill of Sale, was sufficiently reliable for the judge to admit it, and to conclude that Midland purchased the debt and that Townsend owed a principle balance of $1,905.21 as of the date of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Finally, there was no clear error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff, where the court found that \u201c[w]ith the contents and attachments of Plaintiffs Exhibit 1, over Defendant\u2019s objection(s), the Plaintiff has proven its claim by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, the Affidavit conforms to the requirements of Md. Rule 3-306 in this \u2018debt buyer\u2019 case.\u201d Although the court is not bound by the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 3-306(d) in a contested small claim proceeding, it did not err in using 3-306(d) as a guide in its disposition of this case. The trial judge expressly found that the documents presented at trial demonstrated both the existence of Townsend\u2019s debt and Midland\u2019s ownership of the debt. In light of the evidence presented, the judge\u2019s consideration of the reliability and weight of the evidence before her, and the absence of any rebuttal evidence by Respondent, who chose not to attend or testify at trial, we find no clear error on the part of the trial judge. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in both cases under review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

We have rephrased these questions for organization and clarity. The questions posed by Petitioners, respectively, in their Petitions for Certiorari are as follows: Bartlett asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">Did the trial court err in a small claims collection action brought by a debt buyer when it admitted hearsay evidence and testimony from a witness who did not have personal knowledge of the matters about which he testified given that the legislative history of newly enacted Rule 3-306 provides that a debt buyer must prove its case with evidence that would pass muster under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Townsend asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">Did the trial court err in a small claims collection action brought by a debt buyer when it allowed a debt buyer to prove its case by merely submitting an affidavit of an individual not employed by the original creditor along with unauthenticated documents and data of the original creditor, given that the legislative history of newly enacted Rule 3-306 provides that a debt buyer must prove its case with evidence that would pass muster under the business records exception to the hearsay rule?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\">. The dissenting opinion in this case asserts that \"[i]t is not self-evident why there would be a lesser standard of proof when the allegations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the complaint are contested and a trial must be held at which the plaintiff still bears the burden of proof.\u201d Dissent op. at p. 292, 91 A.3d at 1149. The dissenting opinion overlooks, however, the difference between the amendment to Rule 3-306 which heightened the pleading requirements for a judgment on affidavit only, and the inherent informal nature of a contested small claim action. In a small claim trial on the merits the trial judge, as the gatekeeper, determines the reliability and probative value of the evidence introduced by the parties, under circumstances where the Rules of Evidence are not applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">. \" \u2018Charge off' means the act of a creditor that treats an account receivable or other debt as a loss or expense because payment is unlikely.\u201d Md.

Midland filed its Complaint against Townsend prior to January 1, 2012, the effective date of the amendment to Rule 3-306.

We note that some types of evidentiary rulings are pure questions of law, for which <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate. Indeed, \"a circuit court has no discretion to admit hearsay in the absence of a provision providing for its admissibility. Whether evidence is hearsay is an issue of law reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Gordon v. State, </em>431 Md. 527, 536, 66 A.3d 647, 652 (2013) (citations omitted). Here, however, where Rule 3-701 provides that the Rules of Evidence do not apply in small claim actions, the District Court judges and Circuit Court judges, on <em>de novo </em>appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>had discretion to weigh whether the evidence was reliable and probative in determining its admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">. Petitioners argue that the cross-reference to Rule <em>5-101 </em>under Rule 3-701 means that the rules of competency still apply to small claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>actions, and that a competent witness must have personal knowledge pursuant to Rule 5-602. We agree that Rule 5-101 states that the rules of competency apply in small claim actions under Rule 3-701 and appeals under Rule 7-112. Md. Rule 5-101(b)(4). \u201cThe rules of competency\u201d referred to in Rule 5-101(b) include Rule 5-601 (General rule of competency), Rule 5-605 (Competency of judge as witness), and Rule 5-606 (Competency of juror as witness). Petitioners\u2019 argument that the competency rules require a witness in a small claim action to have personal knowledge pursuant to Rule 5-602 is misplaced, however. It is well established that competency is not synonymous with personal knowledge. <em>See Matoumba, </em>390 Md. at 553, 890 A.2d at 293 (holding that \u201ccompetency\u201d as used in Rule 5-101 \u201crefers to the traditional notion of competency, <em>i.e., </em>that the witness has sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature and obligation of an oath and is possessed of sufficient mind and memory to observe, recollect, and narrate the things he or she has seen or heard\u201d); <em>Perry v.

Accordingly, Petitioners\u2019 argument to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">.

Alternatively, in a case where the trial judge denies plaintiff\u2019s request for judgment on affidavit and the defendant fails to appear at trial, the case could proceed as a trial upon default. <em>See </em>Rule 3-509(a) (prescribing the procedures \"[wjhen a motion for judgment on affidavit has been ... denied by the court, and the defendant has failed to appear in court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>at the time set for trial\u201d). Like Rule 3-306, Rule 3-509 was amended in 2011 to include special provisions for debt buyer cases to require the trial court to \"consider the requirements set forth in Rule 3-306(d)\u201d before granting a default judgment. Rule 3-509(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(a) Requirements of Proof.

Now, in cases filed by debt buyer plaintiffs on or after January 1, 2012, to obtain judgment on affidavit, the complaint and supporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>documents must comply with Rule 3-306(d). If the case is a small claim and is contested by the defendant, and the plaintiff still wishes to rely on the submitted documents that comply with Rule 3-306(d) and the business records exception to the hearsay rule, the court\u2019s reliance on those documents would not be inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. To be sure, the trial judge must still weigh the reliability and probative value of hearsay evidence before admitting it in the small claims context. Small claim proceedings are analogous to other situations where the formal Rules of Evidence do not strictly apply; in those proceedings it is well-established that hearsay evidence must still be reliable to be admissible. <em>See In re Billy W., </em>387 Md. 405, 434, 875 A.2d 734, 751 (2005) (concluding that \"in permanency planning hearings when the Rules of Evidence are not strictly applied, the trial court must evaluate whether evidence proffered for admission is sufficiently reliable and probative prior to its admission\u201d); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. McDorman, </em>364 Md. 253, 262, 772 A.2d 309, 314 (2001) (\"It is hornbook law that hearsay evidence, if reliable, is admissible at administrative proceedings.... Moreover, not only is hearsay evidence admissible in administrative hearings in contested cases but such evidence, if credible and of sufficient probative force, may indeed be the sole basis for the decision of the administrative body.\u201d); <em>Baker v. State, </em>332 Md. 542, 558, 632 A.2d 783, 790 (1993) (stating that \"while the strict Rules of Evidence do not apply at a sentencing proceeding, unreliable hearsay is inadmissible\u201d). Whether hearsay evidence or not, a trial judge in the small claims context must ensure that the evidence is sufficiently reliable and probative before accepting it. Ultimately, then, the evidence presented must be sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff owns the debt sued upon and that the defendant owes the outstanding debt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">.

Because the trial judge found that the documents submitted met the requirements of Rule 3-306(d), it is reasonable to infer that she believed the records would pass muster under the business records exception. While it is not necessary to comply with the business records exception in this situation, it certainly adds to the reliability and probative value that these records would in fact be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b319-5\">. More specifically, Townsend argues that by admitting and relying on hearsay evidence in the form of an affidavit, without the opportunity to cross-examine, he was denied procedural due process. This argument is without merit. First, as to the admission of hearsay, we have noted, in the context of an administrative hearing, that \"procedural due process does not prevent an agency from supporting its decision <em>wholly </em>by hearsay, if there is underlying reliability and probative value.\u201d <em>Maryland Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. 573, 595, 565 A.2d 1015, 1026 (1989) (emphasis in original). In the context of small claims, where the Rules of Evidence are not applicable, the circumstances are similar. Second, as to due process, \"[t]his Court has long held that procedural due process requires that litigants must receive notice, and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Pickett v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>365 Md. 67, 81, 775 A.2d 1218, 1226 (2001). Cross-examination, on the other hand, is not a prerequisite, but instead is an additional procedural protection to be considered when the courts engage in a due process analysis. <em>See Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. at 597, 565 A.2d at 1026-27 (noting that \"a chance to confront and cross-examine witnesses or evidence\u201d is one of the \u201cdifferent elements of the adversary process which <em>may </em>be required as part of\u201d due process (emphasis added)). Further, we have recognized that \u201cdue process is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>flexible and calls only for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u201d <em>Miserandino v. Resort Props., Inc., </em>345 Md. 43, 52, 691 A.2d 208, 212 (1997) (citations and quotations omitted). In this civil small claim case, Petitioner received adequate due process where he was served with the complaint, filed a timely notice of intention to defend, was represented by counsel, and had the opportunity to attend the merits trial before a neutral judge, even though he chose not to attend the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">.

The purchase of a debt from the original creditor and the pursuit of its collection in the District Court is a legitimate economic enterprise. But the prosecution of a collection action by a debt buyer should conform to the standards of fairness normally required by our rules and constitutions. My disagreement with the Majority arises from three considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">\n<em>Some Considerations in Deciding These Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\n<em>Whether There are Different Standards of Proof for Summary Disposition and Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">The summary disposition rule in the District <em>Court </em>\u2014 i.e., judgment by affidavit under Maryland Rule 3-306 \u2014 spells out specific requirements for the contents of affidavits in debt buyer cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These requirements were explicitly designed to satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a principle that is not only codified in Maryland Rule 5-803(6), but that has long been a part of the common law as well as other statutes and rules.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, as the Majority opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>acknowledges,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a debt buyer plaintiff must satisfy the business records exception to prevail if a defendant does not respond to the complaint. As the Majority opinion also acknowledges,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if the defendant files a notice of intention to defend but fails to appear for trial, the court is still to consider whether the debt buyer plaintiff has met the requirements of Rule 3-306. <em>See </em>Maryland Rules 3-306(e), 3-509(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Under the Majority\u2019s approach, it is only when the defendant puts the debt buyer plaintiff to its proof that the rules are relaxed for the plaintiff. It is not self-evident why there would be a lesser standard of proof when the allegations of the complaint are contested and a trial must be held at which the plaintiff still bears the burden of proof. I would not relax the normal standard of proof when the plaintiffs case depends entirely on the reliability of certain records, some of which originated with the plaintiff and some of which the plaintiff purchased from a third party, and about which there may be legitimate questions as to their trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Whether Bank Records are Always Inherently Reliable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqPR\">Second, in affirming the judgments in these cases, the Majority opinion notes that this Court in <em>Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 628 A.2d 676 (1993), characterized bank records as having \u201cstrong indicia of reliability.\u201d Majority op. at p. 284, 91 A.3d at 1144. That case was a criminal prosecution in which the bank was simply a witness and had no stake in the outcome \u2014 unlike a collection case involving a debt allegedly owed to a bank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, this Court made just that point in <em>Chapman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">While it is true that documents that parties prepare for the purpose of litigation are often suspect because of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>apparent self-serving ends, such is not the case when a bank completes an affidavit of account status [in a bad check prosecution]. There is no enhanced motive for insincerity or fabrication under these circumstances.

Federal Trade Commission, The Structure and Practices of the Debt Buying Industry (2013) at p. 25; <em>see also </em>Holland, <em>Junk Justice: A Statistical Analysis of 4,400 Lawsuits Filed by Debt Buyers, </em>26 Loyola Consumer L.Rev. 179, 193-94 &amp; nn. 45, 50 (2014). It seems odd to accord special reliability to those records when the business that actually created and maintained them may have disclaimed their reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In addition, in <em>Chapman </em>and in the other cases cited by the Majority opinion involving business records, the courts appropriately qualified their holdings by noting that records that otherwise satisfy the conditions of the business records exception are not admissible if circumstances concerning their source or preparation indicate that they lack \u201ctrustworthiness.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As this Court has frequently stated, the key mechanism for testing trustworthiness in our adversary system is cross-examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">\n<em>Whether There Should be an Opportunity for Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Finally, under the Majority\u2019s approach, a defendant may be precluded from any opportunity to cross-examine the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tiffs witnesses. It is true that small claims trials under Rule 3-701 are to be conducted informally, but that does not mean that \u201canything goes\u201d \u2014 in particular, that a party that has the burden of proof can avoid having any of its evidence tested through cross-examination. As the Majority opinion notes, the primary purpose of small claims courts is to provide greater access to justice. Majority op. at pp. 273-74, 91 A.3d at 1138. That goal involves not only increasing the efficiency of the judicial system, but also \u201cincreasing the access of the poor to equal justice.\u201d Eric H. Steele, <em>The Historical Context of Small Claims Courts, </em>6 Am. B. Found. Res. J. 293 (1981). Rule 3-701, and its predecessor rule,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was designed to permit the efficient resolution of small claims in which one or both parties were without lawyers, and thereby to make the justice system more accessible for low income and unrepresented parties. It was not meant to allow institutional parties to shield themselves from cross-examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In sum, we should not decide these cases by according special reliability to the business records offered by one party to a dispute, particularly when they belong to a third party and there may be a legitimate question as to their accuracy, and certainly not without the possibility of cross-examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These considerations bring me to the same place as the Court in one case, but to a different outcome in the second case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\n<em>Deciding These Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\n<em>Bartlett</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In the trial of the <em>Bartlett </em>case, Mr. Bartlett himself was called as a witness by PRA in its own case. He conceded the existence and the amount of his debt to Chase Bank. In light of this corroboration, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information set forth in the records from Chase Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">A representative of PRA also testified and was cross-examined concerning PRA\u2019s records in the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court itself noted that PRA\u2019s witness was present and subject to cross-examination. Trial Transcript at p. 16 (\u201cYou have the full ability to plumb the testimony and expose whether it\u2019s based upon reliable and probative evidence, or not.\u201d). In finding that PRA had proven its ownership of Mr. Bartlett\u2019s debt to Chase Bank, the Circuit Court relied on the testimony of PRA\u2019s representative, although the Court expressed skepticism about some aspects of that testimony. <em>Id. </em>at p. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In light of the corroborating evidence of the debt, it was not necessary for PRA to prove its existence and amount solely through the business records of Chase Bank. The witness sponsoring PRA\u2019s business records testified and was available for cross-examination. The conclusions drawn by the Circuit Court were not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court, although not on the basis stated in the Majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Townsend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The <em>Townsend </em>case is a different matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Midland appeared at trial in both the District Court and the Circuit Court <em>without any witnesses </em>and attempted to prove its case simply by submitting an affidavit and copies of various documents. The affidavit of its absent agent \u2014 Ashley Lashinski, an employee of a Midland affiliate \u2014 did not specifically identify the documents that comprised Midland\u2019s proof, perhaps because those documents differed in the two courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>One of the key exhibits that accompanied the affidavit in both courts was a redacted \u201cbill of sale\u201d that purportedly documented the sale of certain debts by Chase Bank, including the debt attributed to Mr. Townsend, to Midland. This bill of sale was apparently an exhibit to a purchase and sale agreement that was not itself submitted to the courts below.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the bill of sale recites statements similar to the requirements of the business records rule, it is not an affidavit, the statements are not made under oath, and it is not clear to whom those statements are to be <em>attributed </em>\u2014 i.e., who would be cross-examined by a defendant who wished to test the truth of those assertions. In any event, the redacted bill of sale submitted with Ms. Lashinski\u2019s affidavit contained no reference to Mr. Townsend\u2019s account \u2014 or any other account, for that matter.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The District Court judge noted the gap in Midland\u2019s proof\u2014 none of the records submitted in the District Court actually documented that Mr. Townsend\u2019s debt had been sold to Midland \u2014 but was willing to find that Midland had covered that gap, by a preponderance of the evidence, through a reference to Mr. Townsend\u2019s Chase account number in Ms. Lashinski\u2019s affidavit. The Circuit Court similarly relied on Ms. Lashinski\u2019s affidavit to conclude that Midland had satisfied the requirements of Rule 3-306<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and proven its claim by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>preponderance of the evidence. Thus, even if one accepted the proffered bank records as business records of Chase Bank simply because they contained a bank logo, they could not advance Midland\u2019s claim without the testimony of Ms. Lashinski, who did not appear at either trial and therefore was not subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The Majority opinion only briefly addresses the possibility that due process would require an opportunity to cross-examine Ms. Lashinski, citing the <em>Bo Peep </em>case for the proposition that an administrative agency may base a decision on hearsay evidence. Majority op. at pp. 289-90 n. 17, 91 A.3d at 1147-48 n. 17 <em>citing Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. 573, 565 A.2d 1015 (1989). In <em>Bo Peep, </em>the hearsay evidence consisted of certain statements made by children concerning acts of abuse allegedly committed against them. However, in contrast to this case, in <em>Bo Peep </em>the adult witnesses who introduced that hearsay into evidence were all subject to significant cross-examination at the hearing, as the <em>Bo Peep </em>opinion recounts at some length. <em>See Bo Peep, </em>317 Md. at 586-95, 565 A.2d 1015. Indeed, in <em>Bo Peep </em>this Court favorably contrasted the procedures in the case before it \u2014 in which there was cross-examination \u2014 with another case in which there was \u201cno opportunity for cross examination\u201d and the proceedings thereby lacked \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Bo Peep, </em>317 Md. at 598-601, 565 A.2d 1015 <em>describing Rogers v. Radio Shack, </em>271 Md. 126, 314 A.2d 113 (1974). In Mr. Townsend\u2019s case, no one from Midland was available for cross-examination. If the trial of this case had proceeded similarly to the administrative hearing in <em>Bo Peep, </em>Ms. Lashinski (like the adult witnesses in <em>Bo Peep </em>through whom the hearsay was admitted) would have been available for cross-examination when she laid the foundation for the introduction of hearsay statements in the Midland and Chase Bank records under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">On its face, Ms. Lashinski\u2019s affidavit raises some obvious questions that might be explored on cross-examination. Her affidavit speaks generally of her familiarity with Midland\u2019s records and makes certain assertions about amounts owed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Mr. Townsend to Chase Bank, but says nothing specifically about the bill of sale or other documents attached to her affidavit. Nor does her affidavit indicate whether Midland has records related to the account that were <em>not </em>attached to the complaint or her <em>affidavit </em>\u2014 e.g., the purchase and sale agreement for which the bill of sale identifies itself as an \u201cexhibit\u201d\u2014 and whether the omitted records contain any disclaimers or other representations concerning the accounts or the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">It may be that Ms. Lashinski could have answered any questions that Mr. Townsend\u2019s counsel might have posed in a way that advanced Midland\u2019s case. But we do not know because, without a witness to cross-examine, the defendant never had that opportunity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under the Majority\u2019s holding, an affidavit that failed to provide sufficient support for summary disposition under Rule 3-306 could be used to prevail at trial without affording the defendant any opportunity to cross-examine the affiant or other representative of the plaintiff, who has the burden of proof, about the defects in the affidavit. As federal courts have noted in two recent cases involving Midland, when the documentary evidence of a sale of a debt is incomplete, \u201cthe possibility of a debt collector attempting to collect a debt that it does not actually own, either through assignment or otherwise, is very real.\u201d <em>Henggeler v. Brumbaugh &amp; Quandahl, P.C., LLO, </em>894 F.Supp.2d 1180, 1188 (D.Neb.2012) <em>quoting Webb v. Midland Credit Management, Inc., </em>2012 WL 2022013 (N.D.Ill.2012) at *5 n. 8. Even if the statements in the Lashinski affidavit had been sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>admit all of the records under the business records exception, the defendant should have an opportunity to cross-examine a witness who establishes the prerequisites to the business records exception. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment in the <em>Townsend </em>case and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\n<em>Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">It may be that, in most debt buyer cases, the defendant owes the debt and the debt buyer owns the debt. But that is not a reason to discard the normal standards of proof, forgive gaps in the debt buyer\u2019s own records, and treat certain bank records as infallible, particularly when a bank itself may have disclaimed their accuracy. It is ironic that a trial process designed to allow unrepresented lay people to find justice in the legal system, and a rule on summary disposition designed to require debt buyer plaintiffs to satisfy the business records exception to the hearsay rule, have been transformed into a streamlined debt collection process under which a sophisticated institutional litigant avoids even the possibility that its evidence will be subject to testing by cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Judge ADKINS joins this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">.

It is the opportunity for cross-examination that is critical. Ordinarily, when a party seeks to admit business records without a live witness, it must provide notice to the opposing party. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-902(b). This allows the opposing party to object or to subpoena the witness itself if it wishes to cross-examine that witness. <em>See </em>L.

Portfolio Recovery Associates, </em>and <em>Townsend v. Midland Funding, </em>but I write separately to explain my reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Like the Majority, I conclude that Rule 3-306 sets forth the requirements for obtaining a judgment on affidavit, not the requirements for prevailing at a trial. Upon the filing of a timely notice of intention to defend pursuant to Rule 3-306(e)(1), the case proceeds as any other small claims action, and, pursuant to Rule 3-701(f), the District Court would conduct the trial in an informal manner, and Title 5, the Rules of Evidence, would not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A <em>de novo </em>appeal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>District Court\u2019s decision is similarly handled in an informal manner, and the Rules of Evidence do not apply. <em>See </em>Md. R. 7-112(d)(2) (\u201cIf the action in the District Court was tried under Rule 3-701, ... the circuit court shall conduct the trial de novo in an informal manner, and Title <em>5 of </em>these rules does not apply to the proceedings.\u201d). It is undisputed that a contested small claims trial is conducted informally and the Rules of Evidence (except the Rules applicable to the competency of witnesses) do not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\n<em>Bartlett</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">I agree that this Court should affirm the judgment of the circuit court, but not for the reasons stated in the Majority opinion. Like the Majority, I conclude that the circuit court did not err in admitting the documents included in PRA\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 2, over Bartlett\u2019s objection that the documents failed to satisfy Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(6). Because the Rules of Evidence do not apply in contested small claims cases, whether the documents included in PRA\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 2 were hearsay or excepted hearsay under Rule 5-803(b)(6) was simply not a determination that was before the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The circuit court did not err in admitting PRA\u2019s Exhibits 1 and 2 \u2014 which included records from the original creditor, Chase \u2014 over Bartlett\u2019s objection that Sage lacked personal knowledge of the creation and maintenance of the records. As discussed by the majority, an alleged lack of personal knowledge did not render Sage incompetent to testify or to serve as the proponent of the documents in the small claims trial, as a witness\u2019s personal knowledge is distinct from the witness\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">But PRA raises a point that the Majority does not address. PRA contends that, if the Rules of Evidence were applicable, under Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 10-101, in a small claims action, a sponsoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>witness with personal knowledge is not required for admission of business records into evidence. I agree. If the documents at issue were deemed to be business records, a sponsoring witness\u2019s lack of personal knowledge would not be fatal to the admission of the documents. CJP \u00a7 10-101(d), concerning evidence of proof of accounts and records, provides: \u201cThe lack of personal knowledge of the maker of the written notice may be shown to affect the weight of the evidence but not its admissibility.\u201d In <em>Bethlehem-Sparrows Point Shipyard v. Scherpenisse, </em>187 Md. 375, 381, 50 A.2d 256, 260 (1946), we explained that Maryland modeled its business records statute \u2014 now codified at CJP \u00a7 10-101 \u2014 after the Model Act for Proof of Business Transactions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">The [Maryland] Act also provides that all other circumstances of the making of such writing or record, including lack of personal knowledge by the entrant or maker, may be shown to affect the weight, but not the admissibility thereof. The purpose of the Act is to put an end to narrowness in the use of the familiar rule of evidence that the person whose statement is received as testimony should speak from personal observation or knowledge, and to bring the rule of evidence nearer to the standards in responsible action outside of the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Accordingly, I agree that this Court should affirm the judgment of the circuit court, but not entirely on the grounds stated in the Majority opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>Townsend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">As to Townsend\u2019s contention that the circuit court\u2019s admission of Lashinski\u2019s affidavit violated his right to due process because Lashinski was not available for cross-examination, in my view, this case\u2019s particular circumstances do not establish a due process violation. An appellate court reviews without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>deference whether a trial court violated a constitutional right. <em>See Ellis v. Hous.

In <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of Human Res. v. Bo Peep Day Nursery, </em>317 Md. 573, 597, 565 A.2d 1015, 1026-27 (1989), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Cassilly v. Md.

At the <em>de novo </em>appeal in the circuit court, Townsend\u2019s counsel appeared, but did not object on the ground that he could not cross-examine Lashinski. Thus, the issue of Townsend\u2019s right to cross-examination and any alleged deprivation of due process are matters that were neither \u201craised in [nor] decided by the [circuit] court.\u201d Md. R. 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">If the merits were to be addressed, this case\u2019s circumstances do not warrant a finding of a due process violation. On appeal, Townsend has challenged the process and Midland\u2019s manner of proof, but he has not alleged that he is, in fact, not the debtor, or that there is an error as to the debt. Applying the <em>Mathews </em>test, the private interest affected is a property interest. The amount at stake in this case is $1,905.21. Although small claims actions involve smaller amounts than other civil actions for damages, admittedly, the amount at stake may constitute a considerable amount for any defendant. Here, however, other than referencing the amount, Townsend has not alleged the amount to constitute a substantial property interest. Similarly, it has not been established that the risk of an erroneous deprivation of property is high. Townsend has not alleged any circumstances such as an error in <em>paperwork </em>\u2014 ie., that Midland does not own the debt or the amount is incorrect \u2014 or misidentification of himself as the debtor. Thus, in this case, there is no probable value of additional safeguards necessary to prevent an erroneous result. In sum, although cross-examination may indeed be determined to be a fundamental aspect of due process in small claims cases, an analysis of this case\u2019s circumstances does not result in the conclusion that Townsend was deprived of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Although I agree that this Court should affirm the judgment of the circuit court in both cases, in light of the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>raised by Bartlett, Townsend, and <em>amici, </em>and those discussed by Judge Robert N. McDonald in his concurring and dissenting opinion \u2014 most notably, the observation that the small claims trial process was designed \u201cto make the justice system more accessible for low income and unrepresented parties\u201d rather than to \u201callow institutional parties to shield themselves from cross-examination,\u201d <em>see </em>Concurring and Dissenting Opinion at 293-95, 91 A.3d at 1150-51 \u2014 I would urge the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure to investigate whether there should be changes to the Maryland Rules concerning the level and type of proof in assigned consumer debt small claims contested trials.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-10\">. Bartlett appears to concede as much in stating: \u201cRule 3-306(d) technically does not apply at trial[.]\u201d I decline Bartlett\u2019s and Townsend's invitation to consider Rule 3-306(d) \u201cpersuasive authority as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>what a debt buyer must prove to obtain a judgment ... at a contested trial!,]\u201d as Rule 3-306(d)'s plain language establishes that Rule 3-306(d) applies only to a judgment on affidavit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. Indeed, Bartlett has never even disputed the merits of PRA\u2019s claim or otherwise asserted that he did not have a delinquent credit card account.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
