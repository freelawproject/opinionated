(hereinafter, \u201cDr. Shannon\u201d), were sued in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County by the Estate of Anthony Fusco and Mr. Fusco\u2019s surviving children and widow, Respondents, in survival and wrongful death actions, sounding in informed consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In relevant part, the Complaint alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">17. On or about March 12, 2003, Fusco met with Dr. Kevin Shannon to discuss Amifostine as a cytoprotective agent.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">18. Between the dates of April 15, 2003 and May 15, 2003, Fusco received both radiotherapy and approximately 16 injections of 500mg of Amifostine and was monitored by Dr. Shannon. Dr. Shannon recorded in his follow-ups on Fusco\u2019s prostate carcinoma that he is tolerating the radiation and Amifostine during the external beam portion of his treatment well, having no nausea, dizziness or other symptoms, aside from some mild orthostatic symptoms if he does not change positions slowly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">51. Dr. Kevin Shannon owed to Deceased, Fusco a clear and adequate explanation of the nature, benefits and risks of, and alternatives to the administration of the drug, Amifostine and the administration of radiation in order to enable him to make an intelligent decision as to whether to proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">52. Dr. Kevin Shannon failed to inform Fusco of the risks that accompany the administration of the drug, Amifostine and the administration of radiation and therefore did not provide an adequate explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">53. The adequacy of the explanation must be measured by the patient\u2019s need, and that need is whatever is material to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the decision. A material risk is one which a physician knows or ought to know would be significant to a reasonable person in the patients position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">54. In the situation at hand, a patient under the same or similar circumstances as Fusco would most commonly have objected to the administration of Amifostine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">55. Deceased, Fusco would not have given his consent to the proposed administration of the drug, Amifostine and the administration of radiation, had full and adequate disclosure been made at the time consent was originally given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">56. As the direct and proximate result of Dr. Kevin Shannon\u2019s failure to obtain informed consent, Deceased Fusco was caused to sustain severe and conscious pain, permanent bodily injuries, substantial emotional pain and suffering and mental anguish and ultimately death which caused him to incur medical expenses, funeral expenses and other related expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">During the course of discovery, the Fuscos designated Dr. James Trovato, a pharmacist, as an expert witness, but the trial judge excluded Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony based upon his deposition and proffer. Dr. Shannon and his practice group prevailed after a jury trial, and the Fuscos appealed, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>error in the exclusion of Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial, having determined that Dr. Trovato may have been qualified to offer an opinion because he had substantial experience studying and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>advising patients regarding oncology medications, including Amifostine, and therefore, should have been permitted to testify. <em>Fusco v. Shannon, </em>210 Md.App. 399, 428, 63 A.3d 145, 162 (2013). Dr. Shannon and Hematology-Oncology Consultants, thereafter, filed a petition for <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted, to consider the following questions:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">1. Whether the trial court properly exercised its broad discretion in granting Petitioners\u2019 Motion in Limine to preclude James Trovato\u2019s testimony at trial, and whether the Court of Special Appeals decision holding otherwise was error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">2. Whether the trial court properly exercised its broad discretion in precluding the use of, or reference to, the drug insert and FDA approval, and whether the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision holding otherwise was error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">3. Whether the trial court erred in denying Petitioners\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and/or whether the trial court erred in denying Petitioners\u2019 Motion for Judgment given that Respondents\u2019 did not adduce evidence that Dr. Shannon failed to advise Mr. Fusco of \u201cmaterial risks\u201d to Amifostine, either in discovery or at trial.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-8\"><em>Shannon v. Fusco, </em>432 Md. 466, 69 A.3d 474 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>After Anthony Fusco had been diagnosed with prostate cancer he consulted with a radiation oncologist and decided to undergo treatment, which involved a combination of hormone therapy and radiation. The radiation oncologist referred Mr. Fusco to Dr. Kevin Shannon, a physician who specialized in hematology<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and oncology,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to administer Amifostine, a drag which, according to Dr. Shannon\u2019s trial testimony, was designed to protect the bladder and rectum from inflammation caused by radiation therapy. Mr. Fusco was later diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a disease involving skin irritations and blisters, which ultimately causes the top layer of skin to die and shed,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and died shortly thereafter from pneumonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The Estate of Anthony Fusco, Mr. Fusco\u2019s surviving children, Carmela Dent, Anthony J. Fusco Jr., and Michael A. Fusco; and Mr. Fusco\u2019s widow, Mafalda Fusco (collectively, \u201cthe Fuscos\u201d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> filed wrongful death and survival actions against Dr. Shannon and the medical group of which Dr. Shannon was a member at the time. The thrust of the informed consent action was that Dr. Shannon failed to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>close the material risks of administering radiation therapy as well as Amifostine before obtaining Mr. Fusco\u2019s consent to the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">After the case was joined, a scheduling order was issued requiring the parties to identify any expert witness expected to be called at trial. In response<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the Fuscos designated a pharmacist, Dr. James Trovato, in addition to a physician,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as an expert. Dr. Trovato was offered, in his deposition, as \u201can expert in drug therapy, generally and specifically in drug therapy as it applies to oncology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Dr. Shannon, thereafter, moved for summary judgment, alleging that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the Fuscos had failed to produce expert testimony to establish that Dr. Shannon had breached his duty to obtain Mr. Fusco\u2019s informed consent. In this first motion, Dr. Shannon alleged that Dr. Trovato was not qualified to offer an opinion on the standard of care a physician must exercise in obtaining the informed consent of a patient, because he was a pharmacist and had never obtained a patient\u2019s informed consent. The Fuscos opposed the motion, arguing that Dr. Trovato was not offered to testify about the standard of care in this case; he was offered, rather, to testify about Amifostine, including its risks and alternative treatments. They contended, moreover, that expert testimony is not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>establish a breach of the standard of care in an informed consent case. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Fuscos elected, pursuant to Rule 2-419(a)(4),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to take a video or <em>de bene esse</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>deposition of Dr. Trovato, in lieu of having him appear at trial. During this deposition, Dr. Trovato offered his opinion that, \u201camifostine was inappropriately used or should not have been used for the reason of a patient getting radiation therapy for prostate cancer.\u201d To support his opinion, Dr. Trovato testified that the Food and Drug Administration had not approved Amifostine to supplement radiation treatment in prostate cancer patients, but rather, only for two uses not applicable to Mr. Fusco\u2019s condition.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Likewise, Dr. Trovato explained that an insert contained in the Amifostine packaging provided by the manufacturer advised against its use in elderly patients, because its effects on an older population were not yet known. Additionally, he also testified that common side effects included nausea, vomiting, hypertension, dizziness, respiratory affects, and \u201cvarious skin reactions,\u201d including Steven-Johnson\u2019s Syndrome. He did not testify about radiation therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">After the video deposition, Dr. Shannon filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony, arguing, again, that Dr. Trovato was not qualified to render an opinion, because \u201che had no experience as a medical doctor, and has never diagnosed a patient; admitted a patient to a hospital; ... prescribed medication to a patient\u201d and because he had never obtained a patient\u2019s informed consent. In addition, Dr. Shan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>non alleged that Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony addressed negligence, rather than informed consent and was, therefore, irrelevant. The Fuscos opposed the motion, contending that Dr. Trovato\u2019s status as a pharmacist did not disqualify him from offering an opinion in this matter: \u201cPrecisely because he is a pharmacist ... Dr. Trovato, is eminently qualified and perhaps more so than the defendant doctors themselves, to discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of Mr. Fusco\u2019s proposed course of treatment\u201d, Amifostine.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Dr. Shannon also renewed his earlier motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> arguing that the Fuscos had failed to prove by expert testimony the material risks of Amifostine, reiterating many of the arguments set forth in the motion in limine, namely that Dr. Trovato was not qualified to offer an opinion in this matter. Additionally, Dr. Shannon argued that Dr. Trovato had not testified to the nature of the risks of Amifostine, the probability of success of Amifostine; the frequency of occurrence of risks of Amifostine, and the availability of alternatives to Amifostine, which Dr. Shannon asserted was required by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Fuscos countered, arguing that Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony did meet <em>Sard\u2019s </em>criteria, and moreover, the \u201clack of clinical evidence regarding the use of Amifostine ... in the treatment of prostate cancer in elderly patients ..., the fact that Amifostine was not FDA-approved ... and the knowledge of the then-known side effects of Amifostine amounted to a material risk such that a reasonable person in Mr. Fusco\u2019s position, having been fully informed, would have withheld consent to this form of treatment.\u201d They alleged, therefore, that a material dispute of fact existed as to whether Dr. Shannon had disclosed all material risks that rendered summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Judge Leo E. Green Jr. of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County decided both motions and initially denied Dr. Shannon\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment, but granted the motion in limine to exclude Dr. Trovato\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>testimony. With respect to the latter, however, he left open the issue of whether Dr. Trovato could testify at trial. In so concluding, Judge Green reasoned that significant portions of Dr. Trovato\u2019s deposition were irrelevant and prejudicial in an informed consent case, because Dr. Trovato is not a medical doctor, did not address the standards of <em>Sard, </em>and his deposition addressed negligence rather than informed consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">The Court grants the motion for the following reasons. That\u2019s not to say I would exclude him at trial, okay. But the testimony as given gives a great indifference to relevance to the issue at hand. That is informed consent. Secondly, he doesn\u2019t testify as to the standard of an expert in an informed consent case. Third, there\u2019s no testimony in the transcript that\u2019s consistent with these standards. Four, his testimony is more in line in the totality when you take out all of the objections and everything else, testimony is more in line with negligence than that of informed consent. And as a result of this, it is more prejudicial than probative to the issue at hand. Lastly, but not \u2014 and I use it as a last situation, is that he\u2019s a pharmacist, he\u2019s not a medical doctor. And he\u2019s not testifying with the five standards that are found in <em>Sard. </em>Information that must be communicated. The nature of the ailment. The nature of risk of a treatment. The probability of success. The frequency of occurrence of the risk. He never gets into that. Is it a Risk? Yes. But he doesn\u2019t give it and he doesn\u2019t testify as to what the available alternatives to the treatment are. He testifies as to the risk but he doesn\u2019t give a whole thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">Now would he be \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t be my choice of my main expert. And then again I\u2019m not a Plaintiffs lawyer any more. But this is a tough call. As it in a totality counsel, right now, I\u2019m not precluding you from calling him at trial, live and not memorex, so to speak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>With the possibility remaining that Dr. Trovato could testify at trial, Dr. Shannon requested his proffer, arguing \u201cif he is going to remain consistent with his deposition testimony and his de bene esse deposition and there are no new opinions, then we would again move in limine for him testifying at trial.\u201d Judge Green granted the request for a proffer, and thereafter, the Fuscos submitted a written proffer, stating Dr. Trovato would testify to, <em>inter alia, </em>the risk factors associated with Amifostine; that Amifostine has only been proven to benefit patients suffering from head, neck and kidney cancer; that the efficacy of Amifostine in treating prostate cancer was unknown; that the package insert cautions against use in elderly patients; that there are no other known alternatives to Amifostine, and that Amifostine was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of prostate cancer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">1. Dr. Trovato is an associate professor with the Department of Pharmacy Practice &amp; Science at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy and is the Director of the University\u2019s Residency program. Dr. Trovato is board certified in oncology pharmacy practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">2. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Dr. Trovato has a clinical practice which focuses on \u201cinsur(ing) appropriate or safe use of medication in oncology patients.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">3. As a part of his teaching and clinical responsibilities, Dr. Trovato educates and advises patients on the appropriate and safe use of oncology medications, including the use of Amifostine. Dr. Trovato plays a pivotal role in educating patients and physicians about the risks and side effects of particular modes of treatment as well as the potential benefits of the treatment and, ultimately, in selecting said treatment. Dr. Trovato makes recommendations to the physicians and patients as to what drag therapy is best for each patient, and plays a direct role in obtaining informed consent from a patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">4. Dr. Trovato will testify that the risk factors associated with Amifostine include nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure or hypotension, skin changes, allergic or immunologic reactions including a rash, hives, toxic necrolysis, and Ste<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>vens-Johnson Syndrome, fever, shortness of breath, and dizziness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">5. Dr. Trovato will testify that the most common risks of Amifostine are hypotension, nausea, vomiting and skin changes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">6. Dr. Trovato will explain the properties of Amifostine as a cytoprotective agent and how it is used to protect certain normal tissues from damage either from chemotherapy or from radiation therapy. Dr. Trovato will testify that Amifostine has been proven to provide this type of benefit to normal tissues in patients only with head and neck cancer and kidney cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">7. Dr. Trovato will testify that it is unknown whether or not Amifostine protects the normal cells of a patient with prostate cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">8. Dr. Trovato will explain that there have only been phase I and phase II clinical trials relative to the administration of Amifostine in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, he will testify that there is no medical literature or clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy of Amifostine for treatment in prostate cancer, only its toxicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">9. Dr. Trovato will testify that \u201cthe risks of using Amifostine in this particular patient (Mr. Fusco) outweigh the potential benefits ...\u201d and \u201cthere is no evidence to support the benefit of Amifostine in this patient, but we do have evidence of the toxicities or adverse effects of this agent\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">10. Dr. Trovato will testify that the package insert of Amifostine gives a precaution as to the administration of the drug to an elderly patient, like Plaintiff, because the toxic effects of the drug have not been tested on an elderly population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">11. Dr. Trovato will testify that the alternative to the administration of Amifostine is to refrain from its administration and treat solely with radiation therapy. He will further testify, based upon his experience in making treatment recommendations and engaging in the informed consent process with patients, that there is no detriment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>advising the patient fully about the risks associated with this medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">12. Dr. Trovato will testify that there are no known alternative cytoprotective agents for prostate cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">13. Dr. Trovato will testify about the approved FDA uses at the time that Amifostine was administered to Anthony Fusco.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">(emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">After receiving the proffer, Judge Green notified the parties that he would not permit Dr. Trovato to testify at trial. Dr. Shannon then filed a second motion for summary judgment, arguing that, pursuant to <em>Sard, </em>expert testimony was required to establish the nature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of the particular risks, and available alternatives, which were no longer available. At the hearing, the Fuscos opposed the motion, contending that their claims could survive summary judgment because \u201cthere\u2019s really one person ..., one doctor, who talks about the five factors more than anybody else and that\u2019s Dr. Shannon,\u201d and thus, they could read to the jury portions of Dr. Shannon\u2019s deposition in which he discussed, among other things, the risks of Amifostine and their likelihood of occurrence. Judge Green agreed that Dr. Shannon\u2019s deposition testimony did create a genuine dispute of material fact as to the materiality of the risks of Amifostine, stating \u201cat this stage of the proceeding I do have some, there is in my view a dispute as to a material fact, i.e. is whether or not that\u2019s a material risk or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">At the hearing, Judge Green also explained his reasons for precluding Dr. Trovato from testifying at trial. Initially, he referred to the Fuscos\u2019 allegation regarding the lack of informed consent regarding the \u201ccomplete treatment plan\u201d of radiation and Amifostine, about which Dr. Trovato, as a pharmacist, was not qualified to offer an opinion. Additionally, Judge Green noted that Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony was not consistent with our opinion in <em>Sard. </em>He also noted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>proffered testimony of Dr. Trovato sounded in negligence and would, therefore, confuse the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">And first and foremost, we must remember that this is a trial that does not have a negligence count. It has a simple count of a lack of informed consent. This is important in the Courts consideration. And the Court looks very carefully and has already given one opinion on this matter already.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">And I adopt what I said earlier and will add to it today as for my reasons. I don\u2019t want to belabor the point but when I ended my opinion before, I looked at the question of what the status of Dr. Trovato was as to what he was. And he quite frankly, he\u2019s a pharmacist. He\u2019s not a medical doctor. And as such, when you look and you review of what, under Maryland Rule 5-701 and 5-702, what an expert is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">In this matter it is not just the sole issue of the medicines that were used. But it is a sole and complete treatment plan that is before the Court. It is not just that sole issue that we have before us. And remember is that the pharmacist is dealing only with a small part of the treatment plan, the medications. And that is where his expertise is. It\u2019s not in the complete treatment plan. So he only deals with medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">There is an entirety to the informed consent and that is not just the medications, but the entire treatment. And as such, a pharmacist does not, in the Courts opinion, have the ability to give the full demarcation of what is involved in informed consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">Quite frankly, he\u2019s never given an informed consent. He\u2019s not trained in informed consent. And he, quite frankly, he is very limited in what he does with patients. And the final call is not his. It is always the doctor. That\u2019s the way the medical system is set up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-9\">In these matters we have to look at what exactly it is that has to be testified to. And it said in the <em>Sard </em>case at page 447 [379 A.2d 1014] \u201cWe are not to be holding as understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>as holding however, that expert medical testimony can be dispensed with entirely in cases of informed consent. Such expert testimony would be required, one to establish the nature of the risk inherent in a particular treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-4\">And that\u2019s key to me is treatment because it has to do with material risks that are involved. Two, \u201cThe probabilities of the therapeutic success.\u201d Again, the pharmacist is really only dealing with a small part of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\">Further I go back to the same things that I would say that I said before. And not in particular order is that testimony is more in line, after I read it, in negligence rather than informed consent. And therefore, would be prejudicial rather than probative to the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">It would not \u2014 I think in other ways it would confuse and disenchant the jury in their ability to determine what the doctrine of informed consent really is if they listen to this sole expert on pharmacology. The testimony that Dr. Tr\u00f3vate both in the proffer and in the <em>de bene esse </em>deposition touches upon the five criteria that I listed in <em>Sard </em>but doesn\u2019t completely analyze, completely give a completeness to what has to be done to this patient. That\u2019s another reason why I\u2019m disallowing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">And again I go back to the relevance of where that particular experts expertise is relevant but not material to the material risks that involved in this matter. So for these reasons and the reasons that I gave when we were before the Court on December 21, 2010, Court will disallow the testimony of James Tr\u00f3vate, a doctor of pharmacology, at trial for those reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Just prior to opening statements, Dr. Shannon moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude the introduction into evidence of a package insert included with Amifostine, as well as any reference to the fact that the Food and Drug Administration had not approved Amifostine for treatment of prostate cancer patients, relying on our decision in <em>University of Maryland Medical System Corp. v. Waldt, </em>411 Md. 207, 983 A.2d 112 (2009), to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>claim that, \u201cto the extent that counsel intends to articulate what the approved FDA uses were for [AJmifostine, we would argue and ask that they be excluded in opening statements as irrelevant.\u201d Judge Green granted the motion <em>in limine, </em>but the two issues were resurrected when the Fuscos offered portions of Dr. Shannon\u2019s deposition in which he had responded to questions regarding the use of Amifostine for treatment of prostate cancer and its efficacy in an elderly population.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Dr. Shannon objected again and argued that <em>Waldt </em>precluded such evidence, with which Judge Green agreed. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Shannon, by answering that a reasonable person, having been informed of the material risks of Amifostine, would not have refused treatment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Fuscos filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, challenging the exclusion of Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony, as well as evidence related to FDA approved uses of Amifostine and the package insert.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, concluding that the trial judge erred in excluding not only Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony, but also references to the FDA-approved uses of Amifostine and the package insert. With respect to the issue of whether Dr. Trovato should have been permitted to testify, the intermediate appellate court opined that, \u201cthe issue is not whether Dr. Trovato was qualified to opine about Dr. Shannon\u2019s advisement to obtain informed consent, but whether he, as a pharmacist, was qualified to testify regarding Amifostine,\u201d <em>Fusco, </em>210 Md.App. at 427, 63 A.3d at 161-62, and reasoned that Dr. Trovato was, because he had prior experience teaching and counseling patients regarding oncology medications, including Amifostine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">Dr. Trovato testified that he had \u201ccounselled [sic] some patients on Amifostine. It was like a handful of cases.... \u201d In appellants\u2019 proffer, they indicated that Dr. Trovato would have testified that \u201cas part of his teaching and clinical responsibilities, [he] educate[d] and advise[d] patients on the appropriate and safe use of oncology medications, including the use of Amifostine.\u201d Although Dr. Trovato was not a medical doctor, he proffered that he was familiar with Amifostine therapy. Thus, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that Dr. Trovato did not qualify as an expert witness on the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 428, 68 A.3d at 162 (alterations in original). The intermediate appellate court, however, stated that, on remand, Dr. Trovato could not testify as to material risks and alternative treatment plans, because it would exceed the extent of his expertise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">On remand, although Dr. Trovato indicated that he counseled and educated patients on the use of oncology medications, including Amifostine, informed consent encompasses more than the potential benefits and risks of Amifostine. There is an overall treatment plan, which the record indicated, including the patient\u2019s past medical, social, and family history, tobacco and alcohol intake, physical examinations, laboratory studies, anatomy demonstrations via diagrams and pictures, x-ray films, and lifestyle management, all of which are a part of a recommended course of treatment. Hence, we note that portions of Dr. Trovato\u2019s proffered testimony regarding informed consent were not admissible, as exceeding the scope of his expertise in an informed consent case. In that regard, Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony regarding the nature of the material risks associated with the particular regimen of treatment provided to Mr. Fusco, and any alternative treatment options, would exceed the extent of Dr. Trovato\u2019s expertise relative to informed consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 437-38, 63 A.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The trial judge also erred, according to the Court of Special Appeals, in excluding evidence relating to the FDA\u2019s approved uses of Amifostine as well as the package insert that contained information regarding the use of Amifostine in elderly patients, explaining that, \u201cthis information could have been a material consideration regarding Mr. Fusco\u2019s decision whether to consent to the use of Amifostine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 63 A.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Before us, Dr. Shannon contends that because Dr. Trovato is not a medical doctor and has never obtained a patient\u2019s informed consent, he is unable to offer an opinion as to whether Dr. Shannon breached his duty to warn Mr. Fusco about the material risks of Amifostine; even assuming Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Trovato was qualified to offer an opinion, he alternatively argues that Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony focused on an inappropriate use of the drug, which, they contend, may be relevant in a negligence action, but not in an informed consent case. Dr. Shannon argues, moreover, that Judge Green properly excluded evidence pertaining to the package insert and FDA-approval status of Amifostine, because such evidence is not relevant in an informed consent cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">The Fuscos disagree, contending that although Dr. Trovato is not qualified to offer an opinion as to whether Dr. Shannon breached his duty to inform Mr. Fusco of the material risks inherent in Amifostine therapy, he is qualified, as a pharmacist, to testify about the nature and frequency of the risks of Amifostine, probabilities of its success, and the available alternatives to the use of the drug, all of which, they argue, are relevant in an informed consent action. They assert, also, that Judge Green erred in excluding evidence pertaining to the package insert and the FDA-approval status of Amifostine, reasoning that such information is a necessary component of an informed consent discussion, because it is information that a reasonable person in Mr. Fusco\u2019s position would want to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">We considered the doctrine of informed consent in the seminal case of <em>Sard, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014, in which a patient alleged that her surgeon failed to disclose to her the potential failure rate and alternative treatment options to a surgical sterilization procedure called a tubal ligation. The trial court had granted a motion for judgment at the end of the plaintiffs case, because it had concluded that a written consent form signed by the patient barred her recovery. In considering the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s decision, we elucidated the various elements of an informed consent cause of action, which, generally, include the duty to disclose to the patient material information that \u201ca physician knows or ought to know would be significant to a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure\u201d; breach of that duty by failing to make an adequate disclosure; and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>breach was the proximate cause of the patient\u2019s injuries. <em>Sard, </em>281 Md. at 444, 379 A.2d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In <em>Sard </em>we opined that informed consent is predicated on the notion that a patient has a right to exercise control over her own body. Because a patient, however, generally does not possess the expertise necessary to understand the consequences of submitting to a particular medical treatment, she, necessarily, relies on the physician for such information. Accordingly, the doctrine of informed consent imposes on a physician a duty to disclose material information that \u201ca physician knows or ought to know would be significant to a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d at 1022, including \u201cthe nature of the ailment, the nature of the proposed treatment, the probability of success of the contemplated therapy and its alternatives, and the risk of unfortunate consequences associated with such treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 379 A.2d at 1020.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We then adduced the scope of a physician\u2019s duty, rejecting a standard embraced by some of our sister courts by which a physician must disclose information that is customarily disclosed by other physicians.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We, rather, adopted a more patient-oriented standard by which a physician must disclose \u201cmaterial risks\u201d, those risks \u201cwhich a physician knows or ought to know would be significant to a reasonable person in the patient\u2019s position in deciding whether or not to submit to a particular medical treatment or procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d at 1022. We further explained that, under the material risk standard, a physician is not \u201cburdened with the duty of divulging <em>all </em>risks\u201d of which he knew or should have known, but rather, only those that are necessary to the rendering of an intelligent decision by a reasonable patient. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d at 1022 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">In <em>Wilkinson v. Vesey, </em>110 R.I. 606, 295 A.2d 676 (1972), a case upon which we relied in <em>Sard </em>to define material risks, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Rhode Island Supreme Court identified two factors of significance in the discernment of what is a material risk, those being \u201cthe severity of the risk and the likelihood of its occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. In <em>Sard, </em>we also consulted Jon R. Waltz &amp; Thomas W. Scheuneman, <em>Informed Consent to Therapy, </em>64 NW. L.Rev. 628, 640-41 (1970), which described the material risk factors, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[T]he basic factors to be considered are the nature of the overall risk, its severity and its likelihood of occurrence. Each factor must be weighed in combination with the others to determine whether a particular risk is material and therefore subject to disclosure....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 640-41. Many of our sister courts with the same patient-centric view of informed consent have embraced the same factors. <em>See, e.g., Flatt v. Kantak, </em>687 N.W.2d 208, 213 (N.D.2004) (\u201cThe materiality of information about the risk of a potential injury is a function of the severity of the potential injury and of the likelihood it will occur.\u201d); <em>Feeley v. Baer, </em>424 Mass. 875, 679 N.E.2d 180, 181 (1997) (\u201cThe materiality of information about a potential injury is a function not only of the severity of the injury, but also of the likelihood that it will occur.\u201d, quoting <em>Precourt v. Frederick, </em>395 Mass. 689, 481 N.E.2d 1144 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Since <em>Sard, </em>we have opined that, while a cause of action for informed consent sounds in negligence, it is distinct from a medical negligence claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">In a count alleging medical malpractice, a patient asserts that a healthcare provider breached a duty to exercise ordinary medical care and skill based upon the standard of care in the profession, ... while in a breach of informed consent count, a patient complains that a healthcare provider breached a duty to obtain effective consent to a treatment or procedure by failing to divulge information that would be material to his/her decision about whether to submit to, or to continue with, that treatment or procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az45\"><em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>410 Md. 1, 18-19, 976 A.2d 1020, 1030 (2009). Because the two causes of action are distinct, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>also opined, in <em>dicta, </em>that evidence that a medical procedure or treatment is contraindicated for a patient is not relevant in an informed consent action. In <em>Waldt, </em>the patient underwent a procedure to treat an aneurysm in her brain in which a device called a neuroform stent was used, which caused Mrs. Waldt to suffer a stroke. Mrs. Waldt and her husband filed an action against the surgeon based upon a lack of informed consent. In support of their claim, the Waldts offered a neuroradiologist as an expert witness, but the trial judge excluded him from testifying, because the neuroradiologist lacked sufficient evidence. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s decision to exclude the neuroradiologist from testifying was not preserved for appellate review pursuant to Rule 5-103,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because the only proffered testimony was that the stent had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of the type of aneurysm from which Mrs. Waldt had suffered. <em>Waldt v. Univ. of Maryland Med. Sys. Corp., </em>181 Md.App. 217, 261, 956 A.2d 223, 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider, among other issues, whether the issue had properly been preserved for appeal. We then quoted with approval the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion, in which our brethren had stated whether a procedure is contraindicated may be relevant in a negligence action to establish that a physician\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of care, but not relevant to a cause of action in informed consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgU\">The Waldts\u2019 proffer was that Dr. Debrun would testify about the approved uses of the neuroform stent. The intermediate appellate court explained,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">The excerpts from the record the Waldts argue constituted a proffer reveal that the only proffered (albeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>vaguely) substantive testimony of Dr. Debrun was that the neuroform stent device was not approved for use on Mrs. Waldt\u2019s type of aneurysm. This is not a proffer of a risk inherent to the procedure that Mrs. Waldt underwent. It is a proffer of expert testimony that the procedure was contraindicated for Mrs. Waldt, and therefore should not have been performed on her. That expert testimony would be relevant to an ordinary negligence claim, <em>ie., </em>that the doctors breached the standard of care in their treatment of Mrs. Waldt by performing a contraindicated procedure on her. It is not relevant to an informed consent claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><em>Waldt, </em>411 Md. at 235-36, 983 A.2d at 130, quoting <em>Waldt, </em>181 Md.App. at 261-62, 956 A.2d at 248, 249. Affirming on procedural grounds, we agreed with the intermediate appellate court that the issue had not been properly preserved for appellate review because \u201cno testimony was proffered concerning the material risks of the procedure that would make out a prima facie case for informed consent.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The issue queued up by the instant case is whether Dr. Trovato, a pharmacist, was qualified to testify in this informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>consent action against Dr. Shannon. We begin by addressing the necessity of expert testimony in an informed consent action, specifically with respect to material risks, because we have not squarely addressed this issue in the past. In <em>Sard </em>we opined in <em>dicta </em>that, \u201c[s]uch expert testimony would be required to establish the nature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of particular risks, the nature of available alternatives to treatment and whether or not disclosure would be detrimental to a patient.\u201d <em>Sard, </em>281 Md. at 448, 379 A.2d at 1024. Likewise, in <em>Waldt, </em>we opined, again in <em>dicta, </em>that, \u201c[ejxpert testimony is necessary to establish the material risks and other pertinent information regarding the treatment or procedure\u201d, and observed that the Waldts had relied on the neurologist to establish the material risks of the neuroform stent procedure. <em>Waldt, </em>411 Md. at 232, 983 A.2d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Although our pronouncements in <em>Sard </em>and <em>Waldt </em>were <em>dictum, </em>it is clear, nevertheless, that expert testimony is necessary to assist the trier of fact in understanding the severity and the likelihood of a risk so that the trier of fact may assess the material risks of the proposed treatment. Pursuant to Rule 5-702,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201c[ejxpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 971 A.2d 235 (2009), we opined, when \u201c \u2018complex medical issue[s]\u2019 ... are in question, we have required a specificity of knowledge, skill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>experience, training, or education for qualification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623, 971 A.2d at 264, quoting <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 615-16, 819 A.2d 1030, 1068 (2003). The likelihood that certain risks will occur when medicine is administered and the severity of such risks are complex medical matters that will generally fall outside the scope of lay knowledge, and thus, expert testimony is necessary to \u201cassist the trier of fact ... to determine a fact in issue\u201d, \u2014 the material risks of proposed medical treatment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Addressing whether a pharmacist, Dr. Trovato, is \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d under Rule 5-702 to opine regarding material risks of Amifostine, is, of course, our main inquiry. Dr. Shannon asserts that because Dr. Trovato is not a physician and has never obtained a patient\u2019s informed consent, he cannot opine as to what information needed to be disclosed before administering Amifostine. The Fuscos react negatively to this <em>per se </em>argument, alleging that Dr. Trovato was uniquely qualified to opine about the material risks of Amifostine.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">As a basis for excluding Dr. Trovato from testifying at trial, the trial judge opined that Dr. Trovato\u2019s expertise did not extend to the \u201ccomplete treatment plan\u201d involved in the treatment of Mr. Fusco\u2019s cancer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">I looked at the question of what the status of Dr. Trovato was as to what he was. And he quite frankly, he\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>pharmacist. He\u2019s not a medical doctor. And as such, when you look and you review of what, under Maryland Rule 5-701 and 5-702, what an expert is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\">In this matter it is not just the sole issue of the medicines that were used. But it is a sole and complete treatment plan that is before the Court. It is not just that sole issue that we have before us. And remember is that the pharmacist is dealing only with a small part of the treatment plan, the medications. And that is where his expertise is. It\u2019s not in the complete treatment plan. So he only deals with medication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Apparently, in this determination, the trial court considered that Dr. Trovato would necessarily have to be qualified with respect to radiation therapy rather than just with the material risks of the administration of Amifostine, which was the foundation of the informed consent action against Dr. Shannon who was not responsible for the radiation therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, on the other hand, opined that Dr. Trovato could qualify as an expert regarding the material risks of the administration of Amifostine and that he did offer such testimony. <em>Fusco, </em>210 Md.App. at 428, 430, 63 A.3d at 162. We agree that Dr. Trovato may have been qualified to testify about the material risks of the administration of Amifostine, but disagree that he rendered such an opinion in his <em>de bene esse </em>deposition or in the proffer of his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">In concluding that Dr. Trovato may have been qualified, we note that he stated in his proffer and in his <em>de bene esse </em>deposition that he had substantial experience and knowledge pertaining to oncological medications. He testified in his <em>de bene esse </em>deposition that he taught and lectured to pharmacy students at the University of Maryland and also served as an \u201concology clinical specialist\u201d at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, in which he provided \u201cdirect patient care activities and other clinical services\u201d, including \u201crounding with the medical oncology team to help provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>appropriate and safe use of medications, oncology related medications\u201d. He further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">I also work with physicians, oncologists at the cancer center in terms of supportive care issues for oncology patients. So, oncology patients that develop complications related to oncology related treatments, chemotherapy, as well as complications related to the cancer itself. I do help to manage these complications, things, for example, like pain management ... things like nausea/vomiting, I also provide a lot of education, patient education, educating patients on oncology related medications, educating patients on adverse effects of chemotherapy, I provide education to medical residents, pharmacy residents, physicians and nursing staff at the cancer center in terms of new oncology drugs. I also play a role in terms of the development of guidelines and policies and procedures related to oncology medication at the cancer center. I also do play a role in formulating addition of oncology related drugs at cancer center. So, in terms of reviewing literature and developing drug monographs and helping to develop guidelines for safe, appropriate use of oncology related medications[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Based on his qualifications, he was offered as an expert in \u201cdrug therapy, generally and specifically in drug therapy as it applies to oncology.\u201d Thereby he may have been qualified to testify about the likelihood and severity of risks caused by the administration of Amifostine.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>In so concluding, we find succor in the decision of <em>Parker v. Harper, </em>803 So.2d 76, 78 (La.Ct.App.2001), in which the Louisiana intermediate appellate court reversed a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of a physician in an action alleging lack of informed consent for administration of the drug Dilantin for seizures. The plaintiff had contracted Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and alleged that the treating physician had failed to warn her of the material risks of Dilantin, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. <em>Id. </em>at 79. In opposition to the physician\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff attached an affidavit of a pharmacist, who attested that Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a potentially fatal disease, and other skin rashes were risks of Dilantin which occurred in two-to-five percent of its users. <em>Id. </em>at 84. The pharmacist\u2019s affidavit, the appellate court reasoned, was sufficient to provide the requisite expert testimony to establish the material risks of the drug. In addressing the pharmacist\u2019s qualifications under Article 702 of the Louisiana Code of Evidence,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which stated that a witness may be qualified by \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\u201d the court opined that he was qualified to offer an opinion about the risks, their nature, and the likelihood with which they occur:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">Though we recognize that he is not a neurologist, the potential development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is not peculiar to the practice of neurology. Mr. Stewart does not need to have treated patients with neurological problems to discuss the frequency of risks associated with Dilantin. His opinions represent to this court that he is an \u201cother qualified expert\u201d with regard to drugs and potential reactions thereto and is capable of judging what risk exists, its nature, and the likelihood of its occurrence. There would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>be a serious question as to the sufficiency of Mr. Stewart\u2019s affidavit if he were opining regarding Dr. Harper\u2019s compliance with a neurologist\u2019s standard of care. However, we do not view his affidavit as being employed for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAU\">Id<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Accordingly, we reject Dr. Shannon\u2019s argument that a pharmacist is <em>per se </em>unqualified to testify in an informed consent action when a physician has been sued. Dr. Trovato was never offered as an expert to testify about the types of information Dr. Shannon had a duty to disclose to effectively obtain Mr. Fusco\u2019s informed consent, and thus, his lack of experience in obtaining informed consent is not a bar to his testimony in the instant case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The relevant inquiry, rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>is whether Dr. Trovato had the requisite expertise to testify about the material risks of the administration of Amifostine; he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Despite agreeing with our intermediate appellate court that Dr. Trovato may have been <em>qualified </em>to testify about the material risks of the administration of Amifostine, we part ways with our brethren regarding whether Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony addressed the material risks of the administration of Amifostine. The intermediate appellate court emphasized that the proffer of Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony expressed his opinion regarding the material risks of the administration of Amifostine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">Dr. Trovato would testify regarding \u201cthe risk factors associated with Amifostine[,] includ[ing] nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure or hypotension, skin changes, allergic or immunologic reactions[,] including a rash, hives, toxic necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson [S]yndrome, fever, shortness of breath, and dizziness.\u201d He would have opined concerning the properties of Amifostine as a cytoprotective agent, and how Amifostine therapy was only successful regarding patients diagnosed with head, neck, and kidney cancer, but not prostate cancer. Furthermore, Dr. Trovato would have asserted that the alternative to Amifostine was radiation therapy; and \u201c... that the package insert of Amifostine [gave] a precaution as to the administration of the drug to an elderly patient, like [Mr. Fusco], because the toxic effects of the drug have not been tested on an elderly population.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOV\"><em>Id. </em>at 434-35, 63 A.3d at 166 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We disagree that Dr. Trovato, in his <em>de benne esse </em>deposition or the proffer of his trial testimony, addressed the severity and the likelihood of the risks of the administration of Amifostine; rather, he opined in both only about the existence of risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: What are some of the risk factors that are \u2014 what are the risk factors that are included in the drug insert that has been approved by the FDA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">[DR. TROVATO]: The most common clinical side effects do include nausea/vomiting, they include low blood pressure or hypotension, there are various skin reactions, such as cutaneous reactions associated with amifostine, some of these could be mild rash to, again, very severe skin eruptions, things that we mentioned like Stevens-Johnson, TEN, are side effects of amifostine. There also could be some central effects in terms of dizziness with amifostine. There could be some respiratory effects, shortness of breathe, for example. So, there\u2019s a variety of different systems that could be affected by amifostine. But, again, the more common ones include the skin changes and the nausea/vomiting and hypo-tension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: Could you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what Stevens-Johnson syndrome is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">[DR. TROVATO]: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome is basically a severe rash that forms on the patient\u2019s skin. So, that basically a skin eruption, presents as red, it could involve peeling of skin or itching.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: What is TEN?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">[DR. TROVATO]: TEN stands for toxic epidermal necrolysis. So, it implies that the severity of the skin damage can progress to the point that the patient can experience necrosis, tissue \u2014 permanent tissue death of the skin, sloughing of the skin, and so forth due to that reaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">In his written proffer, Dr. Trovato simply enumerated the myriad of risks associated with the drug:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>4. Dr. Trovato will testify that the risk factors associated with Amifostine include nausea, vomiting, low blood pressure or hypotension, skin changes, allergic or immunologic reactions including a rash, hives, toxic necrolysis, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, fever, shortness of breath, and dizziness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-4\">5. Dr. Trovato will testify that the most common risks of Amifostine are hypotension, nausea, vomiting and skin changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Because Dr. Trovato did not opine about the likelihood and severity of the risks implicated in the administration of Amifostine,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we cannot say that Judge Green abused his discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>tion in excluding Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We address, next, Judge Green\u2019s decision to exclude evidence pertaining to the package insert accompanying the Amifostine and evidence regarding the use of Amifostine in an off-label manner. Evidence pertaining to the package insert was offered three times, the first of which occurred with Dr. Trovato\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>testimony in which he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT]: [D]oes the drug insert ... speak to the use of amifostine in elderly patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">[DR. TROVATO]: Yes, it does speak to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT]: What does it say relative to the use of amifostine in elderly patients?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">[DR. TROVATO]: There\u2019s actually \u2014 there\u2019s actually a precaution in the product package insert people with drug\u2014 amifostine studied in elderly patients who \u2014 should use precaution in those patients since we don\u2019t know what the effects might be in those patients.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>At trial, moreover, the Fuscos offered a copy of the package insert itself. In a dialogue with the judge, Dr. Shannon argued that the package insert was irrelevant, pursuant to our decision in <em>Waldt, </em>because it listed the approved uses of Amifostine, which, Dr. Shannon asserted were not relevant pursuant to <em>Waldt. </em>Judge Green agreed that <em>Waldt </em>precluded admission of the package insert, and the insert was never admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Finally, the Fuscos sought to introduce Dr. Shannon\u2019s deposition testimony, in which he stated that he had not advised Mr. Fusco about warnings on the package insert pertaining to use in an elderly population:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: Does the drug insert ... indicate that this drug should not be used on elderly patients because there has been inadequate clinical studies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQDL\">[DR. SHANNON]: The drug insert indicates that there are several shoulds. Shoulds are not musts. We should run six times a day. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: [D]id you advise him ... [t]hat the drug manufacturer recommended that it not be used because it hasn\u2019t been fully tested on elderly patients yet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">[DR. SHANNON]: No, I didn\u2019t and there is additional reason why I don\u2019t. We are giving in terms of a dosage spectrum as we just spoke of we\u2019re really on the low end----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Again, relying on <em>Waldt, </em>Judge Green excluded such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Dr. Shannon contends that evidence pertaining to the package insert was properly excluded, because Dr. Trovato testified about the warnings only in support of his ultimate conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>sion that Amifostine was inappropriately <em>used, </em>and thus, the testimony sounded in negligence, and was, therefore, irrelevant. The Fuscos disagree, arguing that the warnings in the package insert \u201ccould have been a material consideration regarding Mr. Fusco\u2019s decision whether to consent to the use of Amifostine.\u201d Dr. Shannon counters, arguing that there was no expert testimony or evidence adduced that the insert\u2019s warning was a \u201cmaterial risk\u201d of the administration of Amifostine, and therefore, there was no evidentiary basis from which a jury could conclude that the insert\u2019s warnings required disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Our intermediate appellate court agreed with the Fuscos, citing our decision in <em>Nolan v. Dillon, </em>261 Md. 516, 276 A.2d 36 (1971) and decisions from other courts in which package inserts have been admitted in negligence cases, to conclude that this information could have been material to Mr. Fusco\u2019s decision to consent to the use of Amifostine. <em>See Fusco, </em>210 Md.App. at 431-32, 63 A.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We disagree with the Court of Special Appeals and agree with Judge Green that, based on <em>Waldt, </em>evidence regarding the package insert, which pertained solely to the fact that it warned against use in an elderly population, was properly excluded. In <em>Waldt, </em>in <em>dicta, </em>we cited with approval language from the intermediate appellate court that had opined that, whether a procedure or treatment is contraindicated is relevant and admissible evidence in a negligence cause of action, but not in informed consent case. Although it was <em>dicta, </em>our pronouncement finds support in our jurisprudence. In <em>McQuitty, </em>we elucidated the distinction between negligence and informed consent; in a negligence cause of action, the relevant inquiry is whether the physician \u201cbreached a duty to exercise ordinary medical care and skill based upon the standard of care in the profession,\u201d whereas, in an informed consent cause of action, the focal point is whether the physician made an adequate disclosure of information regarding the procedure or treatment. <em>McQuitty, </em>410 Md. at 18-19, 976 A.2d at 1030. With regard to the administration of pharma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ceutical drugs, one commentator has observed, \u201c[a] typical medical malpractice claim in the prescription drug realm would deal with the administration of the wrong medicine, the incorrect dosage, or some other similar error. Negligence under informed consent, by contrast, is based on the theory that the patient was not apprised of all material risks, and was therefore unable to properly consent to the administration of drugs\u201d. John G. Culhane et al., <em>Toward a Mature Doctrine of Informed Consent: Lessons From A Comparative Law Analysis, </em>1 Brit. J. Am. Legal Stud. 551, 567 (2012). The package insert\u2019s warning, which suggested that Amifostine should not be administered to an elderly patient, may have supported a claim of negligence in the administration of the drug to Mr. Fusco.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>We address, finally, Judge Green\u2019s decision to exclude evidence regarding the FDA-approved uses of Amifostine. The issue was first presented in Dr. Trovato\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>deposition, in which he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT]: Let\u2019s go back and clear this up. Did the FDA approve the use for amifostine in the treatment of cancer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">[DR. TROVATO]: Yes, the FDA did do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT]: What is the FDA approved use of amifostine in the treatment of cancer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">[DR. TROVATO]: There are only two FDA approved indications for amifostine. One of them is to decrease the risk of nephrotoxicity or kidney toxicity in patients receiving specifically cisplatin, which is therapy agent, that was approved in ovarian cancer patients. It\u2019s also approved for use in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy to protect their prod glands, you know, from \u2014 basically, the end result is to prevent dry mouth in patients receiving radiation therapy to their head and neck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT]: Is there any FDA approved usage of amifostine for prostate cancer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">[DR. TROVATO]: There is no FDA approved indication for use of amifostine in prostate <em>cancer.[</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em>]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The issue of FDA-approval then was resurrected when the Fuscos sought to introduce the deposition testimony of Dr. Shannon at trial, in which he had testified that he was aware that Amifostine was not approved by the FDA for the treatment of prostate cancer patients:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: Do you know whether or not the FDA has approved Amifostine in the treatment of prostate cancer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">[DR. SHANNON]: I do know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: What is the answer to that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">[DR. SHANNON]: The indications are for conditions that don\u2019t include prostate cancer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">[COUNSEL FOR THE FUSCOS]: Okay. So the FDA has not approved Amifostine as a drug for prostate cancer. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be used off label, but it\u2019s not a drug that the FDA has approved for that use, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">[DR. SHANNON]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">As with the package insert, Judge Green relied on <em>Waldt </em>to determine that such evidence was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">The parties advance similar arguments pertaining to the admissibility of Amifostine\u2019s FDA-approval status as they did to the package insert. Dr. Shannon asserts that the FDA-approval status was only offered in support of Dr. Trovato\u2019s opinion that Amifostine was inappropriately <em>used, </em>and thus, sounded in negligence and argues, moreover, that pursuant to our decision in <em>Waldt, </em>FDA-approval status is irrelevant in an informed consent cause of action. As with the warnings in the package insert, the Fuscos contend that the regulatory status of a drug may be material information that a reasonable patient would want to know prior to consenting to treatment. The Court of Special Appeals agreed that FDA-approval or lack thereof could have been a material consideration to Mr. Fusco\u2019s decision to consent to treatment involving the administration of Amifostine. <em>Fusco, </em>210 Md.App. at 436, 63 A.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>As we have explained, our decision in <em>Waldt </em>was based on the procedural inadequacy of the proffer of expert testimony, and thus, language quoted from our intermediate appellate court, which opined that the FDA-approval status is not relevant in an informed consent cause of action, is <em>dicta. </em>In <em>Waldt, </em>we quoted the following language from our intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">The excerpts from the record the Waldts argue constituted a proffer reveal that the only proffered (albeit vaguely) substantive testimony of Dr. Debrun was that the neuroform stent device was not approved for use on Mrs. Waldt\u2019s type of aneurysm. This is not a proffer of a risk inherent to the procedure that Mrs. Waldt underwent. It is a proffer of expert testimony that the procedure was contraindicated for Mrs. Waldt, and therefore should not have been performed on her. That expert testimony would be relevant to an ordinary negligence claim, <em>i.e., </em>that the doctors breached the standard of care in their treatment of Mrs. Waldt by performing a contraindicated procedure on her. It is not relevant to an informed consent claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>Waldt, </em>181 Md.App. at 236, 956 A.2d at 248. Although <em>dicta, </em>as we opined earlier, we find the language persuasive and consistent with our informed consent jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In the context of medical devices, many of our sister courts have opined that the FDA-regulatory status is not relevant to an informed consent cause of action. <em>See, e.g., Blazoski v. Cook, </em>346 N.J.Super. 256, 787 A.2d 910, 913 (2002); <em>Alvarez v. Smith, </em>714 So.2d 652, 653 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). Indeed, in the instant case, although our intermediate appellate court determined that the FDA-approval status is a pertinent part of an informed consent discussion, it cited to only one case that considered the relevance of the FDA\u2019s regulatory status in an informed consent cause of action that came to the opposite conclusion, <em>Southard v. Temple University Hospital, </em>566 Pa. 335, 781 A.2d 101, 102 (2001), in which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania considered \u201cthe issue of whether the doctrine of informed consent requires surgeons to advise their patients of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s ... regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>status of a medical device.\u201d In concluding that no such obligation exists, the Pennsylvania court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">The category into which the FDA places the device for marketing and labeling purposes simply does not enlighten the patient as to the nature or seriousness of the proposed operation, the organs of the body involved, the disease sought to be cured, or the possible results. The FDA administrative label does not constitute a material fact, risk, complication or alternative to a surgical procedure. It follows that a physician need not disclose a device\u2019s FDA classification to the patient in order to ensure that the patient has been fully informed regarding the procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQA\"><em>Id. </em>at 107 (citation omitted). Although addressing the regulatory status of a surgical device, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s reasoning is equally applicable to the regulatory status of a drug; it also is not a \u201cmaterial fact, risk,\u201d or \u201ccomplication\u201d of a drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The Fuscos argue, however, that simply because the FDA-status is not a \u201crisk,\u201d such as nausea and vomiting, it is nonetheless relevant, because in Maryland, physicians are required to disclose \u201cother pertinent information regarding the treatment or procedure\u201d. Likewise, the intermediate appellate court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">Although \u201cpatients generally do not base their decision to purchase a prescription medication on the instructions for its consumption or use or any information contained in the informational pamphlet accompanying the prescription drug.\u201d <em>Rite Aid Corp. v. Levy-Gray, </em>391 Md. 608, 640, 894 A.2d 563 (2006) (Harrell, J., dissenting), we disagree with our sister states, and perceive that this information could have been a material consideration regarding Mr. Fusco\u2019s decision whether to consent to the use of Amifostine. <em>See Waldt II, </em>411 Md. at 241, 983 A.2d 112 (Adkins, J., dissenting) (stating, \u201c[information about the lack of FDA approval is something that a patient could reasonably want to consider in deciding whether to place her confidence and trust in [his or] her physician about the treatment [he or] she is about to undertake.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Fusco, </em>210 Md.App. at 436, 63 A.3d at 167 (footnote omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">A review of the \u201cother pertinent information\u201d that we have determined may require disclosure as part of an informed consent discussion, however, reveals that this information is limited to that which, in some way, will impact the medical treatment. <em>See, e.g., Faya v. Almaraz, </em>329 Md. 435, 448-50, 620 A.2d 327, 334 (1993) (opining that a surgeon may need to disclose his HIV-status as part of an informed consent discussion, because, <em>inter alia, </em>it was foreseeable that the physician might transmit the HIV virus to the patient during surgery); <em>Dingle v. Belin, </em>358 Md. 354, 370-71, 749 A.2d 157, 165-66 (2000) (opining that the identity of the physician who will be performing a surgery may require disclosure as part of an informed consent discussion); <em>Goldberg v. Boone, </em>396 Md. 94, 125-27, 912 A.2d 698, 717 (2006) (opining that the availability of more experienced surgeons to perform a surgery than the treating physician, at least when the surgery is complex and the treating physician had only performed it once in the previous three years, may be material information that needs to be disclosed).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Information pertaining to an \u201coff-label\u201d use provides the patient with no information about the treatment itself. As the Pennsylvania court recognized in <em>Southard, </em>\u201c \u2018[t]he mere fact that the FDA has not cleared a product for a particular use does not mean that the product is not in fact suitable for that purpose; it simply means that the FDA has not cleared it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southard, </em>781 A.2d at 107, quoting <em>Holland v. Smith &amp; Nephew Richards, Inc., </em>100 F.Supp.2d 53 (D.Mass.1999). Because it provides no information regarding the medical treatment, it cannot, therefore, be considered material information to an informed consent discussion.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> We note, finally, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>respect to this issue, that the FDA-approval status does not provide any information regarding the materiality of the risks of the administration of Amifostine; it does not inform the fact-finder of the likelihood or severity of any risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Having concluded that Judge Green did not abuse his discretion in excluding Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony nor in excluding evidence related to the package insert or the FDA-approval status of Amifostine, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.

Dr. Shannon directs us to a number of cases relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals in which some of our sister states determined that a pharmacist or a pharmacologist was not qualified to testify against a physician in a negligence cause of action. <em>See Hollabaugh v. Arkansas State Med. Bd., </em>43 Ark.App. 83, 861 S.W.2d 317, 318 (1993); <em>Chandler v. Koenig, </em>203 Ga.App. 684, 417 S.E.2d 715, 716 (1992); <em>Bell v. Hart, </em>516 So.2d 562, 565 (Ala.1987); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>118 Ariz. 13, 574 P.2d 481, 486 (Ariz.Ct.App.1977). In all of these cases, however, our sister courts opined that the pharmacist was not qualified to testify about the <em>standard of care </em>in a negligence cause of action. As we have explained, negligence and informed consent are distinct causes of action, and moreover, Dr. Trovato was <em>not </em>testifying about whether Dr. Shannon\u2019s informed consent discussion fell below the standard of care. We, therefore, find these cases inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The Court of Special Appeals did, however, rely on a number of other negligence cases in support of its conclusion that Dr. Trovato was qualified to testify in this case. <em>See, e.g., Sinkfield v. Oh et al., 229 </em>Ga.App. 883, 495 S.E.2d 94, 95-96 (1997); <em>Tidwell v. Upjohn Co., </em>626 So.2d 1297, 1300 (Ala.1993). Because negligence and informed consent are two distinct causes of action, we do not, so as to avoid blurring the line between the two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b85-8\">. Dr. Shannon\u2019s assertion that Section 3-2A-02(c)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2013 Repl. Vol.), part of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act, renders a pharmacist <em>per se </em>unqualified to testify in an informed consent action against a physician is without merit. Section 3-2A-02(c)(l) provides that \u201cthe health care provider is not liable for the payment of damages unless it is established that the care given by the health care provider is not in accordance with the standards of practice among members of the same health care profession\u2019\u2019. Dr. Shannon posits, therefore, that because Dr. Trovato is not a member of the same health care profession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>as Dr. Shannon, he is not qualified to testify as an expert. In this, Dr. Shannon conflates negligence with informed consent, thus blurring the distinction between these two causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">. Severity and likelihood of risk are defined by the use of empirical data and are phrased in terms of statistical probability. Severity of illness is defined as \"the degree of ... risk of disease manifested by patients, based either on clinical data from the medical records or on hospital discharge/billing data.\u201d Stedman's Medical Dictionary 947 (28th ed.2006). Likelihood, moreover, relates to the chance or probability that an injury or consequence will occur. <em>See Precourt v. Frederick, </em>395 Mass. 689, 694-95, 481 N.E.2d 1144, 1148 (Mass.1985) (\"The materiality of information about a potential injury is a function not only of the severity of the injury, but also of the likelihood that it will occur. Regardless of the severity of a potential injury, if the probability that the injury will occur is so small as to be practically nonexistent, then the possibility of that injury occurring cannot be considered a material factor in a rational assessment of whether to engage in the activity that exposes one to the potential injury.\u201d); <em>see also Harbeson v. Parke Davis, Inc., </em>746 F.2d 517, 523 (9th Cir.1984) (opining that testimony about empirical research that indicated that certain birth defects are two-to-three times more likely to occur in those taking the drug Dilantin supported the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the birth defect was a material risk); <em>Barcai v. Betwee, </em>98 Hawai'i 470, 50 P.3d 946, 962-63 (2002) (opining that expert testimony that the allegedly undisclosed risk manifested itself in one out of every eight thousand patients provided the necessary expert testimony regarding likelihood to submit the question of whether the undisclosed risk was material to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Dr. Trovato\u2019s testimony embraced only the relative terms of \"most common,\u201d when he opined about which adverse effects were \"most common,\u201d and \"severe,\u201d when he described certain adverse effects as \"very severe skin eruptions.\u201d The terms \"most common\u201d and \"severe\u201d are relative terms, lacking foundation in empirical research and definition in statistical realities. In this regard, we find helpful the Massachusetts Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Precourt, </em>481 N.E.2d at 1149, in which the court opined that expert testimony that the allegedly undisclosed risk of the drug Prednisone, aseptic necrosis, was \"high,\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\"no evidence of the likelihood that a person would develop aseptic necrosis after taking Prednisone,\u201d because \" '[h]igh\u2019 is a relative word. It could mean one in ten, but it could just as well mean one in a million.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">. We also would note that, both Dr. Trovato\u2019s <em>de bene esse </em>testimony and written proffer pertained, primarily, to his opinion that Amifostine was inappropriately administered to Mr. Fusco, because of the fact that the FDA had not approved Amifostine to supplement treatment of undergoing radiation therapy for prostate cancer and that the package insert warned against use in an elderly population, because its effects were not yet known. As a basis for excluding Dr. Trovato's testimony, Judge Green reasoned that the testimony would confuse the jury because it sounded in negligence. We agree. As we explained, <em>supra, </em>informed consent and negligence are distinct causes of action and whether a treatment is contraindicated for a patient may be relevant evidence that the physician\u2019s actions in treating the patient fell below the standard of care, but it is not relevant in an informed consent action. <em>See Waldt, </em>411 Md. at 236, 983 A.2d at 128-29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b89-11\">. The subsequent written proffer similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-12\">10. Dr. Trovato will testify that the package insert of Amifostine gives a precaution as to the administration of the drug to an elderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>patient, like Plaintiff, because the toxic effects of the drug have not been tested on an elderly population.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">. We note, in this regard, that the Court of Special Appeals relied only on negligence cases to support its conclusion that evidence regarding the package insert was admissible in an informed consent case. <em>See Fusco v. Shannon, </em>210 Md.App. 399, 431-33, 63 A.3d 145, 164-65 (2013). In <em>Nolan, </em>the plaintiff filed a negligence cause of action against a physician after an injection of a drug called Sparine allegedly caused portions of three of the plaintiff's fingers to become gangrenous and later amputated. The trial judge gave a jury instruction that the jury was permitted to consider warnings and other information contained in the package insert as evidence of whether the treating physician fell below the standard of care. We granted <em>certiorari, </em>to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the instruction was proper. We concluded that the package insert of a drug \"does not standing alone establish a standard of care,\u201d but rather, was \"prime facie proof of proper use,\u201d and thus, concluded that the jury instruction was \"quite proper.\u201d <em>Nolan v. Dillon, </em>261 Md. 516, 540, 276 A.2d 36, 49 (1971). In the other cases cited by the intermediate appellate court relative to the package insert, many of our sister courts also opined that the package insert is relevant and admissible in a negligence case as to the standard of care. <em>See Garvey </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donoghue, </em>530 A.2d 1141, 1146 (D.C.1987) (opining that package inserts of medication \"are relevant and probative evidence of the medical standard of care for selecting, administering, and monitoring the drug\u201d); <em>Thompson v. Carter, </em>518 So.2d 609, 613 (Miss.1987) (\"[T]lie package insert ... should not be taken as conclusive evidence of the physician\u2019s standard of care, nor should a departure from the directions contained in the package insert be considered to establish a prima facie case of negligence. However, ... the package insert contains prima facie proof of the proper method of use ... and, for those purposes, was admissible at trial.\u201d); <em>Rodriguez, </em>574 P.2d at 486 (\"While the package insert is admissible into evidence, it does not establish conclusive evidence of the standard or accepted practice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the use of the drug by physicians and surgeons, nor that a departure from such directions is negligence.\u201d). As these cases clearly demonstrate, the package insert\u2019s warnings are relevant evidence as to whether the treating physician\u2019s conduct fell below the standard of care in prescribing or administering medication, an issue of no relevance in an informed consent action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\">. Dr. Trovato\u2019s written proffer similarly stated that \"Dr. Trovato will testify about the approved FDA uses at the time that Amifostine was administered to Anthony Fusco.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Having determined that the FDA-approval status of a drug need not be a necessary part of an informed consent discussion, we find no merit to the Fuscos\u2019 contention that, because Dr. Shannon testified in his deposition that he advised Mr. Fusco that the drug was being pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>scribed in an off-label manner, its FDA-status was necessarily relevant evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b98-8\">ELDRIDGE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Anz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">I dissent. <em>See Univ. of Md.
