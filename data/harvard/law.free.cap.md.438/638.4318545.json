Dr. Samuel filed a complaint against Narasimhan with the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On December 28, 2012, in this Court, Bar Counsel filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Narasimhan, charging her with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 1.1 (Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4 (Communication Generally), 7.1 (Communications Concerning a Lawyer\u2019s Services), 8.4(a) (Violating MLRPC), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation), and 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice). On January 9, 2013, we referred this attorney discipline proceeding to the Honorable Eric M. Johnson (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d). On June 3, 4, 5, and 6, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On July 26, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court findings of fact and conclusions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>law, concluding that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 7.1, 8.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">On March 10, 2014, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we suspend Narasimhan from the practice of law in Maryland for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">I. Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">In his opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">On June 11, 2007, this Court admitted Narasimhan to the Bar of Maryland. For the next year and a half, Narasimhan took temporary jobs at a personal injury firm and as a contract attorney completing document review. In January 2009, Narasimhan met Edmundo Gordon Rogers, Esquire (\u201cRogers\u201d) through an advertisement on the website Craig\u2019s List. Rogers represented that he was an experienced immigration attorney who had been practicing law for sixteen years. Eventually, Narasimhan and Rogers established The Immigration Law Group (\u201cILG\u201d) by executing a Joint Venture Master Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). Under the Agreement, Narasimhan was to be \u201cprimarily responsible for the conduct of the office, business development, control of finances, [and the] practice of law[,]\u201d and Rogers was to provide \u201cadvice and legal expertise\u201d and to research \u201clegal issues that will arise in the conduct of the law practice.\u201d Under the Agreement, Narasimhan and Rogers were to equally share ILG\u2019s profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In 2009, the MPD sought an immigration attorney to assist in securing permanent residency for its employee, Dr. Samuel, through the completion of the EB-2 Permanent Residency process. Dr. Samuel, a Canadian citizen who was in the United States pursuant to a work visa that would not lead to permanent residency, had been hired by the MPD as a project specialist tasked with overseeing a new program. On November 4, 2009, only three months after forming ILG, Narasimhan, on behalf of ILG, answered the MPD\u2019s request for a proposal seeking representation for Dr. Samuel by submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>a Request for Quotation, Proposal, her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Rogers\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">In the Proposal, Narasimhan stated that she was \u201cwell-versed\u201d in, and had \u201ca good knowledge of[,] the immigration laws.\u201d In her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Narasimhan stated that she had represented \u201cimmigration clients in documentary immigration processes and litigation\u201d and had \u201chandled Family petitions and Citizenship applications.\u201d Significantly, though, Narasimhan had never: (1) represented clients in the \u201cdocumentary immigration processes\u201d; (2) represented clients in immigration litigation; or (3) \u201chandled Family petitions and Citizenship applications.\u201d Thus, Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 contained several misrepresentations about her legal experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The MPD chose ILG to assist in establishing permanent residency for Dr. Samuel based on Rogers\u2019s experience and Narasimhan\u2019s ability to provide local services as a member of the Bar of Maryland. ILG was to be paid a total of $2,800 for the representation, which was to commence on November 20, 2009. ILG\u2019s primary liaison at the MPD was Diane Haines Walton (\u201cHaines\u201d), the MPD\u2019s Director of Human Resources; Haines authorized Narasimhan to speak with Dr. Samuel about the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Shortly after the MPD selected ILG, Narasimhan traveled to India, where she remained from December 3, 2009, until January 31, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Narasimhan was \u201clargely unavailable\u201d during the time that she was in India and asked Rogers to \u201ctake the lead\u201d on the representation while she was out of the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On December 10, 2009, a conference call was held; Narasimhan did not participate in the conference call. The hearing judge determined that the December 10, 2009, conference call \u201cwould eventually prove to be essential.\u201d Narasimhan did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>respond to the MPD\u2019s request for a second conference call on December 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">On January 20, 2010, Narasimhan advised the MPD that ILG was ready to file \u201cForm 9089\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> online \u201cnext week.\u201d Narasimhan failed to file Form 9089 online, however, and gave no explanation for the failure. Between February 1, 2010, and March 15, 2010, Narasimhan, Rogers, and Dr. Samuel prepared multiple paper drafts of Form 9089. On March 28, 2010, Narasimhan mailed an incomplete and incorrect version of Form 9089 to the Department of Labor (\u201cthe DOL\u201d). On April 2, 2010, Narasimhan submitted an invoice to the MPD for $1,800 for filing Form 9089. On or about May 27, 2010, the Government of the District of Columbia paid the invoice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On April 15, 2010, Dr. Samuel e-mailed Narasimhan and Rogers a series of questions concerning the labor certification process and requested available options, as her work visa would expire in January 2011. Narasimhan replied to Dr. Samuel\u2019s e-mail, assuring her that Rogers would provide answers to her questions. Narasimhan did not answer any of Dr. Samuel\u2019s questions, but instead asked Rogers to respond \u201cASAP.\u201d On or about April 26, 2010, Dr. Samuel telephoned Narasimhan and left a voicemail stating that she had not received any substantive answers to her questions. Narasimhan thereafter advised Dr. Samuel that the delay was due to Rogers\u2019s travel schedule and other assignments. On May 2, 2010, Rogers provided a partial response to Dr. Samuel\u2019s email.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In a letter dated May 3, 2010, the DOL advised the MPD that it was denying certification of Form 9089. Almost all the reasons for denial by the DOL were the result of Narasimhan\u2019s failure to: (1) adequately inform the MPD of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>quirements of the recruitment process; (2) obtain the necessary information to complete Form 9089; and (3) file the correct version of Form 9089 with the information she had obtained. Even if Narasimhan had mailed the correct version of Form 9089, the DOL still would have denied certification because of substantial omissions and misinformation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">On May 8, 2010, Narasimhan and Rogers met with Dr. Samuel and Haines to discuss the denial letter and Dr. Samuel\u2019s options. At the meeting, Narasimhan advised the MPD that a corrected Form 9089 could be filed with the DOL. On May 12, 2010, Narasimhan, for the first time, filed Form 9141, requesting a prevailing wage determination. The DOL requires that Form 9141 be completed prior to, and as part of, the submission of Form 9089. On May 27, 2010, at the request of Dr. Samuel and the MPD, Narasimhan submitted a handwritten Form 9089 that Dr. Samuel had completed. On June 3, 2010, Narasimhan filed a typewritten Form 9089 with the DOL to \u201cclarify any illegible section or portions of the handwritten document.\u201d On June 8, 2010, Narasimhan mailed a letter to the DOL requesting review of the May 3, 2010, denial of certification. On June 21, 2010, Narasimhan mailed another letter to the DOL regarding the refiled Form 9089 and request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">On June 15, 2010, and July 14, 2010, Haines and Dr. Samuel, respectively, requested information from ILG about obtaining a one-year extension to Dr. Samuel\u2019s current work visa. Neither Haines nor Dr. Samuel received a response from Narasimhan or Rogers with information regarding an extension of Dr. Samuel\u2019s current work visa.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In June 2010, the MPD received a second invoice from ILG. At that time, the MPD advised Narasimhan that it would not pay for additional work related to the refiling of Form 9089 that resulted from her errors and omissions. In response, Narasimhan submitted a modified invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On July 14, 2010, Dr. Samuel and Haines requested a conference call with Narasimhan and Rogers to receive an update on the status of the case and to discuss the appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>process. The requested conference call never occurred, and neither Dr. Samuel nor the MPD was provided with the requested information concerning the appeals process. On July 20, 2010, the MPD sent an e-mail terminating ILG\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In September 2010, the DOL again denied Dr. Samuel\u2019s certification. On November 15, 2011, the Board of Labor Certification Appeals affirmed denial of the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Before the hearing judge, the Commission called Michael L. Kabik, Esquire (\u201cKabik\u201d) as an expert in immigration law. Kabik opined, with a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that Narasimhan lacked the necessary and required legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation to represent the MPD. Kabik further opined that the MPD was unable to make informed decisions regarding the permanent residency process due to Narasimhan\u2019s failure to adequately explain the representation and the residency process. The hearing judge credited Kabik\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">II. Evidence Adduced at the Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The following evidence was adduced at the hearing of June 3-6, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The Proposal and Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the Proposal, Narasimhan described herself as follows: \u201cBeing an immigrant [myself, I am] well-versed and ha[ve] a good knowledge of the immigration laws in this country[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, under her job description with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ILG, Narasimhan stated that she had represented \u201cImmigration clients in documentary immigration processes and litigation\u201d and had handled \u201cFamily petitions and Citizenship applications.\u201d Specifically, Narasimhan\u2019s job description with ILG appeared on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\">\n<em>EXPERIENCE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">THE IMMIGRATION LAW GROUP (A Joint Venture),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Alexandria, VA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">Attorney/Joint Venturer, July 20, 2009 \u2014 Present</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFi1\">Representation of Immigration clients in documentary immigration processes and litigation. Handled Family petitions and Citizenship applications.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Before the hearing judge, Narasimhan testified that the job description under ILG stating \u201cRepresentation of immigration clients, and documentary immigration processes and litigation\u201d was not intended to describe her job experience, but instead \u201cwas the description of [ILG] and what it was formed to do\u201d and was meant to be a prospective statement of the work she anticipated ILG to complete. When asked whether she informed anyone at the MPD that her \u201cintention with that first sentence on [her] r[\u00e9]sum[\u00e9] was p[ro]spective and [] didn\u2019t reflect any actual experience that [she] had[,]\u201d Narasimhan answered that she \u201cassumed they knew alreadyf.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Narasimhan testified that, at the time she submitted her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the MPD, ILG had not handled any matters that had resulted in litigation. Narasimhan admitted that there is no such thing as a \u201cCitizenship application\u201d as stated on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and that \u201c[w]hat [she] meant in layman terms is basically an N-400 Application for Naturalization.\u201d Narasim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>han testified that she had handled only two Applications for Naturalization, one in 2007 and one in 2008, both before she formed ILG. When asked why she listed that she had experience with \u201cCitizenship applications\u201d under her job description with ILG, Narasimhan stated: \u201cBecause it was immigration experience, it was related experience, and my intent was to communicate the nature of my limited immigration experience in layman\u2019s terms basically.\u201d Narasimhan explained that the two Applications for Naturalization she had completed were done for her friends, and that she never received compensation for her work, was not retained by the individuals, and never entered her appearance with any government agency related to the applications. As to the statement on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that she had handled \u201cFamily petitions,\u201d Narasimhan admitted that she had completed only one family petition and that the plural word \u201cpetitions\u201d on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u201cwas a typo.\u201d Narasimhan admitted that the family petition that she listed on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was actually prepared by Rogers, and her assistance was clerical.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">On November 30, 2009, after ILG\u2019s representation of the MPD commenced, Narasimhan sent an e-mail to Haines outlining the \u201clabor certification steps.\u201d Narasimhan\u2019s e-mail was forwarded to Rogers, who sent a reply e-mail to Narasimhan, stating: \u201cThis is good [Narasimhan]. Well done. I like your prompt response and dedication to customer service.\u201d These two e-mails were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">As to the December 10, 2009, conference call in which Narasimhan did not participate, the hearing judge admitted into evidence an exchange of e-mails among Rogers, Haines, Dr. Samuel, and Narasimhan ranging from December 8, 2009, through December 10, 2009. In an e-mail dated December 8, 2009, Rogers provided Haines with a brief outline of the EB-2 permanent residency classification and requested \u201csome necessary information\u201d to be discussed during the December 10, 2009, conference call, including Dr. Samuel\u2019s professional and academic background and her current job description. Narasimhan was copied on the e-mail. The following day, Haines e-mailed Rogers, Narasimhan, and Dr. Samuel, and advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that she would be sending documents requested by Rogers, including a job description, copy of a proposed advertisement to be placed in a local newspaper, and a statement of work outlining Dr. Samuel\u2019s duties. On December 10, 2009, Narasimhan responded that she would be unable to join the conference call, but stated that Rogers would share \u201cboth his and my thoughts[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The hearing judge admitted into evidence an e-mail sent by Haines after the conference call occurred, memorializing the topics discussed during the call. In the e-mail, Haines wrote that, among other things: (1) Rogers stated he would \u201creview employment ads submitted by prior clients to see if the employment ad [that the MPD] sent [him] is sufficient\u201d; (2) the parties had \u201cdiscussed the interview process and whether [the MPD] can share the names of applicants who apply lor jobs\u201d; (3) Dr. Samuel had already completed Form 9089; and (4) Dr. Samuel would send information and documents for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The hearing judge admitted into evidence a May 3, 2010, letter, in which the DOL advised the MPD that it was denying certification of Form 9089, and provided the following reasons for the denial: (1) six different items were incomplete on the application, including boxes to identify the occupation title and prevailing wage; (2) Form 9089 indicated that no notice of filing for a permanent employment certification application was posted in a conspicuous location at the place of employment for ten business days; and (3) the newspaper advertisement placed by the MPD was not placed on a Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The hearing judge admitted into evidence a February 2, 2012, letter, in which Narasimhan replied to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for a response to Dr. Samuel\u2019s complaint by denying any violation of the MLRPC and stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">Throughout the period that I represented the MPD, I consulted repeatedly with [ ] Rogers in order to check my conclusions, obtain his review of the documents, and the like, before I communicated advice to the MPD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>[ ] On the same day that ILG received the contract for legal services from the MPD, I sent a detailed e[-]mail of the Labor certification process to the MPD[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">[ ] I, in conjunction with [ ] Rogers, worked with Dr. Samuel to complete the initial Form 9089 in four review cycles[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">III.

For the below reasons, we overrule Narasimhan\u2019s exceptions, determine that the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and uphold all of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-14\">B.

Perhaps the most fundamental legal skill consists of determining what kind of legal problems a situation may involve, a skill that necessarily transcends any particular specialized knowledge.

Competent representation can also be provided through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">This Court has cautioned lawyers undertaking legal work in an unfamiliar field to \u201ctake careful thought as to their competence to practice in \u2018specialty\u2019 areas[.]\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kendrick, </em>403 Md. 489, 515, 943 A.2d 1173, 1187 (2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Where \u201can attorney \u2018plunges into a field in which he or she is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>competent, and as a consequence makes mistakes that demonstrate incompetence, the [MLRPC] demands that discipline be imposed[ J \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 943 A.2d at 1187-88 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.1. It is evident that Narasimhan lacked the necessary experience in, and knowledge of, immigration law and procedure to competently represent the MPD at the time she was retained. Before forming ILG with Rogers, only a few months prior to the MPD\u2019s retaining ILG, Narasimhan had not worked in immigration law; her experience was limited to two discrete applications for naturalization performed for friends and providing clerical assistance to Rogers on a family petition. Narasimhan\u2019s lack of competence was demonstrated by her submission of an incomplete version of Form 9089 to the DOL. The DOL explained that one of the reasons for denial of certification of Form 9089 was that the form was incomplete; <em>ie., </em>there were six different items left incomplete or blank on the form, including boxes to identify the occupation title and prevailing wage. The hearing judge determined that Narasimhan\u2019s failure to obtain the necessary information to complete Form 9089 directly led to the DOL\u2019s denial of certification. The evidence adduced at the hearing supports this finding. The record demonstrates that Narasimhan\u2019s lack of competence led to the denial of certification because she not only lacked the necessary expertise to complete and file the form, but also was not sufficiently prepared to submit a completed form. Compounding the errors, Narasimhan failed to file Form 9141, requesting a prevailing wage determination, prior to submitting Form 9089, as required by the DOL.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Although an attorney can provide competent representation through association with an attorney \u201cof established competence in the field in question[,]\u201d MLRPC 1.1 cmt. [2], such was not the case here. To begin, setting aside any issue as to Narasimhan\u2019s competence, or lack thereof, as the hearing judge concluded, Narasimhan failed to ascertain whether Rogers was, in fact, competent in the field of immigration law. As Narasimhan\u2019s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>record reveals that Narasimhan\u2019s \u201cvetting\u201d of Rogers consisted solely of the following: meeting with Rogers; verifying that Rogers was a member of good standing of the Bar of Arkansas; and assisting Rogers during public seminars on immigration law. Thus, Narasimhan failed to examine Rogers\u2019s qualifications or to verify his qualifications and claims of expertise through any third party.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In any event, regardless of Rogers\u2019s qualifications, it is evident that Narasimhan accepted responsibility for the MPD\u2019s representation. In the ILG Agreement, Narasimhan agreed to be \u201cprimarily responsible for the ... practice of law.\u201d Narasimhan advised the MPD during the proposal process that she \u2014 not Rogers \u2014 would be the attorney named as the District of Columbia contact and the \u201cprincipal point of contact with the\u201d government. During Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of Dr. Samuel\u2019s complaint, Narasimhan responded, in writing, that she had \u201crepresented the MPD[.]\u201d Narasimhan\u2014 not Rogers \u2014 submitted the Form 9089. Also, the record demonstrates that the initial communication after the MPD retained ILG came from Narasimhan, who e-mailed Haines an outline of the \u201clabor certification steps.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Given the above circumstances, we have no difficulty in concluding that Narasimhan, not Rogers, was responsible for representing the MPD. As such, Narasimhan was required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>under the MLRPC, to provide competent representation utilizing \u201cthe legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d MLRPC 1.1. The hearing judge correctly concluded that Narasimhan failed to do so. So accurate is this conclusion that, at oral argument, Narasimhan\u2019s counsel conceded that the violation of MLRPC 1.1 \u201cis established because, ultimately, the client did not receive the quality of representation that [Narasimhan] had hoped for and intended.\u201d For the above reasons, we conclude that the violation of MLRPC 1.1 has been established by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">MLRPC 1.3 (Diligence)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Narasimhan excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 1.3, and contends that she responded promptly and diligently to communications from Haines and Dr. Samuel. Narasimhan asserts that she \u201cresponded promptly to all inquiries by facilitating communication with her more experienced colleague[, Rogers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d MLRPC 1.3. For example, an attorney violates MLRPC 1.3 by failing to keep a client informed as to the status of the case and by failing to respond to the client\u2019s inquiries. See <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 192, 46 A.3d 1153, 1160 (2012) (\u201c[The lawyer\u2019s failure to keep the [clients] informed as to the status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the applications and his failure to respond to the [clients\u2019] inquiries both violate MLRPC 1.3.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.3. The record unequivocally establishes that Narasimhan failed to respond to and/or communicate with Haines and Dr. Samuel on several occasions about important matters related to the MPD\u2019s representation. To begin, Narasimhan failed to participate in the first conference call on December 10, 2009. Later, after the DOL denied certification of Form 9089, both Haines and Dr. Samuel requested information from ILG about obtaining a one-year extension to Dr. Samuel\u2019s work visa. Neither Narasimhan nor Rogers provided a response to Haines or Dr. Samuel regarding the requested information. Haines and Dr. Samuel requested a conference call to receive an update on the status of the case and to discuss the appeals process. The requested conference call did not take place, and neither Narasimhan nor Rogers provided the requested information concerning the appeals process. Less than one week after the failed attempt to obtain information and a status update, the MPD terminated ILG\u2019s representation. Thus, there were multiple occasions on which Narasimhan failed to respond at all to requests for information, and she also failed to provide a requested status update. As to Narasimhan\u2019s claim that she responded by facilitating communication with Rogers, Narasimhan accepted primary responsibility for representing the MPD; as such, it was incumbent upon Narasimhan to provide the requested information herself or to ensure that Rogers responded in full. Under these circumstances, we have no difficulty in concluding that Narasimhan\u2019s violation of MLRPC 1.3 is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">MLRPC 1.4 (Communication Generally)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Narasimhan excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 1.4(a), and contends that she maintained communication with Haines and Dr. Samuel throughout ILG\u2019s representation of the MPD, including during the time she was in India. Narasimhan specifically excepts to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>hearing judge\u2019s finding of fact that she was \u201clargely unavailable\u201d during her trip to India. Narasimhan argues that she did not violate MLRPC 1.4(b), that Rogers \u201cprovided virtually all of the legal advice rendered to the MPD[,]\u201d and that the hearing judge erred in excluding her testimony as to the matters about which Rogers advised the MPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">MLRPC 1.4 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-5\">(a) A lawyer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-9\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyer\u2019s conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the [MLRPC] or other law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-10\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">Comment [5] to MLRPC 1.4 explains that \u201c[t]he client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued.... Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance that is involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.4(a). Narasimhan failed to keep the MPD informed about the status of the matter and failed to respond promptly, on multiple occasions, to requests for information, even though she had advised the MPD that she was the \u201cprincipal point of contact\u201d and would be the attorney \u201cnamed as [the] DC contact[.]\u201d Glaringly, Narasimhan failed to respond to requests made on June 15, 2010, and July 14, 2010, by Haines and Dr. Samuel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>respectively, requesting information about obtaining a one-year extension to Dr. Samuel\u2019s current work visa. Specifically, on June 15, 2010, Haines sent a letter to Rogers at ILG\u2019s Maryland address raising concerns about the DOL\u2019s denial of certification and Narasimhan\u2019s work performance, and requesting an itemization of work related to the second filing of Form 9089. Haines testified that in response to the June 15, 2010, letter, she received an invoice, which was sent by e-mail from Narasimhan to Haines, charging for expenses related to filing the second Form 9089. Haines testified that she did not get an actual response to the June 15, 2010, letter except for an invoice. Consistent with Haines\u2019s testimony, the record does not demonstrate that either Narasimhan or Rogers responded and addressed Haines\u2019s concerns. And, on July 14, 2010, Dr. Samuel sent an e-mail to Rogers and Narasimhan requesting: (1) that a conference call take place on July 16, 2010, with Haines; and (2) that certain information be provided, including an update on the case, the possibility of appeal, and the process of applying for an extension of Dr. Samuel\u2019s work visa. Narasimhan e-mailed Haines and Dr. Samuel advising that Rogers was out of the country and she would need to \u201csee if [he was] available to talk\u201d on July 16, 2010; Narasimhan provided no information concerning the possibility of an appeal, the process of obtaining an extension of the work visa, or an update on the case. Tellingly, less than one week later, on July 20, 2010, the MPD terminated ILG\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Although Narasimhan specifically excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she was \u201clargely unavailable\u201d while in India, the record demonstrates the following: (1) Narasimhan failed to participate in the December 10, 2009, conference call, during which critical information \u2014 such as employment advertisements, information needed from Dr. Samuel, and the interview process \u2014 was discussed;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (2) Narasimhan failed to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>spond to the MPD\u2019s request for a second conference call on December 21, 2009; and (3) although advising the MPD on January 20, 2010, that Form 9089 would be ready to file online \u201cnext week,\u201d Narasimhan failed to file the form online and provided no explanation for the failure. Thus, the record establishes that, while Narasimhan was in India, she failed to communicate with the MPD and to complete promised work.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">There is a dearth of case law addressing the lawyer\u2019s role as counselor under MLRPC 1.4(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rand, </em>429 Md. 674, 716, 57 A.3d 976, 1001 (2012) (\u201cRand\u2019s exception implicates the application of [MLRPC] 1.4 to the process of counseling a client. To our knowledge, this is our first foray into the role of a lawyer as counselor.\u201d (Paragraph break omitted)). In <em>Rand, id. </em>at 716-17, 57 A.3d at 1001, although the hearing judge determined that the attorney had violated MLRPC 1.4(b), we concluded that \u201cthe hearing judge erred in not viewing counseling [the client] as a process, which occurred over a period of time.\u201d We observed that our analysis needed to \u201ctake into account the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>interaction between [the attorney] and [the client] and the information that was communicated[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 57 A.3d at 1001. Based on that guiding principle, we held that there was not clear and convincing evidence that the attorney violated MLRPC 1.4(b), as the attorney explained the consequences of failing to take a particular action at the time of the initial meeting with the client, and explained: \u201cTo parse out what an attorney counsels or fails to counsel, as to the consequences of a client\u2019s failure to act, at each meeting, without consideration of what had been counseled at earlier meetings, is to tread a dangerous path when addressing willful violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 57 A.3d at 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The facts and circumstances of <em>Rand </em>are distinct from those in the instant case. Indeed, we know of no Maryland case presenting circumstances similar to those presented here\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>a hearing judge has determined that an attorney failed to provide accurate information and advice to a client to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions, but the attorney contends that a colleague allegedly provided adequate information and advice to the client. Nonetheless, we conclude that clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Here, following the guiding principle of <em>Rand,, </em>we review the entire interaction between ILG and the MPD, and the information conveyed by Narasimhan and Rogers. The MPD retained ILG to handle the matter of Dr. Samuel\u2019s permanent residency process. On November 30, 2009, shortly after the representation commenced, Narasimhan sent Haines an e-mail detailing the \u201clabor certification steps.\u201d On December 8, 2009, Rogers e-mailed Haines a brief outline of the EB-2 permanent residency classification. During the December 10, 2009, conference call, Rogers discussed the process with Haines and Dr. Samuel. It is not clear whether the information conveyed by Narasimhan and Rogers was accurate or complete. After the initial advisements, Dr. Samuel requested additional information about the labor certification process and her options, as her work visa would expire in a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>months. Significantly, Narasimhan did not answer any of Dr. Samuel\u2019s questions, but instead asked Rogers to respond. When Rogers eventually responded, he provided only a partial response. Later, both Haines and Dr. Samuel requested information about obtaining a one-year extension to Dr. Samuel\u2019s current work visa. After the DOL denied certification of Form 9089, on separate occasions, Haines and Dr. Samuel requested additional information and a conference call to receive an update on the case and to discuss the appeals process. Tellingly, neither Narasimhan nor Rogers responded to the requests for additional information and the conference call did not occur. The requests for additional information and available alternatives to permanent residency and the lack of an adequate response demonstrate that neither Narasimhan nor Rogers provided the MPD with accurate and complete information and advice sufficient to enable the MPD to make informed decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Although Narasimhan argues that Rogers \u201cprovided virtually all of the legal advice rendered to the MPD[,]\u201d it is undisputed that Narasimhan provided the initial outline to Haines of the \u201clabor certification steps\u201d and that she accepted responsibility for the MPD\u2019s representation, both through the ILG Agreement (in which she agreed to be primarily responsible for the practice of law) and by her own initial statements to the MPD (in which she advised she was the attorney \u201cnamed as [the] DC contact\u201d and the \u201cprincipal point of contact\u201d). Because Narasimhan was the attorney responsible for the MPD\u2019s representation and the principal point of contact for the MPD, and as the attorney who submitted Form 9089, it was incumbent upon Narasimhan, not Rogers, to ensure that the MPD was fully advised with accurate information.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Revealingly, when asked at oral argument whether the violations of MLRPC 1.3 and 1.4 were established, Narasimhan\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cI do believe they are established in one ... sense, I do. In the sense that the quality of representation wasn\u2019t there.\u201d Narasimhan\u2019s counsel nevertheless argued that Narasimhan \u201cwas very responsive to client communications.\u201d It is readily apparent, however, that on many occasions Narasimhan failed to promptly respond to communications from the MPD, to keep the MPD reasonably informed about the status of the case, and to provide information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>necessary for the MPD to make informed decisions during the representation. In other words, we are satisfied that the violations of MLRPC 1.4(a) and (b) have been established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">MLRPC 7.1 (Communications Concerning a Lawyer\u2019s Services) &amp; MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Narasimhan excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 7.1 and 8.4(c), and contends that she did not claim in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to have extensive experience in immigration law. Narasimhan asserts that she did not fabricate her credentials or otherwise misrepresent her legal experience with the intent of gaining employment.

The misrepresentations on Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were not minor or slight exaggerations. The record amply demonstrates that the misrepresentations were material misrepresentations and that certain statements on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were wholly fabricated. It is undisputed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>statements on Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and in the job proposal were not accurate as to her immigration law experience. At oral argument, Narasimhan\u2019s counsel admitted that \u201c[tjhere were misstatementsL.]\u201d In the proposal submitted to the MPD, Narasimhan described herself as follows: \u201cBeing an immigrant [my]self, [I am] well-versed and ha[ve] a good knowledge of the immigration laws in this country[.]\u201d In her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Narasimhan described her position with ILG as an \u201cAttorney/Joint Venturer\u201d as follows: \u201cRepresentation of Immigration clients in documentary immigration processes and litigation.

Before the hearing judge, Narasimhan testified that the job description under ILG stating \u201cRepresentation of immigration clients, and documentary immigration processes and litigation\u201d was not her job experience with ILG, but rather \u201cwas the description of [ILG] and what it was framed to do\u201d and was meant to be a prospective statement of the work that she anticipated ILG would complete. When asked whether she had informed anyone at the MPD that her \u201cintention with that first sentence on [her] r[\u00e9]sum[\u00e9] was p[ro]spective and [ ] didn\u2019t reflect any actual experience that [she] had[,]\u201d Narasimhan answered that she \u201cassumed they knew already[.]\u201d Narasimhan admitted that, at the time she submitted her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to the MPD, ILG had not had any matters that resulted in litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">As to the statement on the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 \u201cHandled Family petitions and Citizenship applications\u201d \u2014 Narasimhan conceded that there is no such thing as a \u201cCitizenship application,\u201d and that what she \u201cmeant in layman terms is basically an N-400 Application for Naturalization.\u201d At the hearing, Narasimhan acknowledged that she had handled only two Applications for Naturalization, one in 2007 and one in 2008, both before she formed ILG with Rogers; <em>i.e., </em>it was not accurate as she had stated that she handled \u201cCitizenship applications\u201d while with ILG. Moreover, the two Applications for Naturalization that Narasimhan had completed were done in a non-professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>setting \u2014 she completed the applications for friends, never received compensation for her work, was not retained by the individuals, and never entered her appearance with any government agency related to the applications. When asked why she listed that she had experience with \u201cCitizenship applications\u201d under her job description with ILG, Narasimhan\u2019s explanation was \u201c[bjecause it was immigration experience, it was related experience, and [her] intent was to communicate the nature of [her] limited immigration experience in layman\u2019s terms[.]\u201d Ironically, this explanation highlighted the falsity of Narasimhan\u2019s statement in the proposal wherein she described herself as \u201cwell-versed\u201d in, and having \u201ca good knowledge of[,] the immigration laws[.]\u201d As to the statement that she had handled \u201cFamily petitions,\u201d Narasimhan admitted that she had completed only one family petition and offered that the plural word \u201cpetitions\u201d \u201cwas a typo.\u201d Narasimhan acknowledged that the family petition she referenced was actually prepared by Rogers \u2014 not her \u2014 and that her assistance was clerical, not legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Thus, the hearing judge correctly concluded that Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and the proposal contained misrepresentations. The misrepresentations in Narasimhan\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and in the proposal concerned her immigration law experience, and made it seem as though she had much more experience and knowledge of immigration law than she actually had at the time that she undertook representation of the MPD.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We flatly reject Narasimhan\u2019s contention that the description of immigration law experience on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reflected ILG\u2019s practice of representing immigration clients. Reviewing the document as a whole, it is apparent that the description pertained to Narasimhan\u2019s experience and not to ILG\u2019s practice or mission. Tellingly, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 purports to list Narasimhan\u2019s \u201cEducation\u201d and \u201cExperience\u201d \u2014 not ILG\u2019s practice. The first position listed under \u201cExperience\u201d is Narasimhan\u2019s role as \u201cAttorney/Joint Venturer\u201d of ILG. Directly beneath that appears the description: \u201cRepresentation of Immigration clients in documentary immigration processes and litigation. Handled Family petitions and Citizenship applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>tions.\u201d Thereafter, Narasimhan\u2019s previous legal positions and corresponding job descriptions are listed. The job descriptions for the other previous legal positions utilize the past tense <em>(ie., </em>\u201cConducted[,]\u201d \u201cprepared[,]\u201d \u201cdrafted!,]\u201d etc.). Put simply, we find no merit in Narasimhan\u2019s contention that the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 contained information about ILG\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Narasimhan raises an issue as to the materiality of the many misrepresentations. Although the term \u201cmaterial\u201d has not been discussed explicitly in the context of a violation of MLRPC 7.1, it is evident that a \u201cmaterial\u201d misrepresentation is one \u201c[o]f such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person\u2019s decision-making[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 998 (8th ed.2004). Materiality is gauged objectively, not subjectively, meaning that a court utilizes a reasonable person standard in evaluating materiality. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 162(2) (1981) (\u201cA misrepresentation is material if it is likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his [or her] assent[.]\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 538(2)(a) (1977) (A fact \u201cis material if [ ] a reasonable [personl would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his [or her] choice of action in the transaction in question[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Here, we have no difficulty concluding that the misrepresentations contained in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and proposal, purporting to describe Narasimhan\u2019s experience with and familiarity of immigration law, were material because a reasonable person would have viewed the claimed experience and familiarity as important to a decision as to whether to retain ILG. Stated otherwise, the MPD may not have retained ILG if it had known that Narasimhan essentially had no immigration law experience whatsoever. Even if the MPD had hired ILG based, in large part, as Haines testified, on Rogers\u2019s experience and expertise, and did not necessarily rely on the statements in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and proposal purporting to outline Narasimhan\u2019s immigration law experience, actual reliance on the misrepresentations is not a requirement for violation of MLRPC 7.1 or 8.4(c). Reliance and materiality are two distinct concepts, as something can be material but not relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>upon, <em>ie., </em>a reasonable person could view knowledge of a matter as important in the decision-making process, but not explicitly rely upon knowledge of the matter. In this case, it is readily apparent that Narasimhan\u2019s misrepresentations were made to make her credentials appear attractive to the MPD and to gain employment, and were material.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Although Narasimhan correctly points out that the hearing judge determined she did not set out to purposely defraud or deceive the MPD, no intent to deceive is required to find a violation of MLRPC 7.1 or 8.4(c). The plain language of MLRPC 7.1 does not require that a misrepresentation be made with an intent to deceive. For a violation of MLRPC 7.1 to be established, a false communication need only contain \u201ca material misrepresentation of fact or law[.]\u201d MLRPC 7.1(a). As discussed above, the misrepresentations in the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and proposal were material misrepresentations concerning Narasimhan\u2019s immigration law experience. Similarly, pursuant to MLRPC 8.4(c), we have stated explicitly \u201cthat dishonesty and misrepresentation under [MLRPC] 8.4(c) have no requirement of intent to deceive.\u201d <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 707-08, 73 A.3d at 174. Thus, a false statement need not be made \u201cwith the intent of deceiving anyone\u201d \u201cso long as an attorney knowingly makes a false statement[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708, 73 A.3d at 174 (citations omitted). Here, as Narasimhan acknowledged before the hearing judge, the statements in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 describing her immigration law experience with ILG were inaccurate, <em>ie., </em>they were false and did not describe her actual immigration law experience. That is all that is required to demonstrate the violation of MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In sum, we conclude that clear and convincing evidence established that Narasimhan made material misrepresentations concerning her immigration law experience on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and in the proposal. Although Narasimhan may not have been motivated by a specific intent to deceive or defraud the MPD, the misrepresentations exceeded mere puffery and showed a degree of dishonesty and carelessness on Narasimhan\u2019s part. Accordingly, we determine that the violations of MLRPC 7.1 and 8.4(c) have been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Narasimhan excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that she violated MLRPC 8.4(d) and contends that she did not engage in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice. Narasimhan maintains that she fully cooperated with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation and testified truthfully before the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d). \u201cIn general, a[ lawyer] violates [MLRPC] 8.4(d) when his or her conduct impacts negatively the public\u2019s perception or efficacy of the courts or legal profession.\u201d Dore, 433 Md. at 696, 73 A.3d at 167 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For example, \u201c[fjailure to represent a client in an adequate manner is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 175, 994 A.2d 928, 945 (2010) (alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 8.4(d). Narasimhan provided incompetent representation to the MPD, due to her lack of experience, skill, and thoroughness, and failed on numerous occasions to respond promptly and adequately to requests for information. Narasimhan was responsible for representation of the MPD, and misrepresented her experience in immigration law on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Narasimhan\u2019s full and cooperative participation throughout the attorney grievance process is the same conduct that we expect of any attorney faced with a complaint. Here, Narasimhan submitted a proposal through a public bidding process sponsored by the MPD, a government agency. Narasimhan\u2019s lack of competence in representing the MPD reflected negatively on attorneys and the legal profession, and as a consequence, had the effect of eroding public confidence in the legal profession. Thus, the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Narasimhan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>violated MLRPC 8.4(d) is supported by clear and convincing evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">MLRPC 8.4(a) (Violating MLRPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to[ ] violate or attempt to violate the [MLRPC], knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(a). Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 7.1, 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). Accordingly, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Narasimhan violated MLRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">C. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Bar Counsel recommends that this Court indefinitely suspend Narasimhan from the practice of law in Maryland. Narasimhan requests a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In <em>Dore, </em>433 Md. at 717, 73 A.3d at 180, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">When we impose sanctions, our goal is not to punish the [lawyer], but rather to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession [and] to deter other lawyers from violating the [MLRPC]. To achieve this goal, the sanction should be commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed. In determining an appropriate sanction, we often refer to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>which focus on the nature of the ethical duty violated, the lawyer\u2019s mental state, the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>lawyer\u2019s misconduct, and any aggravating or mitigating [factor]s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">(Second alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Concerning the nature of the ethical duty violated, Narasimhan violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 7.1, 8.4(c), and 8.4(d) by failing to competently and diligently represent the MPD, by failing to promptly and fully respond to and advise the MPD, and by making misrepresentations in her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and job proposal as to her immigration law experience. As to Narasimhan\u2019s state of mind, although Narasimhan did not set out to purposely mishandle the MPD\u2019s case, her inexperience and incompetence got the best of her. As to the actual or potential injury that Narasimhan\u2019s misconduct caused, Narasimhan\u2019s misconduct negatively impacted the MPD\u2019s and the public\u2019s perception of the legal profession, and ultimately caused the DOL to deny certification of Dr. Samuel\u2019s permanent residency application.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In the course of a bankruptcy case, the attorney prepared a bankruptcy petition on behalf of her client and directed her law clerk to file it in the United States Bankruptcy Court. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>at 477, 773 A.2d at 523.

In <em>Jaseb, id. </em>at 482, 773 A.2d at 526, in determining that a reprimand was the appropriate sanction, we stated: \u201cHere, [the attorney]\u2019s inexperience, coupled with her lack of prior misconduct complaints, and the fact that the client was not prejudiced, must be weighed against her behavior, her inaccurate representations ..., and her negligent supervision of her recently hired law clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Such misconduct reflected a degree of dishonesty. Once the MPD retained ILG, Narasimhan\u2019s misconduct during the representation included incompetence in handling the matter at hand, an inability or failure to accurately and fully provide information to the client, and the failure to associate with an attorney who was competent in the field. As in <em>Ward, </em>394 Md. at 39, 904 A.2d at 499-500, we believe a reprimand \u201cwould be too lenient a sanction because [Narasimhan]\u2019s violations were [not] limited to a single rule[,]\u201d or a single act of misconduct. Indeed, Narasimhan violated many MLRPC over a course of time, and her actions reflected negatively on the legal profession. Considering the mitigating factors, however, including Narasimhan\u2019s inexperience in the practice of law and the lack of a prior disciplinary record, coupled with the hearing judge\u2019s finding that Narasimhan did not intend to defraud her clients, we conclude that that appropriate sanction for Narasimhan\u2019s violations of the MLRPC is sixty-day suspension from the practice of law in Maryland.

In this case, to the extent that Rogers\u2019s conduct played a role in the violation, such a fact could be considered in determining the appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ate sanction, but would not affect whether or not Narasimhan violated a particular MLRPC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b687-5\">. In an e-mail dated November 17, 2009, Narasimhan advised Rogers that she would be out oi' the country from December 3, 2009 to January 17, 2010. This e-mail was sent only to Rogers. The only support for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Narasimhan having informed Haines of the trip is Narasimhan\u2019s own testimony at the hearing. Narasimhan testified before the hearing judge that, at some other point before the contract was awarded, she believed that she spoke with Haines during a conference call and advised Haines that she was going to India \"for a family wedding in the month of December and January.\u201d Specifically, Narasimhan testified: \"I believe I did tell [Haines] that I was basically going for a family wedding in the month on December and January.\u201d In the findings of fact, however, the hearing judge did not find that Narasimhan told Haines she would be out of the country from December 2009 through January 2010. As of the morning of the scheduled December 10, 2009, call, it was anticipated that Narasimhan would participate in the call. Indeed, it was only on the morning of the December 10, 2009, conference call, that Narasimhan e-mailed Rogers, Haines, and Dr. Samuel from India informing them that she would be unable to join the conference call.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In an e-mail dated December 10, 2009, Haines advised Narasimhan, Rogers, and Dr. Samuel that they were \"scheduled to speak again on December 21 at 2:00.\u201d The conference call did not occur.

Section 5.01 of the ILG Agreement, concerning the division of labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>between Narasimhan and Rogers outlined Narasimhan\u2019s and Rogers's responsibilities as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">The Parties agree that [Narasimhan] is in a better position to conduct the daily management of the Joint Venture.

In addition to the Agreement, Narasimhan\u2019s own conduct and statements support the hearing judge\u2019s finding that she was primarily responsible for the practice of law. During the representation, Narasimhan \u2014 not Rogers \u2014 submitted Form 9089. During Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation of Dr. Samuel's complaint, Narasimhan responded, in writing, among other things, that she had \"represented the MPD[.]\u201d The quotation above specifically states that Rogers was to \"be primarily responsible for providing advice and legal expertise to the Joint Venture\u201d and that is what the hearing judge found, <em>i.e., </em>that Rogers was responsible for rendering advice to the joint venture\u2014 ILG \u2014 and Narasimhan was primarily responsible for the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Because we determine that Narasimhan was responsible for representation of the MPD, we do not address whether the hearing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>erred in excluding her testimony concerning the matters on which Rogers advised the MPD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">.

As such, Narasimhan was required, under the MLRPC, to provide competent representation utilizing \u2018the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u2019 \u201d Maj. Op. at 653-54, 92 A.3d at 521. (Emphasis added). The Majority relied on this assessment several times to justify its conclusions about several of the Rules that were violated, and the proper sanction. Yet, the hearing judge did not find this. Rather, he found that they \u201cwere hired based on Mr. Rogers\u2019 expertise and the Respondent\u2019s ability to provide local service as a Maryland Bar member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Indeed, the facts, when examined, do not support the Majority\u2019s thesis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The client\u2019s understanding was expressed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>MPD Director of Human Resources Haines, who agreed that MPD \u201chired the Immigration Law Group based upon Mr. Rogers\u2019s expertise, not that of Ms. Narasimhan[.]\u201d A lawyer herself, Haines knew Respondent had \u201cless than three months of immigration practice experience.\u201d She confirmed that the MPD \u201ccould not have moved forward\u201d without Rogers and \u201cfelt comfortable that he would meet our need and so we selected him.\u201d Director Haines was convinced from the beginning that Respondent \u201calone [lacked] sufficient experience to do this.\u201d She confirmed that Rogers would serve as \u201clead counsel\u201d and Narasimhan would be a \u201clocal liaison\u201d or \u201cgo-between between ourselves and Mr. Rogers.\u201d She understood that Respondent would be \u201cin constant contact with Mr. Rogers[,]\u201d and that \u201che would look at everything before she sent it to us and that he ... would basically be directing her\u2014 directing her activities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Consistent with the MPD\u2019s understanding, Rogers was on the phone during the December 10, 2009 conference call, and Respondent was absent because of a planned trip outside the country.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Haines also recalled that there were \u201ca few emails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>back and forth\u201d between Respondent and MPD during that trip. Haines also agreed that Respondent appeared \u201cto be dedicated to customer service[.]\u201d When asked about difficulties in communicating with Respondent, Haines replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">The only real problem that we had was, when there was a need for us all to talk together, it was very difficult getting the parties together, either because of conflicts that Mr. Rogers had or conflicts that Sudha<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had, but it was \u2014 on at least two occasions where it was important for us to meet quickly, it took more than a few days to get it done. That\u2019s the only thing I, personally, was aware of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Haines amplified by explaining that \u201ctrying to get them together for a conference phone call was problematic, ... there was a lot of interaction between Dr. Samuel and Sudha, and I didn\u2019t perceive that there was any problem when they were actually interacting with each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">A primary defense offered by Respondent, especially to the incompetency charge, was that, although she alone did not have sufficient knowledge and experience to undertake the legal immigration work necessary to secure a permanent residence for Dr. Samuel, she only undertook the work in conjunction with her partner, Rogers, who, she believed, had 16 years of experience in immigration law. The Majority rejects Respondent\u2019s defense saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">Although an attorney can provide competent representation through association with an attorney \u201cof established competence in the field in question[,]\u201d MLRPC 1.1 cmt. [2], such was not the case here. To begin, setting aside any issue as to Narasimhan\u2019s competence, or lack thereof, as the hearing judge concluded, Narasimhan failed to ascertain whether Rogers was, in fact, competent in the field of immigration law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Maj. Op. at 652, 92 A.3d at 520. The Majority opines that Respondent should have examined Rogers\u2019s qualifications and expertise by checking with some third party, and that verifying his Bar membership, as she did, was not sufficient.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maj. Op. at 686-88, 92 A.3d at 540-41. In my view, this sets up an unduly harsh standard for young attorneys who seek jobs. I know of no registry or procedure, other than verifying that Bar membership is in good standing, to determine what expertise an attorney possesses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If an attorney seeking a job has a sophisticated knowledge of the field of practice, she might telephone other practitioners to ask about the lawyer in question. But a person fresh out of law school, who may not know many attorneys, let alone attorneys who specialize in a given field, just does not have access to this information. When an older lawyer offers her a job, tells her of his experience, and she verifies his status as a member of the Bar, a younger lawyer should not be disciplined for failure to ascertain some more precise method for objective measurement of his expertise. Respondent\u2019s actions in associating with Rogers to undertake an immigration practice may have been naive, but they were not unethical.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">To hold that Respondent was expected to be able to complete the legal work necessary to obtain a Green Card for Dr. Samuel on her own, without guidance from Rogers, is an extremely unfair application of the MLRPC. Under these circumstances, Respondent should only be held to the standard of a novice attorney, working under the supervision of an attorney experienced in the field. The Majority\u2019s refusal to acknowledge Respondent\u2019s status as a novice attorney in an apprentice-like relationship with Rogers is pertinent to more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>than one of the alleged instances of misconduct. I address the particulars below.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">MLRPC 7.1 (Communications Concerning a Lawyer\u2019s Services)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">I agree that Respondent made minor misrepresentations about her experience in the resume she submitted to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), thereby violating MLRPC 7.1 and 8.4(c). Although she truthfully told the MPD that she had less than three months as a practitioner in the field, and did not purport to be qualified to handle the MPD work for Dr. Samuel on her own, she did exaggerate slightly the specifics of her experience. This is a violation for which some discipline is appropriate. As I indicated earlier, neither Respondent nor the client, MPD, considered her experience to be material in the decision to hire the Immigration Law Group (\u201cILG\u201d) for the immigration law work at hand, a factor to which we should accord significant weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">MLRPC 1.1 (Competence)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">On March 24, 2010, Respondent filed the Employer\u2019s Application for Permanent Employment Certification for the position of \u201cProject Specialist,\u201d known as Form 9089. This, apparently, is the first step required to obtain a Green Card. On May 3, 2010, the Department of Labor, Office of Foreign Labor Certification (DOL) denied the certification, indicating that the Form 9089 was incomplete in that it failed to provide information known as the Prevailing Wage Determination, among other things. Clearly, this filing contained significant errors by both Rogers and Respondent, who worked on the filing together. Petitioner\u2019s expert, an immigration practitioner, expounded at length about Respondent\u2019s lack of expertise, and failure to meet the standard of care, testimony that was accepted generally by the hearing judge.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Yet, Respondent promptly made efforts to correct her error and, under the guidance of Rogers, secured a new Prevailing Wage Determination from the appropriate division of the DOL, and filed a more complete form within less than 30 days. As acknowledged in the DOL\u2019s November 15, 2011 ruling,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the deficiencies were all completed in this second submittal. Despite this compliance, the DOL again denied the labor certification, on grounds that 20 C.F.R. 656.17(a) provided that \u201c[incomplete applications will be denied.\u201d DOL explained: \u201cPERM is an exacting process, designed to eliminate back- and-forth between applicants and the government, and to favor administrative efficiency over dialogue in order to better serve the public interest overall, given the resources available to administer the program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Respondent, was, without doubt, \u201cin over her head\u201d in trying to take the appropriate steps to secure permanent residence status for Dr. Samuel. But, in bidding for and undertaking the work, she did so in reliance on Rogers\u2019s 16 years of experience, and her work was under his guidance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She admitted sending an incomplete version of Form 9089 by mistake when she had at her fingertips a more complete version. This proved to be a significant error because, as its denial memo said, the DOL policy is to reject filings that are incomplete, without allowing amendment. Petitioner\u2019s expert also delineated other errors, although the evidence does not reveal whether these were entered into the computer by Rogers or Respondent, as both made entries on the form. Both Respondent\u2019s testimony and e-mail exhibits show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>both filings of Form 9089 were read and approved by Rogers. Rogers did not testify, and the record does not reveal whether he was charged with any violations in Arkansas or any reciprocal discipline here. With the Majority opinion as written, I fear the implications of holding young lawyers accountable, in the <em>disciplinary context,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the negligence or inattention of more experienced lawyers who supervise them. It can be efficient \u2014 benefiting both the client and the law firm \u2014 for an inexperienced lawyer to act in an apprenticeship role, handling certain details of a matter, including regular client contact. Moreover, in many instances, a client, like MPD here, is fully aware that the inexperienced lawyer will not provide the expertise and judgment expected of the more experienced lawyer. If young attorneys, working in a firm, become reticent to interact freely and openly with clients, the long tradition of apprenticeship as an entryway to our profession will suffer. I worry that the Majority opinion imperils the viability of this time-honored method of beginning a legal career.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">As the Preamble to the MLRPC says, and many of our decisions reflect, \u201cthe Rules presuppose that whether or not discipline should be imposed for a violation, and the severity of a sanction, depend on all the circumstances, such as the willfulness and seriousness of the violation, extenuating factors and whether there have been previous violations.\u201d MLRPC, Preamble: A Lawyer\u2019s Responsibilities [19]. In deciding this case, we should bear in mind that \u201c \u2018mistakes are the inevitable lot of mankind\u2019 \u201d <em>Baranski v. Serhant, </em>106 F.R.D. 247, 250 (N.D.Ill.1985) (quoting <em>Re Taylor\u2019s Estate, </em>22 Ch. D. 495, 508 (1882)), and lawyers are not immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Whether we ultimately decide to grant Respondent\u2019s exception to the finding that she violated MLRPC 1.1 is a close call. Clearly, the denial of the labor certification was caused, at least in part by Respondent\u2019s failure to pay attention to details at a time when details were terribly significant. I have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>doubt that she regrets this and has learned from this mistake. Under these circumstances, even if she violated MLRPC 1.1, such violation, by itself, would justify no more than a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">MLRPC 1.4 (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to communicate is a major issue used by the Majority to justify Respondent\u2019s discipline. As I understand the evidence, Respondent\u2019s alleged failures to communicate with the client consisted of (1) the failure to set up a second conference call with Rogers and MPD in December 2009, when Respondent was on a planned trip to India that the client knew of from the beginning of the representation; (2) the failure to cause Rogers to provide substantive information about the immigration process in response to an April 15, 2010 e-mail; (3) the failure to advise MPD regarding how to secure a one-year extension for Dr. Samuel in May or June, 2010, and (4) the failure to set up a conference call with the client and Rogers for a 6-day period in July.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Majority says that \u201cthere were multiple occasions on which Narasimhan failed to respond at all to requests for information, and she also failed to provide a requested status update.\u201d Maj. Op. at 655, 92 A.3d at 522. <em>See also, </em>Maj. Op. at 661-62, 92 A.3d at 525 (\u201cIt is readily apparent, however, that on many occasions Narasimhan failed to promptly respond to communications from the MPD, to keep the MPD reasonably informed about the status of the case, and to provide information necessary____\u201d); Maj. Op. at 669, 92 A.3d at 530 (Respondent \u201cfailed on numerous occasions to respond promptly and adequately to requests for information.\u201d). With due respect to the Majority, I submit that the record does not support these characterizations. To explicate my position, unfortunately, I must delve into some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">(i) December Conference Call</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Rogers conducted an initial telephone conference call with Haines and Dr. Samuel on December 10, 2009, in which he outlined the process for securing permanent resident status. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>As the e-mails in the record reveal, during this call, Rogers set up the plans for the December 21, 2009 conference call. Respondent was in India and there is no indication that Respondent was asked to facilitate that second call in any way. If Rogers did not follow through and have this call, it is decidedly unfair to blame Respondent. This was not a violation of MLRPC 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">(ii) Communications in April</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">If there was any failure by Respondent to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, it was minor. The record is rife with e-mails from Respondent to Haines and Dr. Samuel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although Dr. Samuel testified that she asked questions of Rogers and Respondent in an April 15 e-mail, and received no response until April 27, the record reveals that Respondent replied on April 18, that \u201cGordon will respond with all the answers.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When Respondent\u2019s counsel brought her attention to this reply, Dr. Samuel responded: \u201cI did not receive immediate answers, so just telling me that somebody is going to respond and then receiving the answers to the question 12, 13, 14 \u2014 even five days later \u2014 is just unreasonable to me[.]\u201d Dr. Samuel evidently did not accept what her superior, Haines, negotiated as the terms of the representation: that it was understood that Rogers had the immigration expertise, that Respondent did not, but would provide local assistance, gather information, speak with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>client, and assist Rogers in preparing the necessary filings. There was no evidence that Respondent had any power to control Rogers\u2019s schedule, or guarantee his responsiveness, and MPD had no reason to expect that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">(iii) Communications After Initial Denial By DOL. (May-July)</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">May. The labor certification sought by the original submission of Form 9089 was denied by the DOL on May 3, 2010, on grounds it was incomplete. Dr. Samuel complained in her testimony that, thereafter, she had some difficulty arranging a face-to-face meeting with Respondent on or around May 8, and they did not actually meet until May 27. Dr. Samuel explained: \u201c[I]t was something I wanted to do more so, closer to when we received the denial, but \u2014 you know, [Respondent\u2019s] schedule just never seemed to be open enough for her to meet with me[.]\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The written e-mails during this period provide specific evidence of communications which negate the general complaint that Dr. Samuel made. In a May 7 e-mail, Dr. Samuel asked Respondent to \u201caddress the missing information and make the necessary corrections,\u201d and Respondent replied the same day, indicating they were to speak at 2:00 p.m. the next day. Apparently, a face-to-face meeting did not take place, but Haines verified that a conference call with Rogers, Respondent, Haines and Dr. Samuel occurred on Saturday, May 8, in which that issue was discussed. During this call, they talked about the options of refiling or appealing. Rogers guided the client as to these options, and MPD decided to resubmit a revised Form 9089 to the DOL.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Respondent responded quickly to resubmit the form. She e-mailed Rogers on May 8, asking him to fill out \u201cthe Ml section\u201d and \u201cthe F section of the 9089 form.\u201d From May 8-27, Rogers and Respondent were working on completing a revised Form 9089. In a May 12 e-mail, Respondent sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Rogers certain information needed to \u201cre-fill the 9089 form,\u201d making comments and asking questions about aspects of the form. Rogers completed the form, and in a May 16 e-mail to Dr. Samuel and Haines, asked for \u201ca little more information\u201d that he thought would be helpful to include. Respondent, meanwhile, spoke to two government agencies about securing the necessary \u201c[prevailing wage information,\u201d reporting to Rogers in a May 20 e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Importantly, Dr. Samuel was aware of the work being done \u2014 between May 14 and May 25 there were several e-mails between Rogers and Dr. Samuel regarding details of the revised Form 9089. After talking with Dr. Samuel on May 26 to arrange a meeting to sign the revised document, Respondent e-mailed Dr. Samuel and Haines, indicating: \u201cwe are on for tomorrow May 27th at 9:30 am.\u201d Respondent sent the revised Form 9089 by Federal Express to the DOL on May 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In sum, regarding May, 2010, after a four-way conference call on May 8, Rogers <em>was communicating with Dr. Samuel </em>about the revisions to Form 9089 that he and Respondent were making to correct the deficiencies of the original filing. Certainly Respondent was not obligated to communicate with Dr. Samuel when Rogers was already doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">June. On June 8, Respondent faxed a follow-up letter to the DOL requesting relief from the \u201cFinal Determination Denial\u201d of the Form 9089. On June 14, she told Rogers that she was also working on completion of Form 1-140, known as \u201cPetition for Immigrant Worker,\u201d which she would send for his review and approval. She included a link from the DOL website indicating \u201c[a]n 1-140 petition is the second step in the Green Card process\u201d after the \u201cLabor Certificate is approved[J\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>On June 17, 2010, the Office of Foreign Labor Certification e-mailed Respondent notice that it had issued a \u201cprevailing wage determination for the position of Project Specialist\u201d and on June 21, Respondent informed the DOL office reviewing Form 9089 of this receipt. As indicated above, this determination proved to be fruitless, as the DOL would later, in November, reject the Form 9089 labor certification request, even though the requisite information was provided, on grounds it was not complete when first filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">July \u2014 MPD\u2019s Termination. In a July 14 e-mail, Dr. Samuel requested a meeting with Rogers for July 16. On the same day, Respondent replied, indicating that Rogers was in Panama and she would \u201chave to see if [Rogers] is available to talk this Friday.\u201d In that e-mail, she also advised that she and Rogers were \u201cworking on your 1-140 and 1-485 application.\u201d Respondent followed up the next day with another e-mail advising Dr. Samuel that Rogers, after checking his schedule, could not fit in a conference call that Friday, but could do so the following week.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It was six days later, on Tuesday, July 20, that Haines sent an e-mail terminating the MPD\u2019s attorney-client relationship with ILG, and asking ILG to send a final bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">(iv) Conclusion Re: MLRPC 1.4</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Rejecting a key defense offered by Respondent that, in light of her limited experience, her role was to play the assistant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Rogers, the Majority says: \u201cAs to Narasimhan\u2019s claim that she responded by facilitating communication with Rogers, Narasimhan accepted primary responsibility for representing the MPD; as such, it was incumbent upon Narasimhan to provide the requested information herself or to ensure that Rogers responded in full.\u201d Maj. Op. at 655, 92 A.3d at 522. As I said before, the hearing judge did not reject or otherwise address this defense. I submit that the evidence does not support the Majority\u2019s treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Dr. Samuel, without the testimonial support of her superior, Haines, made a general complaint against Respondent about supposed failures to communicate. Yet, as my discussion above demonstrates, neither Dr. Samuel nor the hearing judge, provided enough specific information for us to conclude Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4 by delaying in providing replies to requests for service. Lawyers cannot always provide legal advice as fast as their clients would like, especially since answers to many questions require research, thought and judgment. In our role overseeing the discipline of lawyers for ethical violations, we should be careful to fully understand the context of the alleged delay, and discipline only for those delays that qualify as neglect of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In light of Respondent\u2019s diligent efforts to communicate overall, and the evidence of the work performed and communications, I submit that Dr. Samuel\u2019s general testimony, such as \u201c[Respondent\u2019s] schedule just never seemed to be open enough for her to meet with me ...\u201d is not sufficiently specific to provide clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.4.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Neither Dr. Samuel nor the hearing judge said anything more specific than that. It is my strong opinion that the generalities of both Dr. Samuel and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>hearing judge on this topic do not rise to the level of specific delays that would justify our finding that there exists clear and convincing evidence of a failure to communicate. Conclusory testimony does not become clear and convincing evidence simply because a hearing judge deems it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">MLRPC 8.4(d)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Finally, I do not agree that Respondent violated MLRPC 8.4(d). This Rule should be reserved for more serious violations than have been demonstrated here. The Majority relies on our opinion in <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Dore, </em>433 Md. 685, 707-08, 73 A.3d 161, 174 (2013) as analogous support for finding a violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) and supporting an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after 60 days, reasoning that both cases involved dishonesty and misrepresentation without any intent to deceive. In the Majority\u2019s view, \u201cNarasimhan\u2019s lack of competence in representing MPD reflected negatively on attorneys and the legal profession, and as a consequence, had the effect of eroding public confidence in the legal profession.\u201d Maj. Op. at 669, 92 A.3d at 530. I see a fundamental distinction between the two cases. In <em>Dare, </em>we dealt with an experienced attorney who authorized hundreds of false statements made to multiple courts involving hundreds of foreclosure actions all over Maryland. 433 Md. at 722, 73 A.3d at 183. That case involved an entire system of misrepresentation that required new court proceedings in multiple counties to correct the problem. <em>Id. </em>I agreed that the attorney\u2019s actions in <em>Dore </em>constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MLRPC 8.4(d) because of the magnitude of the filings in question, the involvement of the courts, and the attendant publicity. I do not see the events here as remotely comparable. We should not transform every act of negligence by an attorney into a violation of MLRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The exacting approach exemplified by the Majority\u2019s opinion will not further the principles motivating our adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>MLRPC. Rather, it will only serve to amplify the anxiety an attorney suffers when faced with the complexities of modern practice. Under all of the circumstances, including her misrepresentation about her prior experience, and even if we find a violation of MLRPC 1.1,1 think a flat suspension for 15 days is fully sufficient sanction for Ms. Narasimhan.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Judge McDONALD authorizes me to state that he joins in this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">. This understanding is consistent with the Joint Venture Agreement between Narasimhan and Rogers, which clearly set forth that Rogers was lead counsel. In its words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">The Parties hereby acknowledge that [Rogers] has the experience, legal knowledge and, the business acumen in the Joint Venture. [Rogers] shall be primarily responsible for providing advice and legal expertise to the Joint Venture. [He] shall also be primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>responsible for research of legal issues that will arise in the conduct of the law practice within the Joint Venture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Joint Venture Agreement 5.01 (Division of Labor) (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-7\">. Dr. Samuel did not participate in the hiring of ILG. She expressed the opinion that Respondent was \u201ctheir lawyer\u201d but, when asked, had no particular basis for this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">. MPD issued the procurement contract for legal services provided by ILG on November 20, 2009. Respondent had scheduled a trip to India between December 3, 2009 and January 17, 2010, and informed Haines of this right after the bid was awarded. Designating Respondent\u2019s trip to India as a failure to communicate, when Rogers, the recognized senior partner with immigration expertise, participated in the first conference call occurring on December 10, during Respondent\u2019s trip, is simply unfair. It is not required that two attorneys participate in each client meeting. The Majority also charges that Narasimhan failed to respond to the MPD\u2019s request for a second conference call on December 21, 2009. The facts as shown by e-mails in the record are that Rogers set up a second conference call for December 21 when talking with the client during the December 10, 2009 conference call. Respondent kepi abreast of the discussions in that call by reading e-mails Haines wrote summarizing the meeting, and she sent e-mails to Rogers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The record contains conflicting testimony over whether the December 21 conference call took place, and the hearing judge made no findings on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">.

A significant aspect of the deficiencies in Form 9089, as explained by Respondent, was caused by her mistake in mailing an earlier rough draft of Form 9089 to the DOL. This submitted Form 9089 omitted significant information as required to complete sections F-2 through F-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>6, despite MPD having provided that information to Respondent.

When Dr. Samuel e-mailed \"Gordon and Sudha\u201d on April 15, 2010, for some additional information \"[w]hen you have an opportunity,\u201d Respondent e-mailed Rogers the next day, asking him to \"respond to this ASAP.\u201d On May 2, 2010, Rogers did respond to the e-mail, although his response may not have been complete. Haines described a conference call with Rogers, Respondent, Haines and Dr. Samuel on Saturday, May 8, in which that issue was discussed, and they talked about the options of refiling and appealing. Rogers guided the client as to these options, and MPD decided to resubmit a new Form 9089 to the Department of Labor, which was done on June 4, 2010. According to Haines, Respondent \"respond[ed] quickly to resubmit the forms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">.

Meanwhile, the lack of success with the Form 9089 had eroded MPD\u2019s trust in Respondent\u2019s capabilities. In a belated effort to record the MPD's dissatisfaction with the original 9089 filing, on June 15, Haines sent a letter addressed to Rogers, indicating that she found it \"prudent to send this letter in response to some ongoing issues.\u201d She complained about the March 24, 2010 denial by the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Labor, the delay caused by the need to resubmit Form 9089. In this regard, she said that his resume indicated that he had the \u201cexpertise, knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to respond to these immigration issues!,]\u201d but complained that Respondent \u201ceither does not have sufficient experience to address these issues, or, she is distracted and does not pay sufficient attention to what she is doing.\u2019\u2019 Haines complained that the Department of Labor rejected the application because of the omission of information that MPD had provided to Respondent.
