Section 3-107(a). Under Section 3-104(n)(ii) of the LEOBR, a law enforcement officer must be provided with \u201cany exculpatory information\u201d upon completion of an investigation, at least ten days before a hearing, upon certain conditions not relevant here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is the definition of \u201cexculpatory\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>with which we are concerned.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In the present case, Joshua Tripp Ellsworth, Petitioner, a homicide detective with the Baltimore City Police Department (\u201cDepartment\u201d), Respondent, was involved in an incident with Baltimore City Police Sergeant Jonathan Brickus of the Patrol Division. The incident arose during an investigation into a possible abduction, when the victim of the abduction was purportedly being held in a house located on the 2700 block of West Garrison Boulevard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After members of the homicide unit, including Detective Ellsworth, arrived, no agreement was reached as to which unit would supervise the scene, but Sergeant Brickus advised Detective Ellsworth not to enter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>home in which the victim and abductor were allegedly ensconced. Detective Ellsworth, however, began walking toward the house and failed to adhere to Sergeant Brickus\u2019s orders to stop; Sergeant Brickus told Detective Ellsworth that he was suspended and seized Detective Ellsworth\u2019s gun. A more heated argument ensued; Detective Ellsworth, without his gun, advanced on the house and entered the porch. Sergeant Brickus, thereafter, removed Detective Ellsworth from the porch and attempted to handcuff him and then filed a complaint against Detective Ellsworth, which precipitated an investigation by the Internal Investigation Division of the Baltimore Police Department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The investigator found that the allegations against Detective Ellsworth were supported by sufficient evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and he was charged with seven violations of four administrative rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>CHARGE 1</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">Rule 1, Conduct: Any breach of the peace, neglect of duty, misconduct or any conduct on the part of any member of the department, either within or without the City of Baltimore, which tends to undermine the good order, efficiency or discipline of the department or which reflects discredit upon the department or any member thereof, or which is prejudicial to the efficiency and discipline of the department, even though these offenses may not be specifically enumerated or laid down, shall be considered conduct unbecoming a mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>ber of the Baltimore Police Department, and subject to disciplinary action by the Police Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">Specification 1: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth undermined the good order, efficiency and discipline of the Department by failing to obey several lawful commands and/or orders given to him by Sergeant Jonathan Brickus, a permanent ranking supervisor, not to approach the dwelling located at 2727 W. Garrison Avenue, thereby, conducting himself in a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department. Specification 2: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth undermined the good order, efficiency and discipline of the Department by failing to obey a lawful command and/or order from Sergeant Jonathan Brickus, a permanent ranking supervisor, to not knock on the door of the dwelling located at 2727 W. Garrison Avenue, thereby, conducting himself in a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department. Specification 3: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth reflected discredit upon himself and the Department, when, while on the scene of a possible domestic abduction, Detective Ellsworth entered into a verbal confrontation with Sergeant Jonathan Brickus, a permanent ranking supervisor, while in plain view of numerous law enforcement members and the general public, thereby, conducting himself in a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>CHARGE 2</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Section 14: No member of the Department shall willfully disobey any lawful command or order, either verbal or written, of any superior or other member designated to command.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">Specification 1: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth failed to obey several lawful commands and/or orders from Sergeant Jonathan Brickus, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>permanent ranking supervisor, not to approach the dwelling located at 2727 W. Garrison Avenue, a home possibly harboring an alleged abduction victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">Specification 2: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth failed to obey a lawful command and/or order from Sergeant Jonathan Brickus, a permanent ranking supervisor, to not knock on the door of the dwelling located at 2727 W.

It is imperative that members assist colleagues fully and completely with respect and consideration at all times. Specification: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellsworth, a detective within the Homicide Section entered into a verbal confrontation with Sergeant Jonathan Brickus a permanent ranking member of the Northwestern District, while at the scene of a possible domestic abduction at the dwelling of 2727 W. Garrison Avenue, in plain view of numerous law enforcement members and the general public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">\n<em>CHARGE 4</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\">Section 13: No member of the department at any time shall be insubordinate or disrespectful to a superior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-12\">Specification: For that, on or about August 7, 2009, Detective Joshua Ellswortli, a detective within the Homicide Section behaved in an insubordinate and/or disrespectful manner when he entered into a verbal confrontation with Sergeant Jonathan Brickus a permanent ranking member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the Northwestern District, while at the scene of a possible domestic abduction at the dwelling of 2727 W. Garrison Avenue, in plain view of numerous law enforcement members and the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Detective Ellsworth elected a trial board hearing rather than accept the sanction recommended by the Department.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Prior to the hearing, counsel for Detective Ellsworth requested in writing from the City Solicitor,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> representing the Department, \u201cdiscovery to the fullest extent allowed by law, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>to the fullest extent required by the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights, Md. Ann.Code Public Safety \u00a7 3-101, <em>et seq.\u201d </em>In relevant part, Detective Ellsworth\u2019s written request stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">Please provide me with a copy of the investigatory file and exculpatory information. Md. AnmCode Public Safety \u00a7 3-104(n)(ii). '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">Please understand that I interpret the phrase \u201cexculpatory evidence\u201d to mean any evidence favorable to the accused because it tends to prove the accused to be not guilty or tends to mitigate punishment. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 [83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215] (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">At the hearing before a three member board,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> seven law enforcement witnesses were called to testify by the Department, including Officer Daniel Redd, who had been present during the incident between Detective Ellsworth and Sergeant Brickus.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Counsel for Detective Ellsworth cross-examined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Officer Redd regarding whether Officer Redd had \u201can attorney in [his] employ protecting [his] interests for an ongoing federal criminal investigation\u201d in addition to whether Officer Redd knew he was \u201cthe subject, in fact the target, of an ongoing federal criminal investigation.\u201d Officer Redd answered both questions in the negative. Counsel for Detective Ellsworth further queried Officer Redd, \u201cSince you were 18 years of age, have you ever distributed a controlled dangerous substance?\u201d Officer Redd again answered \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The hearing board found Detective Ellsworth guilty of two of the charges, but not guilty of five. The guilty findings included: Charge I, Specification III for conduct \u201cin a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department\u201d by entering into a verbal confrontation with Sergeant Brickus and Charge IV, Specification I for behaving \u201cin an insubordinate and/or disrespectful manner when he entered into a verbal confrontation\u201d with Sergeant Brickus. The hearing board found Detective Ellsworth not guilty of Charge I, Specification I for conduct \u201cin a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department\u201d by approaching the dwelling at 2727 West Garrison Avenue; not guilty of Charge I, Specification II for conduct \u201cin a manner unbecoming a member of the Baltimore Police Department\u201d by failing to obey Sergeant Brickus to not knock on the door of the dwelling at 2727 West Garrison Avenue; not guilty of Charge II, Specification I for failing \u201cto obey several lawful commands and/or orders\u201d from Sergeant Brickus to not approach the dwelling; not guilty of Charge II, Specification II for failing \u201cto obey a lawful command and/or order\u201d from Sergeant Brickus to not knock on the door of the dwelling; and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>guilty of Charge III, Specification I by entering into a verbal confrontation with Sergeant Brickus in plain view of law officers and members of the public. The Hearing Board recommended seven days loss of leave and a letter of reprimand, which the Police Commissioner imposed by Final Order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Detective Ellsworth filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, a \u201cPetition for Judicial Review of Decision and Order, and Final Order of Police Commissioner Pursuant to the Maryland Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During his hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Detective Ellsworth, among other concerns, asserted that his LEOBR hearing was \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d because of \u201cmisconduct on the part of the Department regarding Detective Redd\u201d, specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">by failing to disclose ... exculpatory evidence, the Board was left with the mis-impression that this Detective, Detective Redd, was a credible person. When they should have said; we discredit his testimony, because though he calls himself a detective of the Baltimore City Police Department, he\u2019s in fact, one of the largest distributors of heroin in the City of Baltimore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Detective Ellsworth\u2019s counsel further asserted during the circuit court hearing that he inferred that Officer Redd was under investigation because of events occurring before the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">I drew an inference from what had transpired prior to the Hearing Board. The FBI contacted my client about Detective Redd. The DEA contacted me about Detective Redd. Had the ATF contacted me, I would have thought it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>something to do with alcohol or guns. Because it was the FBI and the DEA, I suspected that perhaps the man, Detective Redd, had something to do with drugs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Department argued that were there to have been an investigation, knowledge of it could not be \u201cimputed to the entire Department\u201d; that at the time of the hearing \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anything substantiated\u201d against Officer Redd and that \u201cpeople get investigated all the time\u201d sometimes turning up \u201cnothing\u201d; and, regardless, \u201ceven without the testimony of Redd ... there\u2019s enough evidence in the record\u201d that Detective Ellsworth would have been found guilty \u201c[e]ven if we just excluded Redd from the record\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">[W]hat matters is that Ellsworth was involved in this physical or verbal altercation out in public, before everybody. That\u2019s the first charge. And the second one is that he was disrespectful----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Those are the two things that he was found guilty of. I don\u2019t see how Redd really plays into that at all. I mean, other than, who was in command. But that doesn\u2019t really matter. He\u2019s not charged with being insubordinate. He\u2019s charged with being disrespectful to a superior officer. And, he\u2019s charged with conduct that\u2019s unbecoming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">I think \u2014 Ellsworth\u2019s own testimony admits that, you know, he sort of got into this verbal altercation. It was embarrassing to the Police Department. Everybody was watching. Other police officers---- There\u2019s, you know, sixteen witness\u2019s statements of people who, you know, have varying degree of watching this episode. But Redd you can throw out Redd, and there\u2019s still plenty of evidence, I think, to find that he was disrespectful to Brickus, and that he acted and his behavior was unbecoming to a police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">In reversing the Police Commissioner\u2019s Final Order imposing the hearing board\u2019s recommended sanction, the judge honed in on the fact that the Department failed to disclose any information regarding an investigation of Officer Redd, which, under the court\u2019s view, constituted a violation of the LEOBR:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Petitioner asserts that no exculpatory evidence or material was provided specifically concerning Detective Redd.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] Petitioner further asserts that at the hearing, Respondent, Baltimore Police Department, continued to deny any knowledge of any exculpatory or impeachment evidence relating to Detective Redd. It is asserted by Petitioner that on or about July 19, 2011, sixty-three days after Petitioner\u2019s hearing, Detective Redd was arrested and charged with federal drug conspiracy and firearm charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-4\">In the instant case, Petitioner\u2019s counsel wrote a detailed letter, which is part of the record therein, to the Office of Legal Affairs of the Baltimore Police Department specifically outlining his requests regarding exculpatory evidence. In response, Petitioner received no evidence whatsoever regarding Detective Redd. On the facts in the record herein, the Court finds that the rights of Petitioner were prejudiced by the manner in which the Respondent dealt with the issues pertaining to Detective Redd. This Court finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose any information regarding the investigation of Detective Redd constitutes a violation of Petitioner\u2019s rights under the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights and, therefore, constitutes an unlawful procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The Department appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting the following question for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Did the Circuit Court err in finding that [BPD] violated the rights of the Appellee under LEBOR [sic] \u00a7 3-104(n)(l) by failing to disclose any information regarding the FBI\u2019s investigation of a witness in the trial board, Daniel Redd, for distributing controlled dangerous substances and handgun violations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\"><em>Baltimore Police Department v. Ellsworth, </em>211 Md.App. 198, 201, 63 A.3d 1192, 1193 (2013) (alterations in original). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>intermediate appellate court, in a reported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, determining, <em>inter alia, </em>that the information regarding Officer Redd would not have tended to exonerate Detective Ellsworth of the administrative charges of being disrespectful to a superior officer or engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer, \u201cand, therefore, does not fall within the definition of \u2018exculpatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 211, 63 A.3d at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We confront the same issues of whether the precepts of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and its progeny, should be imported into the LEOBR, and if so, whether the Department is thereby obligated to disclose information in the administrative setting about an alleged criminal investigation of a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States held that, \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d at 218. In <em>Brady, </em>the defendant and a companion, Boblit, were found guilty of murder in the first degree in separate trials and were sentenced to death. <em>Id. </em>at 84, 83 S.Ct. at 1195, 10 L.Ed.2d at 217. Prior to trial, Brady requested access to extrajudicial statements that were made by Boblit; although the prosecution disclosed several statements, it withheld the statement in which Boblit admitted to committing the homicide. <em>Id. </em>On appeal from his denial of post-conviction relief, we determined that the withholding of the confession was prejudicial to Brady and denied him due process of law and remanded the case for retrial on the issue of punishment only. <em>Brady v. State, </em>226 Md. 422, 430-31, 174 A.2d 167,171 (1961), <em>aff'd, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). On certiorari, the Supreme Court affirmed and held that although Boblit\u2019s confession did not exculpate Brady, it was material to the determination of his punishment, such that the failure of its disclosure violated due process. <em>See Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 90-91, 83 S.Ct. at 1198, 10 L.Ed.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 151, 92 S.Ct. 763, 764, 31 L.Ed.2d 104, 106 (1972), the Court confronted the question of whether <em>Brady </em>was implicated by the nondisclosure of a promise not to prosecute made by the State to its key witness in exchange for his testimony. The Court determined that because the State relied almost entirely on the witness\u2019s testimony as the co-conspirator to substantiate the charges against Giglio for passing forged money orders, his credibility was critical, such that without his testimony \u201cthere could have been no indictment and no evidence to carry the case to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150-51, 154, 92 S.Ct. at 764, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d at 106-07, 109. Therefore, the failure to disclose the plea deal entitled the defendant to a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 92 S.Ct. at 766, 31 L.Ed.2d at 109. In so doing, the Court acknowledged that the State\u2019s failure to disclose evidence that could be used for impeachment was not automatically a violation of <em>Brady, </em>if the evidence was \u201cnot likely to have changed the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 92 S.Ct. at 766, 31 L.Ed.2d at 108, quoting <em>United States v. Keogh, </em>391 F.2d 138, 148 (2d Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">In <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 100-03, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2396-97, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 347-49 (1976), the Court considered whether the State was required under <em>Brady </em>to disclose that the victim in a murder trial had been convicted of assault and two charges of carrying a deadly weapon, which could be used by the defendant to show his propensity for violence in furtherance of Agurs\u2019s theory of self-defense. The Court concluded that the victim\u2019s convictions were not material to the case because they were cumulative of other evidence and were not likely to have changed the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 96 S.Ct. at 2402, 49 L.Ed.2d at 355-56. The Court explained that the prosecutor does not have an obligation to disclose all information, because \u201c[i]f everything that might influence a jury must be disclosed, the only way a prosecutor could discharge his constitutional duty would be to allow complete discovery of his files as a matter of routine practice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 96 S.Ct. at 2400, 49 L.Ed.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 670-74, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3377-79, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 486-89 (1985), the Court addressed whether the State\u2019s duty to disclose under <em>Brady </em>extended to the terms of the agreements reached between two key witnesses with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to supply information about the defendant\u2019s narcotics and gun dealings in exchange for money. The conviction was reversed and remanded because the prosecutor had misrepresented the lack of inducement and there could be a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, had the information been disclosed, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 105 S.Ct. at 3384-85, 87 L.Ed.2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Our <em>Brady </em>jurisprudence began in 1964 with <em>Dyson v. Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary, </em>233 Md. 630, 196 A.2d 455 (1964), and extends to our most recent case of <em>Derr v. State, </em>434 Md. 88, 73 A.3d 254 (2013). This jurisprudence clearly shows that <em>Brady </em>is limited to the criminal context and has never been applied in a civil or administrative setting. The Supreme Court, likewise, has not extended <em>Brady </em>beyond the criminal context and has explained that <em>Brady </em>and its progeny are \u201caccess-to-evidence cases\u201d, specific to criminal prosecutions, imposed to ensure \u201cthe integrity of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 2532, 81 L.Ed.2d 413, 420 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We have found violations of <em>Brady </em>in situations in which the State has failed to disclose confessions by one other than the defendant, <em>Bloodsworth v. State, 307 </em>Md. 164, 175, 512 A.2d 1056, 1061 (1986), prior material inconsistencies in statements made by key witnesses and in situations in which a witness for the State had received inducements to testify, which had not been disclosed by the prosecution. <em>Ware v.

Supplement to the One Hundred Fifty-Eighth Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure at 4 (March 25, 2008). At that time, Rule 4-263 was amended to more specifically require disclosure by the State of evidence of a relationship or agreement between the witness and prosecution; prior criminal convictions; materially inconsistent witness statements not otherwise memorialized; medical, psychiatric, or addiction conditions of the witness that would impair his ability to testify truthfully; the witness\u2019s failure of a polygraph examination; the witness\u2019s failure to identify the defendant; and \u201cevidence of prior conduct to show the character of the witness for untruthfulness pursuant to Rule 5-608(b).\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">What is significant is that our Rule does not require disclosure by the State of alleged investigations or \u201cbad acts\u201d of witnesses, not having resulted in a conviction and not related to a witness\u2019s character for untruthfulness. In this regard, we have long-held that \u201cmere accusations of crime or misconduct may not be used to impeach____[Accusations of misconduct are still clothed with the presumption of innocence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and receiving mere accusations for this purpose would be tantamount to accepting someone else\u2019s assertion of the witness\u2019 guilt and pure hearsay.\u201d <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 Md. 173, 179-80, 468 A.2d 319, 322 (1983) (citations omitted). Furthermore, not all acts of misconduct are \u201cprior bad acts that are relevant to assessing [the witness\u2019s] credibility regardless of whether a conviction resulted\u201d, but only those crimes or bad acts that logically relate to a witness\u2019s character for untruthfulness. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>298 Md. 193, 197, 468 A.2d 328, 331 (1983); <em>see Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 704, 436 A.2d 906, 907-08 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Detective Ellsworth, as he must, concedes that the constitutional protections afforded by <em>Brady </em>do not apply in an administrative setting, but, instead, argues that \u201cexculpatory\u201d is \u201ca term of art whose meaning may be found in <em>Brady </em>and its progeny,\u201d which the Legislature intended to import into the statute by including the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d in the 1987 amendment to Section 3-104(n). He argues that he was prejudiced by the Department\u2019s failure to disclose the alleged investigation of Officer Redd, because he could not have been found guilty of insubordination, unless the \u201cHearing Board weighed the testimony of Detective Redd against that of three others: Lieutenant Carter, Major McLarney and Detective Joshua Ellsworth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The Department argues that the language of Section 3-104(n) is not ambiguous and the plain meaning of the terms should apply: \u201cexculpatory\u201d meaning \u201ctending to clear from a charge of fault or of guilt\u201d and \u201cimpeach\u201d meaning \u201cto challenge or discredit the credibility, of a witness,\u201d citing Webster\u2019s Revised Unabridged Dictionary 521, 734 (1913). Further, the Department argues that the legislative history of the LEOBR does not indicate that the Legislature intended \u201cexculpatory\u201d in Section 3-104(n) to include all impeachment information, as the statute differentiated between that which is \u201cexculpatory information\u201d and that which is \u201cnonexculpatory information.\u201d Further, the Department proffers that Rule 4-263 provides guidance as to the distinct definitions of the terms \u201cexculpatory\u201d and \u201cimpeachment,\u201d such that the infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mation sought by Detective Ellsworth was \u201cnonexculpatory\u201d, because it did not tend to negate the guilt of Detective Ellsworth. The Department argues, alternatively, even assuming <em>arguendo, </em>it was required to disclose information regarding an investigation by the federal law enforcement agencies into Officer Redd\u2019s activities, that failure did not prejudice Detective Ellsworth as he was aware of the very information he alleges he was wrongfully denied; because mere accusations of illegal conduct cannot be used to impeach a witness; extrinsic evidence could not have been introduced to contradict Officer Redd\u2019s testimony; and also Officer Redd\u2019s testimony was cumulative of other witnesses\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">What is clear, however, is that the legislative history of Section 3-104(n) contains no reference to <em>Brady </em>and its progeny. It does, however, reflect a myriad of concerns regarding disclosure of information beyond the officer and the conduct with which the officer was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The LEOBR was enacted in Chapter 722 of the Maryland Laws of 1974, \u201cto provide procedural safeguards for law enforcement officers during any investigation and subsequent hearing that might result in disciplinary action ... \u2018in <em>departmental </em>disciplinary matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyle v.

City of Hagerstown, </em>324 Md. 519, 526, 597 A.2d 972, 975 (1991). The investigation of charges against a law enforcement officer and a resultant hearing under the LEOBR are distinctly administrative. <em>See Popkin v.

The LEOBR though, does not define \u201cexculpatory information\u201d or \u201cnonexculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>information\u201d, nor do other provisions of the Maryland Code in which the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d is used.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">The precursor of Section 3-104(n) was Section 728(b)(5) of Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol., 1974 Supp.), which provided an officer under investigation with information regarding the \u201cnature of the investigation\u201d and \u201cthe names of all witnesses.\u201d The ambiguity of these provisions led to various proposals for revision by the General Assembly in 1976 and 1977. <em>See </em>Letter from Roy W. Rafter, Chairman, Governor\u2019s Commission to Review the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights to Hon. Steny Hoyer, President of the Senate, and Hon. John Hanson Briscoe, Speaker of the House (January 7, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">By 1984, House Bill 916<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> was proposed to provide a police officer under investigation with a copy of the investigatory file in addition to the names of any witnesses and all charges and specifications.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While House Bill 916 was under consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>in the House Judiciary Committee, Bernard D. Crooke, Chief of Police for the Montgomery County Department of Police, voiced strong opposition to the bill as worded because it would have required disclosure of information beyond the officer\u2019s involvement in the specific incident, thereby potentially compromising witnesses\u2019 cooperation and more importantly, \u201cother law enforcement investigations\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">It cannot be stated too strongly the \u201cchilling effect\u201d a wholesale release of the entire file would have on investigations into alleged police misconduct. Citizen witnesses and fellow police officers are frequently reluctant to speak out in these situations as it is, but we are presently able to assure them that their statement will be released only if they are called upon to testify at the trial board and then, only that portion of their comments which is relevant to this charge will be released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">Another consideration is that release of the entire file could jeopardize other law enforcement investigations. Internal affairs officers frequently encounter a situation where information on a distinct charge against the same or different officers is contained in one statement. Sometimes this information is part of charges that have been completed and sometimes the investigation is still ongoing. Under the proposed amendment, this information would be released as well and would very likely compromise the progress of those ongoing investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Opposition Statement to House Bill 916 (March 8, 1984) (statement of Bernard Crooke, Chief of Police for the Montgomery County Department of Police). Significantly, the final version of the bill excluded disclosure of information within the investigatory file that was not relevant to the charges for which the officer was under investigation, with the provision that: \u201cthe law enforcement officer under investigation shall be furnished with a copy of the investigatory file, excluding the identity of confidential sources, any information which will not be used in the upcoming hearing, and recommendations as to charges, disposition or punishment\u201d.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> 1984 Maryland Laws, Chapter 660, codified at Section 728(b)(5) of the Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl.

Lieutenant Emmit Jones of the Baltimore Police Department also provided written testimony against the bill, cautioning against disclosure of information related to pending investigations that could be compromised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">It would provide to the accused officer facing a Hearing (Trial Board) not only the investigative file involving the pending hearing, but any other pending Internal Investigation File which is relevant to the charges and specifications against the officer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">It is conceivable that an officer could be facing a Hearing for Excessive Force while he is being investigated for possible criminal activity which is relevant to the charge of Excessive Force. To be faced with a legal requirement to divulge the second investigation prior to completion of the Hearing is not only unjustified but would compromise the ongoing investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Statement of Lieutenant Emmit Jones of the Baltimore Police Department Regarding House Bill 704 \u2014 Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights \u2014 Investigatory Files \u2014 As Prepared for a Hearing Before the House Judiciary Committee (March 16, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The House Judiciary Committee recommended language that specified that the Department must provide the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>under investigation with the investigatory file and information that was \u201cexculpatory\u201d but not information that was \u201cnonexculpatory\u201d to the charges for which the officer was under investigation. House Bill 704 as adopted, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">(III) IN ADDITION, THE LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICER UNDER INVESTIGATION SHALL BE FURNISHED WITH A COPY OF THE INVESTIGATORY FILE AND ANY EXCULPATORY INFORMATION, BUT EXCLUDING:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">1.

What is significant, then, is the fact that if exculpatory information were disclosed, it would relate only to the officer investigated and the specific incident in which the officer had been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Not only is there absolutely nothing in the text of Section 3-104(n) or its legislative history to indicate, as Detective Ellsworth suggests, that the General Assembly considered or intended to use the term \u201cexculpatory\u201d to import <em>Brady </em>and its progeny into the administrative LEOBR process, but there is nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>require state and federal agencies to provide information regarding pending investigations unrelated to the officer and his or her specific charges. Rather, the history supports only the conclusion that the Legislature only intended to disclose information related to the officer and the charges specified rather than the disclosure of information regarding an alleged extraneous investigation of a witness, which did not relate to the officer and his or her specific charges involved in the hearing.

Although I agree with the Majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that there is no indication in the legislative history of H.B. 704 of 1987 that suggests explicitly that the Legislature intended to import broadly <em>Brady </em>and its progeny into the LEOBR by inclusion of a requirement that a charged officer be given pre-hearing by the department any exculpatory information (Maj. op. at 96-97, 89 A.3d at 1199-1200), I disagree with the Majority opinion\u2019s absence of any appreciation that \u201cexculpatory information\u201d should include potential impeachment information regarding a departmental material witness to the alleged misconduct. The Majority opinion concludes that \u201cthe Legislature only intended to disclose information related to the officer and the charges specified rather than the disclosure of information regarding an alleged extraneous investigation of a witness, which did not relate to the officer and his or her specific charges involved in the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Neither the language of H.B. 704, as enacted, nor the legislative history pointed to by the Majority opinion (Maj. op. at 94-95, 89 A.3d at 1198-99), supports the Majority\u2019s conclusion. Moreover, to countenance the police department offering as one of its material witnesses an officer that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>at the time he was called to testify, was suspected by the department of being a distributor of illegal narcotics, and yet suppress that information, is 'wrong manifestly (even in an administrative proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Lieutenant Jones\u2019s testimony before the Legislature on H.B. 704 (recounted in pertinent part by the Majority opinion at 94-95, 89 A.3d at 1198-99) used as an illustration of what concerned him about the original bill the example of an ongoing, parallel investigation of the <em>charged officer </em>that could be compromised by premature revelation. This does not bolster the Majority opinion\u2019s view that the Legislature was concerned with divulging impeachment evidence of a departmental witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The legislative testimony of Sergeant Hoffman (Maj. op. at 94-95, 89 A.3d at 1198-99) was directed likewise to the unamended version of H.B. 704. The original bill excluded from disclosure \u201cany information that is the subject of any other pending investigation which is irrelevant to the charges and specifications against the officer.\u201d Maj. op. at 94 n. 26, 89 A.3d at 1198 n. 26. Even then, Sergeant Hoffman\u2019s relevant concern about the original language was about \u201crevealing information that may be to the detriment of ... other officers that may be involved____\u201d Maj. op. at 95, 89 A.3d at 1198. That also is not the circumstance of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Thus, the change made in the proposed legislation, after hearing these testimonies, should be read in the light of the concerns expressed to the Legislature, none of which suggested that impeachment information regarding a departmental material witness in the trial board proceedings of the pertinent charges against Detective Ellsworth should be deemed excluded as \u201cnon-exculpatory information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">I find it reprehensible that a police department may blind a trial board to the obvious credibility suspicions that would have arisen surely from the department producing a material witness (another police officer) that it has reason to suspect may be a drug dealer. Had Detective Redd been so discredited, the case against Detective Ellsworth could have come down essentially to a \u201che said/he said\u201d contest between Detective Ellsworth and Sergeant Brickus. With the unsullied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201ceyewitness\u201d corroboration by Detective Redd of Sergeant Brickus\u2019s version of what happened on 7 August 2009 at 2727 W. Garrison Avenue in Baltimore, the scales of the weight of the evidence tipped in the department\u2019s favor. The proceedings, in my judgment, were flawed fatally.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">I would hold that \u00a7 3-104(n)(l)(ii) of the Public Safety Article of the Maryland Code means that \u201cexculpatory information\u201d required to be disclosed includes potential impeachment information, known to the department, regarding a witness the department intends to call at the trial board proceedings. As that was not done in the present case and the implicated witness was a material eyewitness, Detective Ellsworth is entitled to a new trial board hearing. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the matter to that Court with directions to affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Chief Judge BARBERA and Judge ADKINS authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
