The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court and concluded that the trial judge had satisfied the requirements of Maryland Code, Section l-202(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article and adhered to Rule 16-819(c)(2)(A). Before this Court, Kusi, a native of Ghana who arrived in the United States four years prior to his conviction, alleges that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying him an interpreter for his criminal trial and also argues that the Court of Special Appeals applied a clear error review, which, he asserts, was the wrong standard of appellate review. Kusi petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. 432 Md. 466, 69 A.3d 474 (2013). In his petition, Kusi presented the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err in applying a \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard of review to requests for an interpreter, and under the proper standard, was it an abuse of discretion to refuse an interpreter for Petitioner at his jury trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">We shall hold that appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision to appoint an interpreter is a two-part process in which the reviewing court will first examine whether the trial judge\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous and, if those findings were not clearly erroneous, the reviewing court will then consider whether the trial judge abused his discretion in making the determination regarding whether to appoint an interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>With regard to the appointment of an interpreter in this particular case, Section 1-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.) required the trial judge to first make factual findings regarding whether Kusi could \u201creadily understand or communicate the English language\u201d and whether he could \u201cunderstand a charge made against [him] or help present the defense.\u201d We shall review the factual findings made by the trial judge utilizing a clearly erroneous standard. Thereafter, the trial judge determined that an interpreter was unnecessary, which we review under an abuse of discretion standard. In the present case, after applying the relevant standards, it is clear that the trial judge acted within his discretion to deny Kusi\u2019s request for an interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On the morning that Kusi\u2019s criminal jury trial was scheduled to commence, his attorney notified the trial court for the first time that, one week earlier, Kusi had requested that an interpreter be present at the trial:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9c\">[Defense Counsel]: I just need to ask the Court maybe to inquire. My client and I have had conversations during the pendency of this case\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">The Court: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 and we\u2019ve talked in English and everything. I met with him last week. For the first time he expressed the desire to have an interpreter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The Court: Really. What language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">[Defense Counsel]: He\u2019s Ashanti. There was no line.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] I contacted the office on Friday to see. What I\u2019m trying to do\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">The Court: Could I ask him some questions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Kusi was sworn by the court, and the trial judge proceeded to question him regarding his educational level and his use of the English language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">The Court: [H]ow far did you go in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">Kusi: My school was (unintelligible), but I learn a lot of language, but I\u2019m not really good in English.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">The Court: Well, I didn\u2019t ask you that. I asked you how far you went in school. I\u2019ll get to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-11\">Kusi: Middle school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-12\">The Court: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-13\">Kusi: Middle school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-14\">The Court: Middle school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-15\">Kusi: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">The Court: And if I could inquire, where were you born?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asa\">Kusi: Born in Ghana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-17\">The Court: In Ghana. Very good. And how old are you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-18\">Kusi: I\u2019m 44 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-19\">The Court: Forty-four. And when were you born?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-20\">Kusi: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-21\">The Court: What year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-22\">Kusi: June 16, 1967.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-23\">The Court: 1967. And when did you come to the United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Kusi: The date that I come to United States?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The Court: Just the year; I don\u2019t need the exact date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">Kusi: It\u2019s four years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">The Court: Four years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">Kusi: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">The Court: Okay. Very good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The trial court continued to question Kusi regarding what he did for a living and then addressed discussions between Kusi and his attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">The Court: And before this all happened, what did you do for a living?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\">Kusi: I just help my, one of my friend for home improvement so that he give me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-13\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-14\">The Court: [Y]ou have been represented by [defense counsel] since this case [w]as first brought, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-15\">Kusi: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-16\">The Court: And have you had meetings with [defense counsel]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-17\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-18\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-19\">The Court: [H]ave you told him everything you know about what the State alleges in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-20\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-21\">The Court: And has he answered all of your questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-22\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-23\">The Court: And when you\u2019ve spoken to [defense counsel], I take it, you have conversed in English, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-24\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-25\">The Court: Very good. And have you had any difficulty understanding what he\u2019s telling you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-26\">Kusi: Sometimes, but I put some words at, words down to ask some inmate in the (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The Court: So sometimes there\u2019s an idiom he uses that\u2019s not clear, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">Kusi: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">[Defense Counsel]: I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Kusi: No, he\u2019s clear, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 don\u2019t know if you heard what he said. I think he said he put some words down to ask an inmate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">Kusi: Inmate, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\">[Defense Counsel]: There was an occasion when there was another person that helped me talk\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\">The Court: An investigator or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\">[Defense Counsel]: No, no, against my better\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: Inmate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 another inmate that spoke Ashanti.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-15\">The Court: Okay. Very good. And has he answered all of your questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-16\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-17\">The Court: And are you satisfied that he\u2019s listened to what you\u2019ve had to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-18\">Kusi: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">The trial judge then addressed the nature of the proceedings against Kusi:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-20\">The Court: And do you know why you\u2019re here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-21\">Kusi: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-22\">The Court: Do you understand what you\u2019re accused of doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-23\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-24\">The Court: Believe me, the reason we\u2019re having a trial is the State has to prove it. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-25\">Kusi: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-26\">The Court: You don\u2019t have to prove anything. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-27\">Kusi: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-28\">The Court: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">The Court: You don\u2019t have to testify. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adce\">Kusi: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">The Court: You don\u2019t have to call witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Kusi: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">The Court: You understand that, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">The Court: In our system, the burden of proof always is on the State. Do you understand that, sir?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Defense counsel interrupted the dialogue at this juncture to request that the judge vary the dialogue from asking leading questions, which enabled Kusi to repeatedly answer yes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">Judge, I know you\u2019ve been asking him ... several questions, and he\u2019s ... been acknowledging by saying yes. Because of their leading nature----I\u2019m suggesting maybe a little alternating or something, because it\u2019s just the routine of saying yes ... to Your Honor, the authority, so I just want to make sure, because he\u2019s expressed to me not always understanding me, even the second or third time that I\u2019ve met with him by not understanding what we talked about before....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">The Court responded, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d and defense counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-16\">[Defense Counsel]: I want to make sure that he\u2019s comfortable doing this in English; that he understands what\u2019s going on. I know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-17\">The Court: Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-18\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 the prosecutor showed me, and I remember there was an advice of rights form that he acknowledged speaking four different languages partially, at least that\u2019s what he\u2019s told me, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-19\">The Court: Well, let me inquire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-20\">[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 I just want to make sure he knows\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQI\">The Court: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>[Defense Counsel]: \u2014 when he hears when you\u2019re talking that he understands it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The trial judge then began inquiring about Kusi\u2019s ability to speak languages other than English:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">The Court: Sir, what languages do you speak in whole or in part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">Kusi: I speak Dutch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">The Court: Dutch. Very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">Kusi: That\u2019s my language Ashanti.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">The Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">Kusi: And Italy language, which is Latin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">The Court: Any others? Where did you learn Dutch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">Kusi: The Dutch, I\u2019ll be in Germany sometimes, and I just pick it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\">The Court: How long have you been speaking Dutch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-15\">Kusi: Just a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\">The Court: Where did you learn English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">Kusi: When I came to United States, I started learn, learning English.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-18\">The Court: So, when you came here four years ago, you started learning English, is that fair, yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-19\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-20\">The Court: And you\u2019ve been able to work in the United States during those four years, is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-21\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-22\">The Court: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-23\">Kusi: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-24\">At this point, the judge began to inquire more specifically about what Kusi did for a living and what he did with the money he earned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-25\">The Court: Tell me a little bit about what you did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-26\">Kusi: For clean the carpet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-27\">The Court: Clean the carpet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-28\">Kusi: And fix the drywalls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The Court: Drywall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">Kusi: And fix the electrics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">The Court: Electrical work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">The Court: What other things, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">Kusi: I think that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">The Court: That\u2019s it. And how many years have you been doing it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">Kusi: (Unintelligible) I be here one year, I didn\u2019t work for nowhere, but after the three years the only thing that I have been doing to help my friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">The Court: During this time did you always work for the same company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-14\">The Court: And what was the name of the company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-15\">Kusi: Enos Power Clean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-16\">The Court: Very good. And how did you meet up with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-17\">Kusi: Oh, he, he from Ghana, and is a, a friend of mine introduce me to him. And he know I can work in the street without do anything, so he just take me like that for him to help me (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-18\">The Court: Okay. And how many days a week typically would you work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-19\">Kusi: Sometimes, sometime if he having a good job maybe three days, sometimes maybe one week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-20\">The Court: Okay. And how much were you paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-21\">Kusi: He used to give me two weeks, two weeks he used to give me about $600 or $700.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-22\">The Court: Would he pay you in cash or by check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-23\">Kusi: Cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-24\">The Court: All right. Do you have a bank account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-25\">Kusi: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-26\">The Court: So, you would just keep the cash, and spend it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Kusi: No, no, I don\u2019t spend it. I just, because I, before I am (unintelligible), and it doesn\u2019t have a good job, so I just help her to pay (unintelligible) that\u2019s why\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The judge then explored Kusi\u2019s possession of a Maryland driver\u2019s license, the test for which Kusi took in French:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The Court: Do you have a driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">Kusi: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">The Court: From what state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">Kusi: From Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">The Court: From Maryland. And I take it you had to take a written exam, a driving test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">The Court: What language did you take it in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">Kusi: I was (unintelligible), so French.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">The Court: You took it in French?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">The Court: And you passed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">The Court: Okay. And you\u2019ve been driving around Maryland, and D.C., and I take\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-19\">Kusi: Yeah, D.C., Laurel, Virginia, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-20\">The Court: Can you read the road signs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-21\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-22\">The Court: Okay. Anybody else have any additional suggestions for me at this time or requests?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-23\">The State\u2019s Attorney then interjected to request the court ask a few questions regarding the language Kusi used at home, as well as to request that the trial judge return to the court proceedings colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-24\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: Your Honor, just briefly. What language is spoken in the household with the victim and his girlfriend, the victim\u2019s mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-25\">The Court: Sir, when you were living with the child and her mom, did you speak to each other in English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-26\">Kusi: Yes, I tried to pick up from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The Court: Okay. And I take it the child speaks English. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">Kusi: (No audible response.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">The Court: When you spoke to the child, did you speak in English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">The Court: And when you spoke to the child\u2019s mom, did you speak in English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-10\">The Court: I\u2019m not asking you what you said. I\u2019m staying away from that. I\u2019m just asking the means of communication. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: My only other concern, Your Honor, is perhaps, we could ask if he\u2019s understood what has happened this morning in terms of discussion. We\u2019re obviously speaking to him directly, speaking more slowly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-12\">The Court: Let me ask it a little differently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-13\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: And keeping up with a trial is a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-14\">The Court: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-15\">[State\u2019s Attorney]: \u2014 little bit different. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-16\">The Court: Sir, we are here today to pick a jury. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-17\">Kusi: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-18\">The Court: And I\u2019ve been going over with your lawyer, and with the State, questions that I\u2019m going to ask potential jurors. Do you understand that? You have to say yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-19\">Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-20\">The Court: Thank you. The reason we do this is to try to figure out whether any potential jurors are going to be biased before they hear any evidence one way or another. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-21\">Kusi: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-22\">The Court: We don\u2019t want people starting off the trial leaning one way or another. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Kusi: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">The Court: The purpose is to get as neutral a jury as possible, understanding that everybody has opinions about things.

I\u2019ll answer them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Before stating his findings on the record and ultimately denying Kusi\u2019s request for an interpreter, the trial judge reminded Kusi that Kusi could stop the proceedings at any point if he did not understand what was happening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">The Court: Sir, if at any time you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on, tell [defense counsel], and he\u2019ll tell me, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">Kusi: Okay.

I find that he is able to communicate cogently with his counsel. I find that he is able to discuss with his counsel in English the facts of the case. I find that he\u2019s able to discuss with his counsel in English the legal strategies to be employed. I find that he understands as much as any civilian would understand the process of jury selection. And I find that he is able to proceed in this matter without the aid of an interpreter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-14\">If anything changes, somebody let me know, and I will revisit my findings, and, if necessary, make whatever accommodation needs to be made. Okay? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-15\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-16\">It is the language embodying the trial judge\u2019s determination that is couched as a finding that sparks, in part, the controver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>sy before us, in addition to the methodology employed by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Before us, Kusi argues that the trial judge erred when he determined not to appoint an interpreter during his trial. Kusi also contends that the Court of Special Appeals applied the wrong standard of review when it reviewed the judge\u2019s determination, having embraced clear error review. Kusi argues that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard of review, because the appointment of an interpreter is \u201ca \u2018reasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives.\u2019 \u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 22, <em>quoting Judge v. R and T Construction Co., </em>68 Md.App. 57, 60, 509 A.2d 1236, 1237 (1986)). Kusi\u2019s counsel at oral argument reasoned that were the correct standard for the determination to be used in review that we would reverse and remand because the trial judge did not adhere to the recommendation contained in the Committee Note appended to Rule 16-819, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">Committee note. \u2014 Examples of matters relating to identification are: name, address, birth date, age, and place of birth. Examples of questions that elicit active vocabulary in vernacular English are: How did you come to court today? What kind of work do you do? Where did you go to school? What was the highest grade you completed? What do you see in the courtroom? Examples of questions relating to the proceedings are: What do you understand this case to be about? What is the purpose of what we are doing here in court? What can you tell me about the rights of the parties to a court case? What are the responsibilities of a court witness? Questions should be phrased to avoid \u201cyes or no\u201d replies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Kusi\u2019s argument also relies on the word \u201cshall\u201d as used in Section 1-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 RepLVol.) which mandates that courts \u201cshall appoint a qualified interpreter\u201d when the defendant cannot readily understand or communicate in English because, he contends, the court was obligated to appoint him an interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>The State argues that the trial judge\u2019s lengthy colloquy with Kusi supports the trial judge\u2019s factual findings and that, even under an abuse of discretion standard, his determination that there was no need for an interpreter should be affirmed. The State posits, though, that the clearly erroneous standard of review is the appropriate standard to apply because, according to the State, the court\u2019s inquiry in determining whether to appoint an interpreter necessarily involves a factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The Court of Special Appeals rejected the State\u2019s argument, which the State has abandoned before this Court, that Kusi\u2019s statement indicating that he was \u201cgonna be fine\u201d represented an affirmative waiver. The intermediate appellate court did agree, however, with the State that \u201cit was incumbent upon [Kusi] to let the court know if there came a point during trial when [Kusi] could not understand the proceedings.\u201d The intermediate appellate court referenced its earlier decision in <em>Biglari v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 665 n. 2, 847 A.2d 1239, 1244 n. 2 (2004), in which the court announced that \u201c[the] statutory mandate [of Section 1-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article] requires that we apply the clearly erroneous standard of review to the issue of whether [a defendant] was entitled to an interpreter.\u201d As the <em>Biglari </em>court explained the clearly erroneous standard, \u201c[a] judge\u2019s decision is not clearly erroneous if the record shows that there is legally sufficient evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 847 A.2d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The intermediate appellate court noted that the trial judge had \u201cengaged in an extensive colloquy\u201d with Kusi and held that \u201cthe judge was not clearly erroneous in finding that [Kusi] understood the English language well enough to participate meaningfully in the proceedings\u201d and that the trial \u201ccourt\u2019s determination concerning appellant\u2019s need for an interpreter was not clearly erroneous.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the trial judge had satisfied the requirements of Maryland Code, Section l-202(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article and had fulfilled the dictates of Rule 16-819(c)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The history of Rule 16-819 and our recent jurisprudence regarding appointment of an interpreter do not assist us in answering the ultimate question of when an interpreter should be appointed by the court or what is the correct standard of review to employ. Our most recent cases involving interpreters, <em>Gonzalez v. State, </em>429 Md. 632, 57 A.3d 484 (2012) and <em>Kang v. State, </em>393 Md. 97, 899 A.2d 843 (2006), address different questions. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>this Court confronted the admissibility of incriminating statements made by a defendant who claimed, due to the lack of an interpreter, he did not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he was given. While the <em>Gonzalez </em>opinion aptly demonstrates this Court\u2019s reluctance to second guess the factual findings of a trial court, it does not address the standard of review applicable to requests for an interpreter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Likewise, in <em>Kang, </em>an interpreter had been appointed by the trial court and the appointment was not challenged in this Court. Rather, this Court assessed Kang\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>claims that untranslated portions of the proceedings had unfairly impacted his waiver of a jury trial and, like our decision in <em>Gonzalez, </em>we relied upon the record to determine that a \u201cjury trial waiver was likely not the result of language deficiency\u201d and indicated that we were \u201csatisfied that [the defendant] had an opportunity to understand and participate in his criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Kang, </em>393 Md. at 118, 899 A.2d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Before we address the ultimate question of whether an interpreter should have been appointed by the trial judge, we must address just how we review his decision. Maryland Rule 8-131 generally defines the scope of appellate review and subsection (c) describes the standards applied when an action has been tried without a jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Rule 8-131. Scope of review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">(c) Action tried without a jury. When an action has been tried without a jury, the appellate court will review the case on both the law and the evidence. It will not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the \"witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Unlike the dichotomy presented in the instant case between application of the clearly erroneous standard of review and that of abuse of discretion, we have acknowledged that Rule 8-131(c) does not always require a solitary standard of review, but rather there are often \u201cinterrelated standards\u201d applicable. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Victor A., </em>386 Md. 288, 297, 872 A.2d 662, 667 (2005). For example, we have articulated \u201cthree distinct aspects of review in child custody disputes.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. 551, 586, 819 A.2d 1030, 1051 (2003), <em>quoting Davis v. Davis, </em>280 Md. 119, 125, 372 A.2d 231, 232-33, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 939, 98 S.Ct. 430, 54 L.Ed.2d 299 (1977). <em>See also Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 513, 615 A.2d 1190, 1193 (1992); <em>McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 484, 593 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1991); <em>Domingues v.

Community Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Baltimore County, </em>437 Md. 115, 135, 85 A.3d 185, 197 (2014) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s evaluation of the evidence is reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard.... A court\u2019s decision to grant or deny declaratory relief is generally assessed under an \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard.\u201d); <em>State v. Walker, </em>345 Md. 293, 325, 691 A.2d 1341, 1356 (1997) (\u201cSome of the subsidiary determinations made by a trial court in arriving at its findings and conclusions may well be purely factual or discretionary ones, and, as to them, we will continue to apply a clearly erroneous or abuse of discretion standard.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Because the trial judge in this case, as required by Rule 16-819, first made factual findings concerning Kusi\u2019s ability to use the English language, the first tier of review in this case involves an examination of the trial judge\u2019s factual findings using the clear error standard. We will give deference to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, while still reviewing those findings for clear error, because we give \u201c \u2018due regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility\u2019 \u201d of the evidence. <em>City of Bowie v. MIE Properties, </em>398 Md. 657, 676, 922 A.2d 509, 521 (2007), <em>quoting </em>Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(c); <em>Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty.

As this Court has previously stated, \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>199 Md. 121, 130, 85 A.2d 759, 763 (1952) (internal quotations omitted). Judge Wilner expounded on the concept of clear error review in <em>Attorney Grievance v.

If the check admitted into evidence was blue in color, and we could see it was blue in color, we certainly would not accept the judge\u2019s crediting of the office manager\u2019s testimony that it was yellow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Applying the clearly erroneous standard of review to the present case, it is evident that the trial judge did not commit clear error when he found that Kusi could \u201cunderstand[ ] the nature of the proceeding,\u201d \u201cdiscuss with his counsel in English the facts of the case,\u201d and \u201cunderstand[ ] as much as any civilian would understand the process of jury selection.\u201d The trial judge had an opportunity firsthand to hear Kusi speak English during the lengthy process, and the judge also asked a number of questions that revealed the amount of education Kusi had received, the jobs he had worked in the U.S., and his use of English in his home. Kusi\u2019s answers to these questions revealed that his knowledge of the English language was thorough enough to allow him to proceed without an interpreter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">After the trial judge made the factual findings that Kusi \u201cunderstands the nature of the proceedings\u201d and was \u201cable to communicate cogently with his counsel,\u201d the trial judge next stated, \u201cI find that [Kusi] is able to proceed in this matter without the aid of an interpreter.\u201d Although the trial judge used language indicating that this statement was a \u201cfinding,\u201d the statement was the legal determination that the trial judge reached when he applied Maryland Rule 16-819 to the facts found. We have stated that the clearly erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>standard \u201cdoes not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based upon findings of fact.\u201d <em>In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 585, 819 A.2d at 1050; <em>see also Nesbit v.

Elza, </em>300 Md. 51, 55-56, 475 A.2d 1180, 1182 (1984).

John Crane, Inc., </em>385 Md. 185, 198, 867 A.2d 1077, 1084 (2005), <em>quoting In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118-19 (1997) (citations omitted). We also have said that the trial court abuses its discretion when, \u201c \u2018no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. at 312, 701 A.2d at 118, <em>quoting North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13, 648 A.2d 1025, 1031 (1994). A reviewing court may also find an abuse of discretion when \u201cthe ruling under consideration is \u2018clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court\u2019 ... or when the ruling is \u2018violative of fact and logic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Under any of our articulations, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied the appointment of an interpreter in the instant case. His extended colloquy and his factual findings support his determination that an interpreter was not needed at Kusi\u2019s trial. Rule 16-819(e)(2)(B) specifically indicates that a \u201ccourt\u2019s examination\u201d should include questions relating to a defendant\u2019s \u201cidentification,\u201d \u201cactive vocabulary in vernacular English,\u201d and \u201cthe court proceedings.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s factual findings show that he had examined Kusi regarding each of these areas described in the Rule and that the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was clearly based on the finding that Kusi could understand. The record clearly demonstrates that the trial judge was attempting to ascertain, in compliance with the Rule, whether Kusi spoke English \u201cwell enough to participate fully in the proceedings and to assist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>counsel,\u201d Rule 16 \u2014 8!9(c)(2)(i), and in so doing, did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Finally, although Kusi argues that the statutory language of \u201cshall\u201d in Section l-202(a) of the Criminal Procedure Article requires the appointment of an interpreter when requested by the defendant, it is clear that the obligatory language only applies when the statutory precondition is met. With respect to the appointment of an interpreter, the statutory precondition is a factual finding that the criminal defendant is unable to understand and communicate readily in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Kusi also asserts that the Committee Note to Rule 16-819, which gives courts \u201c[e]xamples of questions that elicit active vocabulary in vernacular English\u201d and \u201c[ejxamples of questions relating to the proceedings,\u201d also directs that, \u201c[questions should be phrased to avoid \u2018yes or no\u2019 replies.\u201d While the Note advises, it is not binding, because it is not part of the Maryland Rules. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 1 \u2014 201(e) (\u201ccommittee notes ... are not part of these rules\u201d). As this Court has previously stated, \u201cthe Committee Note following the Rule lay[s] out the kinds of things a court <em>may </em>do.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Arrington v. Department of Human Resources, </em>402 Md. 79, 104-05, 935 A.2d 432, 448 (2007) (emphasis in original); <em>see also Bijou v. Young-Battle, </em>185 Md.App. 268, 288, 969 A.2d 1034, 1046 (2009) (\u201ccommittee notes ... are not part of [the Maryland] Rules\u201d). The Note does not impose a <em>per se </em>requirement that the questions asked must follow a certain rubric.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The trial judge in this case made extensive findings based on a lengthy colloquy which included multiple open-ended questions directed to the defendant. While it may be that the trial judge could have asked more open-ended questions relating to the defendant\u2019s comprehension of courtroom procedures, it is nonetheless clear that the trial judge elicited enough information from the defendant to make factual findings that Kusi understood \u201cEnglish well enough to participate fully in the proceedings and to assist counsel,\u201d which did not constitute clear error. The legal determination that Kusi was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>therefore, not entitled to the appointment of an interpreter under either Section 1-202 of the Criminal Procedure Article or Maryland Rule 16-819 was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Generally, pursuant to Rule 16-819(b), requests for an interpreter should be submitted to the clerk of court not less than 30 days before the proceeding. Rule 16-819(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(b) Application for the appointment of an interpreter. A person who needs an interpreter may apply to the court for the appointment of an interpreter. As far as practicable, an application for the appointment of an interpreter shall be (1) presented on a form approved by administrative order of the Court of Appeals and available from die clerk of the court and (2) submitted not less than 30 days before the proceeding for which the interpreter is requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azq\">In the present case, the State did not challenge the timeliness of the request nor did it assert waiver as an argument. Rather, the State conceded in oral argument that the Rule states that applications for the appointment of an interpreter should be submitted in a timely manner \u201d[a]s far as practicable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-24\">.

Of note, in the <em>Gonzalez </em>opinion is this Court\u2019s indication that it would '\u2018defer to the motion court\u2019s factual findings and uphold them unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>429 Md. 632, 647, 57 A.3d 484, 493 (2012). The Court's inquiry in <em>Gonzalez, </em>focused not on the adequacy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings given, but rather on the trial court's acceptance of testimony from a trooper explaining his belief that the defendant had understood the warnings. This Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">In evaluating the adequacy of the warnings issued by [the trooper], we begin with a crucial credibility determination made by the suppression court. The court stated that it \"believe[d] the testimony of [the trooper] to be both truthful and persuasive.\u201d That credibility determination is virtually unassailable. Consequently, we, as the reviewing court, must accept as fact (as obviously did the suppression court) [the trooper's] testimony concerning his impressions of Petitioner\u2019s comprehension of not only the Spanish language, but also the trooper\u2019s phonetic pronunciation of the Mixtee words for \"court\u201d and \"attorney.\u201d Indeed, the suppression court found that Petitioner \"could sufficiently understand Spanish in order to waive his rights under <em>Miranda.\u201d </em>Implicit in that finding, moreover, is the suppression court's predicate (albeit unexpressed) finding that Petitioner sufficiently comprehended the <em>Miranda </em>warnings so as to enable him to make a valid waiver of the rights described therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 57 A.3d at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">As we shall address <em>infra, </em>a locus on the trial court\u2019s factual determination is likewise controlling in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b418-7\">McDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALKT\">concurring, in which BARBERA, C. J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">I concur in the judgment, but do not join the Court\u2019s opinion. While I agree with the outcome of the case, I do not understand the Court\u2019s use of multiple standards of review in this context. In particular, I do not believe that an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard need be overlaid on the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard that the Court also applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">The relevant statute and rule require the appointment of an interpreter for a defendant in specified circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, the relevant statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Z\">(a) The court shall appoint a qualified interpreter to help a defendant ... when the defendant ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">(2) Cannot readily understand or communicate the English language and cannot understand a charge ... or help present the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Maryland Code, Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), \u00a7 1-202(a) (emphasis added). Similarly, the related court rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>The court shall appoint a spoken language interpreter if the court determines that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">(i) the party does not understand English well enough to participate fully in the proceedings and to assist counsel, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(ii) the party ... does not speak English well enough to be understood by counsel, the court, and the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Rule 16-819(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">As is evident, both CP \u00a7 1-202 and Rule 16-819 state that a trial court \u201cshall appoint\u201d an interpreter for the defendant if the court finds that certain circumstances exist \u2014 for example, that the defendant does not readily understand English or does not speak it well enough to be understood by the jury. If those circumstances exist, the court has <em>no discretion </em>\u2014 it must appoint an interpreter. Whether the predicate circumstances exist is a factual determination made by the trial court. As is generally the case, a trial court\u2019s fact findings are reviewed by an appellate court under a \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>See Biglari, </em>156 Md.App. at 665-68 &amp; n. 2, 847 A.2d 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The Majority opinion appears to agree with the reasoning above. <em>See </em>Majority op. at pp. 383-86, 91 A.3d at 1203-05. But the Majority opinion then goes on to add an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard as well. <em>See </em>Majority op. at pp. 385-87, 91 A.3d at 1204-06. The Majority opinion does not indicate what legal provision compels an exercise of discretion by the trial court and what, if any, criteria exist for measuring the exercise of that discretion \u2014 apart from the criteria in CP \u00a7 1-202 and Rule 16-819, which do not accord the trial court <em>any </em>discretion if the factual predicate for appointment of an interpreter is established.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The introduction of this standard of review, untethered to CP \u00a7 1-202, Rule 16-819, or any other legal provision, has the potential to sow confusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Chief Judge BARBERA joins this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-12\">. Although neither the Supreme Court nor our Court has announced a constitutional right to the appointment of an interpreter, these provisions appear designed to satisfy the constitutional bases for such a right. <em>See Biglari v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 657, 665, 847 A.2d 1239, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 Md. 686, 856 A.2d 723 (2004) (\"[t]he ability to understand the proceedings is essential to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial\u201d); <em>United States ex rel. Negron v. New York, </em>434 F.2d 386, 389 (2d Cir.1970) (due process, the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, and the right to be present at one\u2019s own trial required appointment of interpreter for a defendant who did not speak or understand English).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\">. As the Majority opinion notes, Rule 16-819 also sets forth the procedure a trial court should follow to determine whether the predicate factual circumstances exist. I have no quarrel with the Majority\u2019s assessment of the trial court's compliance with those procedures. Majority op. at pp. 386-88, 91 A.3d 1205-06.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\">. I suppose that we might say that a trial court has \u201cdiscretion\u201d to appoint an interpreter even if the appointment is not compelled by CP \u00a7 1-202 or Rule 16-819, but it is difficult to imagine how that decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>would be subjected to review under an \"abuse of discretion\u201d standard. Presumably, the defendant would not object to that assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\">. If it were contended that a trial court misinterpreted the requirements of CP \u00a7 1-202 or Rule 16-819, our review would not accord the trial court\u2019s legal interpretation any deference \u2014 that is, we would not apply an \"abuse of discretion\u201d standard, but would review the trial court\u2019s legal determination <em>de novo.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
