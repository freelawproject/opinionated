On one hand, Maryland law recognizes that property owners owe no affirmative duty of care to trespassers. On the other hand, settled Maryland precedent acknowledges that, in some instances, the duty of care in a negligence action may arise from statute or regulation. Our task is to examine this intersection, and clarify the relationship between these two facially divergent principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Around 9 a.m. on June 13, 2010, three-year-old Christopher Paul and his ten-year-old brother, Andre, went to play outside their parents\u2019 apartment home at Country Place Apartments (\u201cCountry Place\u201d) in Burtonsville, Maryland. The two boys returned to the apartment three times before going back outside to continue playing. A few minutes after the boys went outside for the third time, Andre came to the apartment and asked the boys\u2019 mother, Alicia Paul (\u201cRespondent\u201d), where Christopher was. Respondent and Andre went outside to look for Christopher, with Respondent looking between cars in the parking lot while Andre looked behind the apartment building. Respondent and Andre then began walking on the sidewalk toward the apartment complex\u2019s pool, all the while shouting Christopher\u2019s name and continuing to look between the cars in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Eventually Respondent decided to move toward the pool. Upon nearing the pool, Respondent saw Christopher\u2019s t-shirt and slippers just inside the pool\u2019s gate. Respondent attempted to push the gate open, but could not do so. At that time, the pool\u2019s lifeguards arrived, and Respondent asked them to open the gate. After one of the lifeguards unchained the gate, Respondent ran to the pool and saw that Christopher was submerged in the water. One of the lifeguards jumped into the pool and pulled Christopher out of the water. The lifeguards began CPR while Respondent spoke to a 911 operator. Police officers responded to the scene, relieving one of the lifeguards who was performing chest compressions while the other lifeguard continued to perform rescue breaths. These efforts continued until paramedics arrived and transported Christopher to the pediatric emergency room at Howard County General Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">As a result of this near drowning, Christopher sustained a severe anoxic brain injury. He now has multiple, complex medical conditions. Christopher is dependent on others for mobility and feeding, is largely unresponsive, and has neither volitional movements nor functional vision. These conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>require continuous care. Doctors do not expect Christopher\u2019s various medical conditions to improve in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">On December 17, 2010, Respondent filed a complaint against Second Blackburn Limited Partnership (\u201cSecond Blackburn\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Berkshire Property Advisors, L.L.C. (\u201cBerkshire\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Community Pool Service, Inc. (\u201cCPS\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (collectively, \u201cPetitioners\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The complaint alleged negligence and negligence per se, and sought compensatory damages for medical expenses in the amount of $15,000,000, plus costs and interest. Respondent\u2019s negligence action alleged that Petitioners breached \u201ca duty to maintain the Country Place pool in a reasonably safe condition for all residents of Country Place Apartments, and particularly children of all ages, including Christopher.\u201d Respondent\u2019s negligence per se action alleged that Petitioners breached statutory and regulatory duties by failing to comply with pool regulations set forth in the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 10.17.01.01 <em>et seq.,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Montgomery County Code \u00a7 5 1-1 <em>et seq., </em>and Code of Montgomery County Regulations (\u201cCOMCOR\u201d) 51.00.01 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Blackburn and Berkshire filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to all of Respondent\u2019s claims, arguing that because Christopher was a trespasser, they only owed a duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring Christopher. Blackburn and Berkshire further stated that the alleged violations of state and county codes could not create a duty to Christopher because he was a trespasser, and argued that Christopher\u2019s unsupervised play was the intervening, superseding cause of his injuries. CPS also filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that as Blackburn\u2019s agent, it could not have owed Christopher a duty greater than the duty that Blackburn owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">After a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order granting Petitioners\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court held that Christopher\u2019s status changed from invitee to trespasser when he entered the pool area, and as a result, the only common-law duty owed \u201cwas to avoid willful and wanton misconduct or entrapment.\u201d The Circuit Court found no evidence to support a breach of that duty. Concerning the alleged statutory duty, the court first held that \u201ca potential violation of a statutory regulation is relevant only if the Court found that the Defendants owed [a] duty beyond that of a trespasser.\u201d The court also held that the alleged statutory violations did not set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence because the regulations at issue only became effective on February 10,1997 and did not require the Country Place pool, built in 1978, to comply with the new requirements. Finally, the court stated that a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence required finding that the violation of a regulation was a proximate cause of the injury, but \u201c[wjithout a scintilla of evidence demonstrating exactly how Christopher circumvented the fence, the Court cannot consider a possible violation as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court reversed the Circuit Court, holding that Petitioners were required to comply with the 1997 COMAR regulations and the 1997 Montgomery County statutory, provisions concerning pool barriers. <em>See Paul v. Blackburn Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>211 Md.App. 52, 105-06, 63 A.3d 1107, 1138-39 (2013). The court adopted those regulations as the standard of care, concluding that \u201cthe statutes and regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>were designed to create a cause of action in tort for the protection of the swimming public.\u201d <em>Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 106-08, 63 A.3d at 1139-40. The court firmly rejected the notion that a defendant must owe a common-law duty to a plaintiff before violation of a statute can be used as evidence of negligence. <em>Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 109, 63 A.3d at 1141. Finally, the intermediate appellate court held that the trial court erred in \u201cfinding there was not a \u2018scintilla of evidence demonstrating exactly how Christopher circumvented the fence,\u2019 and in granting summary judgment on the issue of causation.\u201d <em>Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 112, 63 A.3d at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Petitioners appealed to this Court, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">1. Has the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals abrogated more than eighty years of law holding that property owners owe no duty to trespassers onto their property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals improperly conclude that evidence of violation of regulations created a duty from a property owner to a trespasser?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">3. Has the Court of Special Appeals improperly applied COMAR regulations enacted more than twenty years after a swimming pool was constructed, contrary to the legislative history and the specific language of the regulations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">For the reasons described below, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\"> \u201cA trial court may grant summary judgment if there is no genuine dispute as to any 5 material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Ross v. Housing Auth. of Baltimore City, </em>430 Md. 648, 666-67, 63 A.3d 1, 12 (2013) (citing Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f)). When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we determine \u201cwhether the parties properly generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Myers v. Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 203, 892 A.2d 520, 529 (2006) (citation omitted). This Court considers \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe[s] any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). A plaintiffs claim must be supported by more than a \u201cscintilla of evidence^]\u201d as \u201cthere must be evidence upon which [a] jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738-39, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993) (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">If the trial court decision turns on a question of law, not a dispute of fact, we review the trial court\u2019s decision for legal correctness without deference. <em>See Mathews v. Cassidy Turley Maryland, Inc., </em>435 Md. 584, 598, 80 A.3d 269, 277 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Petitioners present three arguments that the Court of Special Appeals erred in reversing the Circuit Court. The first argument is based on Maryland law that has consistently and unambiguously held that property owners do not owe an affirmative duty to trespassers. This argument unfolds as follows: (1) in premises liability cases, legal duties are contingent on a person\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d on the premises; (2) there was no dispute of material fact that Christopher was a trespasser at the pool; and (3) given Christopher\u2019s status as a trespasser, Petitioners had no duty to protect Christopher from injury caused by his trespass into the pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Petitioners\u2019 second argument is that the regulations regarding fencing and barriers did not alter the limited common-law duty that Petitioners owed to Christopher as a trespasser. Asserting broadly that regulatory violations cannot create a duty where none exists under common law, Petitioners specifically contend that under Maryland law, regulations regarding fencing around pools or bodies of water will not create a duty from a property owner to a trespasser. Petitioners allege that in order to create a legal duty, a statute must expressly state that it is doing so \u2014 something the regulations at issue here fail to do. Indeed, Petitioners state that only one case, <em>Allen v. Dackman, </em>413 Md. 132, 991 A.2d 1216 (2010), has held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>statute expressly created a duty from a landowner to a trespasser. Thus, Petitioners contend that the long-standing common-law rule limiting a property owner\u2019s duty to a trespasser has only been abrogated in the narrow context of lead paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Finally, Petitioners argue that even if the relevant COMAR regulations were construed to create a legal duty to trespassers, the plain language, legislative history, and implementation of those regulations by the Montgomery County Health Department evince that pre-existing pools, like that at Country Place, were not required to retrofit or change barriers to comply with the barrier provisions enshrined in COMAR 10.17.01.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Respondent urges us to affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. She contends that our inquiry cannot end with an examination of Petitioners\u2019 duty to Christopher under the common-law duty of property owners to trespassers. Rather, she asks us to focus on the statutory duty that Petitioners owed to Christopher. Respondent advances that under Maryland law, the applicable test for her negligence claim is whether Petitioners violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation that was designed to protect a specific class of persons, which includes Christopher, and whether that statutory violation proximately caused Christopher\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">According to Respondent, duties arising from statutory violations have been recognized in Maryland for almost a century, and are not confined to cases involving lead paint. Respondent further alleges that a review of the language, legislative history, and purposes of the relevant COMAR and County regulations compels the conclusion that Christopher is within the class of persons that these pool safety regulations were designed to protect. Respondent rejects Petitioners\u2019 claim that they are exempt from Maryland\u2019s pool safety barrier regulation, thus rejecting their invocation of COMAR\u2019s grandfathering provisions. Respondent claims that the inapplicability of the grandfathering provisions is further bolstered by the compliance schedule set forth in COMAR 10.17.01.54, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>as well as COMAR 10.17.01.03D, which precludes grandfathering that \u201cjeopardizes the health or safety of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Respondent concludes by arguing that Petitioners\u2019 construction of the regulations would have dangerous implications for Maryland public pools, and that Petitioners waived any argument that the Montgomery County Codes and The Building Officials &amp; Code Administrators Basic Building Code of 1970 (\u201cBOCA\u201d) do not create a duty to Christopher. Respondent alleges that Petitioners have no viable argument that their violation of the statute \u2014 a breach of their statutorily-derived duty of care to Christopher \u2014 was not the proximate cause of Christopher\u2019s injuries. Finally, Respondent characterizes the cases cited by Petitioners as inapplicable and outdated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Duty To Trespassers And Statutory Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">We now turn to the first question. Petitioners argue that any putative duty of care derived from statute cannot trump the limited, common-law duty that property owners owe to trespassers. The starting point of this argument is unobjectionable, for in a variety of cases, we have indeed affirmed a property owner\u2019s right to exclude others from, and to control the use of, their property. <em>See Weems v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Calvert Cnty., </em>397 Md. 606, 619, 919 A.2d 77, 85 (2007) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has remained consistent in asserting that included amongst a property owner\u2019s \u2018bundle of rights\u2019 is the right to exclude others.\u201d); <em>Landay v. Cohn, </em>220 Md. 24, 28, 150 A.2d 739, 741 (1959) (\u201c[A landlord\u2019s] responsibility for the reasonably safe condition of premises retained under his control is limited to the confines of his invitation to use them, express or implied. It does not extend to the use of such premises for an unintended purpose.\u201d); <em>Levine v. Miller, </em>218 Md. 74, 79, 145 A.2d 418, 421 (1958) (\u201cOne may be an invitee or business visitor as to one portion of the premises, or for a limited time, and be a licensee or trespasser as to another portion of the same premises or, without changing location, undergo the same change in status by the lapse of time.\u201d). These precepts form the basis of our common-law rule concerning the limited duty of property owners to trespassers. <em>See Levine, </em>218 Md. at 79, 145 A.2d at 421 (\u201cThe Maryland law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>is firmly established that the owner of land owes no duty to a trespasser or licensee, even one of tender years, except to abstain from wilful [sic] or wanton misconduct and entrapment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">But another strand of law is relevant here. Our examination of this strand begins with <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 79, 835 A.2d 616, 621 (2003). <em>Brooks </em>concerned a tenant\u2019s tort action against a landlord based upon a child\u2019s consumption of lead-based paint in leased premises that were in violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code. 378 Md. at 72, 835 A.2d at 617. There, we recognized that a different common-law rule \u2014 that landlords have no duty to repair or inspect premises before or during a lease term \u2014 was trumped by Maryland\u2019s rule concerning applicable statutory schemes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">[U]nder the common law and in the absence of a statute, a landlord ordinarily has no duty to keep rental premises in repair, or to inspect the rental premises either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term. There are, however, exceptions to this general rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">Moreover, where there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, another well-settled Maryland common law rule has long been applied by this Court in negligence actions. That rule states that the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u201cis prescribed by the statute\u201d or ordinance and that violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmFs\"><em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 78, 835 A.2d at 620-21 (quoting <em>Brown v. Dermer, 357 </em>Md. 344, 358-59, 744 A.2d 47, 55 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The <em>Brooks </em>Court observed that this rule was first announced in <em>Flaccomio v. Eysink, </em>129 Md. 367, 380, 100 A. 510, 515 (1916), nearly one hundred years before the dispute here. 378 Md. at 78, 835 A.2d at 621. To give flesh to this longstanding rule (\u201cthe Statute or Ordinance Rule\u201d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <em>Brooks </em>Court went on to describe both its requirements and effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Under this principle, in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action, all that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of. \u201cProximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent. * * * It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Brooks, 378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>357 Md. at 359, 744 A.2d at 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A subsequent case in the <em>Brooks </em>line, <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. 132, 991 A.2d 1216 (2010), clarified the reach of the Statute or Ordinance Rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Allen, </em>this Court considered an argument that lead paint statutes in the Baltimore City Housing Code \u201cimposed no duty on owners of property in regard to individuals who have no legal right to possess the property.\u201d 413 Md. at 156, 991 A.2d at 1230. The property owners in that case argued that because a court had determined that plaintiffs \u201cwere wrongfully in possession of the property [...]\u201d in question, no duty applied. <em>Id. </em>This Court rejected that argument, first observing that common-law limitations on the duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>owed to trespassers were \u201cinapplicable\u201d in a case \u201cbased on the Housing Code, not the common law.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. at 157, 991 A.2d at 1231 (emphasis added). After examining the purposes and language of the Housing Code, this Court determined that the <em>Allen </em>plaintiffs were within the class to be protected by the statute. <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. at 157-58, 991 A.2d at 1231. Thus, the tort action in that case survived summary judgment, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 status as trespassers under the common law. <em>See Allen, </em>413 Md. at 160, 991 A.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Petitioners nevertheless persist that \u201cregulations regarding fencing around pools or bodies of water will not create a duty from the premises owner to a trespasser.\u201d They primarily rely on <em>Osterman v. Peters, </em>260 Md. 313, 272 A.2d 21 (1971), in which this Court considered the case of a four-and-a-half-year-old boy who drowned while trying to retrieve a ball from a pool at his neighbor\u2019s vacant house. Basing its holding on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Longeley, </em>161 Md. 563, 158 A. 6 (1932), the <em>Osterman </em>Court held that because the boy was a trespasser, the boy\u2019s father could not bring a negligence action based on the defendant\u2019s violation of a fencing ordinance. <em>Osterman, </em>260 Md. at 317, 272 A.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In <em>State v. Longeley, </em>this Court declined to hold quarry owners liable for the drowning of a trespassing twelve-year-old. 161 Md. at 570, 158 A. at 8. The Court examined the defendant\u2019s violation of an ordinance requiring that abandoned quarries be enclosed by a fence with certain characteristics. <em>Longeley, </em>161 Md. at 566, 158 A. at 7. In holding that the quarry owners owed no statutory duty to the child, the <em>Longeley </em>Court set forth a two-part test: \u201c(1) [tjhat the violation of the ordinance was the proximate cause of the injury. (2) That the person injured, at the time of the injury, had the right to be on the property of defendant and was not a trespasser.\u201d <em>Longeley, </em>161 Md. at 569, 158 A. at 8. The Court declared that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">The ordinance in this case was passed for the benefit of the public. Any violation of it subjects the owner of a quarry to a fine. But, before an individual can hold [a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>property owner] liable for an injury alleged to have resulted from [a statutory violation], there must be shown a right on the part of the plaintiff, a duty on the part of the defendant with respect to that right, and a breach of that duty by the defendant whereby the plaintiff has suffered injury. A trespasser can acquire no such right except in case of willful injury. The mere violation of a statute would not give it. The effect of such violation is only to raise a presumption of negligence in favor of one entitled to assert it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><em>Longeley, </em>161 Md. at 569-70, 158 A. at 8 (citations omitted; emphasis added); <em>see also Murphy v. Baltimore Gas and Elec. Co., </em>290 Md. 186, 194-95, 428 A.2d 459, 464 (1981) (applying <em>Longeley </em>and <em>Osterman </em>in a similar abandoned quarry case), <em>overruled on other grounds by Baltimore Gas and Elec. Co. v. Flippo, </em>348 Md. 680, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">As our discussion of <em>Longeley, Osterman, </em>and <em>Murphy </em>highlights, none of these cases involved a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whereas those cases dealt with ordinances \u201cpassed for the benefit of the public,\u201d the statute at issue here, as we shall explain, aims to protect a more targeted class of persons. That is why those courts did not engage in a careful application of the Statute or Ordinance Rule, and why we must do so here. It is also why those courts relied on the plaintiffs status as trespasser to deny relief. As we stated in <em>Allen, </em>the Statute or Ordinance Rule places no significance on the legal status of plaintiffs on the premises. What matters is that they are members of the class to be protected by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Petitioners attempt to characterize <em>Allen </em>as \u201ca rare instance of the court finding that a statute created a specific duty from one group of persons to another.\u201d They argue that \u201cthis Court held in <em>Allen </em>that the long-standing law that a premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>owner owes no duty to a trespasser had been abrogated solely in the narrow conf\u00ednes of the Baltimore City Housing Code lead paint statutes, which expressly created a duty to abate lead paint between premises owners and all occupants, whatever their status.\u201d We find no reason in law or logic to so cabin our holding in <em>Allen. </em>There, the common-law rule that a landowner owes a limited duty to trespassers was trumped by the Statute or Ordinance Rule. <em>See supra. </em>Here, the same rationale applies.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Moreover, the Statute or Ordinance Rule has never been confined to the context of lead paint cases. This Court has identified the Statute or Ordinance Rule as the right rule to apply in a variety of settings. <em>See Wietzke v. Chesapeake Conference Ass\u2019n, </em>421 Md. 355, 395, 26 A.3d 931, 955 (2011) (holding that a jury could apply the Statute or Ordinance Rule to regulations concerning sediment control regulations); <em>Gourdmine v. Crews, </em>405 Md. 722, 758, 955 A.2d 769, 791 (2008) (holding that protections contained in product branding statutes targeted too broad a class to satisfy the Statute or Ordinance Rule); <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 587, 831 A.2d 18, 29 (2003) (holding that the Statute or Ordinance Rule was not satisfied by hunting regulations that were not intended to prevent the injury at issue); <em>Moore v. Myers, </em>161 Md.App. 349, 365-66, 868 A.2d 954, 964 (2005) (holding that the Statute or Ordinance Rule was satisfied by the violation of an animal control statute). This variety indicates that the Statute or Ordinance Rule has broad applicability,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and need not be cabined by common-law rules that are unique to the premises liability context.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Importantly, part (a) of the Statute or Ordinance Rule already sets a meaningful limitation on a court\u2019s ability to apply it. <em>See, e.g., Wietzke, </em>421 Md. at 388, 26 A.3d at 951 (\u201c[W]e have always required the statute or ordinance allegedly violated to \u2018set forth mandatory acts\u2019 that are \u2018clearly for the protection of a <em>particular </em>class of persons\u2019 and <em>not </em>merely for \u2018the public as a whole.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 584, 831 A.2d at 27 (2003) (italics in original)));<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>see also Muthukumarana v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>370 Md. 447, 499-500, 805 A.2d 372, 403 (2002) (holding that a statute designed to protect \u201cthe safety and well-being of the citizens of Maryland\u201d referenced too broad a protected class to satisfy the Statute or Ordinance Rule (quoting Md.Code (1957,1997 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 18 \u2014 101(a))).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Despite the relative clarity of the Statute or Ordinance Rule, Petitioners also argue that the creation of a legal duty must be expressly stated in a statute for the Statute or Ordinance Rule to apply. Petitioners rely on our recent decision in <em>Warr v. JMGM Group, LLC, 433 </em>Md. 170, 70 A.3d 347 (2013). In <em>Warr, </em>this Court rejected several arguments to impose dram shop liability, including an assertion \u201cthat the tavern owners owed a duty to refuse to serve an intoxicated patron[] because there is a criminal statute prohibiting the sale of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons.\u201d <em>Warr, 433 </em>Md. at 195, 70 A.3d at 362. This Court observed that it \u201cha[d] not extrapolated civil liability from criminal statutes regulating the sale of alcohol, unlike some of our sister states.\u201d <em>Warr, </em>433 Md. at 197, 70 A.3d at 363. The Court then stated the Statute or Ordinance Rule \u2014 that in order to premise civil liability on a violation of a statute, a party need show \u201c \u2018(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>of.\u2019 \u201d <em>Warr, </em>433 Md. at 198, 70 A.3d at 364 (quoting <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621). This Court rejected the application of the Statute or Ordinance Rule, finding that the statute in question was enacted \u201c \u2018for the protection, health, welfare and safety of the people of this State[,]\u2019\u201d not a particular class. <em>Warr, </em>433 Md. at 198, 70 A.3d at 364 (quoting Md.Code (1957, 2011 Repl. Vol.), Article 2B, Section l-101(a)(3)). Thus, <em>Warr </em>only reinforced part (a) of the Statute or Ordinance Rule, and did not set forth any requirement that statutes must expressly state the creation of a legal duty in order to represent the standard of care in a negligence action. In <em>Warr, </em>the applicable statute failed to define a particular class to be protected. That infirmity is not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\n<em>Existence Of A Statutory Duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"> Although we hold that the Statute or Ordinance Rule can apply irrespective of a property owner\u2019s duty to trespassers under the common law, we must still determine whether a statutory duty arose in this case. The intermediate appellate court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">[T]he 1997 COMAR regulations governing public swimming pools, and specifically COMAR 10.17.01.21 governing pool barriers, as well as the 1997 Montgomery County statutory and regulatory provisions, were applicable to the Country Place pool at the time of the incident in this <em>case </em>\u2014 i.e. [Petitioners] were required, by statute and regulation, to comply with the regulations and code provisions relevant to public swimming pools, in general, and pool barriers, in particular. That the circuit court found otherwise was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 105-06, 63 A.3d at 1138-39. Petitioners argue that the trial court was correct in holding that no statutory duty arose from the COMAR regulations because Petitioners were not required to comply with them. We now turn to that question, warning the reader that a good amount of patience will be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">COMAR 10.17.01.01 <em>et seq. </em>became effective on February 10, 1997. The stated purpose of the chapter \u201cis to enact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>regulations that protect and promote the public health and safety of individuals at public spas and pools in Maryland. Public pools include ... recreational pools!.]\u201d COMAR 10.17.01.01. Under COMAE 10.17.01.05B(19)(f)(v), Petitioners\u2019 pool meets the definition of a recreational pool. (\u201c[A recreational pool includes those at] [a]n apartment complex, housing subdivision, or mobile home park with more than ten units [.]\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> COMAE 10.17.01.13, entitled \u201cStandards for Recreational and Semipublic Pools!,]\u201d provides that \u201c[a]n owner shall ensure that an existing, newly built, or altered recreational or semipublic pool is in compliance with: A. This chapter; B. Applicable State and local codes; and C. The American National Standard for Public Swimming Pools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUr\">COMAE 10.17.01.05B(3) defines a \u201cbarrier\u201d as \u201ca fence or wall or a combination of a fence and wall that completely surrounds and obstructs access to the pool or spa.\u201d COMAE 10.17.01.21, entitled \u201cBarriers!,]\u201d mandates the following requirements for a recreational pool:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">A. Except as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 B, C, and D [<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] of this regulation, an owner shall ensure that a recreational pool ... including the required deck area, is completely surrounded by a barrier that complies with the following requirements!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">(3) Except when the entrance gate is open, an opening in the barrier and in the gate does not allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">COMAE 10.17.01.21A (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Under the plain language of COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3), a barrier\u2019s entrance gate cannot allow the passage of a sphere 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>inches in diameter. This requirement aligns with standards set forth in the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s <em>SAFETY BARRIER GUIDELINES FOR HOME POOLS, </em>which state that \u201c[a] successful pool barrier prevents a child from getting OVER, UNDER, or THROUGH and keeps the child from gaining access to the pool except when supervising adults are present.\u201d These same guidelines explain that the 4-inch sphere requirement is \u201cbased on the head breadth and chest depth of a young child and is intended to prevent a young child from passing through an opening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">But Petitioners vigorously dispute that the barrier requirements in COMAR 10.17.01.21 mandated modification of their pool fence, built in 1978. We do not quarrel with Petitioners\u2019 observation that under the COMAR regulations \u201cexisting pools would be exempt from parts of the new regulations.\u201d (Emphasis added). The question is whether the barrier provisions are among those parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The exemptions provided by COMAR 10.17.01.03 for pools constructed before February 10,1997 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">A. Except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 D and E of this regulation, the owner of a pool or spa that was approved by the Secretary for construction before the adoption of this chapter is exempt from bringing the previously approved pool or spa into compliance with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">(1) Regulations .13C, .14A(3), .17C, .18A(3), .22, .24, and .35 of this chapter;[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">(2) Notwithstanding an exemption set forth at \u00a7 A(l) of this regulation, the diving area dimensions of Regulation .27B of this chapter[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>B. The owner of a pool ... that was approved by the Secretary for construction before the adoption of this chapter shall maintain the pool ... including appurtenant structures and equipment as originally approved and may complete a repair that restores the pool ... to its original condition before damage or deterioration without complying with the requirements of this chapter, except for Regulations .06C and .28 of this chapter, when the repair:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">(1) Costs less than 25 percent of the replacement value of the pool ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">(2) Consists of the same or equivalent materials and components ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">(3) Does not create a danger or allow a danger to continue that threatens the health and safety of an individual using the pool[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">D. The exemptions in \u00a7\u00a7 A and B of this regulation do not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">(1) The previously approved pool or spa has a condition that jeopardizes the health or safety of the public, in which case the owner shall ensure that the condition is corrected to meet the requirements of this chapter[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Petitioners argue that the \u201cexemptions for \u2018appurtenant structures and equipment\u2019 necessarily include [Petitioners\u2019] fencing by the terms and definitions of the regulations, enshrined in COMAR 10.17.01.03 Previously Approved Pools and Spas.\u201d Observing that COMAR defines a pool as \u201can artificial enclosure of water that is used for the immersion of the human body for recreation, therapy, or exercise, including a structure that is installed in the ground, above ground, outside, or in a building or portable structure[,]\u201d Petitioners contend that the \u201cpool\u201d is merely the container of water. COMAR 10.17.01.05B(15). In contrast, \u201cBarrier\u201d is defined as \u201ca fence or wall or a combination of a fence and wall that completely surrounds and obstructs access to the pool or spa.\u201d COMAR 10.17.01.05B(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Petitioners point to this distinction as evidence that a barrier is an appurtenant structure or equipment for purposes of finding exemptions under COMAR 10.17.01.03 B, C, and D. Consequently, Petitioners contend that COMAR 10.17.01.03B applies to its pool barrier, mandating only that the owner of a pre-existing pool \u201cshall maintain the pool or spa including appurtenant structures and equipment as originally approved[.]\u201d Petitioners attempt to bolster their argument by observing that under COMAR 10.17.01.03C and 10.17.01.03D(2), certain repairs and alterations need not comply with the new COMAR requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">In examining Petitioners\u2019 argument, we first observe that the standards concerning pool barriers in COMAR 10.17.01.21 are not among the listed exemptions in COMAR 10.17.01.03A. Therefore, we focus on whether the grandfathering provisions laid out in COMAR 10.17.01.03B apply to Petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Under the plain language of COMAR 10.17.01.03B, Petitioners would be able to maintain or even repair their barrier without complying with the requirements of COMAR 10.17.01.21, so long as the maintenance and repair actions followed the guidelines set forth in COMAR 10.17.01.03B(1)-(3). <em>See supra. </em>If these provisions governed, a court would not be able to hold that Petitioners\u2019 barrier violated COMAR 10.17.01.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">But we do not look at this subsection in isolation, and a different subsection carves out an exception to the exemption. COMAR 10.17.01.03D(1) states that the exemptions listed in COMAR 10.17.01.03B do not apply when \u201c[t]he previously approved pool or spa has a condition that jeopardizes the health or safety of the public, in which case the owner shall ensure that the condition is corrected to meet the requirements of this chapter[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Petitioners argue that this exception does not apply to their fence because the language focuses solely on the pool, and does not mention the appurtenant structures or equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">We reject this argument based on the plain language of COMAR 10.17.01.03D(1). The fundamental danger of a pool is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>posed by its water. And it hardly needs saying that, without a fence that bars entry by a three-year-old child, the pool, located in the midst of 300 residential apartments, poses a risk which \u201cjeopardizes the health or safety of\u2019 such a child,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> who might accidentally access the pool unsupervised. The quality and compliance of the fence is simply crucial to safety. The COMAR subsection also states that when such a condition is present, \u201cthe owner shall ensure that the condition is corrected to meet the requirements of this chapter[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, the provision does not in any way limit the \u201crequirements of this chapter\u201d to mean solely the requirements that deal with the pool structure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In addition to the plain language of COMAR 10.17.01.03D(1), we draw support from the purposes and context of the chapter as a whole. As we stated in <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., Inc., </em>\u201c[statutes are to be construed reasonably and with reference to the purpose to be accomplished.\u201d 285 Md. 527, 538, 404 A.2d 1045, 1052 (1979) (citing <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 142, 395 A.2d 464, 470 (1978)). Whenever possible, the various parts of a statute should \u201cbe reconciled and harmonized to be consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.\u201d <em>John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. at 538-39, 404 A.2d at 1053 (citations omitted). Our interpretation should avoid illogical, absurd, or anomalous results. <em>John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. at 539, 404 A.2d at 1053 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">COMAR 10.17.01.04D incorporates by reference the \u201cAmerican National Standard for Residential Inground Swimming Pools (ANSI/NSPI-5 1995) including Appendix E, Model Barrier Code for Residential Swimming Pools, Spas, and Hot Tubs[.]\u201d (\u201cModel Barrier Code\u201d). We find it significant that Appendix E begins with a \u201cPreamble to NSPI Model Child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Protection/Barrier Code.\u201d (Emphasis added). The Preamble states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-4\">Protecting young children from accidental drownings and near-drownings in all aquatic environments, whether natural or constructed, is a primary concern of parents, the aquatic industry, health and safety organizations and regulatory groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">While supervision is the key to accomplishing the objective of reducing the number of submersion incidents, it is well-known that, at times, children may do the unexpected, catching their supervisors off guard. But being caught off guard does not have to mean being unprepared. For those instances when the unexpected does occur and there may be a lapse in supervision, the National Spa and Pool Institute (NSPI) has developed the Model Child Protection/Barrier Code. This Model Code establishes layers of protection to supplement and complement the requirement for constant adult supervision of young children around aquatic environments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Model Barrier Code at 37 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The Model Barrier Code further states, in its \u201cScope\u201d and \u201cPurpose\u201d sections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\n<em>SCOPE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">These requirements establish layers of protection for young children against the potential for drowning and near drowning in residential swimming pools, spas and hot tubs by limiting or delaying their access to swimming pools, spas, and hot tubs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">\n<em>PURPOSE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">The objective of these requirements is to establish provisions that address supervision, the foremost deterrent to a young child\u2019s access to a pool, spa or hot tub and to potential accidental drowning, both at times when a pool, spa or hot tub is in use, and at times when it is not in use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Additionally, in the event of a lapse in adult supervision, and particularly for the protection of children in the most at-risk age group, less than five (5) years of age, who cannot yet appreciate or be instructed as to the risk of drowning, supplemental layers of protection are established. They limit or delay child access to an outdoor or an indoor pool, spa or hot tub from the surrounding area and to an outdoor or an indoor pool, spa or hot tub from within a building or dwelling where walls of the building or dwelling are the barrier, or part of the barrier, to the pool, spa or hot tub.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Model Barrier Code at 37 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">With these purposes and objectives in mind, COMAR 10.17.01.03D(1) must be read to provide an exception to the grandfathering provisions for both a pool and its barrier. Were we to hold otherwise, the targeted safety objectives of the Model Barrier Code, incorporated by reference in CO-MAR 10.17.01.04, would be completely ignored. Moreover, the \u201cprimary concern\u201d of the Model Barrier Code, which is to prevent the drowning and near drowning of young children, would be of no concern to all the owners of recreational pools that, through mere historical accident, were built before CO-MAR\u2019s adoption. This result would be illogical, and we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Petitioners rely on the chapter\u2019s legislative history in an attempt to cabin its applicability and broaden the grandfathering provisions. These efforts are unavailing. In the \u201cNotice of Proposed Action\u201d for the COMAR regulations, the \u201cEstimate of Economic Impact\u201d is projected as \u201cminimal due to the grandfathering of existing public pools and spas[.]\u201d Proposed Action on Regulations, 22:14 Md. Reg. 1067 (July 7, 1995). But the estimate also indicates that \u201cthere will be an increased cost to owners of some pools and spas for safety personnel and to meet updated standards[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The estimate further states, in its \u201cAssumptions\u201d section, that \u201c[t]he public may have significant, nonquantifiable savings as a result of decreased illness and injury at public pools and spas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1068. When pitted against the purposes and objectives of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>COMAR regulations, described above, this scant evidence fails to convince us that Petitioners\u2019 interpretation is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\n<em>Application Of The Statute Or Ordinance Rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We must now determine whether the COMAR regulations meet the requirements of the Statute or Ordinance Rule. As we have explained, the finding of a statutory duty under the Statute or Ordinance Rule must be premised on the statute being targeted toward a protected class, and not merely the public at large. <em>See supra. </em>Consequently, we focus our attention on whether COMAR 10.17.01.21 fulfills this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Petitioners argue that neither the \u201cNotice of Proposed Action\u201d nor the enacted COMAR statute identify a class of protected persons, much less identify trespassers as the protected class.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This is true, but does not tell the whole story. As we have held, the COMAR regulations incorporate the Model Barrier Code, which does identify a specific class\u2014 namely, young children under the age of five years. Petitioners miss the mark because they focus exclusively on the lack of a duty to trespassers generally, and ignore the special class of young children that COMAR most assuredly recognizes as beneficiaries of the pool owner\u2019s duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Thus, under COMAR 10.17.01.21, Petitioners were required to provide a barrier that did not allow passage of a sphere 4 inches in diameter, except when the entrance gate was open. <em>See supra. </em>This language sets forth mandatory acts for the protection of a particular class identified in the Model Barrier Code \u2014 namely, children under the age of five. <em>See supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Christopher, three years old at the time of the accident, was clearly a member of this protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\n<em>Violation Of Duty And Causation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Part (a) of the Statute or Ordinance Rule requires a violation of the statute setting forth the duty of care. <em>See supra. </em>Here, evidence concerning the state of the fence at the time of the incident could prove that Petitioners\u2019 enclosure failed to meet the requirements of COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3). This question is a disputed matter of fact, for the fact-finder to decide. <em>See Allen, </em>413 Md. at 160, 991 A.2d at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Part (b) of the Statute or Ordinance Rule requires that the violation of the statute was the proximate cause of the injury. \u201c \u2018Proximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent * * * It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>357 Md. at 359, 744 A.2d at 55). As we have already discussed, Christopher was a member of the class of persons identified in the Model Barrier Code, and Respondent has alleged injuries that the statute intended to prevent. <em>See supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Of course, this cause of action cannot sound in negligence per se, because COMAR 10.17.01.01 <em>et seq. </em>does not expressly provide so. <em>See Absolon v. Dollahite, </em>376 Md. 547, 557, 831 A.2d 6, 11 (2003) (\u201c[T]he settled rule in Maryland is that a statutory violation is evidence of negligence. It does not constitute negligence <em>per se, </em>unless a statute expressly makes it so.\u201d); <em>see also Polakoff, </em>385 Md. at 478, 869 A.2d at 844 (\u201cAs we repeatedly stated in <em>Brooks, </em>proof of a statutory violation, plaintiffs membership in the class of people designed to be protected by the statute, and causation, amount to <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence, not negligence <em>per se.\u201d) </em>(citations omitted). Respondent must still produce facts that would allow a jury to reasonably conclude that Christopher entered the pool because the gate violated COMAR.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that here, sufficient circumstantial evidence existed for a jury to find causation. <em>See Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 110, 63 A.3d at 1141; <em>see also Ross, </em>430 Md. at 669, 63 A.3d at 13 (2013) (\u201cChildhood exposure to lead paint and dust may be established through circumstantial evidence^]\u201d); <em>Dow v. L &amp; R Props., Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 67, 75, 796 A.2d 139, 143 (2002) (\u201cCircumstantial evidence may support a negligence determination if it \u2018amount[s] to a reasonable likelihood or probability rather than a possibility.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 17, 264 A.2d 851, 855 (1970))). Christopher and his older brother, Andre, were playing at a playground adjacent to the apartment building, and returned three times to the apartment before going back outside to continue playing. As the intermediate appellate court further detailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">(1) [A]t the time of the near drowning, Christopher was three-years-old, and his head was approximately 5.1 inches wide; (2) appellant discovered Christopher submerged in the water in the five foot section of the pool closest to the gate; (3) when investigating the near drowning, Detective Hamill observed a pair of shoes and a T-shirt on the \u201cfirst table [] inside the front gate\u201d; (4) Detective Hamill observed that there was \u201ca lot of play in the gate,\u201d and that she was \u201cable to completely put [her] leg from the waist down into that [ ] opening, [with] how the gate bowed out\u201d; (5) Detective Hamill stated that it did not take the \u201cforce of an adult\u201d to open the gate; (6) Beerman, Berkshire\u2019s property manager, testified that he inspected the pool barrier within a day of the near drowning and measured six inch spacing between the vertical posts of the fence; (7) neither Detective Hamill nor Officer Magnelli observed any cuts, bruises, or other injuries to <em>Christopher </em>\u2014 i.e. marks indicating that he climbed or jumped over the six foot fence surrounding the pool; and (8) Officer Magnelli testified that there was no evidence suggesting that Andre assisted Christopher in gaining access to the pool area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><em>Paul, </em>211 Md.App. at 111-12, 63 A.3d at 1142. We conclude that this evidence is sufficient for a trier of fact to reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>conclude that Christopher entered the pool by slipping through the allegedly defective gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Because Respondent\u2019s allegations, viewed in the light most favorable to her, could satisfy the Statute or Ordinance Rule, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence can be established, and there is \u201c \u2018sufficient evidence to warrant the court in submitting the case to the jury on the question of the [Petitioners\u2019] negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allen, </em>413 Md. at 144, 991 A.2d at 1223 (quoting <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621). The trial court will then have to determine if the Petitioners\u2019 actions \u201cwere reasonable under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">For the reasons stated above, we hold that Petitioners\u2019 alleged violation of COMAR 10.17.01.21A(3), if proven, would demonstrate the breach of a duty from Petitioners to Christopher. Such a duty, derived from statute, would apply irrespective of Christopher\u2019s legal status on the property when the incident occurred. A reasonable trier of fact could find that such a duty existed, that Petitioners violated this duty, and that such violation was the cause of Christopher\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">.
