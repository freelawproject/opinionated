Greenleaf s actions came to the attention of the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">On March 14, 2013, in this Court, Bar Counsel filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Green-leaf, charging him with violating Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rule of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) 8.4 (Misconduct). On March 18, 2013, this Court assigned this attorney discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>proceeding to the Honorable Paul M. Bowman (\u201cthe hearing judge\u201d) of the Circuit Court for Kent County.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">On July 25, 2013, the hearing judge conducted a hearing. On September 19, 2013, the hearing judge filed in this Court an opinion including findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Greenleaf had violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act), 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation), 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice), and 8.4(a) (Violating the MLRPC).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On April 8, 2014, we heard oral argument. For the below reasons, we disbar Greenleaf.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In his opinion, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">On November 8, 1979, this Court admitted Greenleaf to the Bar of Maryland. Between 1987 and 2004, Greenleaf served as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County, an interim State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County, and a Senior Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County. On January 6, 2004, Greenleaf became the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals. Greenleaf s office was located at the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">On March 8, 2010, Detective Sergeant Louis Gary Yamin (\u201cDS Yamin\u201d) of the Baltimore Police Department was working undercover for the Cyber and Electronic Crimes Unit. DS Yamin had a Yahoo Messenger account with the username \u201cravens_girl2003,\u201d which was connected to a Yahoo profile for a female named \u201cBeth.\u201d On March 8, 2010, as \u201cBeth,\u201d DS Yamin entered a Yahoo Messenger chat room entitled \u201cMaryland Romance.\u201d In the chat room, a person with the user-name \u201cdelmarvanl9901\u201d initiated a private chat with \u201cBeth,\u201d who almost immediately sent the message \u201c14/f/balto. md[,]\u201d which is Internet language for identifying oneself as a fourteen-year-old female in the Baltimore area. \u201cdelmarvanl9901\u201d began discussing sexual topics. \u201cBeth\u201d sent \u201cdelmar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>vanl9901\u201d two photographs that depicted a young teenage girl. \u201cdelmarvanl9901\u201d sent a photograph of himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In addition to sending the two photographs, \u201cBeth\u201d e-mailed \u201cdelmarvanl9901,\u201d who sent a reply e-mail. DS Yamin learned that Greenleaf was using the IP address from which \u201cdelmarvanl9901\u201d had sent the reply e-mail. The IP address belonged to the Maryland Judiciary. DS Yamin matched the photograph that \u201cdelmarvanl9901\u201d had sent with a photograph of Greenleaf from the Motor Vehicle Administration\u2019s database. Thus, it was established that while the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals, Greenleaf used a State-owned computer in the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building to communicate with \u201cBeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Greenleaf believed that \u201cBeth\u201d was a fourteen-year-old or a fifteen-year-old girl.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cBeth\u201d repeatedly referred to her age and stated that she was a high school student. The hearing judge expressly rejected Greenleafs allegation that he believed that \u201cBeth\u201d was an adult who was \u201crole-playing\u201d by posing as a fourteen-year-old or a fifteen-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">On approximately one hundred fifty separate dates, Green-leaf and \u201cBeth\u201d e-mailed and/or chatted with each other. On nearly half of those dates, Greenleaf used his computer at the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building to communicate with \u201cBeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Greenleafs and \u201cBeth\u2019s\u201d conversations were \u201cconsistently sexually explicit.\u201d For example, Greenleaf asked \u201cBeth\u201d to describe her pubic hair, sexual history, bra size, and whether she was taking birth control.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Greenleaf often discussed arranging a meeting with \u201cBeth\u201d and described the sexual acts in which he wanted to engage with \u201cBeth.\u201d Greenleaf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>\u201cgroomed\u201d \u201cBeth\u201d for sexual activity by telling \u201cBeth\u201d that she seemed more mature than a fourteen-year-old or fifteen-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">In December 2010, on four separate occasions, Greenleaf sent \u201cBeth\u201d links to pornographic videos. Greenleaf last communicated with \u201cBeth\u201d on January 25, 2011. Finally, in January 2011, Greenleaf was arrested and was placed on administrative leave. On April 1, 2011, Greenleaf was permitted to retire from his position as the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals. On May 31, 2012, Greenleaf tendered an <em>Alford </em>plea<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to a charge of attempting to violate Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cCR\u201d) \u00a7 11-203 (Sale or Display of Obscene Item to Minor). Green-leaf received probation before judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">In an attorney discipline proceeding, this Court reviews for clear error the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact, and reviews without deference the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-759(b)(2)(B) (\u201cThe Court shall give due regard to the opportunity of the hearing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reno, </em>436 Md. 504, 508, 83 A.3d 781, 783 (2014) (\u201c[T]his Court reviews for clear error a hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact[.]\u201d); Md. R. 16-759(b)(l) (\u201cThe Court of Appeals shall review de novo the [hearing] judge\u2019s conclusions of law.\u201d). This Court determines whether clear and convincing evidence establishes that a lawyer violated the MLRPC. <em>See </em>Md. R. 16-757(b) (\u201cThe [Commission] has the burden of proving the averments of the petition by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AND\">A. Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact. Greenleaf excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s finding that he believed that \u201cBeth\u201d was a fourteen-year-old or a fifteen-year-old girl.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We overrule Greenleafs exception, as the hearing judge did not clearly err, or err at all, in finding that Greenleaf believed that \u201cBeth\u201d was a fourteen-year-old or a fifteen-year-old girl. The record unequivocally demonstrates that \u201cBeth\u201d: (1) identified herself as a fourteen-year-old girl; (2) repeatedly referred to her age; (3) stated that she was a high school student; and (4) sent two photographs that depicted a young teenage girl.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although Greenleaf told \u201cBeth\u201d that he thought she was a woman in her thirties, the hearing judge credited DS Yamin\u2019s opinion that Greenleaf made the statement as part of his grooming \u201cBeth\u201d for sexual activity, not because Greenleaf actually believed that \u201cBeth\u201d was a woman in her thirties. The record is replete with evidence sufficient to establish that \u201cBeth\u201d identified herself as a fourteen-year-old girl; and, thus, there was sufficient evidence for the hearing judge to have independently rejected Greenleafs claim to have believed Beth a \u201cwoman.\u201d Moreover, although a person must state that he or she is an adult to enter a Yahoo Messenger chat room, common sense dictates that a minor could enter a Yahoo Messenger chat room by falsely stating that he or she is an adult. We find no basis to disturb the hearing judge\u2019s express rejection of Greenleafs allegation that he believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>that \u201cBeth\u201d was an adult who was \u201crole-playing\u201d by posing as a fourteen-year-old or a fifteen-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">In addition to excepting to certain findings of fact, in an apparent attempt to establish mitigating circumstances, Greenleaf alleges additional facts: (1) he performed well as the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals; (2) at the time of his misconduct, he had just returned from sick leave, and was \u201ctrouble[ed]\u201d at work because he had been transferred to a secluded office that was away from other employees; (3) he completed \u201cmental health counseling\u201d as a condition of probation; (4) he \u201csuffered ignominy\u201d because of his misconduct; and (5) he \u201chas shown remorse\u201d for his misconduct. The hearing judge did not find that Greenleaf: (1) performed well as the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals; (2) suffered from any personal or emotional problems; (3) attempted any kind of rehabilitation; (4) endured any embarrassment; or (5) showed any remorse. As this Court stated in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Davy, </em>435 Md. 674, 694, 80 A.3d 322, 333-34 (2013):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">[Ajbsent indications that [a] hearing judge did not consider purported evidence of mitigating factors, where a hearing judge omits the purported evidence of mitigating factors from [the hearing judge\u2019s] opinion, [this Court] may interpret the omission to mean that the hearing judge did not credit the purported evidence of mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">(Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the hearing judge neither credited nor rejected the alleged facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The record demonstrates that the hearing judge allowed Greenleaf to testify on his own behalf and proffer at length. We see no indication that the hearing judge did not consider Greenleaf s remarks. Given the nature of Greenleaf s proffer and <em>testimony </em>\u2014 ie., he performed well at work, he was in a secluded office, and he suffered embarrassment \u2014 it is evident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>that the hearing judge did not find this information to be mitigating. Even if the facts that Greenleaf alleges were accurate, it strains credulity that some of them \u2014 such as Greenleaf s work performance or his being moved to another office \u2014 would constitute mitigating factors. Thus, we do not adopt as mitigating factors the facts that Greenleaf alleges.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">B. Conclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The Commission does not except to any of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. Greenleaf excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that he violated CR \u00a7 3-324 (Sexual Solicitation of Minor).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We overrule Greenleafs exception and uphold all of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law as to the MLRPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Under CR \u00a7 3-324(b), \u201c[a] person may not, with the intent to commit a violation of ...

[CR] \u00a7 3-307[.]\u201d Under CR \u00a7 3-307(a)(4), \u201c[a] person may not ... engage in a sexual act with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old, and the person performing the sexual act is at least 21 years old[.]\u201d Under CR \u00a7 3-307(a)(5), \u201c[a] person may not ... engage in vaginal intercourse with another if the victim is 14 or 15 years old, and the person performing the act is at least 21 years old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Greenleaf violated MLRPC 8.4(b) by violating CR \u00a7 3-324(b).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When he was at least twenty-one years old, Greenleaf knowingly solicited DS Yamin (who was posing as \u201cBeth,\u201d a fourteen-year-old or fifteen-year-old girl) for sexual acts and/or vaginal intercourse; for example, Greenleaf asked: \u201cBeth, do you want to have sex with me?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Violating CR \u00a7 3-324(b) undeniably adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to continue to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We reject Greenleafs ludicrous contention that he did not violate CR \u00a7 3-324(b) because he did not intend to violate CR \u00a7 3-307 by immediately engaging in intercourse with \u201cBeth\u201d \u201cthen and there[,]\u201d but instead was \u201cpreparing] for the <em>future </em>[.]\u201d (Emphasis in original). CR \u00a7 3-324(b) simply requires that, at the time of the solicitation, a person intends to violate CR \u00a7 3-307 at some point in the future \u2014 even if the person does not intend to immediately violate CR \u00a7 3-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit[,] or misrepresentation!;.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Here, clear and convincing evidence supports the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Greenleaf violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by using his computer at the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building to communicate with \u201cBeth.\u201d Greenleafs use of the computer in the workplace during work time to violate CR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00a7 3-324(b) constituted conduct involving dishonesty. The Court of Special Appeals would neither expect, condone, nor excuse the use of a court computer for the purpose of solicitation of a minor for sex. Such egregious conduct in violation of a criminal statute designed to protect children clearly involved dishonesty as to Greenleafs appropriate use of time and equipment. Greenleaf could not have reasonably expected to disclose this activity and remain employed as the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court, or, for that matter, employed in any capacity by the Court. That said, a lawyer may, at times, make incidental personal use of computer equipment in the workplace without violating MLRPC 8.4(c). Use of computer equipment on multiple occasions \u2014 for nearly half of the one hundred fifty dates spanning almost eleven months, from March 8, 2010 through January 25, 2011 \u2014 to commit the crime of solicitation a minor for sex involved dishonesty as to Greenleafs employer, the Maryland Judiciary (specifically, dishonesty as to his workplace activities).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In sum, it is the extensive use of the computer over a protracted course of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and that Greenleaf clandestinely used the computer to commit a crime, the solicitation of a <em>minor </em>\u2014 i.e., that he secretly committed an offense in the workplace for which he knew his employment could be terminated \u2014 that causes us to conclude that his conduct constituted dishonesty in violation of MLRPC 8.4(c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">MLRPC 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]\u201d MLRPC 8.4(d).

Greenleaf solicited for sexual acts a person whom he believed to be a fourteen-year-old or fifteen-year-old girl. Greenleaf was arrested and charged, and entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to a charge of attempting to violate CR \u00a7 11-203.

In other words, Greenleaf deliberately preyed on, and intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ed to violate, a person whom he believed to be under the age of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">As to the potential injury caused by Greenleafs misconduct, Greenleaf could have solicited a minor for sexual acts or sexually abused a minor if \u201cBeth\u201d had actually been a minor. In other words, Greenleaf had the mindset to solicit, violate, mentally scar, and destroy the innocence of a child. In this case, no injury actually occurred due to Greenleafs misconduct only because \u201cBeth\u201d was not in reality a minor capable of being injured by Greenleaf.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Eight aggravating factors accompany Greenleafs misconduct. First, Greenleaf obviously had the selfish motive of sexual gratification. Second and third, Greenleaf engaged in a pattern of egregious misconduct and committed multiple offenses by communicating with \u201cBeth\u201d on approximately one hundred fifty separate dates. Fourth, Greenleaf has refused to acknowledge his misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature; indeed, Greenleaf: (a) outrageously asks us to give him \u201ccredit ... for not taking matters further\u201d with \u201cBeth\u201d;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (b) attempts to shift the blame for his misconduct to his employer by contending that he was \u201ctrouble[ed]\u201d at work because he had been transferred to a secluded office that was away from other employees; and (c) belittles his misconduct\u2019s egregiousness in a manner that is woefully inappropriate under the instant circumstances, <em>e.g., </em>indicating that his actual plans for \u201cBeth\u201d were for the future. Fifth, Greenleafs victim, a purported minor, was vulnerable. Sixth, Greenleaf has substantial experience in the practice of law; he has been a lawyer for over thirty years, was a prosecutor for seventeen years, and at the time of the offense was serving as the Chief Deputy Clerk for the Court of Special Appeals. Seventh, Greenleaf has shown indifference to rehabilitating himself; the hearing judge did not find that Greenleaf had made any attempt to seek profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>sional help. Eighth, Greenleaf engaged in illegal \u2014 indeed, criminal \u2014 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Only one mitigating factor accompanies Greenleafs misconduct: the absence of a prior disciplinary record. We reject Greenleafs contention that his misconduct is mitigated by such circumstances as the lack of: (1) in-person contact between himself and \u201cBeth\u201d; (2) child pornography; and (3) misconduct that arose out of representation of a client. A lawyer\u2019s misconduct is not mitigated by the lawyer\u2019s refraining from engaging in even more egregious and inappropriate misconduct. Similarly, we reject Greenleafs contention that his misconduct is mitigated by other penalties in the form of being placed on probation and leaving his position as the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals. Receiving a sentence and losing one\u2019s job are the natural and foreseeable consequences of committing a crime, and crimes against children are among the most heinous crimes of all. Here, Green-leaf did not lose his job; he was permitted to retire. Green-leafs misconduct is not mitigated by his being placed on probation or leaving his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We are more than satisfied that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Greenleafs egregious misconduct. Greenleaf deliberately solicited and preyed on a person whom he believed to be under the age of consent. Greenleaf had the intent to violate, mentally scar, and destroy the innocence of a child. Greenleaf is a sexual predator who is a danger to the public and is \u201cunfit to continue\u201d to practice law. <em>Gerace, </em>433 Md. at 649, 72 A.3d at 577 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Sheinbein, Painter, </em>and <em>Dechowitz </em>lead to the inescapable conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Greenleafs egregious misconduct. If disbarment is the appropriate sanction for an obstructionist, a domestic abuser, and a drug dealer, then disbarment certainly is also the appropriate sanction for a sexual predator like Greenleaf. The solicitation of minors is a deplorable crime that cannot be tolerated in our society, much less tolerated when committed by an attorney, employed by the Judiciary and using State-owned computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>equipment to commit the crime in the workplace. <em>Cf. Painter, </em>356 Md. at 302, 739 A.2d at 29 (\u201c[D]omestic violence is a serious problem in our society.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Our conclusion that disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Greenleafs egregious misconduct is unassailable, given that: (1) Greenleaf violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by using his computer at the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building to communicate with \u201cBeth\u201d; (2) Greenleaf communicated with \u201cBeth\u201d on approximately one hundred fifty separate dates; (3) there are eight aggravating factors, including a pattern of misconduct, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his misconduct, and indifference to rehabilitation; (4) the only mitigating factor is the absence of a prior disciplinary record; and (5) the Commission recommends that we disbar Greenleaf.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Greenleafs reliance on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>364 Md. 48, 770 A.2d 685 (2001) is untenable. In <em>Childress, id. </em>at 64, 67, 52, 770 A.2d at 695, 696, 688, this Court adopted the Commission\u2019s recommendation by indefinitely suspending from the practice of law, with the right to apply for reinstatement after one year, a lawyer who violated MLRPC 8.4(d) by using the Internet to solicit minors for sex.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This Court acknowledged that the lawyer\u2019s \u201cmisconduct seriously undermined public confidence in the legal profession. The public is becoming increasingly aware that preying by adults on children via the Internet is a grave social problem.\u201d <em>Childress, </em>364 Md. at 65, 770 A.2d at 695. Unlike in the instant attorney discipline proceeding, in <em>Childress, </em>this Court did not identify any aggravating factors, and we found the following mitigating factors: (1) the absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) remorse; and (3) mental disability in the form of \u201cmajor depressive episodes and ... obsessive compulsive disorder[,]\u201d and rehabilitation in the form of treatment by \u201ca board-certified psychiatrist,\u201d who opined that: (a) the treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ment was \u201ca \u2018rousing success\u2019 (b) the lawyer was \u201c \u2018a different person\u2019 in comparison to when [the psychiatrist] first met\u201d the lawyer; (c) \u201c[t]here ha[d] been a \u2018tremendous decrease in [the lawyer\u2019s] obsessive-compulsive symptoms\u2019 \u201d; (d) \u201cthere was \u2018an insignificant risk\u2019 that [the lawyer] would again\u201d solicit minors for sex; and (e) the lawyer \u201cd[id] not meet the DSM-IV[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] criteria for pedophilia or any other sexual disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65-66, 770 A.2d at 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">To be perfectly clear, we caution that <em>Childress </em>does not stand for the proposition that, generally, solicitation of a minor merits a sanction that is less than disbarment. \u201cThe severity of the sanction depends on the circumstances of each case ... and any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bocchino, </em>435 Md. 505, 536, 80 A.3d 222, 240 (2013) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, in <em>Childress, </em>this Court stated: (1) \u201cwe must ... consider certain circumstances ... that mitigate the sanction[,]\u201d <em>Childress, </em>364 Md. at 65, 770 A.2d at 695; and (2) an indefinite suspension was the appropriate sanction \u201c[i]n light of all of the circumstances, including the recommendation of\u201d the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 67, 770 A.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">For a myriad of critical reasons, we distinguish <em>Childress </em>from the instant attorney discipline proceeding. First, in <em>Childress, </em>the lawyer did not violate MLRPC 8.4(c) (Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation); by contrast, here, Greenleaf violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by using his computer at the Robert C. Murphy Courts of Appeal Building to solicit \u201cBeth.\u201d Second, in <em>Childress, </em>this Court did not find any aggravating factors; by contrast, here, we find eight aggravating factors, including a pattern of misconduct, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his misconduct, and indifference to rehabilitation. Third, in <em>Childress, </em>364 Md. at 65-66, 770 A.2d at 695-96, this Court found three mitigating factors: (1) the absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) remorse; and (3) mental disability in the form of \u201cmajor depressive episodes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and ... obsessive compulsive disorder[,]\u201d and rehabilitation in the form of treatment by \u201ca board-certified psychiatrist\u201d; by contrast, here, the only mitigating factor is the absence of a prior disciplinary record. Fourth, in <em>Childress, id. </em>at 64, 770 A.2d at 695, oddly, the Commission did not recommend disbarment; by contrast, here, the Commission recommends disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Fifth \u2014 and perhaps most importantly \u2014 in <em>Childress, id. </em>at 64, 770 A.2d at 694, although this Court held that the lawyer violated a Virginia statute that criminalized solicitation of minors,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this Court did not determine whether the lawyer violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (Criminal Act). In <em>Childress, id. </em>at 51, 770 A.2d at 687, the Commission charged the lawyer with violating only MLRPC 8.4(d); thus, this Court did not determine whether the lawyer violated any other MLRPC. In other words, in <em>Childress, </em>this Court was silent as to whether the lawyer committed a criminal act that adversely reflected on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to continue to practice law. Accordingly, in <em>Childress, </em>this Court did not apply the proposition that, generally, disbarment is the appropriate sanction for a lawyer\u2019s misconduct where the lawyer commits a crime that establishes that the lawyer is unfit to continue to practice law. <em>See Sheinbein, </em>372 Md. at 261, 249-50, 812 A.2d at 1002, 995-96 (This Court disbarred a lawyer who committed the crime of obstructing and hindering a police officer by helping a murder suspect flee the country.); <em>Painter, </em>356 Md. at 307, 305, 739 A.2d at 32, 31 (This Court disbarred a lawyer who committed the crimes of battery and illegally transporting a handgun; the lawyer had abused his spouse and child.); <em>Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. at 193, 186, 747 A.2d at 661, 658 (This Court disbarred a lawyer who committed the crime of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute.). By contrast, here, Greenleaf violated MLRPC 8.4(b) by violating CR \u00a7 3-324(b); in other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>words, Greenleaf committed a crime that establishes that he is unfit to continue to practice law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Although Greenleaf does not expressly rely on either case, we discuss and distinguish <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 329-31, 786 A.2d 763, 772-73 (2001) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mitchell, </em>308 Md. 653, 655, 521 A.2d 746, 747-48 (1987), in which this Court adopted the Commission\u2019s recommendations by indefinitely suspending lawyers who violated MLRPC 8.4(b) (or the predecessor to MLRPC 8.4(b)). In <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 329, 786 A.2d at 772, the lawyer stalked a thirteen-year-old boy. This Court noted only one aggravating factor: vulnerability of the victim. <em>See id. </em>at 331, 786 A.2d at 773. This Court noted that the following four mitigating factors \u201cprevented disbarment\u201d: (1) the absence of a prior disciplinary record; (2) remorse; (3) cooperative attitude towards the attorney discipline proceeding; and (4) mental disability in the form of \u201cnonexclusive homosexual Ephebophiliaf,]\u201d which \u201cinvolves a sexual attraction to pubescent boysf,]\u201d and rehabilitation in the form of \u201ctreatment for his disorder and ... limitfing] his contact with children.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 331, 320, 786 A.2d at 773, 766-67 (footnote omitted). In <em>Mitchell, </em>308 Md. at 654, 521 A.2d at 747, the lawyer fellated a thirteen-year-old boy. This Court did not note any aggravating factors, and noted one mitigating factor: mental disability in the form of \u201cmanic depressive reaction disorder and compulsive homosexual pedophiliaf,]\u201d and rehabilitation in the form of \u201cextensive treatmentf.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 521 A.2d at 747 (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast to <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Mitchell, </em>here, Green-leaf violated MLRPC 8.4(c) by using one of the Maryland Judiciary\u2019s computers to solicit \u201cBeth\u201d; Greenleafs misconduct is accompanied by eight aggravating factors, such as a pattern of misconduct, refusal to acknowledge the wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>nature of his misconduct, and indifference to rehabilitation; there is a sole mitigating factor <em>(ie., </em>the absence of a prior disciplinary record); the hearing judge did not find that Greenleaf had been diagnosed with any mental disability; and the Commission forcefully recommends that we disbar Green-leaf, identifying him as \u201ca sexual predator\u201d in its written recommendation and at oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In sum, we agree. Greenleaf is, indeed, a sexual predator who is a danger to the public and is \u201cunfit to continue\u201d to practice law. <em>Gerace, </em>433 Md. at 649, 72 A.3d at 577 (citation omitted).

In this case, although Greenleaf did not make a false statement, the record demonstrates that his conduct involved dishonesty, as Greenleaf was certainly not candid with his employer about his extensive nefarious activities in the workplace.

In an analogous case, in <em>Lawyer Disciplinary Bd. v.

As a result, the West Virginia Lawyer Disciplinary Board (\"the Board\u201d) charged the attorney with violating WVLRPC 8.4(c) on the basis that the attorney \"engaged in the repetitive unauthorized access of [the wife\u2019s and co-workers\u2019] e-mail accounts by improperly using various email account passwords[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.
