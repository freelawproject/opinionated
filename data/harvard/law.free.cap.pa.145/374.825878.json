SAMUEL W. BELL. PETITIONS <em>OF </em>JOHN R. TATE, THOMAS J. DOWNING AND EDWIN SHAFFER, FOR WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b394-8\">Argued January 12, 1891</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1z\">Decided October 5, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b394-9\">[To be reported.]</p>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-10\">1. When a petition for a writ of habeas corpus sets forth that the relator is in custody by virtue of an order of the court adjudging him guilty of contempt and sentencing him to imprisonment, for refusing to testify as a witness in a criminal case, the fact that the sheriff\u2019s return to the writ does not set out the contempt, or state facts showing the jurisdiction of the court to commit the relator, is immaterial.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b394-11\">2. When a witness has been sentenced to imprisonment for contempt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>court in refusing to testify for the commonwealth upon the trial of an indictment, the sufficiency of such indictment, whether it was properly framed, or whether the acts charged therein constitute an indictable offence, cannot be considered upon a petition of the recusant witness for a writ of habeas corpus.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-5\">3. A witness who declines to answer a question, upon the ground that it would tend to criminate himself, is not the final arbiter of the question whether the interrogatory propounded to him has such a tendency. The decision of this question is committed by \u00a7 10, act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 161, to the trial judge, who therefore necessarily has the power to enforce his decision by punishing a refusal to obey it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-6\">4. Upon the trial of an indictment for bribery, a witness for the commonwealth was asked, in substance, whether the defendant on trial had at a certain time offered a bribe to the witness. A responsive answer to the question, without more, would not tend to criminate the witness, in such a sense as to justify a refusal on his part to answer it: Per Mr. Justice Sterrett.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-7\">5. The provision in \u00a7 32, article HI. of the constitution, that a witness shall not be permitted to withhold his testimony against persons charged with \u201cthe offence of bribery, or corrupt solicitation,\u201d but that such testimony shall not afterwards be used against him in any proceeding, etc., does not relate solely to the \u201cbribery\u201d and \u201ccorrupt solicitation\u201d specified in \u00a7\u00a7 29 to 31 of the same article.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-8\">6. The words \u201c offence of bribery,\u201d employed in \u00a7 32, mean all bribery, whether at common law, under the constitution itself, or under any statute ; and include bribery at nominating conventions or delegate elections, made criminal by act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 70. The words of the constitution should be taken in their popular, natural and ordinary meaning, and little significance attached to the wording of the captions.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b395-9\">7. When a witness has claimed the privilege of refusing to testify on the ground that his testimony would tend to criminate himself, and the court has required him to do so, deciding that the ease is within \u00a7 32, article HI. of the constitution, and the witness is protected thereby, such decision, whether right or -wrong, will shield the witness from having testimony, given in such circumstances, afterwards used against him.</syllabus>\n<judges data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b395-10\">Before Paxson, C.

Whereupon, the president judge required and directed said John R. Tate, your petitioner, to answer said several questions, stating to.him that his answer could not be used against him in any criminal proceeding against him. But your petitioner still refusing to answer, for the same reason above stated, and also under the advice of his counsel, the court, on December 16, 1890, adjudged him guilty of contempt and committed him to the common jail in custody of the sheriff, until such time as he would purge himself of the contempt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">\u201c Your petitioner was imprisoned in the common jail in the custody of the sheriff until December 17,1890, when he was, by the direction of the court, brought into court, and being inquired of by the president judge, whether he still persisted in his refusal to answer the several questions aforesaid, answered that he did, for the same reasons before stated, whereupon he was remanded to said jail. And, in the afternoon of the same day, being again by the direction of the court brought into court, he, through his counsel, stated to the court that he in refusing to answer the questions asked him on the part of the Commonwealth in the case of Commonwealth v. William D. Wallace, at No. 8 September Sessions 1890, and for which refusal he had been convicted of contempt by said court, had in such refusal no purpose or intention of contumacy or of interfering with'or preventing the course of justice; on the contrary, he said that he was indicted in the same court, at No. 11 September Sessons 1890, for the alleged offence of receiving bribes, offering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>to accept and receive bribes from William D. Wallace to give his vote, while a delegate to the same nominating convention charged in the indictment against Wallace, and employed counsel to conduct his defence in said case; that his counsel aforesaid had advised and counseled him and he verily believed that an answer to the said questions would tend to criminate him and, could be used as evidence against him on the trial of the case against him; and further, he was so advised and verily believed that the course pursued by him as aforesaid was the only means by which he could protect his legal rights in the conduct of his own defence. He further showed to the court, that with all due respect to his Honor\u2019s judgment, he was still advised by his counsel, that in their opinion the said adjudication was erroneous, and that he intended to remove the case to the Supreme Court, in order that the said judgment might be reviewed therein ; and further, he said that if the Supreme Court should hold and decide that he ought to answer said questions, and his answers would not tend to criminate him, and could not thereafter be used against him, that he would then be willing to answer them. The court thereupon sentenced your petitioner as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">\u201c \u2018 And, now, December 17,1890, the witnesses, Edwin Shaffer, alias Edward Shaffer, Thomas J.

' The facts with reference to their refusal to testify in answer to these questions, and the action of the Court of Quarter Sessions thereon, were similar to the facts in the case of Tate.

McOonnell), </em>for the relators:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">1. The court below erroneously construed \u00a7 32, article III. of the constitution, as though it stood alone, giving a signification never intended. In our view, \u00a7\u00a7 29 to 32 are to be read together, and thus read their meaning is plain, clear, and easily understood. The mischief intended to be remedied was legislative bribery. If \u00a7 32 includes everything that the legislature may make bribery, or that was bribery at common law, or even everything that is called bribery in any part of the constitution, the words in \u00a7 29, \u201c within the meaning of this constitution,\u201d would be surplusage, and the disqualifying clause of \u00a7 9, article VIII. would be useless and unnecessary. The \u201c offence \u201d referred to in \u00a7 32, article III., refers to the offences named in \u00a7 31. In support of this view, see: 2 Conv. Deb. 488, 490, 491, 499; 5 Idem, 312, 313 ; 7 Idem, 412, 434, <em>435; </em>Buckalew on Const., 96, 98. This is in accordance with the general rules of construction: Dwarris on Stat., 704, et seq.; Cooley on Const. Lim., 59, n. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-8\">2. Neither of the counts in the indictment against Wallace charged the offence referred to in the constitution, nor indeed any offence, either at common law or under any statute. The witnesses, then, had a legal right to refuse to answer any questions that might tend to criminate them, or elicit a fact which would become a link in the chain of circumstantial evidence: 1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 451; 1 Whart. Cr. L., \u00a7 805; 1 Russ, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Crimes, \u00a7 538; Ex parte Doran, 2 Pars. 467 ; Baird v. Cochran, 4 S. &amp; R. 397; McFadden v. Reynolds, 20 W. N. 312; \u00a7 9, article I. of the constitution. The true interpretation of the constitutional provision, just cited, is that a person cannot be compelled to give testimony against himself before any tribunal, in any proceeding, tending to criminate himself in that or in any other proceeding: Cullen v. Commonwealth, 24 Gratt. 624; McFadden v. Reynolds, 20 W. N. 312; Horstman v. Kaufman, 97 Pa. 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">3. Having merely asserted their constitutional right and common-law privilege, the witnesses were not guilty of contempt : People v. Kelley, 24 N. Y. 74; Ex parte Rowe, 7 Cal. 175. Whether the answer to any single question would or would not have tended to criminate the witnesses, or furnish a link in the chain of criminating evidence, is not before this court. The lower court did not rule upon each question as asked, and the witnesses were adjudged guilty of contempt for refusing to answer all the questions. And this court has jurisdiction on habeas corpus to inquire whether the court below exercised its summary power in a case where it was not warranted by law: Commonwealth v. Ketner, 92 Pa. 372; Commonwealth v. Perkins, 124 Pa. 36; Hummell &amp; Bishoff, 9 W. 416; Commonwealth v. Newton, 1 Gr. 453; People v. Kelley, 24 N. Y. 74; Ex parte Rowe, 7 Cal. 175 ; \u00a7 1, act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 785.

We do not disjrate the proposition that a witness cannot be compelled to give criminating testimony against himself, but it is subject to this limitation, that if the constitution, or a statute, provides that such testimony shall not be used against him in any judicial proceeding, he is thus fully protected and can be compelled to testify: People v. Kelley, 1 Am. L. Reg., N. S., 534. We also believe that none of the questions asked Tate had any tendency to criminate him, and but one question put to Downing, and only three of those asked Shaffer, had such a tendency. If any one question should have been answered, the judgment of the court should not be disturbed: Henwood v. Commonwealth, 52 Pa. 427; Election Cases, 65 Pa. 39; and it was for the court to determine whether the questions had a criminating tendency: Ward v. State, 2 Mo. 120 (22 Am. Dec. 449) ; Whart. Cr. L., \u00a7 807 ; Burr\u2019s Trial, 424; Fries v. Brugler, 7 Hals. 79 (21 Am. Dec. 56); Sidebottom v. Adkins, 3 Jur. 63 ; Adams v. Lloyd, 3 Hurl. &amp; N. 351; Whart. Cr. Ev., \u00a7\u00a7 465, 469. And where the witness is compelled to answer, the testimony cannot be used against him: Rex v. Garbett, 1 Den. C. C. 236; Whart. Cr. Ev., \u00a7 465.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">3. Even if all the questions put had a criminating tendency, the court was right in holding that \u00a7 32, article III. of the constitution protected the witnesses. The charge against Wallace was bribery at common law, and came within the spirit of the act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 70; Respublica v. Teischer, 1 Dall. 335; Commonwealth v.

TATE.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"A67\">Mb. Justice Sterbett :</author>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In December, 1890, William D. Wallace was on trial in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lawrence county on an indictment charging him, in the second count, with offering John R. Tate, Edwin Shaffer, and Thomas J. Downing, electors and delegates to a nominating convention, money as a bribe ; and, in the third count, with soliciting, encouraging, and requesting said John R. Tate, Edwin Shaffer, and Thomas J. Downing, delegates to a nominating convention, to receive and accept money as a bribe, to influence them to make and join in nominating a candidate for congress. The relator, being called and sworn as a witness on behalf of the commonwealth, was asked certain questions, which he refused to answer, on the ground that his answers would tend to criminate him. Other questions were repeatedly propounded to the witness, and, for the same reason, he refused to answer either of them. The question of privilege claimed by him was then discussed, and, after due consideration, the decision of the court was announced to the witness as follows: \u201c The question has been argued in regard to the privilege which you claim, and the court has announced its decision that the witness must answer the questions asked, but that the answers .cannot be used against you in any criminal proceeding.\u201d The witness having still declined to answer any of the questions propounded to him, the president of the court, addressing him, said: \u201c Are you aware of the fact, Mr. Tate, that your refusal to answer is contempt of court, for which you may be punished by imprisonment ? \u201d To which he replied in the affirmative. Thereupon the court, after referring to the facts, adjudged the relator guilty of contempt, and committed him \u201c until such time as he will purge himself of said contempt.\u201d On the following day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>the case of Commonwealth v. Wallace being still on trial, the relator was brought into court, and being asked if he was then willing to answer the questions which had been propounded to him the day before, replied: \u201c I still claim my privilege,\u201d and refused to testify. The court, having considered the premises, thereupon, December 17, 1890, sentenced him \u201cto pay a fine of two hundred dollars, and undergo an imprisonment in the county jail, .... until the tenth day of March next; and stand committed,\u201d etc. Afterwards, on December 23, 1890, the relator was brought before our Brother Clakk on this writ of habeas corpus issued by him at chambers, etc., and by his order the hearing was continued to January 12, 1891, before the court in banc, and an order admitting him to bail, etc., was made. As ancillary to this writ of habeas corpus, the record of the criminal case in which the relator refused to testify was brought before us and referred to, so far as it has any bearing upon the action of the Court of Quarter Sessions in adjudging him guilty of contempt of court, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is unnecessary to consider any technical objection to the sufficiency of the sheriff\u2019s return to the writ of habeas corpus, because, in his petition for the writ, the relator sets forth, inter alia, the fact that he was adjudged guilty of contempt of court in refusing to testify as a witness in the case above referred to ; that for said offence he was sentenced by the court to pay a fine of two hundred dollars, and undergo an imprisonment in the common jail of Lawrence county until the tenth day of March, 1891, \u201c and stand committed to the custody of the sheriff for the purpose of carrying this sentence into effect; bjr virtue of which your petitioner is now in the said common jail in custody of Samuel W. Bell, sheriff.\u201d Nor is it necessary for us to consider the sufficiency of the indictment which Wallace was called upon to answer, whether it was properly framed, or whether the acts charged therein constitute an indictable offence, either at common law or by statute. These and all other matters pertaining to it were for the court before whom the cause was being tried, to consider and determine in the first instance. When they come properly before us (if they ever do), after that court has finally passed upon them, it will be time enough for us to consider them; but we may remark, in passing, that, if the acts therein charged are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>criminal, no time should be lost in making such acts highly penal. Delegate elections and nominating conventions are a necessary part of our representative and elective system, and as such they are recognized, and to some extent guarded and regulated, by law. Bribery and corruption in those sources of political and civil power are calculated, in a very high degree, to debauch and demoralize the people and undermine our institutions. Delegates to nominating conventions are the chosen representatives of the political party to which they profess to belong. In representing those by whom they are chosen, such delegates are called upon to discharge the most important duties that pertain to the elective franchise, the selection of proper persons as candidates for offices to be filled by the votes of the people. In many cases, a nomination is equivalent to an election. Bribery of delegates to nominating conventions is a contemptibly mean fraud upon our elective system, and, as was well said by the present Chief Justice in Commonwealth v. Walter, 83 Pa. 107, \u201ca fraud upon the ballot is a crime against the nation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The relator appears to have been conscious that there was something criminal in the acts laid in the indictment, which, as a witness for the commonwealth, he was called to sustain; because, in refusing to answer any question that could have had even a remote bearing on those acts, and many that had none whatever, he assigned as his only reason for such refusal that his answer would tend to criminate himself. Assuming that he honestly believed in the reason thus assigned, he would appear to be more susceptible of crimination than the trial court supposed he was; for, certainly, fully responsive answers to many of the questions that were put to him by the attorney for the commonwealth could not have had the slightest tendency to criminate him. Whether such answers might tend to criminate the defendant on trial was a matter that concerned only the parties to that case. In a legal point of view, at least, it could not concern the relator. After the relator\u2019s claim of privilege had been considered, and the court had informed him that he must answer the questions asked, but that his answers could not be used against him in any criminal proceeding, and he still, for the same reason as before, repeatedly refused to answer, what remained to be done ? Was his determination in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Opposition to the judgment of the court to be accepted as a finality, and was the court powerless to enforce its order in the premises? We think not. If it was, courts of justice would be at the mercy of contumacious witnesses. It would be in the power of the latter at any time to cause a miscarriage of justice. The relator was not the final arbiter of the question whether his answers to the interrogatories propounded would tend to criminate him. It was the plain duty of the trial judge to decide that question. Men who are as conscious of extreme susceptibility of crimination as the relator appears to have been, would be badly qualified to decide such questions, especially in their own cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The tenth section of our act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 161, provides that \u201c any competent witness,\u201d except defendants actually upon trial in the criminal court, \u201c may be compelled to testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal; but he may not be compelled to answer any questions which, in the opinion of the trial judge, would tend to criminate him.\u201d The trial judge, and not the witness, is therefore the proper person to decide such questions; and it requires no argument to show that, if it is his exclusive province to decide, he must necessarily have the power to enforce his decision by punishing the contumacious witness for refusing to obey.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">It is quite apparent from an examination of the questions which the relator refused to answer that he was contumacious. The following are some of the questions which the relator refused to answer:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u201cState whether you ever heard Mr. Wallace talk about drawing a check at any time during the convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">\u201c State whether you heard him (Mr. Wallace) make any offers or promises of money to Thomas J. Downing or Edwin Shaffer, in connection with any other person, in case they would vote for Major McDowell.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">' \u201cDid you have any conversation with William D. Wallace about how you should vote that day ?</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">\u201cState whether Mr. Wallace had any envelopes there that day, with packages of money in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">\u201c State whether Mr. Wallace, at the time you were in his office on the last day of the convention, offered you, Thomas J. Downing, and Edwin Shaffer, any money in case you would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>vote for Major McDowell, and, if so, how much, as an inducement to influence you to vote for Major McDowell?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">It is difficult to see how responsive answers to these questions, without more, could have tended to criminate the relator. Suppose, in answer to the last question, relator had said, \u201c Yes, he did. At the time and place mentioned, he offered each of us five hundred dollars in case we would vote for Major McDowell, and the offer was made as an inducement to thus vote.\u201d That answer might tend to criminate the defendant then on trial, but certainly it would not tend to criminate the witness, to whom, with others, the offer was made. It requires something more than the naked fact that the offer was made and the purpose for which it was made. If he had answered the question affirmatively, as above supposed, and had then been asked whether he accepted the offer, the question might or might not, according to circumstances, involve a self-criminating answer. But the question that was put to the witness did not necessarily involve a criminating answer. The action of the relator and other witnesses, in refusing to answer questions which, apparently at least, did not involve self-criminating answers, has more the appearance of concerted action on their part, wherein they mutually agreed to refuse to testify to anything that would tend to sustain the charges laid in the indictment against the defendant on trial. These were all matters for the consideration of the trial court; and, except for extraordinary reasons which do not appear in this case, its judgment must be regarded as final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">But it is claimed that, in adjudging the relator guilty of contempt of court, and sentencing him therefor, the court below proceeded upon the erroneous assumption that his case was within the purview of \u00a7 32, article III. of the constitution, which ordains as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201c Any person may be compelled to testify in any lawful investigation or judicial proceeding against any person who may be charged with having committed the offence of bribery, or corrupt solicitation, and shall not be permitted to withhold his testimony upon the ground that it may criminate himself, or subject him to public infamy; but such testimony shall not afterwards be used against him in any judicial proceeding, except for perjury in giving such testimony,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The relator\u2019s contention is that this provision relates solely to the crime of \u201c bribery \u201d and the offence of \u201c corrupt solicitation,\u201d etc., specified in the twenty-ninth, thirtieth and thirty-first sections of the same article, and is necessarily restricted thereby. This, we think, would be a too narrow construction of our organic law. In construing a constitution it must be borne in mind that its provisions are necessarily general, and couched in the language of the people by whom it was ordained. Its words should therefore be taken in their popular, natural, and ordinary meaning, rather than in any technical or restricted sense. The object of construction, as applied to such an instrument, is to give full effect to the intent of its framers, and the people in adopting it. That intent, of course, is to be sought for in the instrument itself. If the words convey a definite meaning, involving no absurdity or conflict with other portions of the instrument, that meaning which is apparent on its face must be adopted: 3 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, 679, and cases there cited. Little, if any, significance can be attached to the wording of the captions and titles of the several articles of such an instrument. At most they are merely intended to indicate the general character of the articles to which they are prefixed. That they were intended as critical and precise definitions of the subject matter of the articles, or as exercising restraining limitations upon the clear expressions therein contained, cannot be assumed: Houseman v. Commonwealth, 100 Pa. 222. This will be apparent by reference to several articles of our constitution. For example, article XII., \u201c Public Officers,\u201d \u00a7 1 of which relates to elections, etc.; \u00a7 2, to incompatibility of offices ; and \u00a7 3, to duelling, etc., as a disqualification. It must be very apparent that the many different subjects to which its provisions relate are much more numerous than the eighteen articles and schedule which constitute the instrument. \u2022\u201c To impose a limitation upon words of comprehensive import, some express declaration to that effect, or inevitable inference, would be requisite. Especially is this so in construing the organic law of the state. Such instruments deal with larger topics, and are couched in broader phrase, than are legislative acts: \u201d Houseman v. Commonwealth, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The word \u201c bribery \u201d appears to be first used in \u00a7 7, article II., wherein it is declared that \u201c no person hereafter convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>embezzlement of public moneys, bribery, perjury, or any other infamous crime, shall be eligible to the general assembly, or capable of holding any office of trust or profit in this commonwealth.\u201d These words, \u201c bribery, perjury,\u201d etc., were doubtless used in their plain and ordinary meaning, and without restriction, embracing both common-law and statutory offences coming within the same designation. In \u00a7 9, article VIII., the word \u201c bribery \u201d is again used without restriction, but in a connection which shows its relation to our election laws. The <em>\u201c </em>bribery \u201d therein mentioned is complete by offers, promises, etc., as was held in Leonard v. Commonwealth, 112 Pa. 607. The word \u201c bribery \u201d again occurs in \u00a7 29, article III., which, after defining what may be termed \u201c legislative bribery,\u201d declares that the offender \u201c shall be held guilty of bribery within the meaning of this constitution, and shall incur the disabilities provided thereby for said offence, and such additional punishment as is or shall be provided by law.\u201d Section 30 of the same article declares that any person who shall, directly or indirectly, do certain things, \u201c shall be guilty of bribery,\u201d etc. By these sections, 29 and 30, which are legislative in their character, it was doubtless intended that the kinds of bribery therein defined should be taken out of the hands of the general assembly, so that they could not be changed by statutory enactment. Having thus given these provisions the force of organic law, the thirty-second section, now under consideration, makes provision for securing testimony, \u201c in any lawful investigation or judicial proceeding against any person who may be charged with the offence of bribery,\u201d etc., by declaring, that \u201c any person may be compelled to testify,\u201d etc. We think the words \u201c offence of bribery,\u201d employed in the thirty-second section, mean <em>all </em>bribery, whether bribery at common law, or under the constitution itself, or any kind of statutory bribery. The learned court was therefore right in saying to the relator that he must testify, and that his testimony could not after-wards be used against him in any judicial proceeding. But, whether the court was right or wrong in holding that the relator was thus protected by the section under consideration, the decision itself would have shielded him. No court would permit the testimony of a witness, truthfully given under such circumstances, to be afterwards used against him in any judicial proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>As already intimated, we are not called upon in this case, at the instance of this relator, to decide whether the indictment against Wallace sufficiently charges him with the offence of bribery at common law or under any statute, or whether it charges any indictable offence. That was not the relator\u2019s affair. It concerned the defendant in that indictment, but not a witness called by the commonwealth to sustain the charge laid therein. It follows from what has been said that in no view of the case was the relator unjustly restrained of his liberty ; and, having been released on bail pending the hearing and consideration of this case, without having fully complied with the sentence of the court below, he must be remanded into the custody of the respondent, to the end that said sentence may be fully executed.
