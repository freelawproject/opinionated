P.

The business of the defendant, in the year 1887, was confined exclusively to preparing a plant for the purpose of supplying light to customers, by means of electricity, through the instrumentality of engines and dynamos, substantially as described in paragraph 2.

The contract provided further as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-12\">\u201c 5. All original installations, enlargements, renewals, additions, or extensions of the plant of the Edison system shall be made subject to rules and specifications to be prescribed from time to time by the Light Company, with the view to maintain the best standard in the quality of all machines, apparatus, articles, methods or devices, and in the manner of employing the same. The Light Company shall, upon the request of the Illuminating Company, but at its charge, supply to it all the necessary drawings, specifications and directions for the installation of any of the patented machines, apparatus, articles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>methods or devices covered by this agreement. In case the Illuminating Company shall undertake the construction of their own plant, or enter into a contract with other parties to construct it, the plant shall not be paid for until inspected by a duly authorized agent of the Light Company, and the Illuminating Company will pay to the Light Company the cost of such inspection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">\u201c 6. It is understood that the Light Company is not now engaged in manufacturing, but that it undertakes and agrees to secure fair and uniform prices to all its licensees, and especially to secure to the Illuminating Company and its sub-licensees under his contract, terms as favorable as are given to any purchasers in like amount in the United States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">The license granted in pursuance of the foregoing agreement, bore date the same day. A preamble thereto recited that the light company (licensor) was the owner of inventions and letters patent for inventions of Thomas A. Edison, specified in an annexed schedule, and was entitled to acquire further inventions of like character, made by said Edison, and all letters patent of the United States, issued or to be issued therefor, and that the illuminating company (licensee) was desirous of acquiring the exclusive right to use such inventions and letters patent within the territory defined by the license, for the purpose of lighting, heating and power, as afterwards expressly defined. It then proceeded in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">\u201c 1.

And it is agreed that this enumeration does not include all forbidden uses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">\u201c6.

The commonwealth\u2019s exceptions averred that the court erred in the fifth finding of fact,1 in the second conclusion of law,a and in not entering judgment for the full amount of the commonwealth\u2019s claim.3 The defendant\u2019s exceptions specified error in the first conclusion of law;a in not holding that the act of June 7, 1879, P. L. 112, in so far as it imposed a tax upon the defendant\u2019s capital stock, was repealed by \u00a7 20, act of June 30, 1885, P.

The finding of the court below that the stock now in question is invested in such a license, is not reviewable: Commonwealth v. Hulings, 129 Pa. 317. In fact, however, the New York companj\u2019- did not convey to the defendant any apparatus or tangible property whatever. On the contrary, as the agreement shows, the defendant was not to procure its plant and appliances from the licensor, but was to \u201c undertake the construction of their own plant, or enter into a contract with other parties to construct it.\u201d Indeed, it appeared from the testimony that in the year 1887, the plant was not yet erected, and the defendant had no tangible property excep't a piece of ground and some conduits laid in the streets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">Counsel then cited, as to the taxability of capital stock invested in patents, the cases cited for the appellee in Commonwealth v.

On January 5, 1891, the decision of the court, McPherson, J., was filed, finding inter alia, in substance, that the defendant was engaged in the business of supplying light to its customers in the city of Chester, by means of its dynamos, wires and lights, or lamps, and was not engaged in furnishing heat or power, or in manufacturing any electric or other apparatus; that the light was produced by electricity in the manner described in the finding of facts in Commonwealth v. Elec. L. &amp; P.

Justice Williams:</author>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">Two questions are raised in this case. The first is whether the appellee is a manufacturing company. While it might well be so regarded, if the question were an open one, we have no doubt that it does not come within the class recognized by our acts of assembly relating to manufacturing <em>companies; </em>and the learned judge of the court below reached a correct conclusion upon this question, for reasons given in the opinion of this court just filed in the case of Commonwealth v. Light &amp; Power Co., ante, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">The other question is whether any portion of the capital stock of the Philadelphia company is invested in patent rights, and for that reason exempt from taxation. The court below was of th\u00e9 opinion that stock issued to the Edison Electric Light Company of New York, amounting to about forty-nine thousand dollars, out of a total capital of one hundred and forty thousand dollars, was invested in patent rights, and therefore exempt. This finding rests on the written agreement or license bearing date on the third day of February, 1887, and we are now to inquire whether the finding is sustained by the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ment. It contains a recital that the Edison Electric Light Company of New York is the owner - of many patents obtained for appliances used in the production of electricity by artificial means, its delivery to customers, and its utilization for purposes of light, heat, and power. It recites, further, the desire of the Philadelphia company to acquire an exclusive right to use such appliances in the city of Philadelphia. Then follows the grant of the desired exclusive right, but only as to the use of the appliances, and under certain conditions and limitations which show plainly the purpose of the owners of the patents to maintain their exclusive ownership in them, and their absolute control over the manufacture of the appliances, and over the manufactured articles when finished. Among these conditions is one that limits the right of the licensee to the supply of its customers on the described circuit; another, forbidding the use of the license for any other purposes than such as relate to light, heat, and power to propel stationary machinery; another, declaring the license to be personal to the licensee, and forbidding any assignment or transfer of it. Still another reserves to the New York company the right to terminate the license on any default made, resume the exclusive ownership of the territory, and grant a new license to another party covering the same exclusive right in the same territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Under this agreement, the licensee secures the right to use the appliances made under the several patents held by the licensor, for a fixed price, to be paid in money, in its own stock, or in both; and it secures nothing more. The New York company, on the other hand, retains its exclusive ownership of all its patents, an absolute control over the manufacture of its appliances protected by the patents, and over the use and disposition of every one of the manufactured articles which its licensee uses. We have just held in Commonwealth v. D. &amp; P. Teleg. Co., ante, 121, following Patterson v. Kentucky, 97 U. S. 501; Stephens v. Cady, 14 How. 528; Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344, that the exclusive right secured to the inventor by letters patent, is an incorporeal right, clearly distinguishable from the ownership of the instrument or appliance manufactured under and by virtue of that right; and that a lessee of the instrument or appliance acquires no title to or ownership in the patent under which it was made. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>language of Justice Field, in Webber v. Virginia, supra: \u201c The right conferred by the patent laws of the United States on inventors, to sell their inventions and discoveries, does not take the tangible property, in which the invention or discovery may be exhibited or carried into effect, from the operation of the tax and license laws of the state.\u201d Whether the \u201ctangible property,\u201d that is, the machines or appliances made and ready for use, is in the hands of the makers, of venders, lessees, or licensees, can make no difference. Such property is not a patent right, but the visible, tangible fruit of the right secured by the patent, which passes to a purchaser or lessee in precisely the same way that any other manufactured articles pass from the maker to the buyer or lessee. It is not necessary to repeat what was said upon this subject in Commonwealth v. D. &amp; P. Teleg. Co., supra; but, for reasons given in the opinion filed in that case, we reverse the judgment as to the taxability of the stock of the appellee used to pay the rent of, or price of the license to use, the manufactured appliances of the New York company in its business in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">Judgment is now entered in favor of the appellant, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the sum of one hundred forty-seven dollars, with interest and costs in addition to the judgment entered in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Tax on $49,000, capital stock, . $147.00</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Int. at twelve per cent from Nov. 6,</p>\n<p id=\"AfS\">1888, to ...</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Attorney general\u2019s commission,</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">defendant\u2019s appeal, no. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"ADE\">Mr. Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">This is an appeal from the same decree which we have just considered, on the appeal of the commonwealth. The only question here presented is whether the appellant is a manufacturing corporation, within the meaning of the act of 1885, exempting manufacturing corporations from the operation of the revenue law of 1879. This question is disposed of by the opinion in Commonwealth v. Light &amp; P. Co., ante, 105, filed herewith. For reasons given in that case</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">This appeal is dismissed, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>commonwealth\u2019s appeal, no. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Aqh\">Me. Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The question presented upon this appeal is identical with that presented by the appeal of the commonwealth from the judgment in the case of Commonwealth v. Elec. Light Co., in which an opinion has just been filed. For reasons there given we reverse the judgment entered in the court below, so far as it relates to the taxability of the stock of the appellee, used to pay the rent for, or the price of the license to use the manufactured instruments or appliances furnished by the Edison company in New York to the Chester company, for use in carrying on their business in the city of Chester.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Judgment is now entered in favor of the commonwealth for the further sum, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AbV\">Tax on $15,000, capital stock, . . $60</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Interest at twelve per cent,</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Attorney general\u2019s commission,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
