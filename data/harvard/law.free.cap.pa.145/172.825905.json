Ct., but on May 16th, on motion of the defendant\u2019s attorney, a rule was granted to show cause why the judgment entered should not be stricken off. This rule, on December 10, 1890, was made absolute, the judgment theretofore entered stricken off, and it was ordered that a proper form of judgment be drafted by counsel and presented for signature. Subsequently the following order was signed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">And, now, December 17, 1890, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendant, James B. Denworth, hath unlawfully assumed and exercised the duties of the alleged office of recorder of the city of Williamsport; that the act of assembly of March 24, 1877, and its supplements, under which the respondent claims to exercise the said office, are unconstitutional and void; that the defendant is therefore without title to the said office; that he be ousted and forever excluded from the actual exercise thereof, and that the commonwealth have and recover from the respondent the costs of this proceeding.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u2014Thereupon, the defendant took this appeal, specifying that the court erred :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-4\">1. In the portion of the charge embraced in [ ] 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-5\">2. The facts upon which the issue was joined having been admitted, the learned court erred in not instructing the jury to render a verdict in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">3. In making the order, judgment, or decree.3</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-7\"><em>Mr. M. E. </em>Olmsted, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">1. The law of this state, in regard to pleadings in cases of this kind, is thus stated: \u201c The attorney general may disclose in his information the specific ground of forfeiture, or he may merely set forth the franchises, alleged to have been illegally exercised, and call upon the defendant to show by what authority they are held. The plea should either deny the facts, of set forth the authority. The replication may then allege the acts relied on as working a forfeiture. This may be denied or admitted by the defendant: \u201d Lewis, C. J., in Commonwealth v. Commercial Bank, 28 Pa. 388, 387. In the case at bar, had the attorney general so chosen, he might undoubtedly have stated in his suggestion merely that the defendant was exercising the office of recorder in the city of Williamsport, and called upon him to show by what authority. Upon answer, however, the attorney general must have alleged the grounds of the alleged illegal exercise of the duties of the office. But the only ground urged was that defendant was not authorized to exercise the duties of the office created by the acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">2. The issue raised by the pleadings was one of fact, and not of law. The suggestion alleged that, without any warrant or lawful authority, the defendant was exercising an office provided by certain acts of assembly. The answer set up certain facts showing him to be duly authorized to exercise the office under the acts. The replication joined issue only as to matters alleged in the answer. All the facts therein alleged, necessary to show the authority of defendant under the acts, were formally admitted by the commonwealth upon the trial. The instruction to the jury, therefore, should have been in favor of the defendant. The pleadings raised no question as to the constitutionality of the act of 1877, and its supplements, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>or any of them; and upon the trial, the attorney general did not call attention to any particular in which said acts, or any of them, violated or were believed to violate any provision of the federal or state constitutions; nor did the learned court in its charge or in its decree.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-4\"><em>Mr. W. U. </em>Sensei, Attorney General, (with him <em>Mr. Jas. A. </em>Stranahan, Deputy Attorney General, <em>Mr. S. W. Watson, </em>of counsel,) for the Commonwealth :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">The suggestion for the quo warranto averred that the defendant used and exercised the office of recorder, under color of certain specified statutes without any warrant or lawful authority. The answer averred that the defendant, by the terms of the acts became and was entitled to hold said office. So that, not only was the constitutionality of the acts raised by. the charge to the jury and the judgment, but also by the pleadings. Moreover, if the question were not raised on the pleadings, the pleadings were amendable, and may now be considered as amended: Trainor v. Railroad Co., 137 Pa. 148; Bolton v. King, 105 Pa. 78. And that the acts are unconstitutional, as local and special legislation, is rested on Scranton School D.\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 178; Weinman v. Railway Co., 118 Pa. 192 ; Morton v. Shelby Co., 118 U. S. 425; Ayars\u2019 App., 122 Pa. 266.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-18\"> The record of this case is fully shown, as illustrative of the practice in quo warranto : See 2 Brewster\u2019s Pr., \u00a7\u00a7 2049-2134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AhM\">Me. Justice McCollum :</author>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">This is an appeal from a judgment of ouster from a public office. The judgment was entered against the appellant on the ground that the statutes under which he claimed title to the office of recorder of the city of Williamsport were unconstitutional, and his contention here is that their validity ivas not called in question by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The objections to the judgment are purely technical, and there is no effort to show that the statutes on which it is admitted the title of the appellant to the office from which he was ousted depends, are of any validity. It is obvious, from an inspection of the record, that the only question for the consideration of the court below was the constitutionality of these statutes. In the information, on which the writ of quo warranto was issued, it was charged that the appellant used and exercised the office of recorder under color of them, and in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>answer thereto it was averred that, by their terms, he became and was entitled to hold the said office. The regularity of the proceedings under them was conceded upon the trial, subject to objection as to their relevancy. It is not possible, in the presence of the information, answer, and concession, to discover any dispute concerning the facts in the case. These were admitted, and the inquiry related to their legal effect. This inquiry necessarily involved a consideration of the validity of the statutes under which the appellant claimed he was entitled to hold the office, and which the commonwealth alleged gave him no more than color of title to it. It is plain from the pleadings, the developments on the trial, and the charge of the learned judge, that the question of the constitutionality of these statutes was presented, considered, and passed upon in the court below; and whether the argument made there by the counsel for the commonwealth was sufficiently specific to satisfy the appellant is a matter with which we have no concern. We may add that, if greater precision in the pleadings was deemed necessary, it could have been secured by an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The statutes under which the appellant claims title to the office of recorder are in palpable conflict with \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution. They are local, because confined in their operations to cities of a specified population; which shall accept them by ordinance duly adopted by councils and approved by the mayor. Whether they shall apply to a city of the class described depends on the action of its municipal officers; and in consequence thereof, one city of the class may be subject to their provisions, and other cities of the same class be exempt from them. Without further elaboration of the subject, it is sufficient to say of this legislation that it is such as was condemned in Scranton School D.\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 176. It follows that a correct judgment was entered in this case, and the specifications are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
