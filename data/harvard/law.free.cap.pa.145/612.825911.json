For the purpose of providing a measure of damages, it was error to admit testimony contrasting the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property, as in its original condition,'with its value in the condition existing when the suit was brought.

Moreover, the riiode of estimating damages applicable to cases of taking under the power of eminent domain, is not ordinarily applicable to actions of trespass. For an injurious trespass, the measure of damages is the cost of remedying the injury, unless that equals or exceeds the value of the thing injured, when such value becomes the measure.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b632-24\">4.

The defendants pleaded not guilty and the statute of limitations. The plaintiff gave notice that he would claim damages to the date of trial: See act of May 2, 1876, P. L. 95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-4\">At the trial, on June 2,1890, the following facts were shown:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">In 1862, the plaintiff became the owner of a farm of seventy-three acres, in North Huntingdon township, Westmoreland county, lying on both sides of Brush creek and at a bend in that stream. The defendants, in 1871, erected the coke works described in Robb v. Carnegie, ante, 324, at a point about one mile further up the creek, and subsequently enlarged them by erecting additional ovens. The works were operated with coal slack, brought by rail from various mines in the neighborhood. Before using it in the ovens, the defendants washed it to remove impurities. The slate, sulphur, horseback, etc., washed out of the slack, as well as the ashes left in the ovens after the drawing of the coke, were carried to and dumped into the creek. In long, dry seasons, when there was insufficient water in the creek to carry off the refuse, it would accumulate in large quantities, the accumulations being carried down the stream later, when the water would rise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-6\">After the erection of the defendants\u2019 ovens there was a gradual change in the channel of the creek through the plaintiff\u2019s land, the creek bed being filled up by the deposit of slack, slate, gravel, etc., with some coke, and the water thus forced over upon the adjoining land of the plaintiff, washing away a part of his orchard and garden. The refuse matter carried down the stream was spread by high waters over seven or eight acres of the plaintiff\u2019s land, rendering that part of it unfit for cultivation. The water of the creek was so polluted as to be unfit for use, as the result of the washing of the slack at the' defendants\u2019 works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-7\">Testimony for the defendants tended to show that- much of the material brought down the stream came from collieries situated above the coke works ; that the deposits on the plaintiff\u2019s land, or most of them, were caused by extraordinary floods, which tore out many of defendants\u2019 ovens and washed all the coke and ashes from their yards; that the coke found upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s land came from the wreck of a large coke train; and that the waters of the creek had been polluted for twenty-five years, by sulphur water discharged from mines situated up the stream.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-4\">A large amount of testimony was given upon the question of damages, some of which is herewith presented:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-5\">William Robb, having testified for the plaintiff that the deposit on plaintiff\u2019s land was mixed up with the soil, from .twenty-two to twenty-three inches deep, and therefore it would be impossible, in the judgment of the witness, to remove the deposit from the land without taking soil and all, which would leave the ground worthless for cultivation, that the witness lived in the neighborhood, had known the plaintiff\u2019s farm since before the deposit came upon it, and that he knew of sales of real estate in that locality and the prices paid therein, was asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">\u201c Q.

Testimony for the defendants tended to show that the damages claimed by the plaintiff were exaggerated and extravagant, and that the deposits upon his land could be removed at a small cost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-12\">The testimony being closed, the court, Doty, P. J., charged the jury in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b636-13\">The plaintiff maintains that at the time of the purchase of this property Brush creek had a well defined channel, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>no one else, to his injury, had a right to divert the course of the stream, or to poison or pollute the waters thereof. He relies upon an ancient maxim of the law, that one must enjoy his own property in such manner as not to injure that of another. This rule gave to the plaintiff a right to the enjoyment of the stream flowing in its natural course over the surface of the land. Each proprietor of the land along Brush creek had an equal right to the advantage of the stream flowing in its natural channel; to the use of the water so as not to diminish its flow upon the other owners along the banks, and so as not to pollute the water and thus render it unfit for use by others; but no proprietor along this stream had any right to deposit foreign and injurious materials in the creek, in such a way that the ordinary current of the water or the usual rises following an ordinary rain would carry the same upon his neighbor below; and if such deposits were made, and substantial injury resulted, an action would lie to recover compensation for such injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-6\">Nor, would the defendants herein, unless they occupy an exceptional position, be free from responsibility in such a case. They contend, however, very earnestly, that their position is exceptional; that they are engaged in a lawful business; that the manufacture of coke is a necessary and important industry ; that all that was done by them was necessary and proper in such manufacture; that they were not guilty of negligence, and that there is no evidence of malice on their part. Now, all these admissions may be made without necessarily arriving at the conclusion to which the defendants direct us. If the coal were mined by the defendants at their plant on Brush creek, and the water of the mine naturally and necessarily flowed into the creek, without negligence or malice on the part of the defendants, those who suffered along the stream below would be without remedy by action. Such a rule, or rather, such an exception to the general rule, is made necessary in this state, in order not to hamper or destroy the industries engaged in the development of the natural resources of the country. But, the exception must not be carried beyond the exigencies of each particular case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b637-7\">The contention here is, that necessarily slack must be washed; that necessarily the stream must be polluted; that of necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the deposits must be made, and from the very necessity of the case, it is probable that some one in the vicinity of the coke plant will be injured by the smoke, by the pollution of the water, or from other causes incident to such manufacture. But, [in principle, we can see no difference between the manufacture of coke and any other offensive or injurious trade or manufacture. In other words, there is nothing in the nature of the coke industry to give it exceptional privileges over other industries, necessarily offensive or dangerous. It is true that it is a necessary and useful industry. If manufactured at the point where the coal is mined, it may be admitted, for the purposes of this case, that the slack could be washed, streams polluted, deposits made; and if done without negligence or malice, any injury done thereby would be damnum absque injuria. But such is not this case. The plaintiff bought his land, according to the testimony, in 1862, about twenty-eight years ago. Eleven years afterwards, or in 1871, according to the testimony, the defendants located their plant on the waters of Brush creek, about a mile up the stream from the land of the plaintiff. The raw material from which the coke is manufactured is not mined at this point, but is shipped from other places at various distances from the coke plant; the product also, is shipped away to market. The place selected for the manufacture is distant, therefore, both from the place of production of the raw material and from the market where the product is sold. Selecting such a location, as we view the law, the defendants are not in a position to claim exemption from the rule which requires \u2019them to use their own property so as to cause no injury to another; and if they did so use it, they would be liable for whatever injury they caused to plaintiff\u2019s land for six years prior to the commencement of this suit.]9.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-5\">We are now to call your attention to several matters of fact which we conceive it to be your particular duty to pass upon and decide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-6\">The first question is, to what extent has the plaintiff\u2019s property been injured? There seems to be no serious contention but that some injury was done to the plaintiff\u2019s property by some person at some time. The plaintiff alleges that six or eight acres, as we have alreadj^ indicated, were absolutely ie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>stroyed; that these acres were out of the very centre or heart of the farm, and that the destruction of these six acres depreciated the market value of the entire farm. On the other hand, it is contended by the defence that this injury was not nearly so great; that there was but a slight deposit of coke or other foreign material upon the north side of the tract, which we understand to be larger; and upon the south side thereof, there was not more than an acre and a half of the land that was rendered unfit for cultivation. There has been a great deal of testimony taken upon this question of fact, as well as some other questions that are present in the case, and we will refer very briefly, bjr way of refreshing your recollection, to the general run of the testimony upon the one side and upon the other.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\">The defendants, however, at this stage of the case, contend very earnestly that if liable at all for an injury, it is for a very small part of the damage you may find the plaintiff has sustained.....Now, if you find, under the evidence, the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, and what part, if any, the defendants were responsible for, you will next turn your attention to the question, how much of this injury if any has been caused to the plaintiff\u2019s land within six years before the commencement of the suit.....If you pursue the method of investigation that we have indicated, in their order, you will determine three questions: The extent of the plaintiff\u2019s injury; how much, if any, was caused by the defendants, and how much, if any, was done in the last eight years, six years before the commencement of the suit ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-10\">After deciding these questions there may remain one, namely, what damage, if any, has the plaintiff sustained? He claims for a permanent injury to his farm. To illustrate the damage, he has shown an orchard injured by sulphur or coke killing the trees, and by the waters washing trees away; that his fences have been swept away. The injury to the fences, however, was more than eight years ago. W\u00e9 have tried to recall some testimony to fix precisely when the trees were injured or swept away, but we have not been able to discover the precise time ; but that is a matter for you. The real injury complained of is the permanent and substantial injury to his premises. He claims for a depreciation in the market value of his property; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that from six to eight acres in the heart of his farm have been ruined, and that the value of the whole has depreciated in the market. This is a question to which you will particularly direct your attention. What is the difference in the value of this land with and without the deposit caused by the defendants within six years prior to the bringing of the suit ? This is the true measure of damages in this case, unless the cost of removing the deposit, and placing the premises in the same position as before the injury, would be less than the difference in the value of the land. If less, this would be the measure; this would be, the amount that ought to be awarded to the plaintiff. As we have already indicated, compensation is the rule. The plaintiff, if entitled to any damage, is entitled only to such damage as will compensate him for the injury he has suffered. If the deposit can be removed and the plaintiff placed in the position he was in'on the eighth of March, 1882, for less than the land has depreciated in value, he ought to be awarded only sufficient to place him in such position.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-5\">The plaintiff requests the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-6\">8. We instruct you that it was incumbent upon the defendants to provide a dumping ground for the refuse material from their coking plant, and to deposit the same in such manner as in no way to interfere with the flow of the water in Brush creek, and so as to do no injury to the lands of the plaintiff; and this is especially true, if you believe from the evidence there is other land which could be procured, in the vicinity of the coke ovens, upon which the said refuse material could be deposited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">Answer: The defendants have no legal right to dump slack or other material into the creek; and if you find that that has been done to the injury of the plaintiff, the defendants will be liable for whatever damage was caused by them to the land of the plaintiff.18</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">4. The plaintiff is entitled to the use and enjoyment of the waters of Brush creek, as it naturally flowed through his land, undiminished and unpolluted; and if the jury believe that the water of said stream has been polluted by reason of the defendants having allowed the filth from their washer and coke yard to pass into the stream, and the plaintiff has been thereby deprived of the ordinary use and enjoyment of the water of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>stream, he would be entitled to your verdict for such amount as would compensate him for the injury thus sustained from the eighth of March, 1882, down to the present day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">Answer: This point is affirmed.13</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">5. If the jury believe that the channel of' Brush creek has been filled up by reason of the slate and other refuse material from the coke ovens deposited in the channel of said stream by the defendants; and that by reason thereof the channel of said-stream has been changed, and the plaintiff\u2019s orchard washed away, the plaintiff will be entitled to your verdict for such amount as would compensate him for the injury thus sustained from the eighth of March, 1882, down to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">6. If the jury believe that the lands of the plaintiff have been permanently injured by reason of the filth thrown into the stream by the defendants, and carried down by the ordinary action of the water to and upon the land of the plaintiff, we instruct you that the proper measure of damage would be the difference between the market value of the plaintiff\u2019s farm, as unaffected by the alleged nuisance, and the market value of the said farm, as affected by the said alleged nuisance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axs\">7. We instruct you that in making the estimate of the damage sustained by the plaintiff, you will take into consideration the value of the land actually destroyed, the loss of crops from the eighth of March, 1882, to the present time, the destruction of his orchard, the damage to his fences and his dwelling-house, and the injury that resulted to him from the pollution of the water by the coke works, and the additional expense caused to plaintiff for the purchase of grain, feed, etc., by reason of the above deposit, and any other injury resulting therefrom ; and allow him such a verdict as will compensate him for the damage sustained from eighth of March, 1882, down to the present time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-11\">Answer: The correct measure of damage is stated in the sixth point, and with this qualification this point is affirmed. The fifth and seventh points are refused.15</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-12\">The defendants request the court to charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-13\">2. The defendants are engaged in a lawful business ; and if you believe they have selected a judicious location therefor, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action, unless he has satisfactorily shown that the defendants have operated their works with negligence, unskilfulness or malice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Answer: this point is refused.16</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">3. If you believe the defendants have chosen a secluded place for the erection of their ovens, where as few persons may be inconvenienced as possible, and in the manufacture of coke from coal slack it was necessary to remove the sulphur and other impurities by washing it, and if in such washing the water was polluted and flowed, by gravity in the channel of Brush creek through the plaintiff\u2019s property, in such condition making it unfit for any use to which he might desire to apply it, then we instruct you that such pollution of the water is damnum absque injuria, and on that branch of the plaintiff\u2019s case your verdict must be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-7\">Answer: Under the evidence in this case this point is refused.17</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-8\">4. If the evidence satisfies you that coal slack, slate, and coke, from collieries above defendants\u2019 works as well as other causes beside, sand, stone and gravel, combined in the injuries alleged to have been sustained by plaintiff, and the plaintiff not having proved the injury committed by defendants alone, you will be warranted in finding a verdict only for defendants\u2019 proportionate share of the damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-9\">Answer : This point is affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-10\">6. The undisputed evidence is that the defendants were and are pursuing a lawful business upon their own premises; and if any substance passed down the stream from their works, which was mingled with the same or like materials from collieries, embankments and other sources, as well as with stone, sand, gravel and other d\u00e9bris, and all were together deposited on plaintiff\u2019s land, in the time of the flood which was shown to have visited Brush creek in 1888, there can be no recovery under those circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-11\">Answer : If the whole injury were caused by the extraordinary flood of August, 1888, the defendants would not be liable. The defendants are only accountable for the injury caused by their own acts, and not by the acts of others working concurrently.

The defendants have been held liable in damages, because, in the lawful operation of their works, they have added to the impurities of water that was already befouled and totally unfit for use. The doctrine of Tinicum Fishing Co. v. Carter, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Pa. 89, renders further discussion in this connection unnecessary. We claim that whatever injury results from the lawful operation of an industry, located in a mining region and having for its object the conversion of raw minerals into manufactured products, is damnum absque injuria, and for any fouling of the stream that was the necessary result of their manufacturing business, the defendants are not liable: Penna. Coal Co. v. Sanderson, 113 Pa. 126; Commonwealth v. Miller, 139 Pa. 77; Penna. etc. R. Co. v. Walsh, 124 Pa. 544; 3 Bl. Com. 217; Railroad Co. v. Yeiser, 8 Pa. 366 ; Phila. etc. R. Co. v.

In the part of the charge assigned for error, the court improperly assumed and said to the jury that the business of the defendants was \u201c necessarily offensive or dangerous,\u201d thereby classing this case with Penna. Lead Co.\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 126. This manner of charging a jury has been condemned: Price v. Grantz, 118 Pa. 413. The court also had a wrong idea as to the legal effect of the selection by the defendants of a location for their operations. The rule laid down is entirely too stringent, and if sustained by this court, will be the death knell of industrial activity in this country. The defendants, if liable at all, were liable for such injuries only as. were caused by their own acts ; and it was incumbent on the plaintiff to distinguish between what came to his land from their works, and what came from other sources, before he could recover at all: Little Schuylkill Co. v. Richards, 57 Pa. 147; Seely v. Alden, 61 Pa. 306; Leidig v. Bucher, 74 Pa. 69.

Gas Co., 131 Pa. 143, s. c. 139 Pa. 121. The doctrine that one who throws coal dirt and other impurities into a stream, and permits them to be carried down by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>action of the water and deposited on the land of another, is responsible in damages therefor, has been recognized and applied in the following cases: Little Schuylkill Co. v. French, 81* Pa. 370 ; Howell v. McCoy, 3 R. 268; Horton v. Hall, 1 Penny. 159; McCallum v. Water Co., 54 Pa. 58; Hanover Water Co. v. Iron Co., 84 Pa. 284; Seely v. Alden, 61 Pa. 306; Sanderson v. Coal Co., 86 Pa. 408, 113 Pa. 143; Bushnell v. Proprietors, 31 Conn. 150. This is not an instance of a mine located by nature on the banks of a stream, as in the Sanderson case, but of a coking plant located by the defendants on a railroad and creek for their own convenience, using coal collected from many mines and brought to the ovens by rail. There is no necessity for casting refuse into the creek; a dumping ground could be provided for it. Nor is it shown that washing the slack is a necessity to the business. The defendants had a right to such use of the water of the creek as they could make, without materially diminishing its quantity, or corrupting its quality; but no greater right. And it matters not whether the water came flowing by the coke works in a pure condition or not; the defendants are answerable for such impurities as they added; and on this branch of the case the court below was especially clear and careful in the charge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-28\"> Cf.

Justice Williams :</author>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The questions raised by this appeal are substantially those which were considered and decided in the recent case of Robb v. Carnegie, ante, 324, in which an opinion was filed on the first day of the present term. The conclusions reached in that case require us to sustain the second, fifth, sixth, eighth, and fourteenth assignments of error, all of which relate to the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The plaintiff is the owner of a farm containing seventy-three acres and lying on both sides of Brush creek. It is mainly upland. The flat along the stream is quite narrow, and covers not more than seven or eight acres, including the bed of the stream. The defendants own and operate an extensive coke works, situated on the bank of the stream a little more than one mile above the plaintiff\u2019s farm, at which the slack is collected from several coal mines in the region, and used for making coke. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants habitually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>put the ashes from their ovens and their refuse slate and slack into the stream, using it as a dumping ground, and depending on the current and the floods to carry it away. By this means the water is polluted, and rendered unfit for use; the channel is choked up, the water is crowded out of its original bed, and the flat cut up and covered with a deposit of ashes, slate, and refuse from the coke works, so that it is unfit for cultivation. For the injury thus sustained, as the result of the unlawful use made of the stream by the defendants, the plaintiff seeks to recover in this action. The defendants reply that the pollution of the stream began before their works were erected, as the result of mining operations on Brush creek and its tributaries, which were in progress more than twenty years before this suit was brought. They say that their own works were erected in 1871, and have been in operation since that time without objection or complaint until now; that the condition of the stream and the plaintiff\u2019s land has undergone no material change for many years, and if their present condition is to any extent chargeable to the acts of defendants or their employees, no recovery can be had in this case except for injury done within six years before suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The questions thus presented to the jury were, in the first place: What was the condition of the stream and the plaintiff\u2019s flat land six years before the writ was issued? Was the water then polluted? Was the channel choked with refuse and the flat cut by the water, and covered with the deposit complained of ? Having ascertained what the situation then was, they were next to inquire whether the situation had been made worse during the six years. If so, in what respect, and to what extent ? In this way they would be able to reach a correct conclusion as to the extent of the injury done the plaintiff, for which he could recover in this action. The method adopted on the trial was quite different. The plaintiff &gt;vas permitted to show, and the jury was instructed to consider, what the plaintiff\u2019s farm would be worth as a whole, including the buildings and improvements, with the creek and the flat land in the original condition as it was before the work of pollution began, and what it was now worth, with the stream and the flat in their present condition; so that the difference between these estimates became the measure of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>We held in Robb v. Carnegie, supra, that this mode of estimating damages, which is properly applicable to cases where an entry is made under the power of eminent domain, is not ordinarily applicable to actions of trespass. It is not necessary to repeat the reasons which were given in support of that conclusion. It is enough to say that we adhere to them. In case of a taking, the natural inquiry is, how is that which is left affected by the taking? Where nothing is taken, but an injurious trespass is alleged, the question is, what will be the cost of restoring the thing injured to its former condition ? If the cost of restoration will equal or exceed the value of the thing' injured, then the value becomes the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages. But there is still another reason why the measure of damages adopted in the court below was inapplicable to this ease. The defendants had pleaded the statute of limitations, and the inquiry was thereby limited to six years. The comparison which the testimony placed before the jury carried them back to a time when the stream was not polluted, and the slate and slack had not been deposited on the plaintiff\u2019s land. It brought to their notice, not the injury done in six years, but the changes made from the beginning of operations on Brush creek, which was nearly or quite a quarter of a century before the trial. While the learned judge told the jury that the plaintiff could not recover for an injury sustained more than six years before his action was begun, he permitted testimony to be given which brought the entire change in the situation of the plaintiff\u2019s flat land to their attention, and which contrasted its value, if in its original condition, with its value in its present condition. This evidence was admitted after objection, and for the purpose of providing the jury with a measure of damages in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The seventh assignment of error is also sustained. The witness had put a value upon the plaintiff\u2019s farm. The defendants had a right to test his knowledge and his fairness as a witness, upon cross-examination. For this purpose it was proper to ask him if he did not know of sales of farm lands in the same vicinity, at a much less price than he had put upon the farm of the plaintiff. If he did know of such sales, but disregarded them in fixing the price of the plaintiff\u2019s land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that circumstance was calculated to affect his credibility, unless it was explained to the satisfaction of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The judgment is reversed, and a venire facias de novo is awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
