L. 194, for the year ending the first Monday of November, 1887, the company filed an appeal and specifications of objections. Afterward, to No. 227 January Term 1889, from a like settlement made for said tax for the year ending the first Monday of November, 1888, an appeal and specifications of objections were filed, also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Said causes having been heard together on a submission to the court, without a jury, under the act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, the court, Simonton, P. J., on May 1, 1890, filed to No. 58 March Term 1888, the following decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-4\">FINDINGS OF FACT.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">1. Defendant is a Pennsylvania corporation; and for the year ending the first Monday of November, 1887, the nominal value of its total bonded indebtedness was $182,000, and it is charged in the settlement appealed from, with tax on this amount less treasurer\u2019s'commission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">2. The following is a copy of the report of the indebtedness of defendant, made by its treasurer November 18, 1887:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">\u201cPhiladelphia, November 16,1887.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0T\">To the Auditor General of Pennsylvania:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-8\">In accordance with the provisions of the fourth section of the act of June 80,1885, and the requirements of your department, as treasurer of the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company I make the following report of the indebtedness of said company for the year ending first Monday of November, 1887:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-9\">Nominal value of all scrip, bonds and evidences of indebtedness . . . $182,000.00</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-10\">Nominal value of all scrip, bonds and evidences of indebtedness held by non-residents of Pennsylvania ..... Unknown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-11\">Nominal value of all scrip, bonds and evidences of indebtedness held by residents of Pennsylvania......Unknown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-12\">Treasurer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-13\">3. This report was accompanied by a protest and statement, that for the reasons set forth therein, the treasurer \u201c has not assessed said indebtedness nor retained any tax.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-14\">4. The treasurer of defendant did not, before making said report, make any effort to learn what amount of said indebtedness, if any, was held by non-residents of Pennsylvania, although, by proper effort, he could in many instances have so learned; nor did he deduct any tax or amount from the interest due on any part of said indebtedness. The funds for the payment of the coupons thereof were deposited by defendant in the South<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>wark National Bank of Philadelphia, and the coupons which were the evidences of the interest due, were paid by said bank upon their presentation; and it was not instructed to make any inquiries, or to endeavor to ascertain from the persons presenting said coupons for payment, or in any other way, whether the owners and holders of the bonds from which said coupons were detached, were residents or non-residents of Pennsylvania. If such inquiry and efforts had been made, the residences of such owners and holders could, in many instances, have been ascertained. The whole amount of interest due upon said coupons was paid without any deduction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-4\">5. After the report upon which the settlement appealed from is based was made, it was ascertained by the defendant and proved on the trial, and we therefore find, that the fifteen thousand dollars of said indebtedness was, during the period included in said settlement, owned and held by Pennsylvania corporations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel contends that, on these facts, defendant is not liable to any tax, because it does not sufficiently appear that any of its indebtedness is due to or held by residents of Pennsylvania. We are unable to assent to this proposition. The treasurer is required by \u00a7 4 of the act of 1885, P. L. 194, to report, on oath, the amount of indebtedness of the corporation owned by residents of Pennsylvania, \u201c as nearly as the same can be ascertained,\u201d \u201c to assess the tax on the nominal value of each and every evidence of debt,\u201d and to deduct the tax from the interest paid thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">It has been so repeatedly held that the legislature has the right to impose these duties upon corporations or their officers, and to hold the corporations liable for omission or neglect to perform them, that we need not discuss the question : Commonwealth v. Canal Co., 128 Pa. 618, and the eases there cited. This being so, and the treasurer having refused or neglected to perform the duties, we think the burden of proof is upon the defendant, and as it is not shown that any of the evidences of indebtedness are held by non-residents, we must assume that they are all held by residents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">We have grave doubts whether there is any specification of objection in the appeal, which raises the question of the burden of proof, or of non-liability to tax because of non-residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>of the holders of the evidence of indebtedness, but if there be, the result will not be changed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">We, therefore, reach the following</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">1. Defendant having failed to report or to prove that any part of its indebtedness is due to, or any of the evidences of such indebtedness are held by non-residents of Pennsylvania, it is liable to tax upon the whole amount of its indebtedness for the year embraced in the settlement appealed from, except upon the amount of fifteen thousand dollars held and owned by Pennsylvania corporations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">2. On the authority of Commonwealth v. Canal Co., 128 Pa. 594, and Commonwealth v. Chester City, 123 Pa. 626, all the specifications of objections contained in the appeal, except that relating to indebtedness held and owned by Pennsylvania corporations, are overruled, and judgment is directed to be entered against defendant as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-10\">********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-11\">Total.......$629.50</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-12\">for which amount judgment is directed to be entered, if exceptions be not filed within the time limited by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-13\">\u2014Judgment was also entered for the Commonwealth in No. 227 January Term 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-14\">Exceptions to the decisions filed by the defendant having been argued, the court, Simonton, P. J., on June 7,1890, overruled the same and directed judgmentsto.be entered as ordered in the decisions filed. Thereupon, the defendant took these appeals, specifying that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-15\">1. In finding that the corporation had made no effort to discover who were the owners of the bonds claimed to be exempt, as held by persons whose names and places of residence are unknown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-16\">2. In finding that the corporation could in many instances have ascertained the residences of such owners and holders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-17\">3. In finding that a tax was due on those bonds, as to which the corporation claimed that it .had made all possible inquiries as to the residences of the owners, and had failed to discover the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-18\">4. In entering judgment for the commonwealth for a tax on all the bonds of the corporation, except those shown by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>corporation affirmatively to be owned by Pennsylvania corporations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">5.
