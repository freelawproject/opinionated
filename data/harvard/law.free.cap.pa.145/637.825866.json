Ct.; court below, No. 13 December Term 1889, O. C.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-13\">On October 31, 1889, George H. Wingert, executor of the will of George M. Kurtz, deceased, filed his account, and on confirmation thereof it was referred to <em>Mr. Henrg 0. </em>Campbell, as auditor, for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b657-14\">On May 1,. 1890, the auditor filed a report finding'as facts that the testator died on July 28,1881, leaving to survive him a widow, Salome Kurtz, and three minor children of whom she was the mother, to wit, Theodore M., Yiola C. and Joseph L. Kurtz. An illegitimate son named Daniel Kurtz also survived him. As members of his family at the time of the testator\u2019s death, there were two children of his wife, George H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>and Anna M., the issue of a former marriage with one Korb. These children were taken into the family of the testator within a few months after his marriage with' their mother in 1867, and thereafter they were both called by the name Kurtz, until Anna M. was married to one Rinn, whose name she bore thenceforward. There was testimony that the testator, his wife, and the five children formed one family, without distinction between the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-5\">The will of the testator, dated January 28, 1880, duly admitted to probate August 8, 1881, was written in German, a translation thereof filed with the register of wills being in its material parts as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-6\">\u201c This is now my will and testament between my wife and children, to be divided equally till each shall arrive at full age of maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-7\">\u201c 1. My personal effects are all in bonds and notes loaned out, county and school bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-8\">\u201c 2. Those two children, George H. Korb and Anna Maria Korb, which came to me by marriage with my wife, I will to each of them fifteen hundred dollars when they are of age and as guardian my name keep.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-9\">\u201c 8. Theodore Morris Kurtz is to have the place and homestead, and besides one thousand dollars he is to have if he is of age, but he must keep his mother as a mother, and keep her on the place and support her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\">\u201c 4. Yiola Catharina Kurtz is to have four thousand dollars, as soon as she is of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-11\">\u201c5. Joseph Lindsey Kurtz is to have the same, four thousand dollars, when he is of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-12\">\u201c 6. I will to Daniel Kurtz six hundred dollars when he is of full age, but I mention herewith that Daniel Kurtz from the second division shall have nothing if he is not satisfied with what I have willed to him, and shall be pronounced null; then in case Daniel Kurtz should die before he arrives at age it falls back to Kurtz\u2019s children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-13\">\u201c 7. I will to my wife Saloma Kurtz two thousand dollars. She shall stay on the homestead as long as she lives. She shall have from the second-division as much as one of the children if she keeps my name, but should she get married she shall have nothing of the second division.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The auditor found that the pecuniary legacies had all been paid ; and, citing Merkel\u2019s App., 109 Pa. 235 ; Castner\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 478, ruled that George H. Kurtz and Anna M. Rinn were not entitled to participate in the fund for distribution, and that it should be awarded to Theodore M., Viola C. and Joseph L. Kurtz, in equal shares, reporting a distribution accordingly. Exceptions to the report filed by George H. Kurtz and Anna M. Rinn having been argued, the court, Wilson, P. J., without opinion filed, on January 5, 1891, entered a decree dismissing the exceptions and confirming the report of the auditor. Thereupon, the exceptants took this appeal, specifying the dismissal of said exceptions and the confirming of the report, for error. . .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-5\"><em>Mr. J.

Kurtz, deceased, are entitled to share in the distribution of the residuary portion of his estate. Both the appellants are given legacies by the will, and are designated as children \u201c which came to me by marriage with my wife; \u201d the \u201c second division,\u201d as testator calls it, is to go to his wife and children. He left children of his o wn which answer this description, and we think the learned auditor was right in excluding the step-children from participation in the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
