Delo, letters testamentary were duly issued by the register for the said county of Clarion to the said John C. Shields, on the twenty-third day of April, 1889.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">\u201c On the twenty-fifth day of April, 1881, the said George P. Delo, the testator, and Martha his wife, by deed of general warranty conveyed to the said D. M. Delo, his heirs and assigns, in fee-simple, by metes and bounds, a certain piece or parcel of land situate in the township of Salem, county and state aforesaid, together with'all and singular the buildings, improvements, ways, water-courses, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments, and appurtenances whatsoever thereunto belonging, etc., to have and to hold the same unto the said D.

Delo, give him the one fourth of all grain in the bushel, the one fourth of the hay in the barn, produced on the premises, deeded by the said George P. Delo to the said D. M. Delo, by deed bearing even date herewith; also, one fourth of the fruit produced from the trees growing on the premises, and permit the said George P. Delo the one fourth of the pasture if he desires it; also, the said George P. Delo to have the privilege of operating his oil wells on the premises without let or hinderance from the said D. M.

Delo, deceased, entered judgment for the plaintiff for $643, with interest from February 21, 1890, and costs of suit; whereupon the defendant took this appeal, specifying the entry of such judgment for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-7\"><em>Mr. W.

Corbett </em>(with him <em>Mr. Don C. </em>Corbett), for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-8\">The deed and bond upon which this controversy arises must be construed together as one instrument: Cummings v. Antes, 19 Pa. 287; and the language of the deed was sufficient to pass the rigs, machinery, etc., in controversy, to D. M. Delo: Waugh v. Waugh, 84 Pa. 356. The plaintiff\u2019s right, therefore, necessarily depends upon the effect of the condition in the bond, the object of which was to secure to George P. Delo certain provisions as a means of support in his old age. The removal of the machinery was to be made by him at his \u201c own pleasure,\u201d and evidently was intended to be done by him personally, in case the wells became exhausted. The right to do this was purely a personal right, which terminated at his death. It is clear the parties never intended, if-the wells were still producing at the grantor\u2019s death, that the machinery should then be detached and taken away by the executor. Even if the true construction of the papers is that a tenancy for life was reserved, the personal representatives would have no right to remove fixtures after its termination: White v. Arndt, 1 Wh. 91.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b416-9\"><em>Mr. W. A. </em>Hindman, for the appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-10\">The agreement that George P. Delo might, at any time, at his own pleasure remove the buildings and machinery at the wells, worked a conversion of said property into personalty, and severed it from the freehold. It became the personal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>perty of George P. Delo. The form of the language used, and the difference in the provisions respecting the products of the farm, and those relative to the buildings and machinery at the wells, show that this was the intent of the parties. Fixtures belonging to a tenant for life pass to his executors as assets: 8 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law, 54; and may be removed within a reasonable time after his death: Idem, 52; Hind\u2019s Est., 5 Wh. 138, virtually overruling White v. Arndt, 1 Wh. 91, cited by appellant; Lawton v.

Justice Gbeen:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The deed from George P. Delo, the plaintiff\u2019s testator, to D. M. Delo, the defendant, is an absolute deed in fee-simple, and passed to the grantee every possible interest of the grantor in the land, and all its buildings, improvements, and appurtenances. No estate whatever in the premises granted remained in the grantor. Had there been nothing more in the transaction than the deed, it cannot be questioned for a moment that the machinery and fixtures in and about the oil wells which were in operation at the time the deed was made, would have passed with the title. Neither argument nor authority is needed in support of this proposition. There was, however, another paper bearing the same date as the deed, and which must be regarded as a part of the transaction. It was a bond .executed by D. M. Delo for the payment to George P. Delo of four thousand three hundred dollars as mentioned in a certain condition annexed. This condition required that the money should be paid in four equal annual sums, beginning one year after the death of George P. Delo, and in the meantime, during his life, the said D. M. Delo was to give to George P. Delo one fourth of the hay in the barn, produced on the premises, one fourth of the fruit produced from the trees growing on the premises, and one fourth of the pasture, if he desired it. The condition concluded as follows: \u201c Also the said George P. Delo to have the privilege of operating his oil wells on the premises without let or hindrance from the said D. M. Delo, and the said George P. Delo may, at any time, at his own pleasure remove any build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ings and the.machinery of the said wells; without any fraud or further delay, then this obligation to be void, or otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It will be observed that whatever rights George P. Delo held, as against D. M. Delo, were under and by virtue of the bond. This was the personal obligation of D. M. Delo. Nothing was reserved or excepted out of the deed. The bond required that D. M. Delo should give the money stipulated, give the proportions of hay, fruit, and pasture specified in the bond, and should also permit George P. Delo to operate the oil wells for his own account, and to remove, at his pleasure, any buildings and the machinery at the wells. Prom six of the wells George P. Delo did remove the machinery during his life, and the other three were in operation at his death. The machinery at these wells remained and was essential to their operation. The wells and their machinery were a part of the realty. Unless a right to remove the machinery after the death of George P. Delo was vested in somebody, it must continue to remain. No such right was reserved to the executors or administrators of George P. Delo, or to his heirs, or to his assigns. The privilege to remove was purely personal to George P. Delo, and died with his person. There is no analogy to the case of fixtures erected on leased premises by a tenant or by the owner of a life-estate. George P. Delo never was a tenant, either for years or life. He was the owner of the land at the time he operated the wells and up to the time of the grant, and he put in the machinery and fixtures as owner, and not as tenant in airy sense. That being the case, they passed by the grant of the land, and the only right he held after the grant was under the personal obligation of the grantee. That right was limited to the period of his own life simply, because it could not be exercised thereafter, and it did not extend to any other persons after his death. Of course, no other person than George P. Delo could claim the one fourth of the hay, fruit, and pasture, either during his life or after, and nothing can be clearer than that that right died with his person. The right to remove the machinery has no higher or other origin than the right to take the hay, fruit, and pasture.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We are clearly of opinion that the right to the machinery at the wells passed with the deed to D. M. Delo, and was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ject only to the right of removal by George P. Delo during his life. That right not having been exercised as to the machinery at the three wells which were in operation at the death of George P. Delo, that machinery belongs to D. M. Delo under his deed. There was no severance of the machinery from the freehold during the life of George P. Delo, and hence it cannot be claimed by his executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The judgment of the court below is reversed; and judgment is now entered on the ease stated for the defendant, with costs, including costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
