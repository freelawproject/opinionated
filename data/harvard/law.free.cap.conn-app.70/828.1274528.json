On appeal, the defendant claims that the court (1) deprived him of his federal and state constitutional rights to cross-examine and confront witnesses in denying his request to conduct an in camera inspection of a witness\u2019 psychiatric records and (2) improperly found that he violated a condition of his probation on the basis of allegations that were not contained in the violation of probation warrant in derogation of his due process rights. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On January 28, 1998, the trial court sentenced the defendant to seven years incarceration, execution suspended, with four years of probation, following the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to the crime of possession of a narcotic substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21-279 (a). As conditions of his probation, the defendant agreed, in pertinent part, not to violate any criminal laws, to report to his probation officer as directed, to permit his probation officer to visit him when needed and to keep the probation officer informed of his whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">Over two years later, during the afternoon of May 30, 2000, a woman, while driving a vehicle and looking visibly upset, motioned for Officer Karen Roberts of the New Haven police department, who was driving behind her in a marked police vehicle, to pull over to the side of the road. The woman, who identified herself as Passion Harris, told Roberts that the defendant, her boyfriend and the father of her two children, had hit her a few moments earlier. Roberts noticed that Harris\u2019 neck was discolored and that her shirt was tom. Harris elaborated that she was sitting in her car about to pull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>out of a driveway when the defendant grabbed the steering wheel. As she drove away, Harris claimed that the defendant continued to hold onto the steering wheel, punched her and ripped her shirt. Harris then lost control of the car and drove into a parked car.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Roberts went to 233 Howard Street in New Haven, where the incident occurred, and observed the damaged parked car. She also observed the damage to Harris\u2019 vehicle. Harris later explained to another police officer, Joe Dease, that the defendant attempted to choke her. Dease also observed red marks on Harris\u2019 neck. Two other New Haven police officers, including Dease, found the defendant that afternoon. The defendant was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in the first degree and assault in the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The defendant\u2019s probation officer, Brenda Westberry, subsequently prepared a violation of probation warrant. In the warrant, Westberry alleged that she had notified the defendant to report to her office on May 2, 2000, and on May 30, 2000, and that the defendant had failed to appear on both occasions. The warrant further described the incident with Harris and stated that the defendant \u201cis considered to be in violation of his probation based on his noncompliance with the following: \u2018Do not violate any law.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">A probation revocation hearing ensued. The trial court found that the defendant had violated his probation by failing to report to his probation officer on May 2 and May 30,2000, and by violating the law with respect to the altercation with Harris. The trial court committed the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a period of four years. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The defendant first claims that the court deprived him of his constitutional right to confront and cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>examine witnesses when it denied his request to conduct an in camera inspection of Harris\u2019 psychiatric records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this issue. Prior to the hearing, defense counsel obtained a letter written by Harris to the defendant detailing that she suffered from mental illness. Defense counsel also came into possession of a letter from Catholic Family Services stating that Harris receives treatment for depression. During the hearing, but before the state called Harris as a witness, defense counsel sought a continuance of the trial until he could obtain Harris\u2019 psychiatric records and further requested that the trial court conduct an in camera inspection of those psychiatric records. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">During direct examination, Harris acknowledged that she took medication for her mental illness. Harris further testified that the medications helped to \u201cclarify things and [make] things calmer,\u201d but that they did not interfere with her ability to testify truthfully. Harris also stated that she would not consent to an inspection of her mental health records.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The defendant introduced into evidence during cross-examination a letter written by Harris to him and also a document prepared by a therapist at Catholic Family Services. In the letter, Harris wrote that she attended counseling and that she might be \u201ccrazy.\u201d The document prepared by a social worker at Catholic Family Services provided that Harris sought treatment for and suffered from \u201cmajor depressive disorder,\u201d and that bipolar disorder was \u201crule[d] out.\u201d The defendant proceeded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>question Harris about her mental illness and the treatment she had sought. Harris admitted that she had anger management problems and that she had not taken her medication on May 30, the date of the incident with the defendant. Harris further testified that when she did not take her medication, she sometimes became angry and might yell, scream and lie. Moreover, Harris stated that a physician at the Hospital of Saint Raphael had told her that she might have schizophrenia, but that he never followed through with any tests or definite diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">At the conclusion of his cross-examination of Harris, the defendant renewed his motion for the trial court to conduct an in camera inspection of Harris\u2019 mental health psychiatric records on the ground that they might contain information related to Harris\u2019 ability to tell the truth and to perceive the events of May 30, 2000, accurately. Particularly, the defendant argued that the in camera review could reveal the effect of the medication on Harris\u2019 ability to tell the truth. In response, the state contended that Harris had been completely forthcoming with defense counsel, had answered all of his questions and that \u201c[t]his is a specific attempt to circumvent her testimony and have it stricken, because when those records come in, Your Honor, she is not going to agree to your doing an in camera inspection . . . .\u201d The trial court then ordered briefs on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs, the court denied the defendant\u2019s request for an in camera inspection of Harris\u2019 mental health records. In denying the request, the court stated that it found Harris\u2019 \u201ctestimony to be lucid; I found her testimony to have \u2014 to consist of very few inconsistencies with . . . the observations made by the initial police officer; her observations of the victim at the time; her observations of the damage to the victim\u2019s car, as well as to the other car at the alleged scene of this event; her observations as to the red marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>around the neck, which were not testified to by the victim, but the victim did explain how those red marks most likely took place .... I am also aware of Ms. Harris\u2019 potential conflict in this matter. I\u2019m aware that she has a child by the defendant, if not two children. . . . Based on her testimony, it\u2019s obvious that there has been a long-standing relationship .... She indicated on the record that she has gone to a number of hospitals . . . that she has had a number of . . . theoretical diagnoses . . . that she was supposed to take medication, that during this time she did not take medication, and that when she doesn\u2019t take medication she\u2019s prone to anger and that, on occasion, she lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">\u201cI find, however, that her testimony being corroborated, as it is, not only by officers at the scene but by the admissions that the defendant himself gave to the police officers. I am impressed most of all by the amount of corroboration independent of her testimony that exists .... There is no indication, in my mind, that her ability to recollect the facts of this occasion accurately has been affected in any way by any theoretical medical illness.\u201d The trial court further noted that the letter from Catholic Family Services, which the defendant entered into evidence, revealed that Harris has \u201cissues with depression, mood swings, anxiety and anger. . . . That, to me, does not translate into someone who cannot accurately depict the events of this occasion. In short, I feel the defense has failed to meet the threshold. ... I am singularly impressed with the lack of inconsistencies. . . . I\u2019m not going to review [the records] at this time unless Ms. Harris wishes me to review them but that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the ruling of this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request to conduct an in camera inspection of Harris\u2019 psychiatric records deprived him of his constitutional right of confrontation because Harris\u2019 \u201cability to observe the events of May 30, 2000, and whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>not she had fabricated the allegations\u201d was central to this case. We are not persuaded and conclude that the trial court properly ruled that the defendant had not made the required preliminary showing to warrant an in camera inspection of mental health records.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201cThe trial court is vested, in the first instance, with the responsibility of resolving the inherent tension between the broad privilege that our state law affords to a witness concerning the confidentiality of his or her psychiatric communications and records, including those pertaining to the diagnosis, prognosis or treatment for alcohol abuse or alcoholism; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7\u00a7 17-155bb (b) (recodified at General Statutes \u00a7 17a-630 [c]), 52-146d, 52-146e; and a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the [fact finder] facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility. . . . The defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination does not allow him to discredit and impeach in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish. . . . Before a defendant may have access to privileged records that he believes contain information that would allow him to impeach a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, [he] must make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 478, 625 A.2d 791 (1993). \u201cIf in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera. A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 457, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992). We review the trial court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>that the defendant failed to meet his preliminary showing and its subsequent refusal to conduct an in camera inspection under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>204 Conn. 654, 663, 529 A.2d 1236 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">We note at the outset that a history of mental illness does not automatically impugn a witness\u2019 ability to testify truthfully and to relay events accurately. Moreover, the existence of a psychiatric disorder does not \u201cautomatically [make] a witness fair game for disclosure of psychiatric records to a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>supra, 225 Conn. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">During cross-examination, Harris testified at length about her mental illness, the treatment sought and the effect that the medication had on her behavior. The trial court granted the defendant complete latitude to question Harris about these topics, particularly regarding her veracity and anger management issues when not taking the medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Significantly, and central to the trial court\u2019s determination here, Harris\u2019 allegations against the defendant were all corroborated by the observations made by the police officers involved in the case. The police officers noticed that Harris had red marks on her neck, that her shirt was tom and that her vehicle was damaged. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s own admission to police officers that he engaged in a physical altercation with Harris also substantiated Harris\u2019 version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">In addition, the trial court noted, and we agree, that the document from Catholic Family Services that the defendant presented as exhibit D indicated that Harris \u201chas issues with depression, mood swings, anxiety and anger,\u201d but that \u201cdoes not translate into someone who cannot accurately depict the events of this occasion.\u201d While the defendant thoroughly questioned Harris, he neither subpoenaed Harris\u2019 counselor at Catholic Family Services, whose identity was known to him, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>offered any other medical or other testimony to establish a connection between Harris\u2019 depression and her reliability as a witness. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We, therefore, conclude that the court properly refused to conduct the requested in camera inspection of Harris\u2019 mental health records. On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the defendant has failed to make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce those records likely impaired his right to impeach the witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The defendant next claims that court improperly found that his failure to report to his probation officer constituted a violation of a condition of his probation because he lacked sufficient notice that his failure to report formed a basis of his probation revocation hearing. Specifically, the defendant claims that the violation of probation arrest warrant did not provide adequate notice that his failure to report to his probation officer formed one of the grounds for his probation revocation hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The following additional facts are pertinent to this issue. In the defendant\u2019s violation of probation arrest warrant, it was alleged that, after receiving notice to . appear on both May 2 and May 30, 2000, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>failed to report to his probation officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the warrant provided that as a result of the altercation with Harris on May 30, 2000, the defendant was arrested for assault in the third degree and reckless endangerment in the first degree. Accordingly, the warrant stated that the defendant \u201cis considered to be in violation of his probation based on his noncompliance with the following: \u2018Do not violate any law.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">At the commencement of the hearing, the defendant argued that he lacked notice that his failure to appear on May 2 and May 30, 2000, formed one of the grounds for the potential revocation of his probation. Specifically, the defendant contended that because the warrant provided that he is considered to be in violation of his probation due to his noncompliance with the proscription against violating any law, he was unaware that his failure to appear formed the basis of the proceedings as well. The trial court replied that the warrant provided sufficient notice to the defendant in that it explicitly enumerated his failure to report to his probation officer on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">In announcing its finding that the defendant violated conditions of his probation, the court stated: \u201c[The defendant] was not to violate any law; he was to report to his probation officer. And I consider those two issues to be the subject of this violation. Now, I know the defense claims otherwise, or at least has during the course of the hearing, that because of the wording \u2018Do not violate any law,\u2019 I should only consider whether or not there was some kind of altercation between Ms. Harris and the defendant. I indicated before, and I\u2019ll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>indicate again, I think the defendant is on fair notice in that it is also alleged in the warrant that he failed on two occasions to report to his probation officer. So I think that merely because of the words \u2018do not violate any law,\u2019 I think the \u2014 the substance of the arrest warrant application rules here and there is clearly more than one violation; there\u2019s actually, technically, I suppose, three violations. I find that the \u2014 to a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has violated the terms of his probation\u201d on all three grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">We note at the outset that the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s conclusion that his actions toward Harris constituted a violation of the condition of his probation that he not violate any law. Therefore, because the defendant does not contest the court\u2019s finding that he violated his probation by committing a crime, it is unnecessary to address the defendant\u2019s argument that he was not afforded adequate notice that he faced probation revocation on the alternative ground of his failure to report. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>57 Conn. App. 64, 71, 747 A.2d 21, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 909, 753 A.2d 942 (2000). We will, nonetheless, take this opportunity to resolve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u201cIn <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that the minimum requirements of due process include \u2018(a) written notice of the claimed violations of [probation] ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>42 Conn. App. 768, 781, 682 A.2d 521 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 243 Conn. 339, 703 A.2d 109 (1997). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a) further provides in relevant part: \u201cAt such [probation violation] hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which such defendant is alleged to have violated the conditions of such defendant\u2019s probation or conditional discharge . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The defendant claims that the statement contained in the warrant that \u201cthe offender is considered to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>in violation of his probation based on his noncompliance with the following: \u2018Do not violate any law,\u2019 \u201d did not sufficiently notify him that his failure to report also formed a basis for the revocation of his probation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">A thorough review of the record reveals that the defendant possessed sufficient notice that his probation revocation hearing was based on both his noncompliance with the provision that he \u201cnot violate any law\u201d and his failure to report to his probation officer on May 2 and May 30, 2000. The violation of probation arrest warrant set forth at the outset the various conditions of his probation to which the defendant agreed to adhere to, including that he should not violate any law and that he must report as his probation officer directs. Moreover, in addition to detailing the incident involving Harris, the arrest warrant explicitly described the occasions when the defendant was directed to report to his probation officer and subsequently failed to appear. The defendant did not request a bill of particulars to clarify the basis of the probation revocation proceeding. Moreover, at the commencement of the hearing, the state read into the record the arrest warrant and stated that it was proceeding on the grounds that the defendant failed to report to his probation officer and violated the law based on the incident with Harris. In fact, during the hearing the defendant\u2019s probation officer testified regarding the defendant\u2019s failure to report on May 2 and May 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Under those circumstances, we conclude that the defendant received adequate notice regarding all of the grounds on which he was ultimately found to have violated his probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>64 Conn. App. 208, 214-15, 779 A.2d 233 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Repetti, </em>60 Conn. App. 614, 617-18, 760 A.2d 964, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 923, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000). When we read the warrant in its entirety, and not in isolated parts, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>clear that the defendant was on notice that his failure to report to his probation officer was part of the basis for the probation revocation proceeding. Further, the hearing was based solely on the allegations contained in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-9\"> The defendant asserts his rights under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. Because the defendant did not separately address his state constitutional claim, we resolve this issue only on federal constitutional grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\"> In so concluding, we mention the state\u2019s concern that, given Harris\u2019 relationship with the defendant and the fact that the defendant is the father of Harris\u2019 children, Harris would have used the issue of the in camera inspection as a means to \u201ccircumvent testifying in this case.\u201d Had the trial court permitted an in camera review of Harris\u2019 records, Harris stated that she would have refused to consent to the inspection, thereby resulting in the striking of the testimony of this principal witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b856-11\"> The defendantphrases this argument as being that the trial court \u201cimproperly found that he violated the terms of his probation because the basis for finding him in violation was beyond the four comers of the arrest warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b857-8\"> The warrant additionally detailed several prior occasions when the defendant failed to report to his probation officer and neglected to inform the probation officer of his address. In fact, on September 14,1998, the defendant was arrested for violation of probation based on his failure to report and, on November 8, 1999, was found in violation of his probation. The trial court, however, did not revoke the defendant\u2019s probation at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
