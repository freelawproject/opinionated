We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiffs appeal. The underlying event in this case involved the plaintiff and A.P.L. Auto Consulting, Inc., also known as Discount Auto Sales, a used automobile dealer (dealer). In 1995, the plaintiff purchased a motor vehicle from the dealer. Over protest by the plaintiff, in 1997, the dealer repossessed the vehicle. As a result of the repossession, the plaintiff filed an action against the dealer, alleging, in pertinent part, breach of contract and unfair trade practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The plaintiff demanded statutory, actual, punitive and treble damages. The court rendered a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff after the dealer failed to appear and awarded damages in the amount of $20,286.40 plus costs of $280.60. The award included punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Subsequently, the dealer went out of business and failed to pay the judgment. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-52, however, the dealer had obtained a surety bond for $20,000, which was issued by Western Surety. After the expiration of the 180 day waiting period of General Statutes \u00a7 52-400e,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the commissioner invoked the surety bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>on the plaintiffs behalf. The commissioner noted the court\u2019s prior award of damages, but found that the plaintiff suffered actual damages of $5650, an amount consisting of her down payment, financing payment and costs. The commissioner then concluded that the balance of the court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages was not \u201crecoverable under the subject bond,\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 14-52, and thus ordered Western Surety to pay $5650 to the state of Connecticut for the benefit of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration, which the commissioner denied. The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. In affirming the decision of the commissioner, the court concluded that \u00a7 14-52, the surety bond requirement statute, precludes an award of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The plaintiff first contends that the court\u2019s award of damages of $20,286.40 constituted a final judgment, and, therefore, the doctrine of res judicata barred the commissioner from disturbing that award and finding the surety liable for only $5650. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">\u201cThe doctrine of res judicata holds that an existing final judgment rendered upon the merits without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of causes of action and of facts or issues thereby litigated as to the parties and their privies in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent jurisdiction. ... If the same cause of action is again sued on, the judgment is a bar with respect to any claims relating to the cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>which were actually made or which might have been made. . . . The applicability of res judicata raises a question of law that is subject to our plenary review. . . . We therefore must determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision is legally and logically correct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Richards </em>v. Richards, 67 Conn. App. 381, 383, 786 A.2d 1247 (2001). \u201cIt is axiomatic that in applying the doctrine of res judicata we remain cognizant that [t]he scope of matters precluded necessarily depends on what has occurred in the former adjudication.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">We conclude that the doctrine of res judicata did not bar the commissioner\u2019s, and subsequently the court\u2019s, determination in the present case. The issues before the court that rendered judgment against the dealer greatly differed from those before the commissioner and the court in the subsequent action. In the action against the dealer, the court was faced with a controversy solely between the dealer and the plaintiff after the dealer wrongfully had repossessed the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The issue regarding the extent of the liability of Western Surety pursuant to the surety bond provision was not before the court in the prior action against the dealer. In fact, it was not until after the judgment was rendered against the dealer that the dealer went out of business, thereby implicating Western Surety in the situation. Moreover, the issues before the commissioner, and subsequently before the court on appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision, consisted of whether the dealer\u2019s actions triggered the surety bond provision, and Western Surety\u2019s liability, pursuant to \u00a7 14-52. The determinations of the commissioner and the court solely referred to Western Surety\u2019s liability and did not disturb the prior judgment regarding the dealer\u2019s liability for wrongful repossession.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner\u2019s decision holding Western Surety liable for an amount of $5650 pursuant to the surety bond was not precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We now address the plaintiffs primary claim that this court should set aside the judgment of the trial court because, pursuant to \u00a7 14-52, she was entitled to recover punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees from Western Surety. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the phrase contained in \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4) that the surety bond will be \u201cprovided as indemnity for <em>any loss sustained </em>by any person by reason of any acts of the licensee constituting grounds for suspension or revocation of the license or such licensee going out of business,\u201d necessarily includes punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the plaintiff argues, the court improperly concluded, as a matter of law, that \u00a7 14-52 precludes an award of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">In this case, because the surety bond itself is not part of the record, nor do the parties invoke its terms, the dispositive issue to determine is whether \u00a7 14-52 confers on the plaintiff the right to recover punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. That issue is a matter of statutory interpretation, as well as an issue of first impression for this court, over which our review is plenary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Smith </em>v. Smith, 249 Conn. 265, 280, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Several well settled principles govern our interpretation of \u00a7 14-52. \u201cWhen we construe a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . Furthermore, [w]e presume that laws are enacted in view of existing relevant statutes . . . because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. . . . We construe each sentence, clause or phrase to have a purpose behind it. ... In addition, we presume that the legislature intends sensible results from the statutes it enacts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 357, 757 A.2d 549 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\u201cWhen the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretive guidance because we assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature. . . . When we are confronted, however, with ambiguity in a statute, we seek to ascertain the actual intent by looking to the words of the statute itself . . . the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute . . . and the purpose the statute is to serve. . . . We note also that [a] statute should not be interpreted in any way to thwart its purpose . . . and that [i]n construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts will assume that [the legislature intended to accomplish] a reasonable and rational result . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 666-67, 560 A.2d 975 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Before directly analyzing the issue, an explanation of basic principles governing suretyship law provides guidance. \u201c[T]he general purpose of a suretyship contract is to guard against loss in the event of the principal debtor\u2019s default. . . . [T]he obligation of a surety is an additional assurance to the one entitled to the performance of an act that the act will be performed. . . . [T]he liability of sureties is to be determined by the specified conditions of the bond .... [W]hen a bond is required by statute, a court will read the statute into the contract between the principal, surety and obligee.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>supra, 254 Conn. 358-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\u201cA legally mandated bond is a secondary obligation required by law, whether the obligee or beneficiary is a government, a class of persons to whom the principal obligor may owe an obligation, or a particular person. . . . When ... a legally mandated bond is deemed to contain terms set forth in the law that requires that it be provided, the legally mandated bond is treated as containing those terms. . . .\u201d Restatement (Third), Suretyship and Guaranty \u00a7 71 (1) and (2), pp. 284-85 (1996). General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 establishes legally mandated surety bonds for new and used motor vehicle dealers. As a condition for engaging in business, \u00a7 14-52 requires motor vehicle dealers to procure a surety bond in the amount of $20,000. General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 (b) (4) further provides in relevant part that those legally mandated bonds \u201cshall be conditioned upon the applicant or licensee [the motor vehicle dealer] complying with the provisions of any state or federal law or regulation relating to the conduct of such business and provide as indemnity for <em>any loss </em>sustained by any person by reason of any acts of the licensee constituting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>grounds for suspension or revocation of the license or such licensee going out of business . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">With those principles in mind, we turn to the dispositive issue at hand, namely, whether the phrase \u201cany loss\u201d encompasses punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. We find the term \u201cany loss\u201d to be both generalized and ambiguous, and susceptible on its face to several different interpretations. That ambiguity is demonstrated by Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary, which defines \u201cany\u201d as \u201cone, indifferently out of more than two . . . one, some, or all indiscriminately of whatever quantity.\u201d Moreover, the statute fails to define \u201cany loss.\u201d Accordingly, we turn to the legislative history behind \u00a7 14-52 to construe the meaning of \u201cany loss.\u201d Upon examination of the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the surety bond clause of \u00a7 14-52, as well as its relationship to other similar legislation, we hold that the legislature did not intend for the phrase \u201cany loss\u201d to encompass punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In 1984, the legislature amended \u00a7 14-52, through No. 84-508 of the 1984 Public Acts, to include a provision mandating that motor vehicle dealers obtain surety bonds. Prior to that amendment, when motor vehicle dealers went out of business, consumers often lacked any \u201cavenue for recovery.\u201d 27 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1984 Sess., p. 2709, remarks of Representative Christine M. Niedermeier. The legislative history surrounding the amendment demonstrates that the legislature added that provision to \u201cprovide <em>some </em>financial security to enable consumers to obtain reimbursement for <em>money owed to </em>them\u201d by defunct motor vehicle dealers. (Emphasis added.) Id. Debate in the Senate additionally reveals that the legislature enacted the amendment to protect consumers. See 27 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1984 Sess., pp. 3153-54, remarks of Senator William A. DiBella. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>legislative history again discloses that when the surety bond provision was further amended in 1993 in Public Acts 1993, No. 93-164, \u00a7 2, to increase the required amount of the bond posted, that those particular \u201csurety bonds were established to provide <em>some </em>recourse for victims of fraudulent practices by motor vehicle dealers and repairers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 36 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1993 Sess., pp. 3219-20, remarks of Senator Thomas A. Colapietro.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The specific use of the word <em>some </em>proves quite revealing and pertinent to our resolution of the issue. By utilizing the word <em>some, </em>our legislature clearly did not intend for those motor vehicle dealer surety bonds to compensate consumers for <em>all </em>losses suffered as a result of a motor vehicle dealer\u2019s actions. The word <em>some </em>demonstrates that the legislature intended to limit the recovery of consumers. The statements of the legislators disclose that the surety bonds were not provided to make consumers whole for all costs or losses associated with a defunct motor vehicle dealer, but rather were meant to provide \u201csome financial security.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 27 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2709.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Further, the legislature explicitly provided that the surety bonds were enacted to \u201cenable consumers to obtain reimbursement for <em>money owed to them.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. Again, the phrase \u201cmoney owed to them,\u201d demonstrates that the legislature intended to restrict recovery under the surety bonds. The statement that consumers were entitled to recover \u201cmoney owed\u201d refers to the amounts presently due and owing to consumers by defunct motor vehicle dealerships. It does not refer to, or include, any subsequent costs that may result.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">An award of punitive damages, \u201cfulfills the salutary purpose of <em>fully </em>compensating a victim for the harm inflicted . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Mansfield, </em>50 Conn. App. 21, 27, 717 A.2d 267, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 943, 723 A.2d 321 (1998). Here, as shown through the legislature\u2019s language, the legislative history clearly demonstrates that the surety bond provision was not enacted to wholly remunerate consumers. We therefore conclude that \u00a7 14-52 does not provide for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">With particular respect to attorney\u2019s fees, we note that Connecticut adheres to a basic principle regarding awards of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses related to litigation known as the \u201cAmerican rule.\u201d Under the American rule, \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a [specific] contractual or statutory exception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rizzo Pool Co. </em>v. <em>Del Grosso, </em>240 Conn. 58, 72, 689 A.2d 1097 (1997). As our Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[W]hen the General Assembly wanted to authorize the award of attorney\u2019s fees it knew how to do it.\u201d <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 593, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In other surety contexts, our legislature has enacted statutes that specifically include the award of attorney\u2019s fees. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 14-176 stipulates that where title to a motor vehicle is in question, the party seeking the title may be required to obtain a surety bond. General Statutes \u00a7 14-176 further provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he bond shall be in an amount equal to one and one-half times the value of the vehicle . . . and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner . . . and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle . . . against <em>any expense, loss or damage, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees . . . .\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The legislature\u2019s inclusion of attorney\u2019s fees in \u00a7 14-176 is dispositive of the issue here. \u201cWhere a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed. . . . That tenet of statutory construction is well grounded because [t]he General Assembly is always presumed to know all the existing statutes and the effect that its action or non-action will have upon any one of them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 717, 674 A.2d 845 (1996). The legislature\u2019s statement, in the context of \u00a7 14-176, that \u201cany loss\u201d includes attorney\u2019s fees, demonstrates that the legislature did not intend that \u201cany loss\u201d provided for in \u00a7 14-52, a similar statute, would encompass punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>236 Conn. 845, 861, 675 A.2d 835 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Moreover, the legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cany loss\u201d in enacting a statute is not unusual. In various other statutes, when our legislature has utilized the phrase \u201cany loss,\u201d it has further provided that the term \u201cany loss,\u201d \u201cinclude[s] reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d or punitive damages. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 42a-4A-211 (f) (liability to bank for \u201cany loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d incurred by bank as result of cancellation of payment order); General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (any person who suffers \u201cany ascertainable loss\u201d as result of violation of CUTPA entitled to award of actual and punitive damages, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees); General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-265s (b) and 8-286c (b) (\u201cguarantee shall secure the mortgagee up to the amount of the guarantee for <em>any loss </em>incurred by the mortgagee because of default of the mortgagor, including losses in principal balance, interest and fees and expenses due to foreclosure\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cBecause we must respect the legislative prerogative of choosing the special circumstances under which [attorney\u2019s fees] awards may be made . . . we require a clear expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>a statutory exception\u201d to the American rule. (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. Garnett, 231 Conn. 77, 94, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994). We cannot ascertain any such legislative intent here. Accordingly, we conclude that under \u00a7 14-52, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees in the calculation of \u201closs.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The plaintiff presents several arguments in support of her claim that \u201cany loss\u201d as contained in \u00a7 14-52 includes punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, which we find necessary to address. Citing <em>Levick </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>51 Conn. 461 (1884), and <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 472 A.2d 306 (1984), the plaintiff in her brief asserts that our Supreme Court \u201chas consistently mandated that a surety pay the type of treble or statutory damages at issue herein.\u201d The plaintiffs reliance on those cases is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Neither of the cases on which the plaintiff relies stands for the proposition that \u00a7 14-52 provides for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees, nor do they even invoke a statute similar to \u00a7 14-52. In <em>Levick </em>and <em>Gionfriddo, </em>unlike in the present situation, the statutes involved specifically permitted an award of treble dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ages. The appellants in those cases did not contest whether the statutes permitted punitive damages, but whether the particular actions at issue rendered them liable at all under the applicable statute in the first place. Here, in contrast to <em>Levick </em>and <em>Gionfriddo, </em>the parties do not dispute the defendant\u2019s liability in and of itself, but rather the extent of the defendant\u2019s liability. Accordingly, the principles to be derived from <em>Levick </em>and <em>Gionfriddo </em>simply do not apply here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The plaintiff further argues that the term \u201closs\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 14-52 necessarily includes punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees because had the dealer remained in business, those sums would have been included in the amount of her recovery. The plaintiff contends that because she was entitled to recover punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a result of the judgment against the dealer under CUTPA, her award should not be diminished because the dealer went out of business. Moreover, in conjunction with those arguments, the plaintiff claims that to preclude recovery for attorney\u2019s fees, in particular, thwarts the public policy to protect consumers as set forth in CUTPA and \u00a7 14-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Although we recognize to a certain extent the logic contained in the plaintiffs arguments, as a reviewing court we cannot undermine the function of the legislature to add provisions to statutes that the legislature simply did not intend. \u201c[I]t is the prerogative of the legislature, not the courts, to determine the [special] circumstances under which an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party will be authorized.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>State, </em>216 Conn. 85, 111, 579 A.2d 37 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>We therefore conclude that under \u00a7 14-52, the legislature did not intend to permit recovery for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees under the surety bond.

The plaintiff seems to contend that res judicata barred the commissioner from altering the original award because \u00a7 14-52 provides that the judgment of the original trial court has a preclusive effect. As will be evident from our conclusion, that interpretation of \u00a7 14-52 lacks any merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b815-10\"> In arriving at our conclusion, we take note of <em>Western Surety Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV 990494408S (December 15, 1999). We find guidance from that decision in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>court addressed and resolved the identical issue that we now face. The trial court in the matter before us also relied on <em>Western Surety Co.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\"> We further note that our conclusion finds support in the Restatement, Security (1941), and also among many of our sister states that have enacted substantially similar statutes governing motor vehicle dealers and surety bonds. The Restatement takes the view that the obligation of a surety pursuant to a statutorily mandated bond does not include punitive damages. Restatement, Security, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 73, 195, 198. Moreover numerous jurisdictions that have considered the exact issue have come to the same conclusion. See <em>Ferris </em>v. <em>Haymore, </em>967 F.2d 946 (4th Cir. 1992); <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>23 Ariz. App. 348, 533 P.2d 559 (1975); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Agricultural Ins.

Thus, we find that general statement to be inaccurate, particularly when viewed in the present context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b824-6\">SCHALLER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2hK\">dissenting. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of General Statutes \u00a7 14-52 and its conclusion that this section precludes the recovery of punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. I conclude, contrary to the majority, that the term \u201cany loss\u201d in \u00a7 14-52 is clear and unambiguous. Given its plain meaning, I believe \u201cany loss\u201d encompasses punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The majority concludes that the term \u201cany loss\u201d is \u201cboth generalized and ambiguous,\u201d and that the generality and ambiguity surrounding the term is demonstrated by consulting a standard dictionary definition. Indeed, the dictionary definition that the majority uses as support for the term\u2019s lack of clarity supports my position. The majority defines \u201cany\u201d as, \u201cone, indifferently out of more than two . . . one, some, or all indiscriminately of whatever quantity.\u201d That definition of \u201cany,\u201d together with the use of the word in the statute, is clear and comprehensive. As the majority recognizes, when the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, there is no need to examine legislative history or other sources of guidance. Not only is logic on the side of the plaintiff in this case, as the majority concedes, but the word \u201cany\u201d is plain on its face and, as such, requires no interpretation beyond that which comes from its normal usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>The only conceivable ambiguity might concern whether punitive damages constitute a \u201closs.\u201d That concern, however, is resolved under our case law. Punitive damages are awarded in this state \u201cnot to punish the defendant for his offense, but to compensate the plaintiff for his injuries.\u201d <em>DeSantis </em>v. <em>Piccadilly Land Corp., </em>3 Conn. App. 310, 315, 487 A.2d 1110 (1985). Moreover, our Supreme Court has recognized the principle that \u201ca finding of actual loss may support an award of punitive damages\u201d; <em>Hi-Ho Tower, Inc. </em>v. <em>Com-Tronics, Inc., </em>255 Conn. 20, 34, 761 A.2d 1268 (2000); and that punitive damages may be awarded upon a jury finding of liability, which is the equivalent of a finding of damages. Id. Punitive damages, therefore, represent a special kind of compensation for injury, damage or loss. In this case, the punitive damages awarded to the plaintiff in an unallocated damages award signify the existence of a loss, bringing it within the statutory term \u201cany loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In view of the clarity of the phrase \u201cany loss,\u201d it is not necessary or appropriate to consult legislative history. The term \u201cany loss\u201d should be accorded its plain meaning without more.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In any event, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s analysis of legislative history in this case. Although the majority notes the proposition that an award of punitive damages fulfills the salutary purpose of fully compensating a victim for the harm inflicted, it concludes that the surety provision in question was not enacted to provide consumers with full compensation. The majority supports that conclusion by relying on the use of the word \u201csome\u201d and the term \u201cmoney owed\u201d in the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">I do not agree with the proffered analysis. The use of the word \u201csome\u201d does not imply that the legislature intended that a plaintiff should be limited to partial damages but, instead, indicates that only one of many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>potential means of recovery was being provided. The term \u201csome\u201d was specified, not by the legislature in the statute itself, but by legislators in the course of discussing the legislation. In addition, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cmoney owed to them\u201d means amounts presently due, as opposed to subsequent money owed, is not supported by analysis. I see no basis for reading the legislative history so restrictively. Even if legislative history were properly considered in this case, it does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion. In addition, with regard to the analysis of attorney\u2019s fees, even though the legislature chose to specify certain examples of recovery in some instances, that practice does not detract from the comprehensive clarity of the words \u201cany loss\u201d in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Moreover, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s reliance on the Restatement, Security (1941). Sections 195 and 198 deal with injunction bonds and attachment bonds, respectively, and are not applicable in this case. Similarly, \u00a7 73 is inapplicable here because that section applies to penalties. In the present case, however, the judgment awarded the plaintiff compensation for a loss in the form of damages. The award was not a penalty that was assessed against the dealer in addition to compensating the plaintiff for her loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Because the award in this case is consistent with the public policy behind \u00a7 14-52, that is, that the surety should pay what the principal was obligated to pay, the plaintiff should not be deprived of her compensation by the defendant\u2019s suggestion of ambiguity in a term that could hardly be more straightforward. Because under the clear and broad language of \u00a7 14-52, the plaintiff should be allowed to recover from the surety the damages awarded for all her losses, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
