On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless search, (2) abused its discretion by admitting evidence of prior uncharged misconduct, (3) admitted expert testimony concerning battered woman syndrome and (4) permitted the prosecutor to engage in misconduct during closing argument, which denied the defendant a fair trial. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In July, 1998, the defendant and the victim, Carissa LeJeune, lived together in an apartment at 58 Yorkshire Street in Torrington. The defendant and LeJeune had been romantically involved with each other for about one year and, during that relationship, the defendant greatly restricted LeJeune\u2019s movement. If LeJeune had to leave the apartment to go somewhere, the defendant demanded that she page him to tell him of her whereabouts. He allowed her to go across the street to the Pateo store to buy snacks, cleaning supplies and the like, and to use a pay telephone. He did not, however, allow her to speak to any men and only to certain friends. Although LeJeune worked, the defendant would pick her up from work and bring her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">On July 29, 1998, at approximately 11 p.m., LeJeune went across the street to call her friend, Serita Oligny, from the pay telephone. The defendant had forbidden LeJeune from contacting Oligny. While she was speaking with Oligny, the defendant approached in his car. When LeJeune saw the defendant approaching, she immediately hung up the phone. The defendant asked LeJeune who she had been speaking with, and she told him Cristin Fitzgerald, a friend to whom the defendant allowed her to speak. He did not believe her and ordered her to get into the car. Upon returning to their apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ment, the defendant dragged her up the stairs to the kitchen where he threw her to the floor and kicked her in the back and crotch as he yelled that she had lied to him. He then drove LeJeune back to the pay telephone across the street and called Fitzgerald himself to determine whether she was the person to whom LeJeune had been speaking when he approached in his car. Fitzgerald said that she had spoken to LeJeune earlier that day. The defendant confronted LeJeune about her lie and called Oligny to determine whether she was the person LeJeune had telephoned. Oligny initially denied that LeJeune had telephoned her, but after LeJeune screamed at her to tell the truth, she told the defendant that she had been speaking to LeJeune when he approached in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">After the defendant finished speaking to Oligny, he and LeJeune got back in the defendant\u2019s car and he punched her in face. When she began to bleed, he warned her not to bleed all over his car. They drove around until the defendant decided to stop at a nearby house. He went into the house and a short time later came out with a mini blind rod. Once he resumed driving, he hit LeJeune across her face with the rod and, when she put her head between her knees to avoid additional blows, he began hitting her on her head, back and legs. As he hit LeJeune, he asked her why she had betrayed him by speaking to Oligny and others and by going out. The defendant then ordered LeJeune to hold out her hands, which he hit with the rod because she had used them to dial the telephone. In addition, he repeatedly hit her in the face and forcefully pushed her head into the seat belt buckle. LeJeune did not attempt to open the car door and escape because the defendant did not permit her to touch the door and had threatened to kill her if she did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">When they returned to their apartment, the defendant brought LeJeune into the living room, and ordered her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>to take off her clothes and kneel in front of a wall with her hands behind her back and her forehead to the wall. Again, he asked her why she had betrayed him and lied to him. He also asked her if she was sleeping with her uncle and, when LeJeune replied that she was not, forcefully pushed her head against the wall. LeJeune remained kneeling for several hours, during which time the defendant ate dinner and watched television. LeJeune asked the defendant if she could he down because she felt lightheaded, but he did not allow her to he down until he went to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">On July 30, 1998, at approximately 7 a.m., the defendant awakened LeJeune and asked her to iron his shirt because he had to appear in court. Because of her weakened condition, she had to prop herself up while lying on her stomach to iron his shirt. When she finished ironing his shirt, LeJeune went back to sleep. Before leaving for court, the defendant again ordered LeJeune to remain in the apartment. When he returned, the defendant, holding a razor blade in his hand, awakened LeJeune. He then cut the tip of her nose with the razor blade and told her that she was poison and that she should kill herself. Thereafter, he told her to take a shower because she had dried blood on her and she was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Before she could do so, the defendant told her to leave the bathroom so that he could use it. When he came out of the bathroom, the defendant picked up a steak knife and started to cut LeJeune on her foot, leg and arm while telling her that she was not going to make a fool out of him. He then threw the knife into the sink and left the apartment, again warning LeJeune not to leave and stating that if she did leave, he would kill her. LeJeune was aware that the defendant kept an operable gun in the trunk of his car. She recently had seen the gun in the defendant\u2019s possession and was present when it was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Despite the defendant\u2019s threat, LeJeune got dressed and left the apartment. She walked to a friend\u2019s house nearby and used the telephone to call for a ride. She did not wait for her ride at her friend\u2019s house, fearing that if the defendant found her there her friend also would be at risk. Instead, she waited across the street in the doorway of a bowling alley. A short time later, a family friend picked her up and brought her to the hospital where she was treated for her injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While she was at the hospital, the police were called. The police questioned LeJeune and took photographs of her injuries. Thereafter, LeJeune\u2019s mother arrived, and she and LeJeune drove to the Yorkshire Street apartment to retrieve LeJeune\u2019s belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">As LeJeune was standing outside the apartment, the Torrington police arrived at the scene. LeJeune spoke with the police, telling them, among other things, that she lived there. One of the officers proceeded to knock on the apartment door to check if the defendant was in the apartment. No one answered. Detective John Murphy then asked LeJeune if she was willing to sign a consent to search form. The form stated that she had a right to refuse to consent to a warrantless search of her apartment and that she was signing the form voluntarily. LeJeune signed the form, and the police searched the apartment. After they determined that the defendant was not present, the police seized a steak knife and a razor blade from the apartment. The police also took photographs of the apartment. The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of kidnapping in the second degree, assault in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree, threatening and cruelty to persons. The court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of twenty-nine years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen years, and five years probation with special conditions. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained by the police from a warrantless search in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the state failed to prove that LeJeune had the authority to consent to the search of the apartment and that the police reasonably believed that she had the authority to consent to the search. He also argues that the court\u2019s reasoning with respect to its denial of his motion to suppress was \u201cflawed.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to trial, the state proposed to offer as full exhibits the steak knife and the razor blade that the police had seized from the apartment. The defendant filed a motion to suppress that evidence, claiming that \u201cthe search was conducted absent a search warrant and no exception to [the] search warrant requirement appliefd].\u201d The court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. At the hearing, the defendant testified that he lived alone at the 58 Yorkshire Street apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>ment and that he lived there pursuant to a lease that he signed as \u201cLorenzo Montgomery.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also testified that he had obtained the money for the security deposit from his family. The defendant further testified that LeJeune did not live with him, that she was never present in the apartment and that she did not have her clothes, toiletries or any of her personal property there.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On the other hand, LeJeune testified that she moved in with the defendant at the 58 Yorkshire Street apartment on July 17,1998, and that she still was living there on July 30, 1998, the date of the search.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She further testified that she provided the money for the security deposit that enabled her and the defendant to rent the apartment. LeJeune also testified that when she moved in, she brought one week\u2019s supply of clothing and other personal items, and that her friend was to bring the rest of her belongings at a later date. She also described the apartment as having four rooms \u2014 a bathroom, living room, kitchen and bedroom, which she shared with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In its memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the court stated: \u201cThe evidence . . . established that both Carissa LeJeune and the defendant lived at the apartment in question. The court finds Ms. LeJeune\u2019s testimony that she moved into the premises on July 17, 1998, and still lived there on the date of the search to be credible and persuasive.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201c[although [the] defendant asserts that there were no other indicia of Ms. LeJeune living in the apartment . . . the court finds Ms. LeJeune\u2019s own testimony that she lived there, provided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>funds for the security deposit, and intended to bring all her clothing to the apartment to be believable and convincing. The couple had just moved into the apartment a couple of weeks earlier. It is not unusual that such incidents of occupancy as a telephone, name on the door or mailbox, receiving mail at a new home and change of address not occur immediately after moving into a new home, but instead take some time.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the court noted that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s testimony that he alone lived in the apartment lacked credibility, not just because Ms. LeJeune\u2019s actual testimony was more believable than his or his interest in the outcome, but also because of his demeanor and testimony on the witness stand during the [hearing].\u201d Specifically, the court cited to the defendant\u2019s testimony about signing the lease as Lorenzo Montgomery and about being present in the apartment all day on July 30, 1998, as \u201ccast[ing] doubt on the overall veracity of his testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The court concluded that \u201c[a]s an occupant of the premises, LeJeune was lawfully entitled to give the police permission to search her home and seize items from it to be used in a prosecution of the defendant\u201d and that because of his \u201ccoresiding\u201d with LeJeune in the apartment, the defendant \u201chad no reasonable expectation of privacy as to items in the apartment.\u201d The court further concluded that the evidence established that \u201cLeJeune voluntarily consented to the search\u201d when she signed the consent to search form and that there was no indication that \u201cher will was overborne or that her consent was the result of promises, force, threats or other coercion.\u201d Finally, the court determined that \u201cthere is no evidence that the defendant had exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>sive control over any part of the apartment; nor is there evidence . . . that the police had reason, at the time consent was given, to doubt the accuracy of the claims of the person giving consent [i.e., LeJeune].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As a prehminary matter, we set forth the standard of review. \u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... [Wjhere the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 279, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001).

Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable. <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Guertin, </em>190 Conn. 440, 446, 461 A.2d 963 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>49 Conn. App. 699, 700, 716 A.2d 137, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 943, 723 A.2d 323 (1998). \u201cA warrantless search or entiy into a house is not unreasonable, however, under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution or article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution when a person with authority to do so has freely consented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>209 Conn. 1, 7, 546 A.2d 839 (1988). It is the state\u2019s burden to prove that the consent was freely and voluntarily given, and that the person who purported to consent had the authority to do so. <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S. Ct. 1788, 20 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1968); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>supra [603]. Such consent may not be established by mere acquiescence to police authority.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>MacNeil, </em>28 Conn. App. 508, 513, 613 A.2d 296, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 901, 615 A.2d 1044 (1992). \u201cWhether there was valid consent to search is a factual question that will not be lightly overturned on appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez-Jaramillo, </em>637 F.2d 1094, 1098 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 862, 101 S.

Ed. 2d 79 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">\u201c[W]hen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S. Ct. 988, 39 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1974). \u201cCommon authority is . . . not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property . . . but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 171 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In addition, a warrantless search is valid when it is based on the consent of a third party who the police, at the time of the search, reasonably believe possesses common authority over the premises but who in fact does not have such authority. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, 497 </em>U.S. 177, 188, 110 S. Ct. 2793, 111 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cAs with other factual determinations bearing upon search and seizure, determination of consent to enter must be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment . . . warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In the present case, the court, in its thoughtful and thorough memorandum of decision, determined that the evidence established that LeJeune and the defendant lived together at the apartment and that, as an occupant, LeJeune lawfully was entitled to give the police permission to search her home and seize items therefrom. The court further concluded that LeJeune voluntarily had consented to the search and that there was no indication that her will was overborne or that her consent was the result of promises, force, threats or other coercion. It is apparent that witness credibility was crucial in the court\u2019s ruling. Although the parties presented two different scenarios with respect to their living arrangement, the court stated that it did not find the defendant\u2019s testimony credible and that it found LeJeune\u2019s testimony \u201ccredible and persuasive.\u201d \u201cIt is the function of the trier to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">On the basis of our review of the whole record, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, and that its denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress legally and logically was correct and properly supported by the facts. We further conclude that the court\u2019s reasoning with respect to its denial of the motion to suppress was not \u201cflawed,\u201d as the defendant claims. Accordingly, the court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of his prior uncharged misconduct. Specifically, the defendant argues that the purpose for which the evidence was admitted does not fall into any exception that permits the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence. He further argues that the evidence of prior misconduct was not relevant to the charges against him, that it was more prejudicial than probative and that its admission deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the state sought to elicit testimony from LeJeune regarding a number of prior incidents in which the defendant had inflicted physical harm on her. LeJeune testified that during the course of the year she dated the defendant, he had (1) burned her with a lighter, (2) kicked her on her leg, causing an imprint of his boot, (3) hit her continuously on her legs with a one liter Nestea bottle, (4) kicked her in the face, causing her nose to bleed and (5) punched her in the face, splitting her lip. The state sought to admit those acts of prior misconduct as a predicate to the testimony of Evan Stark, the state\u2019s expert on battered woman syndrome. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>explained that it intended \u201cto offer a continuum of acts of battery against [LeJeune] over a period of time to show how she became a battered woman and why she didn\u2019t do some things that other people might have done, like leave when she had the opportunity.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the admission of the prior misconduct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The court allowed the introduction of the prior misconduct evidence \u201cto show or establish why LeJeune acted in this case as she did. In other words, to explain her conduct.\u201d It ruled that the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was admissible \u201csubject to linking [it] up and subject to the predicate conduct necessary being shown for Dr. Stark to testify.\u201d The court further ruled that at least one of the acts was \u201cadmissible to show the assault in the second degree.\u201d The court also gave a thorough limiting instruction to the jury as to that evidence during LeJeune\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior crimes or misconduct is not admissible. . . . We have, however, recognized exceptions to the general rule if the purpose for which the evidence is offered is to prove intent, identity, malice, motive, a system of criminal activity or the elements of a crime. . . . [Prior misconduct] evidence may also be used to corroborate crucial prosecution testimony. . . . Moreover, we have held that such evidence may be used to complete the story of the crime on trial by placing it in the context of nearby and nearly contemporaneous happenings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\u201cTo determine whether evidence of prior misconduct falls within an exception to the general rule prohibiting its admission, we have adopted a two-pronged analysis. . . . First, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions. Second, the probative value of such evidence must outweigh the prejudicial effect of the other crime evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">\u201cOur standard of review on such matters is well established. The admission of evidence of prior uncharged misconduct is a decision properly within the discretion of the trial court. . . . [E]very reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. . . . [T]he trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done. . . . The problem is . . . one of balancing the actual relevancy of the other crimes evidence in light of the issues and the other evidence available to the prosecution against the degree to which the jury will probably be roused by the evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>259 Conn. 374, 396-97, 788 A.2d 1221 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In the present case, the state presented evidence that the victim was a battered woman, suffering from what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>has been classified as battered woman syndrome. The state\u2019s expert, Stark, testified as to the cyclical nature of the violence perpetrated on battered women by their batterers and the effects of such violence on those women. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct toward LeJeune corroborated Stark\u2019s testimony. We conclude therefore that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior incidences of violence toward LeJeune was relevant and material to corroborating crucial prosecution testimony in that it demonstrated the manifestation of the battered woman syndrome as it affected LeJeune. See id., 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">With respect to whether the court properly determined that the probative value of the prior misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect, we conclude that the court\u2019s determination was proper. Given LeJeune\u2019s testimony concerning the brutality of the incidents that took place on July 29 and 30, 1998, the prejudicial impact of the relatively less brutal prior misconduct evidence was minimal, and it is unlikely that it unduly aroused the juiy\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, especially in light of the court\u2019s limiting instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Battista, </em>31 Conn. App. 497, 514-16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>626 A.2d 769, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 907, 632 A.2d 696 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 403, 631 A.2d 238 (1993) (absent clear indication to contrary, jury presumed to have followed court\u2019s instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We perceive no impropriety in the court\u2019s admission of the prior misconduct evidence to demonstrate the manifestation of battered woman syndrome as it affected LeJeune. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 398-99. The court properly determined that the probative value of the prior misconduct evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior uncharged misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed Stark, a sociologist, to testify as an expert witness on battered woman syndrome. Specifically, he claims that (1) Stark\u2019s testimony was \u201cminimally\u2019\u2019 relevant because the state presented no evidence that LeJeune was a battered woman, (2) the prejudicial effect of Stark\u2019s testimony outweighed its probative value, and (3) Stark\u2019s testimony bolstered LeJeune\u2019s credibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ity and, thus, invaded the province of the jury. We are not persuaded by any of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. After LeJeune testified at trial, the state called Stark to testify as an expert witness on battered woman syndrome. The defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude Stark\u2019s testimony, arguing that the state had not established a proper foundation for the testimony. The defendant, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Ali, </em>233 Conn. 403, 431, 660 A.2d 337 (1995), also argued that although similar testimony in other cases has been allowed to explain a victim\u2019s recantation relative to battered woman syndrome, Stark\u2019s testimony was not admissible because there was no evidence that LeJeune had recanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The court conducted a lengthy hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion. At the hearing, the state argued that Stark\u2019s expert testimony was necessary to assist the jury in understanding why LeJeune did not end her relationship with the defendant after the prior assaults, why she did not report the prior assaults to the police, why she did not leave the scene after the subject assaults despite the opportunity to do so and why she complied with the defendant\u2019s demands. The state further argued that Stark\u2019s input on battered woman syndrome would enable the jury to better determine whether LeJeune fit the profile of a battered woman. In response, the defendant argued that the jury did not need Stark\u2019s testimony to explain LeJeune\u2019s conduct. He further argued that the testimony was immaterial, irrelevant and more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">After reviewing the cases that counsel cited and considering their arguments of counsel, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in limine and allowed the state to present Stark\u2019s testimony. In so doing, the court determined that recantation was not \u201ca necessary pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>requisite\u201d for the admission of expert testimony on battered woman syndrome, but rather it was \u201cjust one kind of . . . paradoxical behavior that someone might not understand . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court stated that it is \u201cparticularly appropriate to use expert testimony to explain this kind of behavior of not reporting the crime or not attempting to leave when the opportunity presented itself because that conduct seems unusual and, without explanation, would raise questions about whether the conduct actually happened.\u201d The court also determined that the state could pose appropriate hypothetical questions to Stark as he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The defendant first claims that Stark\u2019s testimony was \u201cminimally\u201d relevant because the state presented no evidence that LeJeune was a battered woman. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 353, 696 A.2d 944 (1997). \u201cExpert testimony is admissible if (1) the witness has a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter in issue, (2) that skill or knowledge is not common to the average person, and (3) the testimony would be helpful to the court or jury in considering the issues. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">\u201c [E]vidence is relevant only when it tends to establish the existence of a material fact or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . . [T]he test of relevancy is not whether the answer sought will elucidate any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the main issues, but whether it will to a useful extent aid the court or jury in appraising the credibility of the witness and in assessing the probative value of the direct testimony.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Battista, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Our Supreme Court has held that expert testimony concerning battered woman syndrome is relevant \u201cto describe the behavior patterns typically ascribed to battered [woman] syndrome.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>227 Conn. 153, 174, 629 A.2d 1105 (1993). \u201cOf course, expert testimony, like all other evidence, must be relevant to be admitted. . . . Expert testimony on the subject of battered [woman] syndrome is not relevant unless there is some evidentiary foundation that a party or witness to the case is a battered woman, and that party or witness has behaved in such a manner that the jury would be aided by expert testimony providing an explanation for the behavior.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 172 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In the present case, Stark testified at length with respect to battered woman syndrome on the basis of his experience with battered women and research into domestic violence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Stark defined \u201cwoman battering\u201d as \u201cinvolving] a course of conduct that includes, but is not limited to, multiple instances of physical abuse or assault and the pattern of isolation, intimidation, mental abuse and control.\u201d He indicated that there is a subgroup of battered women, which, as a result of repeated abuse, suffers what he termed a \u201clearned help<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>lessness,\u201d which is exhibited \u201cafter they [experience] frustration in trying to extricate themselves from the situation or, for whatever reason, they simply [give] up for a period of time, at least, and [believe] that they [cannot] escape from the situation even when there [are] opportunities for them to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Stark then described the second part of the syndrome, the \u201ccycle of violence,\u201d which \u201cfeeds into\u201d the learned helplessness. He explained that in abusive situations, \u201cthere [is] a buildup of tension, which [creates] tremendous anxiety and fear on the part of the victim, and then there [is] an episode of physical abuse . . . .\u201d Thereafter, he continued, there occurs what is called \u201cthe honeymoon phase\u201d in which the abusive partner apologizes. Stark indicated that it is during that honeymoon phase that a battered woman often is drawn into the relationship because she \u201cdesperately [wants] to believe things [will] change, [and she hopes] they might change during this period where the apology or the promises dominate, [and] the battered woman in a sense [gets] sucked into the relationship more deeply than she would have otherwise been; common sense should have told her to leave, but now she\u2019s confused . . . [a]nd the result is . . . that she is there when the second episode occurs and possibly the third.\u201d Stark testified that at that point, the abuser \u201cmay no longer apologize, he may no longer be promising change, but because of the cycle of violence, she\u2019s in some sense entrapped in the relationship and, because of the ongoing abuse, that entrapment leads to . . . leam[ed] helplessness and then, at least for a period of time, [she] is unable to seek help . . . even when it\u2019s offered.\u201d Such women, Stark explained, \u201cshift their focus from escape, from getting out of the relationship, to merely surviving in the relationship, and they may identify exposing the facts in the relationship to friends or authorities as counter to their interest in surviving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>either because [the abuser] threatened them with punishment if they report or because they believe at that point, because of the isolation and intimidation, that he has powers which he does not have, in her mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">During his testimony, Stark also was asked a number of hypothetical questions that tracked the facts that gave rise to the charges against the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ally, with respect to each hypothetical question, Stark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>was asked to give his expert opinion whether the hypothetical victim\u2019s conduct was consistent with that of a woman suffering from battered woman syndrome. In each case, Stark concluded that the victim\u2019s conduct as set out in the hypothetical question was indeed consistent with a woman suffering from battered woman syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">As previously stated, before expert testimony about battered woman syndrome becomes relevant, an evidentiary foundation must first be established that the victim is a battered woman and that her conduct is such that the jury would be aided by expert testimony providing an explanation therefor. See id. Here, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence of an abusive relationship warranting the testimony on battered woman syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The state presented evidence that the defendant battered LeJeune on a number of occasions during the course of their relationship. Stark\u2019s testimony was offered to assist the jury in understanding whether LeJeune\u2019s conduct was consistent with the pattern and profile of a battered woman. His expert testimony provided the jury with a relevant insight into LeJeune\u2019s behavior that it might not otherwise bring to its evalua<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>tion of her credibility. That insight was made more significant in light of the defendant\u2019s extensive cross-examination of LeJeune, which focused on her failure to escape from the defendant when she had the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Moreover, Stark\u2019s testimony was particularly crucial to the jury\u2019s determination because although battered woman syndrome has become known to the public more widely than it was in the past, much of the subject still remains beyond the ken of the average juror. Indeed, \u201c [c] ommentators have noted that the research data indicates that potential jurors may hold beliefs and attitudes about abused women at variance with the views of experts who have studied or had experience with abused women. In particular, males are likely to be skeptical about the fear the woman feels in an abusive relationship and about her inability to leave a setting in which abuse is threatened.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 167. Reliance, therefore, on an expert such as Stark in a case such as this one was well warranted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We conclude therefore that the court properly determined that Stark\u2019s testimony concerning battered woman syndrome was relevant to assist the jury in understanding whether LeJeune\u2019s conduct was consistent with the pattern and profile of a battered woman and to the issue of her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The defendant also claims that the prejudicial effect of Stark\u2019s testimony outweighed its probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">\u201cThere are situations where the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion. These are: (1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Battista, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 515-16. \u201cThe primary responsibility for conducting the prejudicial-probative balancing test rests with the trial court, and its conclusion will be disturbed only for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . We note that [bjecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process . . . every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Servello, </em>59 Conn. App. 362, 377, 757 A.2d 36, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 940, 761 A.2d 764 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">As we already have concluded, Stark\u2019s testimony could have assisted the jury substantially in understanding whether LeJeune\u2019s conduct was consistent with the pattern and profile of a battered woman. The court reasonably could have concluded that the probative value of that evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. We therefore are not persuaded that the court abused its discretion in admitting Stark\u2019s testimony, especially in light of the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The defendant\u2019s last claim relative to Stark\u2019s testimony is that it improperly bolstered LeJeune\u2019s credibility and, thus, invaded the province of the jury. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">There is a \u201ccritical distinction between admissible expert testimony on general or typical behavior patterns of . . . victims and inadmissible testimony directly concerning the particular victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 379, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). Expert testimony properly may be admitted to assist the jury in understanding not whether the victim was credible on the witness stand, but whether the victim\u2019s conduct was consistent with the pattern and profile of a battered woman. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Borrelli, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 174. Such explanatory testimony does not invade the province of the jury in assessing the credibility of witnesses. Id. Furthermore, it is not impermissible for an expert witness to respond to hypothetical questions about the behavior of abuse victims for the puipose of establishing that the victim\u2019s behavior was generally consistent with that of such victims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeney, </em>228 Conn. 582, 592-93, 637 A.2d 1088 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">In the present case, Stark did not give his opinion as to whether LeJeune testified truthfully or whether she in fact suffered from battered woman syndrome. His expert testimony could have assisted the jury substantially in understanding whether LeJeune\u2019s conduct was consistent with the pattern and profile of a battered woman. Moreover, Stark provided the jury with a frame<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>work within which it could place and possibly explain the victim\u2019s behavior, which is within the accepted role of an expert witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude, therefore, that Stark\u2019s testimony did not invade the province of the jury in assessing LeJeune\u2019s credibility, especially in light of the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Stark\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor made improper comments during closing and rebuttal arguments to the jury that were \u201cso pervasive and egregious\u201d that they violated the defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly (1) expressed his personal opinion as to the evidence, (2) expressed his personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, (3) referred to facts not in evidence and (4) appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">The defendant concedes that he failed to preserve properly those claims at trial; however, he nonetheless maintains that they are reviewable under either <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>or the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We will review the defendant\u2019s claims under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate to do so and an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct in violation of a fundamental right is of constitutional magnitude. We conclude, however, that the challenged comments did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial and, therefore, that his claims fail under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">\u201c[P]rosecutorial misconduct of constitutional proportions may arise during the course of closing argument, thereby implicating the fundamental fairness of the trial itself . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>258 Conn. 153, 165, 778 A.2d 955 (2001). \u201c[T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial . . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 266, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201cIn order to determine whether claims of prosecutorial misconduct amounted to a denial of due process, we must decide whether the challenged remarks were improper, and, if so, whether they caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. ... In conducting our analysis, we focus on several factors: (1) the extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>42 Conn. App. 507, 515-16, 681 A.2d 362, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 928, 929, 683 A.2d 398 (1996). With those principles in mind, we review the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The defendant first claims that the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion as to the evidence. Specifically, the defendant challenges three separate comments made by the prosecutor during closing and rebuttal arguments. We will address each comment in turn to determine whether the. particular comment was improper and whether the impropriety, if any, deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. During the trial, the defendant offered into evidence three letters<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> that he claimed LeJeune had written to him while he was incarcerated after his arrest on the charges in the present case. During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned LeJeune as to whether she wrote the letters. LeJeune admitted to writing one of the letters, but denied writing the other two.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>dant presented expert testimony from Clarissa DeAngelis, a certified document examiner. DeAngelis testified that she examined the three letters and, in her opinion, that they all had been written by the same person. In rebuttal, the state presented expert testimony from Kenneth Zercie, a criminalist for the state police forensic laboratory, who testified that he examined the same three letters and, in his opinion, exhibit two, the letter that LeJeune admitted writing, was not \u201cauthored\u201d by the person who authored the other two letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The defendant first contends that the prosecutor improperly expressed his opinion by vouching for the credibility of Zercie\u2019s testimony when he commented to the jury as follows: \u201cAnd then these phony letters that come up that are in evidence, these two forgeries to try to tell you that, oh, it was somebody else, some crack-head somewhere who did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u201c[I]t is well established that the evaluation of [witnesses\u2019] testimony and credibility are wholly within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Swan Lake Assn., Inc., </em>66 Conn. App. 858, 861, 786 A.2d 436 (2001). \u201cIt is axiomatic that [t]he prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 274, 780 A.2d 53 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Here, despite the prosecutor\u2019s indelicate use of the terms \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cforgeries,\u201d he did not vouch for the credibility of Zercie\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>neither personally guaranteed the credibility of the testimony nor implied that he had special knowledge outside the record. Viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s comment refer to matters in evidence. \u201c[A] prosecutor may properly comment on the credibility of a witness where . . . the comment reflects reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>64 Conn. App. 80, 93, 778 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1249 (2001). Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause closing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>66 Conn. App. 357, 373, 784 A.2d 444, cert. denied, 259 Conn. 901, 789 A.2d 992 (2001). We therefore conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The defendant also contends that the prosecutor improperly expressed his opinion as to the evidence by describing the letters offered by the defense as \u201ccontrived\u201d and \u201cphony,\u201d and by stating, \u201cI think she\u2019s mistaken,\u201d in reference to DeAngelis\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Here, again, despite his indelicate use of the term \u201cphony,\u201d the prosecutor merely was commenting on inferences drawn from Zercie\u2019s testimony and, therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not improper. Also, it was defense counsel who introduced the term \u201ccontrive\u201d into the case by stating to the jury during his closing argument: \u201cI have to tell you that, frankly, I think that this prosecution was the most <em>contrived, </em>corrupt prosecution I\u2019ve ever seen with my own two eyes anywhere.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by using the term \u201ccontrive,\u201d the prosecutor was responding to an argument invited by the defendant. Although it was improper for the prosecutor to state, \u201cI think she\u2019s mistaken,\u201d the court minimized the prejudicial effect of any impropriety by promptly warning the prosecutor not to inject his opinion into the argument.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We therefore are not persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Finally, the defendant contends that during rebuttal argument, the prosecutor improperly expressed his opinion as to the evidence by describing the letters offered by the defense as \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cbasically distaste,\u201d and by stating that the defendant\u2019s assertion that LeJeune did not live with the defendant in the apartment was \u201cutter nonsense.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s comments arose in reference to defense counsel\u2019s changing his line of questioning after LeJeune, upon being shown the three letters that she allegedly wrote to the defendant, admitted that she wrote one of the letters, but denied that she wrote the other two. The prosecutor referred to the later two letters as \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cbasically distaste.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">We again conclude that despite the prosecutor\u2019s indelicate use of certain terms, his comments, when viewed in context, reflect reasonable inferences from the evidence adduced at trial, namely, the defendant\u2019s dependence on two questionable letters to show reasonable doubt. Also, in arguing that the jury should reject as \u201cutter nonsense\u201d the defendant\u2019s claim that LeJeune did not live with him in the apartment, the prosecutor merely was responding to defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury that it was \u201cwholly unbelievable, and just made up out of whole cloth . . . that [LeJeune] lived with [the defendant].\u201d Furthermore, the court minimized the prejudicial effect of any improper expression of opinion by the prosecutor by sternly warning both counsel in front of the jury not to inject their opinions into the argument.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We therefore are not persuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>that the prosecutor\u2019s comments rose to the level of egregiousness or so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt by making the following two comments: (1) \u201cSo, when you come to court with these letters and say, oh, I have letters from [LeJeune], that somebody else did, unnamed, we know who to \u2014 who the forger is\u201d; and (2) \u201cBut he does tell you another thing, and that is that those two letters are written by the same person, not [LeJeune], but by the same person, and I think we all know who that is.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">\u201cWe acknowledge that it is improper for a prosecutor to express his or her opinion, directly or indirectly, as to a defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>65 Conn.

App. 385, 399-400, 726 A.2d 657, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 920, 733 A.2d 233 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s allusion to the \u201cforger\u201d and his implication that the. defendant forged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>the two letters was improper, even though the jury was aware, both from the evidence and the court\u2019s instructions, that the defendant was not on trial for forgery. Although improper, viewed in the context of the entire trial, the prosecutor\u2019s isolated comments were not so blatantly egregious as to cause substantial prejudice to the defendant. Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor improperly referred to facts not in evidence during his closing argument. Specifically, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly commented on the substantive content of two letters that were admitted for the limited purpose of assisting the jury in resolving the issue of the letters\u2019 authenticity and not for substantive use.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">\u201c[I]n fulfilling his duties, the prosecutor must confine the arguments to the evidence in the record. . . . Statements as to facts that have not been proven amount to unsworn testimony that is not the subject of proper closing argument.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Strictly speaking, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper because he referred to the substance of \u201c[t]he letters,\u201d despite initially acknowledging that two of the letters were admitted into evidence for a limited purpose. Presumably, when he briefly discussed what the jurors might \u201csee\u201d when they read \u201c[t]he letters,\u201d he was referring only to the \u201cthird letter,\u201d which already had been admitted into evidence without limitation.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Indeed, on a number of occasions, counsel for both parties referred genericaily to \u201cthe letters,\u201d and, therefore, to matters not strictly in evidence.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the substance of the collective letters was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Although technically, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not appropriate, we are not persuaded that when they are viewed in the context of the entire trial, they are so egregious as to have deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Given the court\u2019s strong limiting instruction, both at trial and during its final instructions to the jury, as to the proper use of the letters,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the prejudicial effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments was minimal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 403 (\u201c[j]urors are presumed to have followed the instructions of the court as to the law in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary\u201d). Moreover, LeJeune\u2019s relationship with the defendant, his treatment of her, as well as her protestation of her feelings for him, fairly viewed, were evidence that was already admitted into evidence at trial. Accordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Last, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury\u2019s emotions and sympathies during closing argument. Specifically, the defendant takes issue with the following comment: \u201cIf this cycle of violence has to stop, and you have the power, and in this particular case to stop it, you have the power to say to this defendant, no more, you cannot treat another human being like you treated her, our society won\u2019t permit it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">\u201cA prosecutor may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. . . . When the prosecutor appeals to emotions, he invites the jury to decide the case, not according to a rational appraisal of the evidence, but on the basis of powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew that appraisal. . . . Therefore, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [but] such argument must be fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Singh, 259 Conn. 693, 719, 793 A.2d 226 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment on the \u201ccycle of violence\u201d properly was based on evidence presented at trial. Viewed in context, the challenged comment did not \u201cdivert the jury\u2019s attention away from deciding the case on the evidence,\u201d as the defendant contends; rather, it merely suggested that \u201cif\u2019 the jury found that the cycle of violence existed and that it should be stopped, then that could be reflected in the verdict. It is important to note that not only did the prosecutor begin the challenged comment with the qualifier \u201cif,\u201d but immediately following the comment the prosecutor continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you <em>based upon the evidence that you heard in this case, and only that evidence, </em>to bring back guilty verdicts on each of these counts.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">It is the prosecutor\u2019s duty to see that justice is done and to use any legitimate means to accomplish that, including persuading the jury that its verdict will accord with justice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 336, 746 A.2d 761 (2000). Moreover, it is well settled that \u201cin addressing the jury, [cjounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 746, 631 A.2d 288 (1993). We perceive no proscribed appeal to the jury\u2019s emotions and sympathies and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s misconduct claim is without merit.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Finally, we consider whether the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments so infected the proceedings as to deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial. As previously stated, that final determination requires the consideration of several factors: The extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the conduct, the frequency of the conduct, the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case, the strength of the curative instructions adopted and the strength of the state\u2019s case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 515. We conclude that the defendant was not deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Our examination of the entire record discloses that this was, to say the least, a spirited trial. Indeed, much of the indelicacy of the prosecutor\u2019s comments was in response to defense counsel\u2019s equally indelicate comments<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and, therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the most part, was invited by defense counsel\u2019s conduct and argument. Also, the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was infrequent and certainly not representative \u201cof a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tweedy, </em>219 Conn. 489, 509, 594 A.2d 906 (1991). Moreover, because none of the improprieties was egregious and because they referred to secondary or collateral issues, the prejudicial effect of the comments was minimal at most, especially in light of the state\u2019s particularly strong case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">It also is noteworthy that the prosecutor\u2019s comments that the defendant now claims were improper apparently were not so obviously prejudicial as to evoke a contemporaneous objection from defense counsel at trial. \u201c[I]t seems strange that, if the state\u2019s comments were as egregious at trial as they have been depicted on appeal, no contemporaneous objection was made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 535 n.15, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 572, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998) (\u201cbecause the defendant made no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>objection to the statements at trial, we may presume that he did not consider [them] to be seriously prejudicial at the time they were made\u201d). Finally, the court\u2019s strong and clear- instructions to the jury were sufficient to mitigate any possible harmful effect of the misconduct.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">We conclude that because most of the challenged comments were appropriate and any improper comments, taken as a whole, were not sufficiently pervasive to have established a pattern of misconduct or so blatantly egregious that they infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, the cumulative effect of the challenged comments did not clearly deprive him of a fair trial. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct fail under the third prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> At trial, LeJeune, with the aid of photographs, testified concerning her injuries. She testified that she was unable to eat regular food for several weeks because of the injuries the defendant had inflicted on her jaw and that she still experienced pain in her legs. She also testified that the defendant had burned her thigh with a cigarette lighter one or two days before July 30, 1998.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> The defendant does not set forth a separate claim, accompanied by an independent analysis, under the <em>Connecticut </em>constitution. In his appellate brief, the defendant states: \u201cThe defendant is not making a claim that the Connecticut constitution offers him greater protection than the federal constitution for third party consent to search issues, therefore a separate state constitutional analysis is omitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> The defendant testified that he gave the name Lorenzo Montgomery to the landlord when renting the apartment because \u201c[t]hat\u2019s the person [whose] credit was used to approve the apartment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> LeJeune testified that she remembered that she had moved in with the defendant on July 17, 1998, because that was his birthday. The record indicates that the defendant was bom on July 17, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\"> The court noted that LeJeune had testified that the defendant\u2019s name also was not on the mailbox or door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"> On cross-examination, the defendant testified that he was in the apartment all day on July 30, 1998, but on redirect examination, he qualified his earlier statement by explaining that he had meant to testify that he was there until he left the apartment on that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> Because we conclude that the court properly determined that LeJeune freely and voluntarily gave her consent to search the apartment and that she had the authority to do so, we need not consider whether the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>reasonably believed that she had the authority to consent to the search. Moreover, even if we did consider that claim, we would conclude that the court properly determined that the police, at the time of the search, reasonably believed that LeJeune had the authority to consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In so concluding, we note that in his appellate brief, the defendant raises for the first time the issue of LeJeune\u2019s age as a factor to be considered in determining whether the police were reasonable in their belief that she had authority to consent to the search. We can presume fairly that the court considered LeJeune\u2019s age in arriving at its decision. Furthermore, the defendant did not seek review of his claim under either the plain error doctrine; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; or <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, therefore, we would decline to review his claim even if we were to consider the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\"> The court instructed the jury: \u201cOkay, members of the jury, before we begin, I would just like to go over one thing with you. In this case, you heard some evidence of some prior actions on the part of the accused such as hitting or threatening Ms. LeJeune on prior occasions that occurred before the instances that are alleged in this case. Evidence of actions or deeds of the defendant that he is not on trial for here is not admitted to prove the bad character of the defendant.

Such evidence was admitted solely to show or establish by Ms. LeJeune why [she] acted in this case as she did. In other words, to explain her conduct.

She\u2019s seriously assaulted perhaps five or six times over the course of this relationship. She never calls the police. She never reports this. She remains in the relationship.

And the effect of those assaults, in addition to the severe assaults which punctuate the history of ongoing minor assaults, is a level of physical intimidation that can create the learned helplessness that we described earlier. There are a variety of reasons why women don\u2019t report, but the data is pretty clear that in only a very small minority of instances where history of battering is established are women able or do they call the police or visit the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Doctor, assume further that this particular man instructs a woman that she must call or page him before she goes anywhere, tell him who she\u2019ll be seeing, where she\u2019ll be going, when she\u2019ll return, she has to get [his] permission before she goes out before leaving work, she complies with this order.

So, when you read the letters, you can see her asking him, \u2018Why did you do this to me?\u2019 \u2018It had to be my fault,\u2019 she says. Why? Because that\u2019s how [she has] been trained. [She has] been trained by him. Kneel in the comer nude until I tell you to stop. And she does, for hours.

Since the authenticity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>these two letters is in dispute, however, before you would consider those letters at all, you would first have to decide that the evidence established that she had written them.
