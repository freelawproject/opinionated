The plaintiff, Joan E. Gay, now known as Joan E. McNulty, appeals from the order of the trial court modifying the alimony award to be paid by the defendant, Thomas J. Gay. The sole issue is whether the trial court improperly considered capital gains realized by the plaintiff to be income when modifying the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our consideration of the plaintiffs claim. On December 20, 1996, after a thirty-two year marriage, the plaintiff brought an action seeking a dissolution of the marriage based on an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. The court incorporated by reference a stipulation entered into by the parties dated December 20, 1996. The stipulated agreement provided, inter alia, that the defendant shall pay alimony to the plaintiff in the amount of $730 per month.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>On September 29, 1999, the defendant moved for a modification of the alimony payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his motion, the defendant claimed that his retirement, and the accompanying decrease in income, constituted a substantial change in circumstances. Furthermore, he noted that the plaintiffs income and assets had dramatically increased so that her circumstances had changed for the better. After hearing arguments on the matter, the court reduced the defendant\u2019s alimony obligation to $1 per year and ordered the parties to exchange copies of their respective federal tax returns for the following three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On October 24, 2000, the court rendered its oral decision regarding the parties\u2019 motions for articulation. The court first articulated the basis for its conclusion that there was a bona fide retirement on the part of the defendant. In addition, the court articulated the basis for its conclusion that the parties\u2019 income was now in parity and, therefore, the alimony award should be modified. After making certain adjustments to the net income reflected on the plaintiffs financial affidavit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court found that the defendant had a net income of $1268 per week and the plaintiff had a net income of $1323 per week. On January 3, 2001, the court issued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>a further articulation of the order pursuant to the plaintiffs request.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The plaintiff argues that the court improperly considered the capital gains that she realized from her investment accounts to be income. Specifically, she argues that because a capital gain represents the appreciation of an asset it cannot be used as the basis for a finding that there has been a substantial change in circumstances. The defendant argues that the appreciation of any asset is a reasonable basis for a court to modify alimony. We conclude, on the basis of our review of the record, the parlies\u2019 briefs and the relevant case law, that the plaintiff can prevail only if the assets generating the capital gain were acquired by her prior to the divorce and distributed to her pursuant to the divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">We first set forth our well established standard of review applied in domestic relations matters. \u201cA trial court is in an advantageous position to assess the personal factors so significant in domestic relations cases, and its orders in such cases will not be reversed unless its findings have no reasonable basis in fact or it has abused its discretion, or unless, in the exercise of such discretion, it applies the wrong standard of law.\u201d <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>46 Conn. App. 87, 90, 699 A.2d 1029 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">\u201c[U]nder our statutes and cases, modification of alimony can be entertained and premised upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party to the original dissolution decree. . . . Thus, once the trial court finds a substantial change in circumstances, it can properly consider a motion for modification of alimony. After the evidence introduced in support of the substantial change in circumstances establishes the threshold predicate for the trial court\u2019s ability to entertain a motion for modification ... it also naturally comes into play in the trial court\u2019s strue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>turing of the modification orders.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>228 Conn. 729, 737, 638 A.2d 1060 (1994); see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The onus to prove the existence of a substantial change in the circumstances is on the party seeking modification. See <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\u201c[Our Supreme Court] and the Appellate Court have often described financial orders appurtenant to dissolution proceedings as entirely interwoven and as a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>249 Conn. 265, 277, 752 A.2d 1023 (1999). In general, the same factors used by the court to establish an initial award of alimony are relevant in deciding whether the decree may be modified. See <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 736; see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cMore specifically, these criteria, outlined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82, require the court to consider the needs and financial resources of each of the parties ... as well as such factors as the causes for the dissolution of the marriage and the age, health, station, occupation, employability and amount and sources of income of the parties.\u201d <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>supra, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>When determining whether there is a substantial change in circumstances, the court is limited in its consideration to conditions arising subsequent to the entry of the dissolution decree. See <em>Schorsch </em>v. <em>Schorsch, </em>53 Conn. App. 378, 382-83, 731 A.2d 330 (1999). \u201cTo permit the trial court to reconsider all evidence dating from before the original divorce proceedings, in determining the adjustment of alimony, would be, in effect, to undermine the policy behind the well established rule of limiting proof of the substantial change of circumstances to events occurring subsequent to the latest alimony order \u2014 the avoidance of relitigating matters already settled.\u201d <em>Borkowski </em>v. <em>Borkowski, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">To resolve the issue of whether capital gains may be considered as income for purposes of alimony modification, we must engage in an analysis of the statutory construction. Because capital gain is income derived from the sale of property, we must examine two relevant statutes, \u00a7 46b-82, the determination of alimony, and General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the assignment of property and the transfer of title, and how they relate to one another. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>HUD/Willow Street Apartments </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>68 Conn. App. 638, 647, 792 A.2d 165 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Section \u00a7 46b-82 mandates that the court consider specific enumerated factors when determining an alimony award, including amount and sources of income. \u201cThe court is to consider these factors in making an award of alimony, but it need not give each factor equal weight. ... As long as the trial court considers all of these statutory criteria, it may exercise broad discretion in awarding alimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tevolini </em>v. <em>Tevolini, </em>66 Conn. App. 16, 23, 783 A.2d 1157 (2001). Thus, the court <em>must </em>consider all income of the parties whatever its source may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The legislative history of \u00a7 46b-82 is, however, inconclusive as to the intended meaning of the word \u201cincome.\u201d We must, therefore, look to the ordinary meaning of the word. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 281. Income is defined as \u201ca: a gain or recurrent benefit that is [usually] measured in money and for a given period of time, derived from capital, labor, or a combination of both, includes gains from transactions in capital assets, but excludes unrealized advances in value . . . b: value of goods and services received by an individual in a given period of time . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We further note that a capital gain is the \u201cprofit realized on the sale or exchange of a capital asset.\u201d Black\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Law Dictionaiy (6th Ed. 1990). \u201cFor income tax purposes, a capital asset is defined as all property held by a taxpayer (e.g. house, car, stocks, bonds), except for certain assets listed in [Internal Revenue Code] \u00a7 1221.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra. Because the profit realized from the sale of an asset is income, a capital gain is income. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On the basis of the foregoing, \u201cincome\u201d includes realized gain from the sale of a capital asset.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">This does not complete our inquiry. \u201cIt is black letter law that Connecticut is an equitable distribution property state . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Wendt </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>59 Conn. App. 656, 663, 757 A.2d 1225, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 918, 763 A.2d 1044 (2000). \u201cAlthough it is well established that trial courts have broad equitable remedial powers regarding marital dissolutions ... it is equally well settled that [c] ourts have no inherent power to transfer property from one spouse to another; instead, that power must rest upon an enabling statute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">\u201cIn fixing the nature and value of the property assigned, and in determining whether alimony will be awarded, and the duration and amount of the award, the court \u2018shall consider the length of the marriage, the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate\u2019 and needs of each of the parties. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>81 (c) and 46b-82.\u201d <em>Delahunty </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 582, 592-93 n.11, 674 A.2d 1290 (1996). In its determination of property assignments, the trial court must also consider \u201cthe opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income . . . [and] the contribution of each of the parties in the acquisition, preservation or appreciation in value of their respective estates.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">\u201cIt is well established that a trial court need not assign specific values to the parties\u2019 assets when determining financial orders appurtenant to dissolution proceedings. ... A trial court acts as the trier of fact when it evaluates the marital estate and determines each party\u2019s equitable share.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 287. \u201cThe purpose of a property division pursuant to a dissolution proceeding is to unscramble existing marital property in order to give each spouse his or her equitable share at the time of dissolution. ... By comparison, the purpose of both periodic and lump sum alimony is to provide continuing support. . . . Hence, once the marital property is divided, the court has fulfilled its responsibility, and, therefore, continuing jurisdiction over divided marital property does not further the goal of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">We conclude that capital gains generated by an asset distributed in the dissolution decree do not fall within the purview of \u00a7 46b-86, and by implication, \u00a7 46b-82. This is so because the capital gain is merely the appreciation of property previously distributed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81. The court does not have continuing jurisdiction over property distributed at the time of dissolution; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86; and therefore cannot consider the appreciation of such property in its inquiry pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46b-86 and 46b-82. See also <em>Schorsch </em>v. <em>Schorsch, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 385 (mere exchange of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>asset awarded as property in dissolution decree for cash does not transform property into income).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">We must now determine whether capital gains realized on property acquired by the plaintiff after the dissolution is income for purposes of \u00a7 46b-82. We conclude that if the asset is property that was acquired by the plaintiff after the dissolution and, therefore, not distributed as part of the property assignment, then it is income that must be considered by the court in an alimony modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">\u201cA conclusion that there has been a substantial change in financial circumstances justifying a modification of alimony based only on income is erroneous; rather, the present overall circumstances of the parties must be compared with the circumstances existing at the time of the original award to determine if there has been substantial change.\u201d 24A Am. Jur. 2d, Divorce and Separation \u00a7 826 (1998).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">\u201cA substantial increase in the dependent spouse\u2019s separate property or estate, such as by gift or inheritance, may justify a reduction in alimony.\u201d Id., \u00a7 833. \u201cThe fact that the wile has acquired a substantial amount of property, or that her property has increased in value, after the entry of a decree for alimony or maintenance is an important consideration in determining whether and to what extent the decree should be modified.\u201d Annot, 18 A.L.R.2d 10, 74, \u00a7 23 (1951). \u201cA single factor, such as an increase in property values, is generally not enough by itself for a court to modify a support award. When an increase in income or assets of the payee-spouse is combined with other factors, such as a decrease in the supporting spouse\u2019s ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>to pay or the emancipation of a child, changed circumstances may justify modification.\u201d A. Rutkin, Family Law and Practice (1990) \u00a7 52.02 (2) (b). Furthermore, \u201c[p]rior property divisions rarely have provided grounds for support modifications. This is true even if the property award subsequently is shown to have a negative impact upon the movant.\u201d Id., \u00a7 52.02 (2) (a) (iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u201cModification of an alimony award may be proper where either the needs of the recipient spouse or the financial ability of the obligor spouse to pay alimony have changed since the original award was made, as well as where the financial circumstances of both parties have changed. . . . Furthermore, as is true for changes in circumstances more generally, temporary fluctuations in the financial circumstances of the parties normally do not afford a basis for such a modification.\u201d 24A Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 825. \u201cTrial courts should be vested with broad discretion to fashion approaches which will achieve the most equitable results under the facts of each case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wendt </em>v. <em>Wendt, </em>supra, 59 Conn. App. 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The plaintiff argues that her capital gains do not constitute income for purposes of modification of an alimony order. In her argument, the plaintiff finds support in <em>Schorsch </em>v. <em>Schorsch, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 378, <em>Denley </em>v. <em>Denley, </em>38 Conn. App. 349, 661 A.2d 628 (1995), and <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>25 Conn. App. 231, 593 A.2d 161, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 335 (1991). Relying on <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>220 Conn. 372, 381-83, 599 A.2d 14 (1991), the defendant argues that increases in assets of any sort may form an appropriate reason to modify alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Although we have found no precedent governing the precise issue presently before us, we are persuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>that capital gains realized on the sale of an asset acquired after dissolution may be considered by a court in determining whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances. The case law cited by both parties is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">In <em>Simms, </em>the plaintiff sought modification of alimony on the basis of moneys received by the defendant in exchange for United States treasury bonds that he held at the time of the divorce. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 25 Conn. App. 232-33. This court held that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s redemption of the treasury bonds, which he received when he withdrew his share of the capital assets of Bear, Stems and Company, was, as the defendant contends, merely an exchange of assets.\u201d Id., 235. We reasoned that \u201c[although a dramatic increase in the income of one of the parties may constitute a substantial change in circumstances, an increase in the value of assets ordinarily will not.\u201d Id., 234. Furthermore, the defendant declared his capital account as an asset on his financial affidavit. We concluded that \u201cif the capital account is an asset, the defendant\u2019s redemption of the treasury bonds, which he received as a distribution of his capital account, could not be a substantial change in circumstances and could not support a modification of alimony.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In <em>Denley, </em>the plaintiff also sought a modification of alimony, arguing that because he had lost an important client, his income had decreased substantially. <em>Denley </em>v. <em>Denley, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 350. The court denied the motion for modification based, in part, on its inclusion of the profit that the plaintiff had received through the redemption of stock options that had been awarded to him at the time of the dissolution. Id. This court agreed with the plaintiff that \u201cbecause he was awarded the stock options as property in the dissolution decree, any money that he received from the exercise of those stock options was simply a conversion of an asset and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>should not have been considered income by the trial court for purposes of assessing whether there had been a substantial change in circumstances.\u201d Id., 353. This court held that the trial court improperly included the redemption of the stock options in income, reasoning that the \u201cmere exchange of an asset awarded as property in a dissolution decree, for cash, the liquid form of the asset, does not transform the property into income.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Similarly, in <em>Schorsch, </em>the defendant filed a motion for modification of alimony claiming a substantial change in circumstances. <em>Schorsch </em>v. <em>Schorsch, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 380. The defendant, however, was receiving payments toward a purchase money mortgage that he held after the sale of real property awarded to him in the dissolution decree. The trial court considered both the principal and interest payments received by the defendant when it denied his motion for modification. This court reversed the trial court on this ground because the principal balance paid on the purchase money mortgage represented the proceeds from the sale of an asset awarded to the defendant at the time of the dissolution. We held that \u201cthe principal payments that the defendant is receiving on the purchase money mortgage he holds is merely an exchange of assets and may not be included in the calculation of his income.\u201d Id., 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The defendant argues to the contrary and finds support in <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 372. In <em>Bartlett, </em>the defendant was the beneficiary of a revocable trust, the proceeds of which were to be distributed to him upon his mother\u2019s death. Id., 374. Because the trust was revocable and its assets had not yet vested in the defendant, the court did not consider the trust proceeds when it first established the amount of alimony to which the plaintiff was entitled. Id., 373-74. Following the death of the defendant\u2019s mother, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>plaintiff sought a modification of alimony, claiming that because the defendant had received the inheritance there was a substantial change in circumstances since the original divorce decree. Id., 374. Our Supreme Court agreed with the plaintiff and held that because the defendant\u2019s inheritance vested upon the death of his mother, \u201cthe trial court was bound to consider that inheritance in ruling on the motion for an increase in alimony, despite the fact that the assets of the inheritance had not yet been distributed to him.\u201d Id., 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We conclude that the appreciation of an asset that was distributed at the time of the dissolution does not constitute a change in circumstances that the court may consider when deciding whether to entertain a motion for modification of alimony. Furthermore, such an increase in the value of an asset cannot be used as a factor to determine the amount by which alimony is to be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In the present case, the court held that there was a bona fide retirement and, further, that there was a substantial change in the circumstances of the plaintiff. The court first found that the defendant\u2019s net income was $28,228 more per year than the plaintiffs gross income at the time of the dissolution. After noting that the defendant had not experienced a significant change in his net income, the court found that the plaintiff had an increase in net income of $37,492 per year from 1996. In its calculation, the court included $11,430 per year representing the income from capital gains.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>however, did not make a finding as to when the assets generating the capital gains were acquired.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">If the assets were held by the plaintiff at the time of the decree, the court considered conditions antecedent to the last modification, e.g., the dissolution decree, and thereby applied an incorrect legal standard in determining whether there had been a substantial change of circumstances warranting modification. Accordingly, the court must first determine whether the plaintiff acquired the assets generating the capital gains prior or subsequent to the dissolution decree. Therefore, the court\u2019s modification of the dissolution decree without first so doing was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">As a final note, we are mindful that capital gains may easily be manipulated by the owner of the asset and are temporary in nature. Further, the capital gains may vary drastically year to year for legitimate reasons. Trial courts have, however, \u201cwide latitude and equitable powers when determining financial orders pursuant to dissolution actions because they require extremely fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>sensitive resolutions.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 284-85. Our decision today does not mandate that the court modify alimony in all cases where a party has realized a capital gain, but merely to consider the gain as part of its inquiry. In the event that the gain constitutes a substantial change in circumstances, the laws of this state compel the court to modify the existing alimony order. The court should be mindful of the transitory nature of capital gains and careful not to eliminate completely the payment of alimony is cases such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The judgment is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the assets generating the plaintiffs capital gains were acquired prior to or subsequent to the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">In this opinion FLYNN, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-10\"> Section 8 of the parties\u2019 agreement and stipulation for judgment dated December 20,1996, states in relevant part: \u201cA.

I respectfully disagree with the resolution of this case because I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that capital gains may properly be considered as income under some circumstances for the purposes of modification. At the outset, the majority states that the resolution of this issue requires an examination of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-82 and 46b-81 because capital gain is income derived from the sale of property. I do not believe that \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82 are the only sources of authority that we may rely on to answer this question. Those provisions concern the assignment of property and alimony at the time of dissolution. The majority concludes that they do not answer the question that is presently before us. The majority next looks to the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cincome\u201d and determines that capital gain is income based on various dictionary and code definitions of \u201cincome,\u201d \u201ccapital gain\u201d and \u201cgross income.\u201d I am not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Although the issue of whether capital gain constitutes income for purposes of modification apparently has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>been decided by this court or our Supreme Court, I conclude that capital gain, however generated, is not properly considered as income. With regard to capital gain generated by an asset distributed in the dissolution, I conclude that such gain is not income. I reach this conclusion on the basis of an analogous line of cases that hold that the profit recovered by conversion of a noncash asset into cash is not income. See <em>Schorsch </em>v. <em>Schorsch, </em>53 Conn. App. 378, 386, 731 A.2d 330 (1999) (principal payments on purchase money mortgage merely an exchange of assets and may not be included in calculation of income); <em>Denley </em>v. <em>Denley, </em>38 Conn. App. 349, 353, 661 A.2d 628 (1995) (exchange of stock options for cash does not transform property into income); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>25 Conn. App. 231, 235, 593 A.2d 161 (exchange of bonds for cash was merely exchange of assets, not income), cert. denied, 220 Conn. 911, 597 A.2d 335 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Although these cases did not decide the precise issue before us, they stand for the proposition that the conversion of an asset from one form into another does not constitute income. I conclude, as is consistent with the rationale of these cases, that capital gain from the sale of assets acquired at dissolution is nothing more than a conversion of noncash assets to cash and should not be included in income for purposes of modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">I also conclude that capital gain generated from an asset acquired subsequent to the dissolution is not income. While it is true that in this latter situation the asset was acquired after the dissolution, I reach this conclusion by further analogy to the principles cited previously. As our case law makes clear, a conversion of an asset from one form to another does not constitute the creation of income. Implicit in this conclusion is the underlying concept that the growth in value of the asset distributed at dissolution is not income when it is converted to another form. Rather, the growth, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>resulting cash value when converted, simply represents the accrual in value of that asset itself. In other words, the category the item falls into, namely, either \u201ccapital asset\u201d or \u201cincome,\u201d does not change because the asset has appreciated in value and then is converted as a matter of form.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">I do not believe that this principle becomes any less applicable when considering assets acquired after a dissolution. I do not believe, therefore, that the exchange of a capital asset, whenever acquired, for cash transforms that asset into income. Guided by the case law, I conclude that the appreciation of a capital asset acquired after dissolution, and its conversion in form, merely adds to the asset and represents the accrual of value in the asset itself. The category of the item does not change from capital asset to income because there has been an appreciation and conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">On the basis of this conclusion, I note that while I do not agree that the capital gain is income, I do agree with the majority that the appreciation of assets acquired after dissolution may properly be considered as assets of a party\u2019s estate in the court\u2019s determination of whether a modification is appropriate, whether or not the asset has been converted into a different form. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>66 Conn. App. 657, 665, 785 A.2d 1162 (same \u00a7 46b-82 criteria are relevant in deciding whether decree may be modified as are relevant in making initial award of alimony), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 901, 789 A.2d 990 (2001). I also note that in my opinion the majority\u2019s conclusion creates the potential for radically underinflated or overinflated modifications because of the frequent fluctuations in the value of capital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In the present case, the defendant asserted a change in circumstances based on a change in the plaintiffs relative income status and assets. In ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court improperly considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>plaintiffs capital gains as income. While both income status and assets, or capital gains from the assets, properly may have been taken into consideration by the court, each must be assessed individually. For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority. I would reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial with direction to the court to consider the assets acquired after dissolution separately from its consideration of income.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
