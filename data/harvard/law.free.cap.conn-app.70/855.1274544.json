In October, 1998, the victim, Emil Szymczak, was employed as the superintendent of an apartment building at 38 Main Street in New Britain. As part of his duties, Szymczak collected rent payments from tenants. On the evening of October 5, 1998, as he drove his car into the parking lot behind the apartment building, Szymczak saw the defendant, who resided in the building, sitting in a motor vehicle. Prior to that evening, Szymczak had attempted, without success, to collect overdue rent payments from the defendant. Szymczak walked to the defendant\u2019s vehicle and, through the open operator\u2019s side window, asked the defendant about the overdue rent. In response, the defendant handed Szymczak a piece of paper that presumably indicated that he was waiting for money from the state. As Szymczak was reading the paper, the defendant picked up a twenty ounce hammer that was in the vehicle and forcefully struck Szymczak with it twice on the forehead. Szymczak grabbed the hammer and struggled with the defendant for control of it. William Colon, a resident of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>apartment building who witnessed the incident, called the New Britain police after both men called out to him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">When the police arrived at the scene, the defendant and Szymczak were still struggling for control of the hammer. Szymczak then let go of the hammer, and Officer Brian Pearson ordered the defendant to put the hammer down. Pearson had to repeat this order three or four times before the defendant complied. Pearson also ordered the defendant to exit his vehicle. After exiting his vehicle, the defendant told Pearson that Szymczak had asked him for rent money, that he did not have as much as Szymczak wanted, and that when Szymczak kept asking for the money he hit Szymczak twice with the hammer. At that time, the defendant stated that he had not been threatened by Szymczak.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">As a result of the altercation, Szymczak appeared \u201cdazed and pale\u201d and he suffered two bloody, golf ball-sized welts on his forehead. Despite his condition, Szymczak refused medical assistance because he said he had no health insurance and could not afford to pay for treatment. At the time of the trial, he testified that he still suffered headaches and had numbness in his arms as a result of being struck with the hammer.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged in a four count information with attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-49 (a) (2), assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), carrying a dangerous weapon in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-206 and carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of \u00a7 29-38. At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal as to all counts. The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion as to the first count, attempt to commit assault in the first degree, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>the third count, carrying a dangerous weapon. With respect to the first count, the court concluded that the state had failed to present evidence that would support a finding by the trier of fact that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim. With respect to the third count, the court concluded that there was no evidence that the defendant, at any time, had the hammer on his person. After the completion of the trial, the jury convicted the defendant of the two remaining counts. The court sentenced the defendant to two concurrent sentences of five years, execution suspended, with five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support his conviction of assault in the second degree and carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle. We agree with the defendant only as to his conviction of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. ... As we have often noted, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt . . . nor does proof beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>doubt require acceptance of every hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant that, had it been found credible by the trier, would have resulted in an acquittal. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 224-25, 733 A.2d 156 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of assault in the second degree. Specifically, the defendant contends that the state failed to prove that the hammer, under the circumstances in which it was used, was capable of causing death or serious physical injury and, therefore, it failed to prove, as it was required to, that the hammer, as actually used, was a dangerous instrument. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">To prove the defendant guilty of assault in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2), the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, with intent to cause physical injury to Szymczak, caused such injury to Szymczak by means of a dangerous instrument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (7) defines \u201cdangerous instrument\u201d in relevant part as \u201cany instrument . . . which, under the circumstances in which it is used ... is capable of causing death or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (4), in turn, defines \u201cserious physical injury\u201d as \u201cphysical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement, serious impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>ment of health or serious loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">As previously indicated, the state charged the defendant with attempt to commit assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and 53a-49 (a) (2). Section 53a-59 (a) (1) requires, inter aha, proof of \u201cintent to cause serious physical injury to another person . . . by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u2019\u2019In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the charge of attempt to commit assault in the first degree, the court found that the state failed to present evidence that would support a finding that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim. The defendant claims on the basis of that finding and the fact that the court\u2019s jury charge on self-defense did not include an instruction on justification for the use of deadly physical force, that the court determined that the hammer was not used in a manner that was capable of causing serious physical injury. This claim is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The fact that the court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to the victim does not foreclose a finding by the jury that the hammer as used was capable of causing serious physical injury. Proof of intent to cause serious physical injury is quite different from proof that a hammer is capable of causing serious physical injury. A conclusion that the hammer, when used to strike the victim on the head, was not capable of causing serious physical injury would have been truly astonishing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>\u201cUnder \u00a7 53a-3 (7), in order for an instrument to be considered dangerous, it need only be used in a manner capable of causing serious injury under the circumstances\u201d and, therefore, \u201c[t]he facts and circumstances need show only that the general way in which the object was used could <em>potentially </em>have resulted in serious physical injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>38 Conn. App. 868, 880-81, 663 A.2d 1085 (1995). We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the hammer, as used, was a dangerous instrument. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of assault in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The defendant also claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">Section 29-38 prohibits a person from carrying in a motor vehicle any weapon specifically named in the statute or \u201cany other dangerous or deadly weapon or instrument\u201d without a permit or registration. Experience has shown, and cases have recognized, that an almost infinite number of seemingly innocuous implements can, by the circumstances and manner of their use, become dangerous instruments. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Prat, </em>66 Conn. App. 91, 102-103, 784 A.2d 367 (2001) (baseball bat); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>64 Conn. App. 208, 214, 779 A.2d 233 (2001) (crowbar); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>53 Conn. App. 581, 591, 734 A.2d 991 (metal vacuum cleaner pipe, screw driver, ice pick, two by four, cane, scissors, television antenna), cert. denied, 250 Conn. 918, 738 A.2d 659 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rozmyslowicz, </em>52 Conn. App. 149, 154, 726 A.2d 142 (1999) (steak knife). A hammer is just such an innocuous implement that is not considered a dangerous instrument unless it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>intended to be used as such. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Killenger, </em>193 Conn. 48, 55, 475 A.2d 276 (1984). Accordingly, it is not a crime to have a hammer in a motor vehicle unless it is intended to be used as a dangerous instrument or for some other illicit purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In the present case, there was no evidence to suggest that the defendant ever intended to use the hammer to strike the victim until the moment he did so. While it is true that intent may be formed in an instant; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 444, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993); there is no evidence that the defendant was carrying the hammer in his vehicle with the intent to use it as a dangerous instrument. Accordingly, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused to instruct the jury that self-defense was applicable to the charge of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle. Because we concluded in part I of this opinion that there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle, it is unnecessary for us to address this claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding self-defense in relation to the charge of assault in the second degree. Specifically, the defendant claims that, in its instructions on self-defense, the court improperly instructed the jury, in effect, that the defendant\u2019s use of nondeadly physical force would be justified only if the defendant believed that the use of such force was \u201cunavoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial. He maintains, however, that his claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We will review this claim because the record is adequate for review and an allegation of an improper jury instruction on an element of self-defense is of constitutional dimension. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>231 Conn. 484, 493, 651 A.2d 247 (1994). We conclude, however, that the alleged constitutional violation did not clearly exist and did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial and, therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">\u201cAn improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>constitutional dimension. . . . [T]he standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether the jury was misled, [i]t is well established that [a] charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result. . . . The charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>254 Conn. 184, 194, 756 A.2d 274 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The court instructed the jury that \u201caperson is justified in the use of reasonable physical force upon another person when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself from . . . the imminent use of force\u201d by another person. The court explained that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, insofar as it is applicable to this case, provides that \u201ca person is justified when using reasonable physical force upon another person to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the . . . imminent use of physical force and he may use such degree of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary for such purpose.\u201d The court further explained that there \u201cneed not be an actual threat or an assault. The test is not what the other person actually intended, but what the aggressor\u2019s act caused the defendant ... to reasonably believe . . . was his intention . . . .\u201d The court then stated: \u201cIn other words, the danger need not have been actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>if the defendant reasonably believed that the danger was actual, real, imminent or <em>unavoidable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The defendant claims that the court\u2019s inclusion of the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in its charge may have misled the jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">\u201cIt is generally agreed that one who can safely retreat is not required to do so before using <em>nondeadly </em>force in self-defense.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 529, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993). Indeed, \u00a7 53a-19<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> contains no such requirement to justify the use of nondeadly physical force in self-defense. It is the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>of deadly physical force which is not justified if the necessity for using it can be avoided with complete safety by retreating, by surrendering property claimed by the other or by complying with certain demands. See footnote 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">In the present case, the court used the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in its instructions on self-defense in explaining to the jury that the danger faced by the defendant need not be real if the defendant reasonably believed that it was \u201cactual, real, imminent or unavoidable.\u201d It did not charge the jury that the defendant\u2019s use of physical force was justified only if he believed that use of such force was unavoidable, and, in expressing his claim in this way, the defendant has misstated the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense by taking a portion of the instructions out of context. Indeed, the court did not instruct the jury that the defendant had a duty to avoid the use of physical force by retreating, giving up property or acceding to demands if it could be avoided with complete safety. The word \u201cunavoidable\u201d was used in describing the danger perceived by the defendant, not the necessity for the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">We conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s single use of the word \u201cunavoidable\u201d in its instructions on self-defense. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding intent by reading the entire definition of intent set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (ll),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> including a portion which is not relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>to the charge of assault in the second degree. He claims that it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s improper instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">Although the defendant concedes that this claim was not properly preserved at trial, he again maintains that his claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We will review this claim because the record is adequate for review and an allegation of an improper instruction on an element of an offense is of constitutional dimension. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>259 Conn. 799, 806, 792 A.2d 86 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">As previously stated, the standard of review for a claim of an improper instruction on an element of an offense is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amado, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">The court instructed the jury on intent, in part, as follows: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the second degree when with the intent to cause physical injury to another person he causes such injury by means of a dangerous instrument or deadly weapon. . . . The first element is intent to cause physical injury. You must be satisfied that the defendant intended to cause physical injury to his victim, that is, Mr. Szymczak. This raises the issue of the defendant\u2019s intent, that\u2019s an important word as to that first element, and our statute provides that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result or to conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or engage in such conduct. Intentional conduct is conduct that is purposeful rather than conduct that is accidental or inadvertent.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">3= =H</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">\u201cNow the term \u2018physical injury\u2019 \u2014 remember I just said that the first element is an intent to cause physical injury \u2014 so physical injury the meaning of that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>important. What it means is, under our statute, the impairment of physical condition or pain. No particular degree of the impairment of one\u2019s physical condition and no particular degree of pain is required, but that\u2019s an element, intent to cause physical injury which includes pain . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">The court later instructed the jury that to convict the defendant of assault in the second degree, \u201cthe burden of the state is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: One, that the defendant had the intent to cause physical injury to another person, Mr. Szymczak; two, that he did cause that physical injury; three, that he did so by the use of a dangerous instrument, in this case we\u2019re talking about the hammer; and fourth, that he was not acting in self-defense. ... So if you find that the state has proven all of these elements of assault in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 and let me just review them just one last time. In order for you to find the defendant guilty of assault in the second degree, you must find, one, that the defendant had the intent to cause physical injury to another person; that he caused physical injury; and that he did so by using a dangerous instrument; and that the defendant was not, at the time, acting in self-defense. If you find that the state has proven all of those elements beyond a reasonable doubt, then your verdict would be guilty on this count. If, however, you do not find all of the elements proven beyond a reasonable doubt, your verdict would be not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">We agree with the defendant that the portion of the statutory definition of intent relating to intent to engage in proscribed conduct is not relevant to the charge of assault in the second degree, and, therefore, the issue is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s reference to that portion of the definition. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The defendant claims that the present case is indistinguishable from <em>State </em>v. <em>DeBarros, </em>58 Conn. App. 673, 755 A.2d 303, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 931, 761 A.2d 756 (2000), in which this court reversed the defendant\u2019s murder conviction on the basis of an improper jury instruction. In <em>DeBarros, </em>the trial court read the entire statutory definition of intent to the jury, including an improper reference to intent to engage in proscribed conduct. This court determined that \u201c[i]t is reasonably possible that the jury was misled because the probable effect of the improper charge was that it guided the jury to an incorrect verdict. The trial court not only improperly read the intent to \u2018engage in conduct\u2019 language in its initial and two supplemental charges, it also improperly referred back to that language seven times throughout its instructions to the jury.\u201d Id., 682-83. In <em>DeBarros, </em>\u201cthe trial court\u2019s improper instructions were too numerous to be rectified by the court\u2019s proper instructions. In total, the court either read or referred back to the improper instruction ten times.\u201d Id., 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">This court recently examined a similar issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>63 Conn. App. 529, 777 A.2d 704, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 936, 776 A.2d 1151 (2001). In that case, the state charged the defendant with murder. During its charge, the court improperly referred to intent to engage in proscribed conduct twice within the same sentence. \u201cThe instruction, however, properly referred to the intent to cause a result, death, on five occasions, twice when reading the statutory definition of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-54a (a) and three additional times as a prerequisite to finding the defendant guilty of the crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 535. The court in <em>Rodriguez </em>therefore determined that it was not reasonably possible that the charge misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">The improper instruction in this case is more analogous to that of <em>Rodriguez </em>than <em>DeBarros. </em>Here, the trial court improperly referred to intent to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>proscribed conduct only once in its instructions. Moreover, its instructions properly referred to the intent to cause a result, physical injury, on six occasions. Accordingly, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The judgment is reversed only as to the conviction of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty of that crime and to vacate the portion of the defendant\u2019s sentence associated with that count.

In a rather convoluted argument, the defendant contends that because the court in its instructions on the charge of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle informed the jury that possession and use of the hammer as a dangerous instrument was illegal, the jury may have been misled into concluding that \u201cit would not be reasonable to use an illegal weapon in defense of oneself.\u201d We reject the defendant\u2019s argument as speculative and wholly without merit because there is absolutely no indication that the court\u2019s instructions on self-defense were in any way misleading as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">The defendant also claims that, if self-defense does not apply to the charge of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle, then, in the circumstances of this case, \u00a7 29-38 violates his right to bear arms as guaranteed by article first, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\u00a7 15, of the constitution of Connecticut.
