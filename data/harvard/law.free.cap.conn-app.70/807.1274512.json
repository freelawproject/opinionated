We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>The following facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. The defendant was arrested on May 2,1997, and charged in connection with the July 24, 1996 shooting death of Hayfield \u201cPit Bull\u201d Hemly. A codefendant, Marlon Hamilton, was arrested at the same time and charged with having committed the same offenses. Although the defendant and Hamilton were to begin their joint trial in May, 1999, the court instead severed the trials. Subsequently, Hamilton entered a guilty plea to the charge of assault in the first degree in exchange for his cooperation with the state. According to the terms of the plea agreement, Hamilton would not be sentenced until the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial began on October 18, 1999. On November 2,1999, the defendant attempted to call Hamilton as a witness to testify about exculpatory information concerning crimes with which the defendant was charged. Hamilton invoked his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer defense counsel\u2019s questions. The defendant sought a continuance of the trial until after Hamilton was sentenced, anticipating that the protections afforded to Hamilton would no longer be available. The court denied the request. On November 12, 1999, the jury convicted the defendant of the crimes of assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree. The court sentenced the defendant to forty-five years imprisonment, suspended after thirty-five years, and five years probation. Specifically, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty years on the basis of the assault conviction, plus a five year sentence enhancement, pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k, consecutive to that twenty years, and twenty years consecutive, execution suspended after ten years, for the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">The defendant first claims that the court violated his due process rights under the fifth amendment of the United States constitution in denying his request for a continuance of his trial until Hamilton was sentenced. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The defendant contends that the denial of his request for a continuance infringed on his right to offer the testimony of a witness and violated his right to due process of law. Although not fully stated as such, his claim alleges a violation not only of his fifth amendment due process rights, but also his sixth amendment right to present a defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Hamilton had accused Steve Nelson of stealing marijuana from him the week before the shooting. Nelson and the victim had met with Hamilton several days before the shooting and attempted to explain to Hamilton that someone else had stolen the drugs. During the meeting, Nelson and the victim flashed their guns. During the late evening of July 24, 1996, the victim and Nelson drove to Adams Street in Hartford, where they met with friends. The defendant and Hamilton arrived separately later in the evening. Thereafter, Nelson and the victim became involved in a melee with the defendant and Hamilton over the stolen marijuana, which precipitated the shooting death of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>At trial, the state called several witnesses to testify about the events of the evening. Five people present at the scene of the shooting testified for the state, including Nelson, Steve O\u2019Meally, Michael Lawrence, Joseph Lindsey and Franz Murray. A sixth witness, Oreville Lipscome, also testified for the state. Nelson, the first witness called by the state, testified that he witnessed the fight. He stated that he was about two feet from the victim as Hamilton and the defendant began to \u201cbeat\u201d and \u201cstrike\u201d the victim in the head with guns, and that he tried to intervene. Nelson testified further that after about thirty seconds, the victim broke away from his assailants and ran along the street. Nelson testified that he chased and ran past the victim, heard shots and looked back to see the victim lying in the street. Nelson did not see the shots fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The remaining witnesses all testified that Hemly was beaten, or \u201cpistol-whipped,\u201d prior to fleeing along Adams Street, and that he was shot while running and that he fell in the street. All of those witnesses testified that the defendant had a gun at the time of the shooting, and all except Lipscombe stated that the defendant had \u201cpistol-whipped\u201d the victim. Several witnesses stated that Hamilton also struck the victim, either with a gun or with his fists. During the fight, a shot was fired and everyone fled. All but one of the witnesses to the shooting also testified that the defendant alone shot the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The testimony established that the victim ran along the street as the defendant moved into the middle of the street, dropped to his knees and fired two to four shots at the victim. The state rested its case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>on November 1,1999, without calling Hamilton to testify against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The defense began its case on November 2,1999. The next day, the defendant informed the court, outside of the presence of the jury, that he intended to call Hamilton to the witness stand. Hamilton\u2019s attorney informed the court that Hamilton\u2019s case was pending and that he intended to refuse to answer questions on fifth amendment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> grounds. The defense then called Hamilton to the witness stand, and he invoked his fifth amendment protections.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court upheld Hamilton\u2019s assertion of his fifth amendment protections. It also denied the defendant\u2019s request to have Hamilton exercise that privilege with the jury present.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>200 Conn. 310, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986), the defendant sought a continuance until after Hamilton\u2019s sentencing, arguing that Hamilton would no longer have a fifth amendment privilege at that time. The defendant contended that by continuing Hamilton\u2019s sentencing until after the defendant\u2019s trial, the state had created an \u201cartificial sentencing date,\u201d preventing the defendant from calling Hamilton as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">In response, the state explained its plea agreement with Hamilton and its bearing on its case against the defendant. Unsure whether the witnesses identified in the file would be available at the defendant\u2019s trial and convinced of the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the killing, the state decided to ensure that it would have the testimony sufficient to convict by offering Hamilton the plea agreement. He agreed, and on May 28, 1999, gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>a statement to the police describing the events leading to and including the shooting, and describing his and the defendant\u2019s roles. The plea agreement called for Hamilton to plead guilty to one count of assault in the first degree while leaving the other counts open. On the day that Hamilton was to give his statement, defense counsel informed the state\u2019s attorney that he possessed some \u201ccoded\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> letters written by Hamilton and addressed to the defendant, which he believed inculpated Hamilton in the shooting. The state ordered its inspector to review the letters with Hamilton and thereafter concluded that they contained no inference of admissions by Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The state then summarized the situation, stating that \u201cthat\u2019s where we stand now. ... He pleaded to one count. It was continued by the court for sentencing to ensure, now it has nothing to do with anything else, to ensure his continued cooperation with me. [The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office] [didn\u2019t] want to sentence him beforehand for fear he might turn around and say something different.\u201d Ultimately, the state did not call Hamilton to testily. The state informed the court that it decided not to call him because of the last minute availability of testimony from Lawrence and Kevin Pinnette, a witness who came forward subsequent to the Hamilton plea agreement. The prosecutor stated that \u201c[h]ad [the state] had them in the first place, [it] never would have made [the plea] agreement with [Hamilton\u2019s attorney].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The defendant argued that delaying Hamilton\u2019s sentencing violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights in that his light to defend himself outweighed Hamilton\u2019s rights. In support of his claim, the defendant argued that the state could have given Hamilton immunity or could have called him as its witness. The state responded that it had intended to call Hamilton as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>witness, but that Hamilton\u2019s counsel had advised him to invoke the fifth amendment and that the state had not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The court denied the request for a continuance, although it clearly appreciated the complexity of the question involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court then granted the defendant\u2019s request that the letters purportedly from. Hamilton to the defendant be marked as exhibits for identification. The defendant called an inspector from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to give testimony authenticating Hamilton\u2019s statement on the theory that it was exculpatory to the defendant<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and against Hamilton\u2019s penal interest. The state objected to the statement on the ground of inadmissible hearsay, but the court overruled the objection. The court noted, inter alia, that the conspiracy charges against Hamilton still were open, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>that the statement put Hamilton at the scene of the crime and that it could, therefore, be construed as against his penal interest despite Hamilton\u2019s plea agreement as to the assault charge. The statement described the events leading to and including the shooting and, ultimately, implicated the defendant in the killing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">At sentencing, the defendant sought a judgment of acquittal on the ground that by setting an uncertain, future sentencing date for Hamilton, and denying the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance on that basis, the court deprived him of his due process rights. The court denied the motion, citing its earlier ruling on the motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We begin by articulating the appropriate standard of review. As the defendant correctly notes, the <em>Williams </em>court stated that \u201cthe matter of a continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge which will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse. ... It is not every denial of a request for a continuance that violates due process. . . . [T]he right of a defendant to a continuance is not absolute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 320. We also note that subsequent to <em>Williams, </em>our Supreme Court clarified the procedure for evaluating a court\u2019s exercise of discretion in ruling on a motion for a continuance. \u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance was arbitrary. . . . There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>judge at the time the request is denied.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 240, 636 A.2d 760 (1994), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>198 Conn. 43, 47-48, 501 A.2d 752 (1985). The <em>Hamilton </em>court went on to note with approval a list, albeit not an exhaustive one, of several factors that the trial court may consider in exercising its discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The factors include \u201cthe timeliness of the request for continuance; the <em>likely </em>length of the delay; the age and complexity of the case; the granting of other continuances in the past; the impact of delay on the litigants, witnesses, opposing counsel and the court; the perceived legitimacy of the reasons proffered in support of the request; the defendant\u2019s personal responsibility for the timing of the request; the likelihood that the denial would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 240.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The Supreme Court clarified \u201cthat an appellate court should limit its assessment of the reasonableness of the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to a consideration of those factors, on the record, that were presented to the trial court, or of which that court was aware, at the time of its ruling on the motion for a continuance.\u201d Id., 242. Accordingly, in addressing the defendant\u2019s arguments we also will address the relevant factors previously listed that the record before us discloses.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>The defendant, quoting <em>State </em>v. Williams, supra, 200 Conn. 320, argues on appeal that once the court permitted Hamilton to invoke his fifth amendment privilege during the defendant\u2019s trial, \u201cthe unique interest that the defendant had in a continuance in order to get that testimony before the trial jury became more significant.\u201d Although the <em>Williams </em>court found that the trial court in that case had abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance; id., 321; it did so after considering at least two of the factors that later were collected and discussed in <em>Hamilton. </em>The sole fact that the codefendant invoked the fifth amendment privilege in this case, while clearly calling for the court\u2019s careful resolution of the issue presented, does not necessarily demand that the court grant the continuance. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 84-87, 355 A.2d 6 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>45 Conn. App. 282, 286-87, 696 A.2d 352 (1997). After our review, we conclude that <em>Williams </em>is distinguishable on its facts from the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">First, we note that in <em>Williams </em>the joint trial of the defendant and his codefendant was severed on the defendant\u2019s motion. Specifically, the defendant wanted to call his codefendant to testify, consistent with the defendant\u2019s previous statement to the police, that he lacked an accomplice in the robbery for which they both were accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Here, the defendant waited until the state concluded its case to make his request, thereby implicating the timeliness of the request. The defendant argues that although he did not attempt to call Hamilton until the state rested its case on November 1, 1999, that should not count against him, as he had assumed all along that the state would call Hamilton. He also argues that the state\u2019s tactical choice not to call Hamilton should not be sanctioned as a means to prevent the defendant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>calling that witness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant argues that \u201c[t]his was the first opportunity to raise this issue, as the state had not advised the defense of its changed position prior to its decision not to call Hamilton as a witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In response, the state places the responsibility squarely on the defendant for any perceived disadvantage that was worked on him due to the timing of his request. The state notes that the defendant made no effort to secure Hamilton\u2019s testimony until the trial was almost over. Specifically, the state argues that the defendant made a tactical choice in relying on Hamilton to cooperate and testify for the state, which would have permitted the defendant to cross-examine Hamilton at that time. The fact that the state decided not to call him is no more the genesis of the defendant\u2019s perceived disadvantage than the defendant\u2019s failure to urge the court to schedule his trial after Hamilton\u2019s sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>We agree with the state that \u201chad the defendant, who had Hamilton\u2019s \u2018coded\u2019 letters in May of 1999, deemed Hamilton\u2019s testimony critical to his defense, he could have\u201d sought the schedule change and avoided the added burden of asking the court for a midtrial continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"><em>Williams </em>also addressed the \u201clikelihood that the denial would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 240. In <em>Williams, </em>the court specifically stated that after sentencing, the witness \u201ccould no longer have validly invoked his federal constitutional fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination as to those crimes for which he was sentenced.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 321. Here, the defendant appears to assume that had his case been continued until after Hamilton\u2019s sentencing, Hamilton would then have had no valid reason to assert his fifth amendment privilege. The state correctly points out, however, that the defendant failed to make a record that Hamilton would waive his fifth amendment privilege after his sentencing pursuant to his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The state also argues that Hamilton may well have continued to rely on his fifth amendment privilege. The state supports that contention with several salient points. Among them are that had Hamilton confessed to having shot the victim, the state could have prosecuted him on the murder charge; see <em>In re Keijam T., </em>226 Conn. 497, 504-505, 628 A.2d 562 (1993); or on other charges that remained open pursuant to the plea agreement. The court appears to have considered that scenario less likely than Hamilton\u2019s simply refusing to testily because the state probably would leave the other charges open to ensure his cooperation, namely, testilying consistently with his statement. The state also argues that if Hamilton gave testimony inconsistent with the statement that he made in his plea agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>implicating the defendant, he might have been subject to perjury charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Other aspects of the record reveal the court\u2019s consideration of the \u201clikelihood that the denial [of the request for a continuance] would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 240. The defendant claims that Hamilton\u2019s testimony was crucial in that it would have introduced exculpatory testimony. Specifically, the defendant argues that Hamilton made an admission in his coded letters that he had committed the crime. The state responded that the defendant failed to make any showing that the letters contained exculpatory information. The state, through its inspector, reviewed the letters with Hamilton and stated that \u201c[Hamilton] gave me an interpretation through [the inspector,] which throws out any inference of admissions.\u201d The record before the court provided no showing that the proposed testimony would exculpate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">In contrast, the trial court in <em>Williams </em>was aware from the commencement of the trial in that case of the intention of the defendant to rely on known exculpatory testimony. In <em>Williams, </em>the state turned over the \u201cexculpatory\u201d information to the defense during discovery at the defendant\u2019s request. Also, the court was aware from the start of trial of the defendant\u2019s intention to rely on that testimony. Here, although the defendant initially had asserted the \u201cexculpatory\u201d character of the letters with the prosecutor, he did not indicate that he intended to rely on those letters or on Hamilton\u2019s testimony until the state had rested its case. On the basis of the record before the court at the time it ruled, we conclude that the likelihood that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion would substantially impair the defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself was slim.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the court abused its discretion in denying his request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>a continuance because it incorrectly characterized the likely delay of the continuance as \u201cessentially\u201d for an indefinite duration. See footnote 7. This court and our Supreme Court have upheld denials of requests for continuances when they were sought for indefinite durations. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>197 Conn. 413, 424A-C, 504 A.2d 1020 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mendez, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 285-86. Here, the court noted that it had no assurance that Hamilton would testify even if it granted the continuance because the state would likely revoke the plea agreement if Hamilton\u2019s testimony contradicted his statement. Furthermore, the court noted that if the plea agreement with Hamilton collapsed, Hamilton\u2019s trial would then begin and the defendant\u2019s continued trial would be uncertain. The court concluded that \u201cI think under all these circumstances, I will not continue this case until such time [as] Mr. Hamilton may be sentenced, because I think that\u2019s, essentially, an indefinite continuance <em>based on the circumstances that [the prosecutor] explained </em>. . . . [S]o, we could just have an infinite period of time. Hamilton wouldn\u2019t be sentenced, and [the defendant] would never be tried. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2014 and justice wouldn\u2019t be served for anybody under those circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) We decline to characterize the court\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>sion as to the likely length of the delay as improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">On the basis of our review of the factors that the court considered or of which it was aware at the time of its ruling, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the request for a continuance was arbitrary or unreasonable under the circumstances of the case. Therefore, the corut did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request until the completion of Hamilton\u2019s sentencing. See id., 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The defendant next claims that the court violated his constitutional rights when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53-202k with an additional five year consecutive term without first instructing the jury on the commission of a class A, B or C felony with a firearm. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. During its charge, the court instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant as an accessory. It then charged the jury that a \u201cdangerous instrument,\u201d for the purposes of conviction of assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), \u201cis defined by statute as any instrument or thing, which, under the circumstances in which it is used, is capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d The court then summarized the evidence. The court did not instruct the jury to make any findings under \u00a7 53-202k, and the state concedes as much. The defendant was convicted of assault in the first degree and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree. At sentencing, the court, not the jury, made the requisite factual determination that the defendant had used a firearm in committing a class A, B or C felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">The defendant concedes that he did not object to the court\u2019s imposition of the sentencing enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>during sentencing and requests that we review his claim under Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 or <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). His claim is appropriate for review under <em>Golding.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>255 Conn. 782, 793 n.10, 772 A.2d 559 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We note at the outset that the record is adequate to review the claim and that it is of constitutional magnitude because it alleges the violation of a fundamental right. \u201cAn accused has a fundamental right, protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions, to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . [Our Supreme Court] has consistently held that a claim that the judge improperly instructed the jury on an element of an offense is appealable even if not raised at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>60 Conn. App. 487, 493, 760 A.2d 111 (2000), aff'd, 259 Conn. 799, 792 A.2d 86 (2002). For the purposes of our analysis, we discern no relevant distinction between an improper instruction, as in <em>Brown, </em>and the lack of any instruction in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">With regard to the third <em>Golding </em>factor, we again note that the state concedes that the court did not instruct the jury on \u00a7 53-202k, and we therefore must conclude that a constitutional violation clearly exists. See id. We also note that the state concentrates its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>argument solely on the harmlessness inquiry. The defendant disputes the state\u2019s position as to whether harmlessness analysis is appropriate, although he addresses the issue in the alternative. Therefore, as a threshold issue, we discuss whether the violation complained of is subject to harmless error analysis. If so, we must then consider, pursuant to the fourth <em>Golding </em>factor, whether the state has proved harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Connecticut case law is clear on the question of whether harmlessness analysis is appropriate in cases such as this one. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>65 Conn. App. 551, 574, 783 A.2d 100, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 940, 786 A.2d 427 (2001), we reviewed the relevant federal as well as Connecticut case law and concluded that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s silence on the issue in <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000), notwithstanding,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> failure by a court to have the jury determine whether the state proved that the defendant is subject to a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53-202k can constitute harmless error.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 738, 759 A.2d 995 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>In assessing whether the failure to instruct on the elements of \u00a7 53-202k is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, this court is bound by the two-pronged test discussed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 794-96. \u201cA jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 794, citing <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">We note initially that \u00a7 53-202k applies, with limited exceptions, to \u201c[a]ny person who commits any class A, B or C felony and in the commission of such felony uses, or is armed with and threatens the use of, or displays, or represents by his words or conduct that he possesses any <em>firearm </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. The jury\u2019s finding that the defendant was guilty of having committed assault in the first degree, a class B felony, necessarily satisfied the first requirement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>61 Conn. App. 430, 435, 769 A.2d 708, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 954, 772 A.2d 152 (2001). The pertinent question, therefore, is whether the court\u2019s determination that the defendant used, displayed or represented that he possessed a firearm is harmless under <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 694. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>67 Conn. App. 194, 210-11, 786 A.2d 1147 (2001), cert. granted on other grounds, 259 Conn. 920, 791 A.2d 567 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>253 Conn. 210, 231, 751 A.2d 800 (2000), the defendant argues in his principal brief that the failure to instruct was not harmless because the jury\u2019s guilty verdict was \u201cnot contingent on the defendant\u2019s use of a firearm.\u201d Although we agree that the defendant\u2019s conviction was not contingent on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>jury\u2019s finding that he used a firearm, we conclude nevertheless that the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The defendant argues that not only did the court fail to instruct on the elements of \u00a7 53-202k, but that the court\u2019s instructions as to the assault and conspiracy charges did not even mention the word firearm. The state argues that the evidence that the defendant or others beat the victim on the head with a pistol was overwhelming and uncontested, and that this satisfies the second element of \u00a7 53-202k, namely, that he used a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In support of its position, the state makes two relevant arguments. It first argues correctly that there was no evidence of any sort of dangerous instrument other than a pistol that was used to beat the victim. We note that firearm is a term defined by statute to include pistol.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The state presented five witnesses who testified that prior to the shooting, the defendant was armed with a gun. Five of those witnesses stated that they saw the defendant pistol-whip the victim. Lipscome, the only witness who did not testify about that, testified that he arrived after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The state also argues correctly that the defendant did not refute the state\u2019s position that a pistol was used in the assault. The defendant asserted that there was no conspiracy to beat the victim and that Hamilton had acted alone. The defendant cannot, however, render the evidence that he used a firearm controverted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the purpose of harmless error analysis by claiming simply that another participant committed the crime. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Beall, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 435-36 (evidence uncontroverted that defendant used firearm where he did not dispute evidence that victim was shot, but rather claimed he was not shooter), with <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>supra, 253 Conn. 234 (where \u201cdefendant not only denied any involvement in the shooting, but specifically denied being in possession of a firearm\u201d and stated that he gave it to someone else, question of whether he used firearm a contested issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">For the reasons previously set forth, we conclude that the record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element, namely, that the defendant used, displayed or represented that he possessed a firearm, was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence. We conclude that the jury would have found that the defendant was subject to a sentence enhancement under \u00a7 53-202k had it been instructed properly on the elements of that section and permitted to determine whether the state had satisfied its burden of proof. In sum, the impropriety claimed by the defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 577. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the fourth prong of Golding.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\"> The state also charged the defendant with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a, 53a-8 and 53-202k, conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48, 53a-54a and 53-202k, and tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151. The jury acquitted him of the charge of conspiracy to commit murder, and failed to reach a verdict on the murder and tampering charges. The court declared a mistrial as to those two charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b830-9\"> \u201cThe sixth-amendment right of a criminal defendant to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor is applicable to state criminal proceedings under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment . . . and included within its scope is the right to offer the testimony of witnesses.

We note that Lindsey testified that he was not present at the time of the shooting and that he related what other people had told him. Nevertheless, he testified that he \u201csaw\u201d Hamilton, after the defendant had shot the victim, walk over to the victim, who was lying in the street, and that Lindsey then \u201cheard\u201d two shots.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b832-9\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b832-10\"> Upon calling Hamilton to the witness stand, the defendant asked him about the night of the shooting, the existence of the conspiracy and whether he had received consideration for his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\"> One of the letters contained the index to the code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\"> In its ruling, the court stated to defense counsel: \u201cThis is a matter for practicality here. Let\u2019s say that I say all right, we are going to continue this case until Mr. Hamilton is sentenced. And then let\u2019s say the state says in Hamilton\u2019s case, this is hypothetical of course, well, we\u2019re withdrawing our offer because it\u2019s contingent on Hamilton cooperating in the [defendant\u2019s] case and Hamilton is not cooperating. So, he can withdraw his plea and we put him on trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">After further colloquy with the defense and the state, the court issued its ruling: \u201cI think, under all these circumstances, I will not continue this case until such time [as] Mr. Hamilton may be sentenced because I think that\u2019s, essentially, an indefinite continuance based on the circumstances that [the prosecutor has] explained. . . . [S]o, we could just have an infinite period of time. Hamilton wouldn\u2019t be sentenced, and [the defendant] would never be tried. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2014 and justice wouldn\u2019t be served for anybody under those circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\"> Defense counsel stated the grounds for the admission of Hamilton\u2019s statement as follows: \u201c[I]t either involves Hamilton [as] a conspirator or it doesn\u2019t. Either way, I would argue that it\u2019s admissible. If it doesn\u2019t involve the conspirator, then it\u2019s exculpatory to my client. If it does involve him as a conspirator, then it goes to the weight of the evidence that somebody else committed the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">We note that the defendant on appeal characterizes the import of the statement differently. He complains that because the court\u2019s prior denial of the request for a continuance barred him from questioning Hamilton, he was \u201creduced to presenting Hamilton\u2019s statement, which clearly inculpated [the defendant] and exculpated [Hamilton].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\"> The defendant had the state\u2019s inspector read from Hamilton\u2019s statement, which related Hamilton\u2019s recollection that he \u201csaw [the defendant] in the middle of Adams Street with a gun, and I heard two or three shots.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\"> We note that although <em>Hamilton </em>informs us that the list is not exhaustive, we construe it not to be a checklist representing those factors that must, at a minimum, be discussed. Rather, it is a list of highly relevant factors that we, as an appellate court, may consider and should view as particularly persuasive in evaluating the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b836-8\"> Although we note that the Supreme Court went on to discuss factors useful in assessing prejudice to the defendant in the event of an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 241; in light of our conclusion as to the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion, we need not apply those factors for the disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b838-7\"> The defendant implies that the state was disingenuous in naming Hamilton as a witness and then deciding not to call him at the last minute because of the availability of the two witnesses, Pinnette and Lawrence. The defendant cites the prosecutor\u2019s statement to the court that had he known in May, 1999, that they would be available to testily, he \u201cnever would have made [the plea agreement with [Hamilton\u2019s defense counsel].\u201d Then, the defendant refers this court to the fact that the prosecutor \u201cadmitted that Pinnette and Lawrence were a part of the three year old case file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">In addressing that point, we simply refer to the prosecutor\u2019s explanation to the court that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know if they would show up here or if they were back in Jamaica somewhere. That\u2019s where they usually go. And if I was on trial without any evidence at all, I would have Mr. Hamilton. I didn\u2019t know about the other two witnesses.\u201d We also note that the shooting occurred in 1996, and the state explained to the court its apparent concern over the availability of its other known witnesses after the intervening years. After noting that he was not the original prosecutor on the case, the prosecutor explained that \u201c[ljooking the whole file over, I figured I needed more than what I had and I went to [Hamilton\u2019s defense counsel] and offered him to take his client on one count of assault in the first degree, leaving the other counts open in return for a statement from him which would implicate the [defendant]. Because I figured the evidence I did have against [the defendant], while it was good evidence, I wasn\u2019t sure at trial time if it would be available .... I also knew that Mr. Hamilton was in the lockup and couldn\u2019t make bail, so he would be available to me if I needed him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b841-6\"> The defendant in his brief argues that the court, sua sponte, improperly addressed that scenario by suggesting a hypothetical reason to deny the request for a continuance and then, \u201chaving done so, it then denied the request.\u201d The defendant, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>50 Conn. App. 175, 182, 718 A.2d 60 (1998), aff'd, 251 Conn. 54, 738 A.2d 652 (1999), characterizes the court\u2019s conduct in that regard essentially as highly inappropriate advocacy. We note, however, that the court relied on the prosecutor\u2019s statement in casting its \u201chypothetical,\u201d and we decline to regard the court\u2019s prediction of the litigation, had it granted the continuance, as advocacy on the part of the court. The prosecutor explained to the court that \u201c[his predecessors] [didn\u2019t] want to sentence [Hamilton] beforehand for fear he might turn around and say something different. \u201d In our view, the court simply acknowledged the practical realities of the case on the basis of the information it had at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\"> In <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental righl; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.

Without discussing harmlessness, our Supreme Court vacated the trial court\u2019s sentence enhancement because the trial court failed to instruct the jury as to the elements of General Statutes \u00a7 53-202k. We also note, however, as does the defendant, that in the absence of discussion of the issue in <em>Cator, </em>we are bound by the earlier decisions of our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 255 Conn.782, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 759 A.2d 995 (2000).
