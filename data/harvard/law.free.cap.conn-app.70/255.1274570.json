On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court deprived him of his right to present a defense when it refused to admit into evidence a certain laboratory report, (2) the court improperly limited his cross-examination of two of the state\u2019s witnesses, (3) the court improperly denied his motion for a sequestration order during a suppression hearing, (4) the evidence did not support the jury\u2019s finding that he had sold narcotics within 1500 feet of real property that had been conspicuously identified as a day care center, (5) certain comments made by the prosecutor constituted prosecutorial misconduct and deprived him of his right to a fair trial, and (6) we should set aside the court\u2019s finding that he violated the terms of his probation, a finding based on the convictions at issue in these appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Between January and March, 1999, members of the New Britain police department were investigating suspected illegal drug transactions at 29 Glen Street in New Britain, an apartment building that was known to be a haven for such activity. To that end, William Steck, an officer with the New Britain police department, enlisted the assistance of Paula Rivera and Edward Clemonts, both confidential informants. Steck met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Rivera and Clemonts on a regular basis, and both individuals had purchased illegal drags from suspected drag dealers for Steck on several prior occasions. Steck paid Rivera and Clemonts for their assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On February 10, 1999, Steck asked Rivera to present herself at apartment number eight at 29 Glen Street to purchase drugs. Rivera was familiar with the building and with a drag seller in apartment number eight, who she knew as Lloyd. Steck and Rivera drove separately to a parking area located a few blocks away from the building. Steck searched both Rivera\u2019s person and her vehicle for drags. He did not find any and, subsequently, gave Rivera $40 with which to purchase drugs. Rivera drove to 29 Glen Street, parked her vehicle and entered the building. Steck observed her actions from a nearby unmarked vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Rivera presented herself to the defendant at apartment number eight. The defendant inquired as to what she wanted, and she informed him that she wanted to purchase $40 worth of crack cocaine. She followed the defendant inside the apartment. The defendant\u2019s roommate handed the cocaine to the defendant who then handed it to Rivera. After Rivera successfully completed the transaction, she left the building with the crack cocaine and met Steck at the parking lot located a few blocks away. Once there, Rivera related the details of the purchase and delivered the crack cocaine to Steck.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">On March 1,1999, Steck arranged to meet with Clemonts. Steck met Clemonts in an unmarked vehicle and asked him to purchase drags from apartment number eight at 29 Glen Street. Several blocks from the defendant\u2019s building, Steck and Clemonts got out of the vehicle. Steck searched Clemonts\u2019 person for drags. He did not find any. As he had done with Rivera, Steck gave Clemonts money with which to purchase the drags. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Clemonts walked to the building, and Steck observed him enter and exit the building from the vantage point of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Clemonts knocked on the door to apartment number eight. The defendant answered, and Clemonts indicated that he desired to purchase $20 worth of crack cocaine. After the defendant sold it to him, Clemonts exited the building with the drugs and met Steck in a nearby parking lot. Clemonts described the defendant to Steck, apprised him of the details of the purchase and gave him the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes with which he stood charged. These appeals followed. Additional facts will be set forth where warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The defendant first claims that the court deprived him of his right to present a defense when it refused to admit into evidence a laboratory report that indicated that certain evidence that the police took from his apartment subsequent to his arrest tested negative for the presence of cocaine. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The following additional facts underlie the defendant\u2019s claim. On March 11,1999, officers duly executed a search warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment. During their search, they found several of the defendant\u2019s important personal papers and his credit card. During cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney inquired of Steck as to certain substances that he had seized during the search. Steck testified that during the search of the premises, he or other members of his unit seized trace amounts of a substance that they believed, at that time, may have been cocaine. They recovered the substance from a razor blade and from a turntable in the defendant\u2019s medicine cabinet. Steck indicated that either he or a member of his unit conducted a field test of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>substances and that they tested positive for the presence of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The state objected to the defendant\u2019s foray into that line of questioning, arguing that the substances seized from the defendant\u2019s apartment did not provide the basis for the charges against him. The defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the evidence was relevant to Steck\u2019s state of mind. He posited that Steck had arrested the defendant because he believed that he had found cocaine in the apartment and, therefore, that the defendant must have sold cocaine to Rivera and Clemonts. The court commented that it did not understand the defendant\u2019s claim of relevance, as the defendant was \u201cnot charged with any wrongdoing on March 11 ... . So, whether they found cocaine or chewing gum . . . it really doesn\u2019t matter . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted that the evidence was relevant and that he wanted to introduce, via another witness, the laboratory report indicating a negative test result on those substances. The court permitted Steck to testify in response to examination by defense counsel that he or members of his unit had field tested those substances and that they tested positive at that time for the presence of cocaine. During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, his counsel proffered a laboratory report issued by the state toxicological laboratory. The report indicated that those substances had tested negative for the presence of cocaine in tests performed at the laboratory. The state objected on the ground of relevancy. The defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the report challenged the \u201ccredibility of the confidential informants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The court ruled that the laboratory report was not relevant to any issue before the jury. The court emphasized that regardless of what police investigators may have thought that they had found on March 11, 1999, it had no bearing on the alleged offenses that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>dant stood charged with having committed on either February 10 or March 1,1999. Likewise, the court ruled that the proffered evidence did not bear on the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. As the court explained, those events did not \u201chave any direct bearing or even indirect bearing [on] the credibility of the confidential informant witnesses. The jury will judge their credibility based on the testimony which relates to the matters with which we are concerned. The alleged offenses on February 10 and March 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant now claims that the court deprived him of his right to present a defense under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and under the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant preserved his evidentiary claim at trial, but concedes, however, that he did not preserve his constitutional claim at trial. The defendant now argues that the disallowed evidence \u201cwas crucial to [his] defense that the confidential informants lied when they identified [him] as the drug seller, and it was highly relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>. . . that they could have purchased drugs at any of the surrounding apartments within [his] building.\u201d Furthermore, the defendant claims that once the court permitted Steck to testify that the substances field tested positive as cocaine, the jury was left with the mistaken impression that the defendant\u2019s apartment contained cocaine when police investigators searched it on March 11, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is afforded great deference. . . . The trial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination. Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>255 Conn. 61, 69, 762 A.2d 1278 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We dispose of the defendant\u2019s claim because we conclude that the laboratory report was not relevant to the issues before the jury. It is well settled that \u201c[t]he proffering party bears the burden of establishing the relevance of the offered [evidence]. Unless such a proper foundation is established, the evidence ... is irrelevant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>255 Conn. 581, 591, 767 A.2d 1189 (2001). \u201cWe have often stated that [e]vidence is admissible when it tends to establish a fact in issue or to corroborate other direct evidence in the case. . . . One fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>26 Conn. App. 151, 156, 599 A.2d 385 (1991), cert. denied, 221 Conn. 907, 600 A.2d 1362 (1992). Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>more, \u201cit is the court\u2019s right and, indeed, its duty to exclude irrelevant evidence.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The laboratory report was not relevant to the issues before the jury, namely, whether the defendant had sold cocaine to Rivera and Clemonts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The details of the police search of the defendant\u2019s apartment days after those sales occurred were of no consequence to the jury\u2019s analysis. We fail to see the logic of the defendant\u2019s argument that the laboratory report would somehow have implicated the credibility of either the confidential informants or Steck. The defendant argues that the evidence would have established \u201cthat the police relied solely on the informants in arresting [him], and that the informants could have lied and obtained the drugs from any of the surrounding apartments.\u201d If that was the defendant\u2019s defense, the court\u2019s exclusion of the laboratory report certainly did not affect his ability to set it forth at trial. No evidence demonstrated that either Rivera or Clemonts had any connection whatsoever to the report or the substances described therein. Steck testified that he lacked knowledge of the laboratory report. The report did not bear on anyone\u2019s credibility because it was not relevant to the events described at trial. Likewise, even if the defendant had uncontroverted evidence demonstrating that he did not have cocaine in his apartment either before or after the alleged sales to Rivera and Clemonts, the report would still be inadmissible because it was irrelevant. Accordingly, the exclusion of the report did not result from an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Having reached that conclusion, we necessarily find that the defendant\u2019s attempt to give the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling constitutional significance is to no avail. The defendant did not claim that the court\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>deprived him of his right to present a defense at trial, and he now seeks review of the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Review under <em>Golding </em>is not warranted because the defendant\u2019s claim is evidentiary in nature and is not of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Toccaline, </em>258 Conn. 542, 550, 783 A.2d 450 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 279, 780 A.2d 53 (2001). A defendant\u2019s right to present a defense guarantees his or her right, to be exercised within limits, to present <em>relevant </em>evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>241 Conn. 57, 133-34, 698 A.2d 739 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1058, 118 S. Ct. 1384, 140 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>46 Conn. App. 640, 646, 700 A.2d 710, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 941, 704 A.2d 797 (1997). That right is not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly \u201cleft [the jury] with the mistaken impression that [he] did in fact have cocaine in his apartment when it was searched by the police.\u201d The defendant argues that Steck\u2019s testimony as to the field test \u201cclearly prejudiced\u201d his case. The record reflects that the state did not question Steck as to the substances that field tested positive for cocaine during the March 11, 1999 search. The defendant inquired as to that evidence, over the state\u2019s timely objection, during his cross-examination of Steck. The court permitted the defendant to inquire as to the field test, but infoimed the defendant\u2019s counsel that he would not be able to get the subsequent test results into evidence through Steck. After the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ruled that the report was irrelevant, the defendant did not request the court to strike Steck\u2019s testimony insofar as it concerned the field test, nor did he ask the court for a curative instruction in regard to that testimony. The testimony complained of here was elicited through careful cross-examination. The defendant made a tactical decision to delve into that irrelevant subject and cannot now complain that the court improperly permitted him to do so. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 32-33, 438 A.2d 815 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>34 Conn. App. 473, 488, 642 A.2d 36, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 907, 648 A.2d 157 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The defendant next claims that the court deprived him of his right to confront adverse witnesses when it limited potential areas of cross-examination as to Rivera and Clemonts. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The following additional facts underlie the defendant\u2019s claim. The state filed a motion in limine seeking to limit the defendant\u2019s inquiry into the prior felony convictions of its witnesses. The state also objected to certain areas of inquiry during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Clemonts and Rivera. Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claim, we first examine the specific parameters of the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">The state represented that Clemonts had several prior felony convictions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court ruled that the defendant could cross-examine Clemonts as to any felony convictions from 1995 and later, and that the defendant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>refer to those convictions by name. During the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Clemonts, the state sought to preclude the defendant from inquiring as to whether Clemonts had received favorable sentences from the court for any of his prior convictions because of his cooperation with the police and whether he had paid income taxes on the moneys that he earned when he worked as an informant for the police. The court permitted the defendant to inquire as to the favorable treatment, but precluded him from inquiring as to the payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In regard to Rivera, the defendant sought permission to inquire into two specific acts of misconduct. Specifically, he wanted to inquire into an incident in 1988 when Rivera allegedly filed a false police report and an incident in 1995 that the defendant described as larceny by false pretenses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court disallowed questioning as to those incidents, concluding that they were not felony convictions and were too remote in time. The court also precluded the defendant from inquiring as to whether Rivera paid income taxes on the money that she had received from her undercover work with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s ruling precluded him from introducing evidence that related to the truth and veracity of the witnesses, an issue crucial to his defense. He argues that the court infringed on his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s claim implicates two types of evidence that a party may use to impeach a witness\u2019 credibility, prior convictions and specific acts of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c[T]he sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination .... This right, however, is not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process. . . . The trial court, in its discretion, may impose limitations on the scope of cross-examination, as long as the defendant has been permitted sufficient cross-examination to satisfy constitutional requirements. . . . The confrontation clause does not . . . suspend the rules of evidence to give the defendant the right to engage in unrestricted cross-examination. . . . Only relevant evidence may be elicited and the right to cross-examine is subject to the duty of the court to exclude irrelevant evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>65 Conn. App. 449, 457-58, 783 A.2d 53, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 927, 783 A.2d 1032 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cCross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>241 Conn. 1, 16, 695 A.2d 1022 (1997). \u201cIn determining whether a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination has been unduly restricted, we consider the nature of the excluded inquiry, whether the field of inquiry was adequately covered by other questions that were allowed, and the overall quality of the cross-examination viewed in relation to the issues actually litigated at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 331, 618 A.2d 32 (1992). \u201cThe constitutional standard is met when defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which [the] jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d (Internal quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>tion marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cWe traditionally apply a two part analysis to determine whether a party has been deprived of effective cross-examination. First, we determine whether the defendant received the minimum opportunity for cross-examination of adverse witnesses required by the constitution. ... If so, we then consider whether the trial court\u2019s restriction of cross-examination amounted to an abuse of discretion under the rules of evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>50 Conn. App. 1, 6, 717 A.2d 775, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 927, 719 A.2d 1171 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We review the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings with great deference. \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>66 Conn. App. 740, 755, 786 A.2d 466 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 906, 789 A.2d 996 (2002). Having set forth those general principles of review, we turn to the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The defendant first claims that the court deprived him of his right to cross-examine Clemonts. He points out that the court precluded him from inquiring as to (1) Clemonts\u2019 felony convictions in 1989,1990 and 1991, (2) the specific acts underlying his 1990 conviction for misrepresentation of a controlled substance and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>1991 conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary, and (3) whether he paid income taxes on the money that he earned when he purchased drugs as an informant for the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We conclude that the court\u2019s rulings did not unduly restrict the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine Clemonts. The record reflects that the defendant examined Clemonts as to all of his post-1995 felony convictions. The defendant\u2019s counsel referred to those convictions by name. The defendant also cross-examined Clemonts as to the specific sentences that he had received for each of those convictions. As a result of vigorous cross-examination, Clemonts admitted that he had received favorable treatment because of his work as a confidential informant for the New Britain police department. Further, the defendant elicited from Clemonts that his ability to purchase drugs for the police and to testify favorably against alleged drug sellers not only had led to his receiving lenient sentences, but that he derived a significant source of his income from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Viewing the cross-examination as a whole, we conclude that the defendant had ample opportunity to expose any potential motive to fabricate or to expose any bias underlying Clemonts\u2019 testimony. The defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness and clearly elicited from him that his relationship with the New Britain police department was a benefit to him. Likewise, the defendant cross-examined the witness in regard to his felony convictions for burglary and robbery as well as his felony narcotics convictions. Additionally, the defendant not only had the opportunity to, but did in fact, effectively expose Clemonts\u2019 criminal character.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We further conclude that the court\u2019s rulings did not constitute an abuse of discretion. \u201cEffective cross-examination does not include eliciting or presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>evidence that is immaterial or irrelevant. . . . When the trial court properly excludes evidence as irrelevant, it does not abuse its discretion in limiting cross-examination as to the excluded evidence.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">With regard to prior criminal convictions, the rule is that \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by introducing the witness\u2019 conviction of a crime if the maximum penalty for that conviction is imprisonment exceeding one year. . . . Recognizing that the inherent authority of the trial court to exclude evidence where its prejudicial tendency outweighs its probative value is particularly applicable to prior convictions otherwise qualifying for admission . . . [t]hree factors have usually been identified as of primary importance in considering whether a former criminal conviction is to be admitted: (1) the extent of the prejudice likely to arise; (2) the significance of the commission of the particular crime in indicating untruthfulness; and (3) its remoteness in time. . . . Moreover, [although we have left to the trial court the responsibility for determining whether, in a particular case, a witness\u2019 criminal conviction may be excluded on the grounds that it is too old, we have sanctioned a general guideline for the determination of remoteness that parallels rule 609 (b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 609 (b) establishes a ten year limitation from conviction or release from resulting confinement upon the use of the conviction for impeachment purposes unless the probative value of the conviction substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. . . . We have recognized, however, that convictions having some special significance upon the issue of veracity surmount the standard bar of ten years and qualify for the balancing of probative value against prejudice. . . . Finally, [w]e will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination as to the admissibility of a prior conviction to impeach a witness absent an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>discretion . . . and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>245 Conn. 351, 360-61, 716 A.2d 36 (1998); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Our courts have further segregated prior convictions that are admissible for impeachment purposes into two general categories. \u201cFirst are those crimes that by their very nature indicate dishonesty or tendency to make false statement. . . . Beyond the obvious violations such as perjury or false statement, we have recognized that crimes involving larcenous intent imply a general disposition toward dishonesty such that they also fall within this category. . . . Convictions of this sort obviously bear heavily on the credibility of one who has been convicted of them. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u201cThe second category involves convictions for crimes that do not reflect directly on the credibility of one who has been convicted of them. . . . The theory behind the admissibility of these convictions as evidence of credibility posits that conviction of a crime demonstrates a bad general character, a general readiness to do evil and that such a disposition alone supports an inference of a readiness to lie in the particular case .... Convictions of crimes that fall within this second category blemish the character of one so convicted. A juror might reasonably conclude that such a witness lacks to some degree the moral rectitude from which a witness\u2019 oath of honesty derives its credibility.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 12-13, 480 A.2d 489 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The rule with regard to inquiry into a -witness\u2019 prior bad acts, separate from proof of conviction, is somewhat similar. \u201cThe right to cross-examine a witness concerning specific acts of misconduct is limited in three distinct ways. First, cross-examination may only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>extend to specific acts of misconduct other than a felony conviction if those acts bear a special significance upon the issues of veracity .... Second, [w]hether to permit cross-examination as to particular acts of misconduct . . . lies largely within the discretion of the trial court. . . . Third, extrinsic evidence of such acts is inadmissible.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 85-86, 513 A.2d 116 (1986); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-6 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The court\u2019s exclusion of Clemonts\u2019 1989 conviction for conspiracy to sell narcotics, his 1990 conviction for misrepresentation of a controlled substance and his 1991 conviction for conspiracy to commit burglary resulted from a proper exercise of discretion. The court properly stated that the right to inquire as to a witness\u2019 prior convictions, even those within the ten year period, is not absolute. The court stated: \u201cI make the ruling on whether they are of probative value on the issue of credibility only. That\u2019s for the court to decide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Having heard the defendant\u2019s proffer as to those convictions, the court concluded that any conviction prior to 1995 was not relevant in assessing Clemonts\u2019 credibility. The court stated: \u201cIn the view of this court, they have little probative value or, certainly, little additional probative value on the issue of credibility.\u201d As to the other felony convictions, the court explained that they \u201c[had] direct bearing on the honesty and integrity and credibility of the witness, as well as his engagement in the sale and possession of narcotics. The underlying criminality . . . relates to [his] integrity and credibility.\u201d Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal, the court did not base its decision solely on the remoteness factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The court also ruled that the defendant could not inquire into any of the specific acts of misconduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>resulted in Clemonts\u2019 pre-1995 convictions. The defendant argues that the court improperly excluded inquiry into those acts of misconduct, apart from the convictions occasioned by them. The court stated specifically that those acts were \u201cmuch too remote in time\u201d and implicitly determined that they would have been of no probative value in cross-examination. We are unable to conclude that this evidentiary ruling resulted from an abuse of discretion. The court was free to conclude that inquiry into the acts underlying Clemonts\u2019 convictions for misrepresentation of a controlled substance and conspiracy to commit burglary merely were cumulative evidence of other evidence that the court deemed admissible in regard to Clemonts\u2019 credibility. Although inquiry into those acts might have borne on the issue of Clemonts\u2019 credibility, the court was free to determine, as it did, that the remoteness of the acts tended to outweigh their probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The court also precluded the defendant from asking Clemonts if he had paid income taxes on the money he earned while working for the police. Despite the fact that our Supreme Court has held that questions asked of a witness regarding whether he or she has cheated on his or her income taxes may be permissible to demonstrate a lack of veracity; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>195 Conn. 651, 658-59, 491 A.2d 345 (1985); such questions are not permissible automatically. We will not second-guess the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling in that regard, having been made, as it was, following the introduction of ample evidence related to Clemonts\u2019 credibility. We conclude that the court\u2019s ruling reflected a proper balance of how much inquiry into the defendant\u2019s prior conduct or criminal character reasonably was necessary for the jury to assess his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">We now turn to the defendant\u2019s claim with regard to his cross-examination of Rivera. As we discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>previously, the defendant sought to inquire of Rivera as to two alleged prior acts of misconduct. Those were two misdemeanor convictions, one from 1988 and the other from 1995, allegedly involving Rivera\u2019s having made a false statement to the police and having somehow defrauded the city of New Britain of $600. The court also precluded the defendant from inquiring of Rivera as to whether she had paid income taxes on the money that she earned while working for the New Britain police department as an undercover informant. The defendant argued that those acts were relevant to the jury\u2019s ability to evaluate Rivera\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The record reflects that the defendant had an ample opportunity to cross-examine Rivera at trial. The defendant elicited from Rivera the fact that she was very friendly with Steck, and the fact that she derives income when she purchases drugs for the police and for \u201c[telling] the police officer what the police officer wants to hear-\u201d concerning the transaction. The defendant also inquired of Rivera as to whether she assisted the police to receive special treatment in the event that she found herself in trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In addition to examining Rivera at length as to her version of the events underlying these appeals, the defendant adequately examined Rivera as to her credibility. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments, the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings did not deprive him of his constitutional right to cross-examine this adverse witness. As we have stated, a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness against him or her is not violated when the court excludes immaterial or irrelevant evidence. St<em>ate </em>v. <em>Otto, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">We further conclude that the court\u2019s rulings did not reflect an abuse of discretion or an improper application of our rules of evidence. After hearing the proffered evidence, the court clearly noted that it did not find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>that the evidence had probative value. The court also stated that insofar as those acts resulted in misdemeanor convictions, it believed that their remoteness weighed against their admissibility. The court was in the best position to evaluate the proposed inquiry and to gauge its effect on the jury. Although any bad acts certainly might bear on an assessment of a witness\u2019 credibility, the court remains in a superior position to make that determination in a particular case after considering the specific acts in question. Likewise, we cannot say that precluding inquiry into whether Rivera paid income taxes on the money she earned from working with the police represented an abuse of discretion. We will not upset the court\u2019s conclusion that the relevance of those acts in the jury\u2019s assessment of Rivera likely was outweighed by their remoteness, their prejudicial effect on the jury or the likelihood that permitting such inquiry might have confused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a sequestration order during the suppression hearing and that this action should result in an automatic reversal of the judgment of conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The record reflects that prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the photographic identifications of him made by Clemonts and Rivera. The defendant argued that the photographic arrays were suggestive and unreliable. The court conducted a suppression hearing over the course of two days. Steck testified as to the manner in which he organized the purchases of the crack cocaine by Clemonts and Rivera. He also testified as to the manner in which he assembled a photographic array, and the manner in which Clemonts and Rivera later identified the defendant as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>person from whom they had purchased the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">At the conclusion of Steck\u2019s examination, the defendant filed a motion for a sequestration order, seeking to prevent Steck from being present in the courtroom. The defendant\u2019s counsel argued: \u201cI don\u2019t know if Officer Steck\u2019s presence will add or subtract from the testimony of . . . Clemonts, the next state\u2019s witness.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel further argued that he was concerned that Steck\u2019s presence might have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on Clemonts\u2019 testimony. The court observed that the proceeding merely was a hearing on a motion, not the trial itself, and it denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We begin our review of the court\u2019s action by looking to the language of the controlling statute. General Statutes \u00a7 54-85a provides: \u201cIn any criminal prosecution, the court, upon motion of the state or the defendant, shall cause any witness to be sequestered during the hearing on any issue or motion or any part of the trial of such prosecution in which he is not testifying.\u201d Either party may invoke the court\u2019s authority to issue a sequestration order during any portion of the trial; the court lacks discretion to deny such a request. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>230 Conn. 591, 598-99, 646 A.2d 118 (1994). The court, therefore, improperly denied the defendant\u2019s request for a sequestration order.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Our analysis of the claim, however, does not end here. The defendant posits that the court\u2019s failure to grant the motion \u201cshould result in automatic reversal or, at the very least, the state should have the burden of proving harmlessness.\u201d The state argues that the defendant bears the burden of establishing the harm or prejudice, if any, that resulted from the court\u2019s action and that he has failed to do so. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">It is well settled that a violation of a sequestration order does not automatically require a new trial. Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>courts have consistently held that \u201c[i]f the trial court fails to observe its own sequestration order, the burden is on the party requesting sequestration to show prejudice.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>211 Conn. 672, 681, 561 A.2d 111 (1989); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 599; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>61 Conn. App. 291, 296, 763 A.2d 680 (2001). Under that requirement, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cthe prejudice resulting from the violation is likely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Although the defendant acknowledges those principles, he argues that they apply in cases in which a court properly has issued a sequestration order that is later violated, but not in the present situation where the court improperly failed to issue a sequestration order when it should have done so. The defendant\u2019s distinction in that regard does not affect our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The defendant in <em>Paolella </em>was convicted of kidnapping in the second degree with a firearm and assault in the third degree in connection with an incident involving the complainant, his estranged wife. The trial court improperly exempted the complainant from a sequestration order, thereby permitting her to remain in the courtroom after she testified and while her children testified in regard to the incident. Despite the fact that the court had issued a sequestration order for all witnesses, the court permitted the complainant to remain in the courtroom after she testified for the benefit of her young children. <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>supra, 211 Conn. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In reviewing the court\u2019s exclusion of the complainant from its order, our Supreme Court looked to whether the defendant had met his burden of demonstrating that the court\u2019s action caused him prejudice. Id., 681. On the basis of the fact that the complainant had testified and therefore was \u201cunable to tailor her testimony to correspond to that of her children,\u201d our Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>held that the defendant had failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s action caused him prejudice. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Likewise, the trial court in <em>Robinson </em>improperly exempted two state\u2019s witnesses, both correction officers, from a previously issued sequestration order. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 595. Again, our Supreme Court required the defendant to prove that the court\u2019s action in exempting witnesses from a sequestration order, over the defendant\u2019s timely objection, caused him prejudice. Id., 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We conclude that just as in cases in which a court violates \u00a7 54-85a by improperly permitting witnesses to testify or to remain in a courtroom during proceedings in contravention of an earlier sequestration order, a defendant must show that a court\u2019s failure to issue a sequestration order under the statute caused him or her prejudice. We can discern no reason to apply a different rule to the latter situation when the consequences of the statute\u2019s misapplication are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We further hold that the defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice as a result of the court\u2019s action. The defendant attempts to demonstrate such prejudice by arguing that Clemonts might have testified differently at the suppression hearing had Steck not been present. Also, the defendant claims that there were differences between Steck\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing and his testimony at trial, and that such differences occurred because Steck altered his testimony to more closely resemble Clemonts\u2019 testimony at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">First, we observe that the defendant requested a narrow sequestration order. He sought only to achieve Steck\u2019s absence from the courtroom during Clemonts\u2019 testimony at the suppression hearing. Even if the court properly had granted the request, it would only have precluded Steck from being in the courtroom during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>remainder of the suppression hearing. In other words, Steck could very well have reviewed a transcript of Clemonts\u2019 testimony after the suppression hearing, or have learned of Clemonts\u2019 testimony from another source, prior to testifying at trial. The record reflects that the defendant did not request a sequestration order to prevent Steck from learning the substance of Celmonts\u2019 testimony, by reviewing a transcript of the proceedings or otherwise, either at the hearing or at any time thereafter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant cannot prove that a sequestration order would have precluded any changes in Steck\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Second, we note that Steck testified before Clemonts at the suppression hearing itself. \u201cThe primary purpose of a sequestration order is to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial by preventing witnesses from shaping their testimony to corroborate falsely the testimony of others.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 297. As was our Supreme Court in <em>Robinson, </em>we are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s improper application of the statute could not, in any way, have induced tailored testimony from the witness who should not have been in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The defendant also argues that Steck\u2019s presence in the courtroom during the suppression hearing might have influenced Clemonts\u2019 testimony. Again, we note that the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice arising from that allegation, and he has not done so. The record reflects that Clemonts had a long history of acting as an undercover informant for the New Britain police department. The defendant, during vigorous cross-examination, elicited from Clemonts the facts that he derived income from his activities with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the department, received lenient sentences from the court in exchange for his work with the department, and had an ongoing relationship with Steck and members of the department. Given Clemonts\u2019 role in the proceedings and his history of testifying for the state, the defendant\u2019s argument that Steck somehow influenced Clemonts to testify in a certain way is purely speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The defendant next claims that his conviction under \u00a7 21a-278a (b) cannot stand because the state failed to prove that he sold narcotics within 1500 feet of \u201ca licensed child day care center . . . that is identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place,\u201d as is required under the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Initially, we note that the defendant failed to raise his sufficiency of the evidence claim before the trial court. The defendant seeks review of his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. See footnote 8. We will afford review to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u201cUnpreserved sufficiency claims are reviewable on appeal because such claims implicate a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be convicted of a crime upon insufficient proof. . . . Our Supreme Court has stated that <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>[443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979)], compels the conclusion that any defendant found guilty on the basis of insufficient evidence has been deprived of a constitutional right, and would therefore necessarily meet the four-prongs of <em>Golding. State </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>225 Conn. 270, 275-76 n.3, 623 A.2d 42 (1993).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>67 Conn. App. 249, 254-55, 786 A.2d 1189 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 918, 791 A.2d 566 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Trotter, </em>69 Conn. App. 1, 4-5, 793 A.2d 1172 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Niemeyer, </em>258 Conn. 510, 517, 782 A.2d 658 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 21a-278a (b), given the facts of the present case, the state needed to prove that (1) the defendant sold a controlled substance, (2) he did so within 1500 feet of the real property comprising a licensed day care center as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 19a-77 and (3) the facility was identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place. General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b). Section 19a-77 (a) (1) provides in relevant part that a child day care center \u201coffers or provides a program of supplementary care to more than twelve related or unrelated children outside their own homes on a regular basis . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">At trial, the jury heard testimony from Patrick Toscano, a licensed surveyor. Toscano testified that the defendant\u2019s apartment building was approximately forty-five feet across Glen Street from a YWCA facility. The jury also heard testimony from Kathy Lynn Coyle, the executive director of the YWCA facility. Coyle testified that since 1989, the facility has housed a day care center that provides care for children between the ages of six weeks and fifteen years. Coyle testified that in February, 1999, workers at the center provided services to more than 100 children a day. Coyle further testified that beginning in the latter part of 1998 and through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the time of the events underlying these appeals, the facility was adorned with a large banner to promote the day care center. The state introduced a photograph of the banner, which read in part: \u201cYWCA Child Care: Superior Pre School for 3 and 4 year olds. Call today!\u201d The banner also displayed the center\u2019s telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The gist of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the banner merely was a promotional display \u201cfor one to get information about the YWCA\u2019s preschool, which could actually be provided at a variety of places within the city. It does not inform the reader that a \u2018child day care center\u2019 is actually located in that building. \u201d We conclude that the evidence of the banner\u2019s display on the facility satisfied the state\u2019s burden of proving that the facility conspicuously was identified by a sign as a day care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The statute does not require the use of certain language on the posted sign. Whether a posted sign satisfies \u00a7 21a-278a (b) is a question of fact. In the present case, the jury viewed a photograph of the banner that contained the phrases \u201cYWCA Child Care\u201d and \u201cSuperior Pre-School for 3 and 4 year olds.\u201d Furthermore, the jury heard evidence that the sign was displayed on a YWCA facility. Applying the common sense and experience of the affairs of life that members of the jury bring to their fact-finding function; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guadalupe, </em>66 Conn. App. 819, 826, 786 A.2d 494 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 907, 789 A.2d 996 (2002); they logically could have found that the banner adequately identified the building as housing a child day care center. Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the banner fulfilled that function in a conspicuous manner. Accordingly, sufficient evidence supported the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 21a-278a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that certain of the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument to the jury rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct and that such comments deprived him of his right to a fair trial. He claims that the challenged remarks fall into five categories of improper argument: (1) expressions of opinion of the credibility of witnesses, (2) expressions of opinion that the defendant was guilty, (3) appeals to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jury, (4) attempts to dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof and (5) comment on the defendant\u2019s choice not to testily. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\u201cWhen presenting closing arguments, as in ah facets of a criminal trial, the prosecutor, as a representative of the state, has a duty of fairness that exceeds that of other advocates. [A] prosecutor is not an ordinary advocate. His [or her] duty is to see that justice is done and to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce prejudice and wrongful decisions by the jury. . . . [B]y reason of his [or her] office, [a prosecutor] usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His [or her] conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty [is] at stake should be forceful, but fair, because [a prosecutor] represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may . . . occur in the course of closing argument. . . . Such argument may be, in light of all of the facts and circumstances, so egregious that no curative instruction could reasonably be expected to remove [its] prejudicial impact. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u201c[T]o determine whether claims of prosecutorial misconduct amounted to a denial of due process, we must decide whether the challenged remarks were improper, and, if so, whether they caused substantial prejudice to the defendant. . . . To make this determination, we must focus on several factors: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>61 Conn. App. 763, 769-70, 765 A.2d 1240, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 901, 772 A.2d 599 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Because the defendant did not object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct at trial, he may prevail on his claim only if he satisfies all four prongs of the analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The record is adequate for review of the claims, and the claims are of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right. Accordingly, we must determine whether the defendant has satisfied <em>Golding's </em>third prong, that is, whether a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. Consonant with the standard of review previously detailed, we will set forth each of the defendant\u2019s claims of impropriety in turn to determine if, under the standard applicable to each, the remarks rose to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. We then will determine, if such misconduct exists, whether it so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>prejudiced the defendant as to deny of him of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the prosecutor made all of the allegedly improper remarks during his rebuttal argument. The defendant, therefore, cannot claim that the prosecutor engaged in \u201ca pattern of egregious conduct\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>64 Conn. App. 80, 92, 778 A.2d 253, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 911, 782 A.2d 1249 (2001); during the entire trial. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>65 Conn. App. 470, 483, 783 A.2d 1057 (fact that claims focused on remarks made only during closing argument demonstrated that comments were not pervasive quality of proceeding), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 930, 783 A.2d 1031 (2001). We also find it significant that the defendant failed to object to any of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Denson, </em>67 Conn. App. 803, 815, 789 A.2d 1075 (failure to object to allegedly improper argument often indicates that counsel did not \u201c \u2018view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial was seriously jeopardized\u2019 \u201d), cert. denied, 260 Conn. 915, 797 A.2d 514 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The defendant first claims that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of Clemonts and Rivera. The prosecutor first pointed out that Rivera knew the defendant and then commented as to her ability to identify him accurately, stating: \u201cShe knew the defendant. There\u2019s no question as to what her identification was.\u201d The prosecutor also commented on the questions asked of both informants during their cross-examination. He expressed his belief that the defense counsel never challenged successfully the heart of the case, that the witnesses purchased crack cocaine from the defendant. He stated: \u201cI submit to you that these people testified truthfully as to what they bought from the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The prosecutor also stated: \u201cWho are the types of people that [the defendant] sold drugs to? Who are the type of people that [the police] bring in? To their credit, Mr. Clemonts and Miss Rivera came here and told you what happened on those days. And I submit to you, they told it in a credible and believable manner. And there\u2019s nothing [that has] been presented to rebut it, and there\u2019s nothing presented to show a bias.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that [a] prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses .... Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. . . . These expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. . . . The jury is aware that he has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence . . . which the jury may infer to have precipitated the personal opinions. . . . The prosecutor may, however, argue to the jury that the <em>evidence </em>and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom should lead the jury to a conclusion as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In his argument, the prosecutor did not personally guarantee the truth of the witness\u2019 testimony. We repeat that a prosecutor\u2019s personal observations of the witness\u2019 capacity to testify truthfully are objectionable and improper. In this case, we do not conclude that the remarks deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We first note the fact that the comments were, to an extent, invited by the defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. Part of the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel improperly appealed to the emotions and prejudices of the jurors relative to their assessment of the witnesses\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>credibility. He argued, with respect to Rivera, that she did not want to testify because she was not getting paid to do so. He further asked, albeit rhetorically, why she did not hold a regular job and why she earned money as a confidential informant. He argued: \u201cAsk yourself, if you were [Rivera\u2019s] boss, and she came in and interviewed with you, would you hire her? And would you want her as a social friend? Would you invite her over for dinner? Now, if you answer no, that means you don\u2019t trust her credibility, her veracity, her truthfulness. And if you don\u2019t believe her \u2014 if you don\u2019t believe her word, then you can\u2019t convict [the defendant].\u201d Defense counsel made a similar argument with respect to Clemonts, asking the jurors to consider whether they would let him into their homes at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning to use the telephone.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel later argued: \u201cI will submit, you can\u2019t find [Rivera and Clemonts] credible because they have a bias, an interest and motive, and they do it for money.\u201d Accordingly, we rely on the fact that the prosecutor made his allegedly improper remarks only during rebuttal argument and in direct response to the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s accusation that the witnesses had lied.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crnkovic, </em>68 Conn. App. 757, 771-72, 793 A.2d 1139, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 925, 797 A.2d 521 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We also are persuaded by the fact that those comments were limited to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument and that the defendant neither objected to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>remarks at trial nor sought a mistrial. Further, we are mindful of the fact that the court carefully instructed the jury that it was its function to assess the credibility of the witnesses and that the arguments made by counsel did not constitute evidence. Having viewed the challenged remarks in light of the entire trial and in light of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury to disregard such comments, we conclude that the defendant has failed to prove that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks clearly deprived him of his right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 274-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor expressed his opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor asked the jurors to \u201ckeep in mind who sold the dope\u201d and made reference to the \u201ctypes of people that [the defendant] sold drugs to.\u201d In closing, the prosecutor stated: \u201cI would submit to you, the state has proven that this defendant is, in fact, guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all counts. . . . Just keep one thing in mind. If it wasn\u2019t for people like [the defendant], there wouldn\u2019t be any [need for confidential informants to serve as witnesses].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Despite the fact that counsel must be afforded generous latitude when delivering argument to the jury, the parameters of zealous advocacy are not without limit. \u201cIt is axiomatic that it is improper for a prosecutor to express his opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the guilt of the defendant.\u201d Id., 270. Such expression of opinion falls outside of the proper commentary on the evidence adduced at trial and is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">As a preliminary matter, the fact that during the heat of argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant as the person who sold drugs or the person who occasioned the need for confidential informants to testify for the state does not convince us that the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>improperly expressed his opimon as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to dissect every sentence of the prosecutor\u2019s argument to discover impropriety. We view in a different light the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the state had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. That statement reflects the prosecutor\u2019s personal evaluation of the evidence and, as such, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">We conclude, however, that the statement did not clearly deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The improper comment occurred only during rebuttal argument, and the prosecutor did not repeat that sentiment in his argument. The comment was not limited to a critical issue in the case, but reflected the prosecutor\u2019s naturally positive view of the state\u2019s case in general. We also observe that the remark followed the remarks of the defendant\u2019s counsel as to his opimon that Rivera and Clemonts had lied to the police, and his inference that the state had presented a weak case to the jury, a case that he personally did not find to be \u201cgood enough.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For all of those reasons, we conclude that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s comments clearly deprived him of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions and prejudices of the jurors. The prosecutor stated: \u201c[The defendant\u2019s counsel] had a lot to say. And he\u2019s working very hard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>in defense of his client. And I find it rather curious that one of his comments [concerned] the good of the public because he\u2019s not here representing the public. He\u2019s here representing the defendant .... Let\u2019s keep these comments in perspective.\u201d The prosecutor also remarked: \u201cI can\u2019t help but go back to [defense counsel\u2019s] reference to the public. Keep in mind, he\u2019s representing [the defendant], not the public. My last thought, [defense counsel] spent a lot of time talking about horrible people like Mr. Clemonts and Miss Rivera .... Just keep one thing in mind, if it wasn\u2019t for people like [the defendant], there wouldn\u2019t be any witnesses.\u201d The defendant also cites other portions of the prosecutor\u2019s argument that refer to the defense counsel\u2019s handling of the case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant argues that those comments invited the jury to view negatively both him and his counsel, to view him as someone separate from the public and caused the jury to question the sincerity of his counsel. He also argues that the state \u201cused [his] constitutional rights \u2014 to counsel, to a trial and to present a defense, and the presumption of innocence\u2014 against him when this was not supposed to be a consideration for the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The rule against a prosecutor appealing to the juiy\u2019s emotions, passions or prejudices is firmly established. The prosecutor may argue in favor of a guilty verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>on the basis of the evidence adduced at trial; he or she may not do so by branding the defendant guilty with the use of \u201cpersonal and degrading epithets\u201d to describe the defendant. <em>State </em>v. Alexander, 254 Conn. 290, 307, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). Stated otherwise, the prosecutor\u2019s arguments should not invite the jury to decide the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the basis of \u201c \u2018powerful and irrelevant factors which are likely to skew\u2019 \u201d its rational appraisal of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>256 Conn. 291, 307, 772 A.2d 1107, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1068, 122 S. Ct. 670, 151 L. Ed. 2d 584 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We do not conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were improper. The defendant\u2019s counsel, in his argument, asserted that Steck had conducted a sloppy investigation. His argument went so far as to hint at a conspiracy against the defendant.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He told the jury that it was \u201chis job\u201d to point out inconsistencies in the witness\u2019 testimony, \u201cto demonstrate the truth and to show exactly what went on.\u201d The defense counsel devoted a good portion of his remarks to the motives underlying the testimony of Clemonts and Rivera. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>commenting on Clemonts\u2019 cooperation with the police, defense counsel asked whether his cooperation was good for the public.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To that extent, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were invited.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Furthermore, it is unlikely that the prosecutor\u2019s comments invited the jury to hold against the defendant his exercise of his constitutional right to present a defense. The prosecutor\u2019s statements that defense counsel had a job to do and that defense counsel represented the defendant, rather than the public, when viewed in context, did not prejudice the defendant. The comments reflected generally on the defendant\u2019s attempts to discredit the state\u2019s witnesses and to criticize the police investigation. We are mindful that \u201c[not] every use of rhetorical language or device is improper. . . . The occasional use of rhetorical devices is simply fair argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 310. Viewing those isolated remarks in the context of the trial, and considering that the court\u2019s charge to the jury sufficiently lessened any prejudice caused thereby, we conclude that they did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Cf. <em>State </em>v. Alexander, supra, 254 Conn. 307-308 (comments related to issue at hand involved such strong, negative imagery that they worked to undermine emotional neutrality of jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor attempted to \u201cdilute the [state\u2019s] burden of proof by referring to what evidence the defendant failed to present to the jury.\u201d The defendant specifically points out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>that the prosecutor remarked that \u201c[defense counsel] spent a lot of time talking about things that might be, things that possibly happened. Now, I explained to you, ladies and gentlemen, [defense counsel] has put forth no concrete theory as to what happened.\u201d The prosecutor also commented as to the fact that defense counsel failed to inquire of Clemonts or Rivera if they actually purchased the cocaine from the defendant.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Further, the prosecutor remarked that the defendant had failed to discredit the testimony of Clemonts or Rivera.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The prosecutor also criticized the manner in which the defendant\u2019s counsel cross-examined Rivera, arguing that defense counsel could have used a different photograph while inquiring as to where Steck had been parked when she was purchasing the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We conclude that those remarks were not improper. First, the prosecutor prefaced his remarks by reminding the jury that \u201cit\u2019s the responsibility of the state to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant does not have to put on any evidence.\u201d Second, the remarks were fair descriptions of the evidence presented and fair criticisms of the defendant\u2019s theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>of defense. A prosecutor cannot comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify or imply that a defendant bears the burden of disproving that he or she committed a crime. In contrast, he or she may comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to contradict the state\u2019s case or to support adequately his or her theory of defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>58 Conn. App. 65, 70-71, 751 A.2d 843, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 914, 759 A.2d 508 (2000). Third, the court accurately instructed the jury that the state, not the defendant, carried the burden of proving its case against the defendant with proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The defendant also claims that the prosecutor improperly commented on the fact that the defendant exercised his right not to testify on his own behalf at trial. He points to one comment that the prosecutor made during rebuttal argument wherein he told the jury that the defendant did not need to present any defense.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">\u201cIt is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. . . . Our legislature has given statutory recognition to this right by virtue of its enactment of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84. In determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments have encroached upon a defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, we ask: Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify? . . . Further, in applying this test, we must look to the context in which the statement was made in order to determine the manifest intention which prompted it and its natural and necessary impact upon the jury. . . . Finally, [w]e also recognize that the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Brown, supra, 256 Conn. 310-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The defendant raises, but fails to address adequately, that issue. After noting the prosecutor\u2019s comment in a footnote of his brief, the defendant asserts that \u201c[t]he state implied [that his] decision was a technical maneuver and not the exercise of a constitutional right, and this was not for the jury to consider.\u201d The prosecutor made reference to the fact that the defendant may \u201cdo nothing, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d The prosecutor did not specifically refer to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the witness stand. Having reviewed the remark in the overall context of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, we are not persuaded that it conveyed to the jury any negative connotation as to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The prosecutor made the remark in the context of reminding the jury that the state bore the burden of proof, and he made the remark just before he critiqued the defendant\u2019s attempts to discredit the state\u2019s case. We conclude that the language was not intended to be, nor was it likely to be received, as improper commentary on the defendant\u2019s choice not to testify. Furthermore, we note that in its charge, the court adequately instructed the jury concerning the defendant\u2019s choice not to testify.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments as to the credibility of the witnesses or his opinion as to the defendant\u2019s guilt, viewed separately or together, did not cause substantial prejudice to the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who . . . sells . . . any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who violates section . . . 21a-278 by . . . selling . . . any controlled substance in or on, or within one thousand five hundred feet of, the real property comprising ... a licensed child day care center, as defined in section 19a-77, that is identified as a child day care center by a sign posted in a conspicuous place shall be imprisoned for a term of three years, which shall not be suspended and shall be in addition and consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed for violation of section . . . 21a-278. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\"> At the time he committed the actions underlying his criminal convictions in the present appeals, the defendant was on probation as a result of a 1991 criminal conviction.

The defendant argues that because we should reverse that judgments of conviction, we should also reverse the court\u2019s judgment revoking his probation. Because we affirm the judgment of conviction, that claim has no merit.

You have audiotape, which the confidential informants could\u2019ve been wired up and you would\u2019ve had voices. You would\u2019ve known who was there. You could\u2019ve had videotape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Defense counsel further argued: \u201cNow, I was raised to do things right, and if you\u2019re going to do it right, you do it yourself. Officer Steck could\u2019ve done this himself, too. He could\u2019ve prepared the warrant. He could\u2019ve moved in. He could\u2019ve gotten \u2014 allegedly gotten, [the defendant].</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">\u201cInstead, Officer Steck used confidential informants, who have eyes and interests and motives to tell Officer Steck what he wants to hear. And now, what the state wants to hear.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> The context of defense counsel\u2019s remark was as follows: \u201cNow, let\u2019s look a.t Eddie Clemonts. Remember what he said? And I think the best came out during the very end. . . . What\u2019s convenient is that he remembers exactly what the police officer told him; to go in, come out with crack and then just spit it right back to the police officer. That\u2019s convenient. What else did he say? He said cooperating with the police is good for him. Now, it sure is good for him. But is it good for the public?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> <em>The </em>context of that challenged remark is as follows: \u201cI\u2019d submit to you that as far as [defense counsel\u2019s] transcript goes in reference to what he calls \u2018inconsistencies\u2019 is just something he used. Let\u2019s get back to what\u2019s relative and important in this matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201cNow, the only person here who said, you know, these informants didn\u2019t buy this crack cocaine from someone else is [defense counsel]. And what he says, ladies and gentlemen, isn\u2019t evidence in this case. Now, you noticed in his examination \u2014 cross-examination of Mr. Clemonts and Miss Rivera\u2014 he never flat out asked them, isn\u2019t it true you didn\u2019t buy this crack cocaine from [the defendant]? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201cHe never, throughout those extensive cross-examinations, [asked] that simple question. And I submit to you, it is because he knew that he was not going to change that aspect of their testimony. He knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b314-10\"> The prosecutor stated: \u201cTo their credit, Mr. Clemonts and Miss Rivera came here and told you what happened on those days.

The defendant does not have to put on any evidence. As a judge I once knew used to say, the defendant can sit at the table, cross his arms, fold his legs, do nothing, and that\u2019s fine. You can\u2019t hold it against him. That\u2019s the law. That\u2019s what you have to follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201cBut [defense counsel] and [the defendant] did put on some defense.

The law does not compel the defendant to take the [witness] stand and testify. And no presumption of guilt may be raised, and no adverse inference of any kind may be drawn from the fact that the defendant did <em>not </em>testify.
