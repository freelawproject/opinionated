Melfi, Donna Melfi, Joseph Kozak and Dian Kozak, appeal from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the defendant city of Danbury (city). On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly (1) ordered the first four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>counts of their complaint stricken, (2) dismissed count five and (3) failed to award damages after a hearing in damages. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. \u201cIn July, 1991, the defendants, Robert Lupi and Phyllis Lupi, purchased two adjoining parcels of land; one parcel was located on Old Ball Pond Road in New Fairfield, the second on Old Ball Pond Road in Danbury. The Lupis built a house and began living there in early 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">\u201cSoon after moving into their new home, the Lupis were concerned about traffic on the road. The city of Danbury, in response to these concerns, authorized the closing of the road to through traffic. A gate was erected across Old Ball Pond Road by Robert Lupi. The gate had posts at either end that were cemented into the ground and was secured by a padlock that required a key. It was effective in blocking all vehicular traffic. The Lupis refused to furnish the plaintiffs with a key to the padlock. The gate was removed after seventeen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201cOn October 26, 1992, the plaintiffs brought this action against the Lupis and the city of Danbury seeking an injunction against future obstruction of Old Ball Pond Road by the Lupis or others, as well as damages and other relief.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Melfi </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>38 Conn. App. 466, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>467-68, 661 A.2d 1046 (1995). Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed a revised complaint on January 20, 1993. The city filed a motion to strike, which the court granted, resulting in the striking of all three counts of the complaint. On May 4, 1993, the plaintiffs filed a \u201csubstitute revised complaint\u201d (original complaint) and, again, the court granted a motion to strike all three counts of the complaint. Finally, on September 21,1993, the plaintiffs filed a five count \u201csecond substitute revised complaint\u201d (amended complaint). In response, the city filed a request to revise that complaint on the ground that the first four counts were substantially similar to those stricken twice before. The plaintiffs objected to the city\u2019s request to revise, which the court overruled, finding that the \u201cadditions to [the September 21, 1993, amended] complaint [did] not raise any allegations materially different from those described in the previous complaint,\u201d and ordered the first four counts of the amended complaint deleted. As a result, count five was the only remaining count in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The plaintiffs first claim that the court improperly struck the first four counts of their amended complaint. The plaintiffs cannot prevail on such a claim because it is wholly foreclosed under our Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>183 Conn. 177, 439 A.2d 298 (1981), and <em>Good Humor Corp. </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>160 Conn. 133, 273 A.2d 886 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In <em>Royce, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201c[u]pon the sustaining of a demurrer the losing party may take one of two courses of action. He may amend his pleading, or he may stand on his original pleading, allow judgment to be rendered against him, and appeal the sustaining of the demurrer. . . . The choices are mutually exclusive. The filing of an amended pleading operates as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>waiver of the right to claim that there was error in the sustaining of the demurrer to the original pleading. . . . When a demurrer is sustained and the pleading to which it was directed is amended, that amendment acts to remove the original pleading and the demurrer thereto from the case. The filing of the amended pleading is a withdrawal of the original pleading. . . . [By] withdrawing one complaint and replacing it by another, [the plaintiffs] escaped an adverse judgment, and also abandoned any claim to a favorable judgment on the complaint so withdrawn. ... It is thus clear that a plaintiff cannot file an amendment after the sustaining of a demurrer and, at the same time, appeal from a decision sustaining that demurrer. . . . The rule is a sound one, as it serves to prevent the prolongation of litigation.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 178-79; <em>Good Humor Corp. </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">In the present case, the court struck all three counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 original complaint. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which operated to waive their right to claim that the court improperly struck the three counts of the original complaint. In response to the amended complaint, however, the city filed a request to revise, formerly known as a motion to expunge. See Practice Book 10-35. The court granted the city\u2019s request to revise and deleted the first four counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint because they were not materially different from the three counts stricken from the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">We note that \u201c[w]hen the allegations of an amended complaint appear to be the same in substance as those of an earlier complaint that was stricken, the defendant may challenge the amended complaint by filing a request to revise ... or a second motion to strike. . . . The request to revise is a [request] for an order directing the opposing party to revise his pleading in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>the manner specified. . . . Although the request to revise may not ordinarily be used to substantively challenge a pleading, it may be used to delete otherwise improper allegations from a complaint. . . . The motion to strike, on the other hand, challenges the legal sufficiency of the pleading by testing whether the complaint states a cause of action on which relief can be granted. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cAlthough [a motion to strike and a request to revise] generally serve different functions, either may be used when the amended complaint merely restates the original cause of action that was previously stricken. ... If the plaintiff here has in fact merely restated the original cause of action, the defendant would prevail on either pleading.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Marselle, </em>38 Conn. App. 360, 362-63, 660 A.2d 871 (1995), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 236 Conn. 845, 675 A.2d 835 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">We consider, therefore, only whether the court properly granted the city\u2019s request to revise the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint by interpreting the pleadings in the underlying action and comparing the original complaint with the amended complaint; see <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>53 Conn. App. 282, 286, 730 A.2d 1184 (1999); \u201cwhich presents a question of law and is subject to de novo review on appeal.\u201d Id. In addition, \u201c[w]hen reviewing the facts alleged in a complaint, we consider them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d Id., 288. \u201cIf the amended complaint stated a new cause of action, the [request to revise] should have been denied. If, however, the amended complaint merely restated the original cause of action, without curing the defect, the [request to revise] was properly granted.\u201d <em>Good Humor Corp. </em>v. <em>Ricciuti, </em>supra, 160 Conn. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Of the thirty-two paragraphs in the first count of the amended complaint, twenty-eight are precisely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>same as in the original complaint. Paragraphs nine, ten, eleven and thirty-two, which are new, do not state a new cause of action or cure the defect. Paragraphs nine and ten allege that the city \u201cinduced\u201d the Lupis, as its \u201cauthorized agent,\u201d to erect a gate. Paragraph eleven alleges that \u201cbut for\u201d such inducement, the gate would not have been erected. Paragraph thirty-two alleges that the plaintiffs were \u201charmed\u201d by such conduct. Paragraphs nine, ten, eleven and thirty-two fail to allege facts sufficient to cure the defect as found by the court when it granted the city\u2019s motion to strike count one of the original complaint. The court aptly noted, and we agree, that the additional paragraphs in the amended complaint add nothing more than mere conclusory statements<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to count one and do \u201cnot differ in substance from the prior complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Count two is virtually the same in the amended complaint as it was in the original complaint. The only addition is an allegation added to paragraph thirty-eight that the city \u201cerected the gate through its agent the Lupis . . . .\u201d Count two, therefore, amounts to nothing more than a conclusory statement devoid of the factual allegations necessary to cure the defect of the original pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Count three of the amended complaint alleges statutory nuisance. This pleading, although technically asserting a different cause of action, is different from the original complaint in title only. Count three incorporates all of the allegations of count two of the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>complaint. In so doing, it fails to allege any new facts that would differentiate it from count two of the original complaint. Count three of the amended complaint is merely a restatement of the allegations set forth in count two of the original complaint, which were stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Count four of the amended complaint is virtually identical to count three of the original complaint with the exception of one additional allegation in paragraph forty-seven, which provides that \u201c[t]he City of Danbury flagrantly exposed the Plaintiffs to peril of life and limb with no proper reason for doing so.\u201d Absent new factual allegations, count four of the amended complaint simply restates the allegations previously stricken in count three of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">We conclude, on the basis of our de novo review of the pleadings in the underlying action, that counts one through four of the amended complaint are substantially the same and merely restate the causes of action in each of the counts previously stricken from the original complaint. The plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations, even when viewed in a light most favorable to them, amount to nothing more than conclusory statements unsubstantiated by supportive facts. See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Connecticut Hospice, Inc., </em>56 Conn. App. 134, 136-37, 741 A.2d 349 (1999) (conclusory statements absent supportive facts insufficient to survive motion to strike), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 938, 747 A.2d 2 (2000). Because we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint fails to cure the defects of their original pleadings, which the court struck, the court properly granted the city\u2019s request to revise and deleted counts one through four of the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly dismissed the fifth count of their amended complaint,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>thereby denying them due process of law. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly concluded that because count five incorporated all of the allegations stated in the four counts previously stricken, it must also fail due to its absence of any factual allegations. We note at the outset that the plaintiffs preserved their right to challenge the court\u2019s dismissal of the fifth count by objecting to the court\u2019s order in a timely manner and by choosing not to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Following the court\u2019s striking of the first four counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, the court inquired of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as to why the action should proceed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finding that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>were no factual allegations in the fifth count, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>granted the city\u2019s oral motion to dismiss count five, resulting in a dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The plaintiffs essentially ask this court to reverse the court\u2019s dismissal of the amended complaint by concluding that the only remaining count contained sufficient factual allegations to allow that cause of action to proceed to trial. The plaintiffs pray for such relief in light of the fact that all the referenced factual allegations of count five were previously stricken from the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Our standard of review of a motion to dismiss is well established. \u201cIn ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. . . . PYirthermore, it is the law in our courts . . . that [a] court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Villager Pond, Inc. </em>v. <em>Darien, 54 </em>Conn. App. 178, 183, 734 A.2d 1031 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">After the court granted the city\u2019s request to revise, four counts of the amended complaint were deleted. The remaining count stated as follows: \u201c1. Paragraphs 1 through 47 of the Fourth Count are incorporated by reference herein as paragraphs 1 through 47 of the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Count as though set forth herein. 48. In so acting, the Defendants negligently inflicted emotional distress upon the Plaintiffs, and such distress was severe. Wherefore, the Plaintiffs seek damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Count five is completely devoid of any factual allegations. Even if we were to apply our standard of review liberally, there are simply no facts to construe in a manner most favorable to the plaintiffs. Count five of the amended complaint specifically references allegations that no longer exist. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument that count five was not altered by any motion to strike or revise, therefore leaving intact its referenced factual allegations, is unpersuasive because those allegations are nonexistent. Because count five fails to allege any facts in support of its claim of emotional distress, it is clear that \u201cno relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. As a result, count five could not withstand the city\u2019s motion to dismiss, which the court properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The plaintiffs also claim that they were denied due process when the court dismissed count five of the amended complaint because \u201cthey had no notice as to any perceived insufficiency\u201d regarding it. This claim is disingenuous and wholly without merit. The court heard argument from both parties before it granted the city\u2019s oral motion to dismiss and was under no obligation whatsoever to inform the plaintiffs of any insufficiency in their complaint, or otherwise. Furthermore, the court deleted the first four counts of the amended complaint nearly seven years before granting the city\u2019s oral motion to dismiss the fifth count of that complaint. Common sense would have suggested to the plaintiffs that they carefully parse their remaining count for its sufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>during that time.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs cannot now attempt to pass the onus of pleading sufficiently onto the court by way of a due process claim based on lack of notice, because such an onus rests squarely on the party pleading, not the trial court. See <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 290 n.7 (plaintiff has burden of adequately pleading his case); see also Practice Book \u00a7 10-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 final claim is that the court improperly failed to award them damages following the hearing in damages as to the Lupis. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that because a default judgment conclusively determines liability, they were, at the very least, entitled to nominal damages. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The court rendered a default judgment against the Lupis on January 19, 1993, and ordered the case to proceed to a hearing in damages. \u201cThe significance of an entry of default against a defendant in a legal action is that it entitles the plaintiff to at least nominal damages. . . . The entry of default, when appropriately made, conclusively determines the liability of a defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Ratner v. Willametz, </em>9 Conn. App. 565, 579, 520 A.2d 621 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">It was improper for the court to fail to award damages to the plaintiffs. Because liability already had been conclusively established as to the Lupis, the plaintiffs, at the very least, were entitled to nominal damages. Although technically incorrect, the failure to award damages does not require a remand. \u201c [N] o purpose would be furthered by a remand because the damages to be awarded to the plaintiff against the defendants could only be nominal based upon the substantive findings of the trial court at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>the hearing in damages.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 580. We will not ordinarily remand a case for \u201cthe mere failure to award nominal damages.\u201d <em>Clay </em>v. <em>Teach, </em>37 Conn. App. 556, 560, 656 A.2d 1065, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 902, 659 A.2d 1205 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-8\"><em> </em>\u201cOn December 15,1992, the plaintiffs made a motion to default the Lupis for failure to appear. The motion was granted on December 23, 1992. The trial court, <em>Fuller, J., </em>granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on January 19, 1993, and ordered the case to proceed to a hearing in damages as to the Lupis. The case was still pending as to the defendant city of Danbury. On April 22,1994, the trial court, <em>McGrath, J., </em>by memorandum of decision, denied the plaintiffs any recovery of damages, finding the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence not credible.\u201d <em>Melfi </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>38 Conn. App. 466, 468, 661 A.2d 1046 (1995). The plaintiffs appealed, and this court dismissed their appeal sua sponte for lack of a final judgment because the case was still pending as against the city. Id., 470. The court\u2019s failure to award the plaintiffs damages as to the Lupis is the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 third claim on appeal, which is addressed in part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> See <em>Hendel\u2019s Investors Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, of Appeals, </em>62 Conn.
