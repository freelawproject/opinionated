At approximately noon and again at 4 p.m. on January 9, 1997, Kyle Dunn and his friend, Amy Ditota, rented Ditota\u2019s purple and black Geo Tracker vehicle to three men, the defendant and two others known as Miquel and Goolie, in exchange for narcotics. The men returned the vehicle at approximately 7:30 p.m. the same day. At approximately 7:15 p.m. on January 9, 1997, the Waterbury police responded to a reported shooting in front of a grocery store on Willow Street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Upon their arrival, the police located one victim, Naomi Williams, who was found on the ground bleeding in the doorway of the store.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The police later located a second victim, Joel Mercado, at Waterbury Hospital.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> According to the victims, the shots were fired from a purple and black \u201cJeep-like\u201d vehicle containing three individuals, although neither victim could identify the assailants. During a subsequent search of the scene, detectives found thirteen shell casings. The shell casings were of two different types of ammunition; ten were .22 caliber and three were ten millimeter. The police recovered no bullets at the scene. The police did not identify any of the bullets that injured the victims by their type, nor did the state present any bullets as evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Henry Mercado, Joel Mercado\u2019s brother, was not with his brother at the time of the shooting, but they were together earlier in the day and saw the purple and black vehicle pass them several times. He identified the three individuals whom he saw in the vehicle at that time as \u201cMiguel, Poncho<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Goolie\u201d and stated that Miguel Torres, an acquaintance from school, was the driver of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">On January 10, 1997, Mark Butler, a police lieutenant, and three members of the Waterbury police department went to the Fairmount Projects in Waterbury to investigate the defendant\u2019s connection with the shooting. Two police officers arrived at the home of Demetrice Chapman, with whom the defendant had fathered a daughter, and spoke with her for about five minutes. Chapman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>apprised the police that the defendant owned a blue Thunderbird vehicle that he kept in a nearby parking lot. While the police interviewed Chapman, two other officers approached the rear exit of the home. There they encountered the defendant approaching the home carrying a car battery. During a patdown search of the defendant, the detectives found a set of keys, which they later determined fit the blue Thunderbird. The police arrested the defendant on charges unrelated to the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After leaving the Chapman residence, James Nardozzi, a police detective, and other police officers went to a residence to interview Dunn regarding the shooting. Dunn agreed to give a statement and did so at the police station. He apprised the police that he had seen the defendant with a ten millimeter gun and that the gun was a \u201cproject,\u201d meaning that \u201cwhoever needs it, gets it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The police obtained a search warrant for the Thunderbird at approximately 10:30 p.m. on January 10, 1997. At that time, the car was located on Lestor Drive near Chapman\u2019s residence. At some point between 6:08 p.m., January 10, and early January 11, the car was towed to the police station garage. In the early morning hours of January 11, the police searched the vehicle at the police station garage. During the search, they seized a ten millimeter Colt pistol with its serial number obliterated and one round in its chamber. They also seized a magazine containing one round of ammunition, later determined to belong to that weapon, and one round of ten millimeter ammunition found under the front passenger seat. Investigators later determined that the three ten millimeter shell casings found at the scene of the shooting were from this pistol, while the ten .22 caliber shell casings were from a different weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Additional facts will be set forth as necessary to resolve the claims raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Specifically, the defendant argues that \u201cthe state has failed to prove the essential elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt because the circumstantial evidence adduced at trial does not preclude the very reasonable hypotheses: (1) that the victims were actually shot by the gun which threw off the .22 caliber shell casings, which reasonable conclusion requires the reversal of the defendant\u2019s two assault in the first degree charges; (2) that, because others clearly had equal access to the ten millimeter gun found in the 1986 Blue Thunderbird, there is insufficient evidence to establish the identity of the shooter and that individual who defaced the identification mark on the handgun, thus the remaining convictions . . . must be reversed as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cThe standard of appellate review of a denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal [challenging the sufficiency of the evidence] has been settled by judicial decision. . . . The issue to be determined is whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, from the facts established and the reasonable inferences which could be drawn from those facts, that the cumulative effect was to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . The facts and the reasonable inferences stemming from the facts must be given a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>59 Conn. App. 771, 776-77, 758 A.2d 400 (2000), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 258 Conn. 1, 778 A.2d 186 (2001). We also note that \u201c[t]here is no distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence so far as probative force is concerned . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>193 Conn. 612, 625, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>480 A.2d 452 (1984); 1B. Holden &amp; J. Daly, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7c, p. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The defendant argues that the state failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the identity element of the crimes with which he was charged. Specifically, he argues that no one identified him as either the passenger or the driver of the black and purple vehicle, nor did the state present any evidence as to the type of bullets that injured the victims. He further challenges the sufficiency of the identification evidence because others had access to the weapon in the Thunderbird. Consequently, he argues that the evidence did not preclude the reasonable hypotheses that the victims were actually shot by the gun that fired the .22 caliber shell casings and that another person could have been the shooter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">To secure a conviction for assault in the first degree under \u00a7 59a-59 (a) (1), the state must \u201c[establish] beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury to another person; (2) he in fact caused serious physical injury to that person; and (3) he caused that injury by means of a dangerous instrument.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Prat, </em>66 Conn. App. 91, 95, 784 A.2d 367 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">\u201cWhere, as here, the identification of the defendant is derived from circumstantial evidence, it is, nonetheless, the cumulative impact of a multitude of factors that must be examined to determine whether the identification of the defendant has been satisfactorily established by circumstantial evidence. ... In criminal cases, including the most serious ones, the fact that an accused was the person who committed the criminal act may be proved by circumstantial evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s sole province as the trier of fact is to draw all reasonable and logical inferences from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>facts as it finds them to exist. . . . The issue of the identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime is peculiarly one of fact to be resolved by the jury. ... If evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, should convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused is guilty, that is all that is required for a conviction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>32 Conn. App. 193, 201-202, 628 A.2d 996, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 920, 632 A.2d 698 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Initially, we note, as does the defendant, that the question is not whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence, but rather whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the trier of fact\u2019s verdict of guilty. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>242 Conn. 485, 490, 698 A.2d 898 (1997). The state argues on appeal that its burden of proof was simply to show that the defendant used a \u201cdeadly weapon,\u201d defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (6) as \u201cany weapon . . . from which a shot may be discharged . . . .\u201d The state argues that it did not need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the actual weapon that the defendant used was the ten millimeter gun, rather than the .22 caliber weapon. While we agree with this statement, we note that the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did in fact use the ten millimeter weapon in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following additional facts relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendant had a motive to kill individuals who had tried to kill him previously. Chapman testified that the defendant stated that they should not drive in the area of the shooting because the defendant \u201csaid he had problems there.\u201d At approximately 7:30 p.m. on the night of the shooting when the defendant returned the vehicle to Dunn, the defendant told him that they \u201chad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>problems\u201d and \u201cthat someone tried to kill them\u201d while they were gone. Dunn recounted further that the defendant stated that \u201c[t]hey got into a beef and did what they had to do\u201d and that \u201c[the defendant] went and solved his problems.\u201d Chapman also testified that upon returning to her house, the defendant stated that \u201cwe got them, we got them. They tried to bust me.\u201d When viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, this evidence supports the inference that the defendant took responsibility for taking part in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Henry Mercado and Joel Mercado saw the defendant, Miguel Torres and Goolie driving a black and purple Jeep vehicle on Willow Street on the day of the shooting. Dunn testified that he rented a black and purple Jeep vehicle to the defendant and two others at 4 p.m., that they returned it at 7:30 p.m., and that upon returning the vehicle the defendant said that they had been driving on Willow Street \u201cwhen people were falling on the ground.\u201d From this evidence, the jury could have inferred that the defendant, Miguel and Goolie were in a black and purple Jeep vehicle in the area of the shooting at approximately 7 p.m. on the night of the shooting and that Joel Mercado and Williams were shot and fell to ground at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Finally, the defendant possessed the ten millimeter pistol that was used during the shooting of the victims. The jury reasonably could have found this based on the fact that when the police arrested the defendant, on the day after the shooting, he was carrying a battery from his car and that this car was later determined to contain the ten millimeter weapon used in the shooting. Additionally, Chapman testified that the defendant did not go to work on January 9 or 10, 1997, and that she told the defendant when others used the Thunderbird while he was at work. When asked by the state\u2019s attorney whether she saw anybody else on those days at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>his Thunderbird, Chapman testified that she could not recall. Further, Dunn testified that he had seen the defendant in possession of the weapon prior to the shooting. The state also introduced evidence, obtained from a confidential informant, that the defendant kept a gun in the Thunderbird.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">In addition to the evidence noted previously, we also agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s access to the Thunderbird, later determined to contain a gun used in the shooting, at a time immediately surrounding the shooting is probative of his identity as the shooter. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>221 Conn. 713, 722 n.2, 607 A.2d 391, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 872, 113 S. Ct. 207, 121 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On the basis of our review of the evidence, and construing the evidence, as we must, in a light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have concluded, from the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect was to establish the defendant\u2019s identity as the shooter beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as to his conviction of criminal attempt to commit murder, conspiracy to commit murder and alteration of a firearm identification number. The defendant again argues that his conviction as to these crimes must be reversed because, in his view, the evidence is insufficient to support the identification element of each crime. The defendant asserts that because others had access to the ten millimeter weapon found in his blue Thunderbird, the identification evidence was insufficient as to the remaining charges as well. On the basis of the evidence discussed previously, we conclude that its cumulative effect was sufficient to prove beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>reasonable doubt the identification element for these crimes. With respect to the alteration charge, we refer to \u00a7 29-36 (a), which provides in relevant part that possession of a weapon on which the identification mark has been altered or obliterated is \u201cprima facie\u201d evidence that the person in possession of the weapon altered or obliterated the identification number. Further, \u201c\u00a7 29-36 does not, by its language, limit application of the inference to situations in which the accused is in actual possession of a pistol. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Alfonso, </em>3 Conn. App. 225, 226-27, 486 A.2d 1136 (1985) (defendant convicted under \u00a7 29-36 where altered gun found in cinder block windowsill of second floor of building).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>246 Conn. 339, 356 n. 18, 717 A.2d 696 (1998). Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not improperly deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s conviction of all the charges, aside from the identification challenge, the defendant has failed to provide any other grounds or alternative analysis for our review of his claim. Accordingly, we decline to review this claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion to suppress the evidence recovered from the Thunderbird as the fruit of an illegal search and seizure. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The following facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. The police obtained the information they used in their application for the search warrant at different times and from several sources during the course of their investigation. Howard Jones, a police detective, spoke to Heruy Mercado at the police station during the evening of January 9, 1997. As noted previously, on January 10, 1997, Nardozzi and other officers spoke with Chapman, who told them that the defendant owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>a blue Ford Thunderbird. She told them that the defendant kept the vehicle in a parking lot near to her residence. At approximately 7:30 p.m. on January 10, 1997, Jones took a statement from Chapman at the police station. On the basis of the information supplied by Henry Mercado and Chapman, Jones and another detective applied for and obtained a search warrant for the blue Ford Thunderbird at approximately 10:30 p.m. on January 10, 1997. Nardozzi testified that he had no personal knowledge of when the vehicle was towed. Nardozzi testified that the vehicle was towed from Lestor Drive, on the side facing Brook Side Road, about 100 to 200 feet away from Chapman\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Defense counsel subpoenaed the police records pertaining to when the vehicle was towed. The police did not produce the records, and the trial was suspended in order to locate the records. When trial resumed, Sergeant Edward Daponete of the Waterbury police department testified that the car might have been towed because it was impeding traffic.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At some point between 6:08 p.m. on January 10, when the police initiated a motor vehicle investigation and the early morning of January 11,1997, a towing company towed the vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>cle from the lot near Chapman\u2019s residence to the police garage. Neither party adduced evidence as to the precise time that the vehicle was towed. The police executed the search warrant on the vehicle between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. on January 11, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained by the police as a result of their seizure of the blue Thunderbird because he believed it was seized at approximately 6:08 p.m., prior to the issuance of the warrant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, concluding that \u201c[it had] no evidence that there was any seizure or search of this vehicle except after the warrant was signed by Judge Doherty, and, therefore, the motion to suppress is accordingly denied.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we apply a familiar' standard of review to a trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>with a motion to suppress. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record .... The conclusions drawn by the trial court will be upheld unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the evidence. . . . Because a trial court\u2019s determination of the validity of a . . . [seizure] implicates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, however, we engage in a careful examination of the record to ensure that the court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vivo, </em>241 Conn. 665, 674\u201475, 697 A.2d 1130 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The state argues that the defendant on appeal does not contest probable cause for the warrant. Rather, the defendant concentrates on the alleged illegality of the seizure. Specifically, he argues that \u201c[b]ecause the seizure of the car was initiated before the warrant was signed . . . the validity of the warrant is moot.\u201d \u201cOrdinarily, police may not conduct a sear ch unless they first obtain a search warrant from a neutral magistrate after establishing probable cause. [A] search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 209, 530 A.2d 603 (1987). In attacking the legality of the seizure, the defendant concentrates his argument solely on the timing of the seizure. Therefore, we will limit our review to an analysis of the court\u2019s conclusions relating to the timing of the seizure of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">At the suppression hearing, the court determined that the vehicle was not seized prior to the issuance of the search warrant at approximately 10 p.m. on January 10,1997. This determination is a finding of fact and will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68, 634 A.2d 879 (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant had not been seized any time prior to his formal arrest was finding of fact subject to clearly erroneous standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The court noted that while Daponete testified that records showed that the vehicle was involved in a motor vehicle investigation at 6:08 p.m. on January 10, 1997, the information adduced at trial did not establish when the vehicle was towed. The defendant argues that the state conceded that the vehicle was towed prior to the issuance of the warrant and that the facts<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> surrounding the seizure establish that the seizure was executed illegally. The state responds, however, that it simply assumed the illegality of the search to make an alternate argument for admitting the evidence seized from the blue Thunderbird and denying the motion to suppress in the event that the court held that the seizure was illegal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s assertion as to this concession is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">During the hearing, the court heard testimony concerning the procedures followed by the police department when arranging for towing seized vehicles, as well as testimony concerning the police records of the tow in the present case. Daponete testified that the police incident report indicated that the investigation began at 6:08 p.m. on January 10, 1997. A separate document indicated the make and model of the vehicle but did not contain a reference to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Jones testified as to the application for the warrant, as well as the timing of the seizure. During cross-exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>nation, defense counsel and Jones engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And by your best recollection, you believe [Judge Doherty signed the warrant] on or about 10 p.m. on January 10th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201c[Jones]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: You believe the execution of the warrant was done by Detective Nardozzi?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u201c[Jones]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: It was subsequent to that period of time whatever that time may be on or about ten o\u2019clock p.m. that the car was then towed to the station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u201c[Jones]: I believe so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Later during the suppression hearing, Nardozzi also testified as to the timing of the tow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Did there come a time when [the blue Thunderbird] was towed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">\u201c[Nardozzi]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Do you know when that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">\u201c[Nardozzi]: Sometime during the <em>late night, </em>of the 10th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-17\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Did you play any role in having that car towed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-18\">\u201c[Nardozzi]: No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-19\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Do you have any personal knowledge about whether the time relationship between the warrant that you executed was prepared and when the car was towed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-20\">\u201c[Nardozzi]: No, I did not.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In sum, the court did not hear any affirmative evidence that the vehicle was towed prior to the issuance of the warrant, whereas it heard testimony from at least one member of the Waterbary police familiar with the investigation that the vehicle was towed after the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The court\u2019s ruling on the motion specifically addressed the lack of evidence to support the defendant\u2019s argument that the vehicle was towed prior to police obtaining the search warrant. As noted previously, the defendant is incorrect in assuming that the state conceded as much in the course of offering alternate arguments. Moreover, evidence showed that the traffic investigation started at 6:08 p.m. on January 10, 1997, that this fact does not establish when the vehicle was towed and that there are no other records available that do indicate when the vehicle was towed. Finally, the court heard from at least one witness who testified that the vehicle was towed after the police obtained the- warrant, i.e., after 10:30 p.m. on January 10, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">On the basis of the evidence before the court at the suppression hearing, its conclusion that there was no problem with the timing of the warrant and the seizure of the blue Thunderbird was not clearly erroneous. After our careful examination of the record, we farther conclude that the court\u2019s decision to deny the motion to suppress was legally and logically correct and was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The defendant claims finally that the presentence investigation that was conducted by the office of adult probation was inadequate, thus violating his due process rights under the federal constitution. Specifically, the defendant argues that the presentence investigation was conducted in \u201can expedited fashion that failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>properly to permit development of those elements necessary for the trial court to impose [a] fair sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The defendant concedes that he did not preserve this claim for appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part that \u201c [t]he court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . .\u201d We also note that the defendant did not seek review of his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The defendant nevertheless raises plain error in his reply brief, arguing that his defense counsel \u201calert[ed] the trial court to the error now claimed . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We reject the defendant\u2019s request for plain error review. First, \u201c[p]lain error is properly reserved for those extraordinary situations where the error is so obvious that the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial process would be impaired were we to fail to address an issue that was not raised or preserved at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics </em>Corp., 222 Conn. 62, 69, 607 A.2d 431 (1992).

The court adopts those three positions taken by the state. With regard to the positions on the law, including evidence that is a car that would inevitably would have been discovered and contents discovered, I don\u2019t find any time discrepancies at all here. State\u2019s number two, first document in time according to Sergeant Daponete says that there was a motor vehicle investigation of this car around, on January 10, 1997, 6:08 p.m., has nothing to do with when it was towed or anything else.

The defendant also asserts that a car towed for parking violations is taken to the towing agency until a fine is paid, not to a police department garage. The defendant offered no evidence to support his allegations concerning this aspect of police towing procedures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> At trial, the state argued that the inevitable search doctrine would be applicable to remove the taint from the hypothetically illegal seizure.
