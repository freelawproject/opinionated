Dowd, </em>No. CV 98-1261, slip op. at 7 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">The district court dismissed Evans\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) because, if Evans were to prevail, the validity of Evans\u2019 criminal conviction would be undermined. Evans concedes that a portion of his claim is barred by <em>Heck, </em>but contends that a portion of his claim is still viable against those defendants who acted, post-conviction, to improperly deny his New York Freedom of Information Law requests. To the extent that his \u00a7 1983 claim is not barred by <em>Heck, </em>we nonetheless affirm the district court because Evans can point to no constitutional right that was violated by the defendant\u2019s failure to fulfill his document request.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
