Their attorneys have fled motions to withdraw as counsel and briefs pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and briefs stating that counsel cannot identify any nonfrivolous issues for review. Because our independent review of the record and the briefs on appeal pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Nunez-Garcia and Ibarra-Moreno knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal and were sentenced within the terms of the plea agreements, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeals. <em>United States v.
