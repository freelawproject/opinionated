Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. CH-0841-00-0743-1-1 (March 19, 2001). Because Yahle had essentially accepted the retirement date that OPM used to calculate her annuity, and because the Board committed no errors of law in reaching this determination, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Yahle\u2019s former federal employer, the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d), discharged Yahle in 1993, after Yahle had worked there only during the six-month \u201cprobation\u201d period. Yahle thereafter sued the DVA for unlawful discrimination, and the parties\u2019 subsequent settlement agreement and court order stipulated that, in order to make Yahle eligible for disability retirement benefits, DVA would treat Yahle as if she had gone on \u201cleave without pay\u201d (\u201cLWOP\u201d) status from the time of her actual discharge (January 1993) to the time of the resignation date set in the settlement contract (November 1998). (J.A. 138-39.) The DVA also agreed to pay Yahle $20,000 in back pay and another $25,000 for emotional distress, as well as Yahle\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">To qualify for disability retirement benefits, a federal employee must have at least 18 months service. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8451(a)(1)(A). The more months worked, however, the more an employee who qualifies for these benefits will actually receive in terms of monthly payments. Generally speaking, months spent on LWOP status count about half as much as the months spent actually working for purposes of calculating the amount that an eligible employee will receive in disability retirement payments. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8411(d) (stating that an employee who takes \u201cleaves of absence without pay\u201d will receive six months\u2019 credit for every \u201ccalendar year\u201d spent in LWOP status).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">OPM Calculates Yahle\u2019s Disability Retirement Annuity</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">In calculating the monthly amount owed to Yahle in disability retirement benefits, the Office of Personnel Management granted Yahle the 18-month minimum needed to so qualify. (J.A. 52-54.) Yahle argued to OPM that in calculating her monthly payments, OPM instead had to consider all the time she spent in LWOP status, as the DVA-Yahle settlement agreement states. (J.A. 56-57, 139.) OPM countered that, in its view, a contract did not and could not govern its calculations for determining the amount owed on a disability retirement annuity; and that OPM therefore had to give Yahle only the 18-month minimum needed to so qualify. <em>(See </em>J.A. 54.) Yahle appealed OPM\u2019s decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">The Administrative Judge\u2019s Telephonic Hearing with Yahle</p>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">In September 2000, Yahle submitted to the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) a \u201cprehearing submission,\u201d which identifies as one of the three issues for the Board: \u201c(b) Whether the computation of [Yahle\u2019s] annuity should be based upon 18 months of service up to June 20, 1994[,] or 42 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>of service up to November 4, 1998.\u201d (J.A. 27.) A month later, in October 2000, the AJ held a telephonic status conference, at which Yahle and her lawyer acknowledged the \u201cchoice\u201d Yahle now had about the retirement date she wanted to use for purposes of her annuity: June 1994 or November 1998. <em>(See </em>J.A. 22.) Yahle also acknowledged the consequences of choosing this latter 1998 date, including the consequences of having the annuity payments start at a later date, of having to \u201cpay back benefits she received under\u201d the earlier 1994 date, and of having \u201ccertain tax problems associated with\u201d that 1998 date. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The AJ and the parties also discussed the problem that Yahle had with the certified record that DVA had submitted to OPM for purposes of calculating Yahle\u2019s annuity. This certified record does not reflect the $20,000 that Yahle received in \u201cback pay\u201d under the parties\u2019 settlement agreement. According to the \u201csummary of telephonic hearing conference,\u201d Yahle and her lawyer indicated that they would attempt to address this matter with the DVA, not OPM; as the Administrative Judge noted, \u201cOPM has no authority to change the information contained on this [certified record], and should OPM have properly calculated the appellant [Yahle\u2019s] annuity based on the [record], I must uphold OPM\u2019s determination.\u201d (J.A. 23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Yahle subsequently elected to forego a hearing on the merits. Nothing in the record shows that, after the October 2000 telephonic hearing, Yahle had objected to OPM\u2019s use of the June 1994 retirement date, as opposed to the November 1998 date.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The Board Affirms OPM\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">In March 2001, the AJ upheld OPM\u2019s decision. First, as stated in the AJ\u2019s decision, Yahle did not object to OPM\u2019s use of the June 1994 date (as opposed to the November 1998 date) by the time the AJ had closed the record. (J.A. 2 n. 1.) Again, if Yahle chose the November 1998 date, she would have also had to make \u201cannuity overpayment^]\u201d \u2014 presumably because she had already received payments from the government that she was not yet entitled to receive \u2014 and likely would have faced adverse tax consequences. According to the AJ, OPM had simply made the choice for her based on what OPM viewed as the \u201cmost advantageous\u201d decision for Yahle.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">Taking the effective retirement date of June 21, 1994, then, the AJ also rejected Yahle\u2019s claim that OPM should have instead calculated the annuity amount by using the pay rates applicable in November 1998, not June 1994. \u201cBy definition,\u201d the AJ reasoned, Yahle could not use pay rates that were in effect in 1998 when she had effectively retired in 1994. <em>(See </em>J.A. 3.) Citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.406(b)(2)\u00ae, the AJ also rejected Yahle\u2019s assertion that OPM had erroneously failed to credit her for \u201cwithin-grade step increases\u201d for the time she spent in LWOP status. <em>(Id.) </em>As the AJ saw it, Yahle could not use the time spent in LWOP status toward the time requirements (or \u201cwaiting period\u201d) for a \u201cwithin-grade step increase,\u201d since the regulation disallows such credit for any \u201cnonpay\u201d leave that exceeds two weeks. <em>(See </em>J.A. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">Last, the AJ concluded that OPM did not err by refusing to take into account the $20,000 that Yahle had received in back pay for purposes of calculating her annuity. (J.A. 4) (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 841.106). Under the AJ\u2019s analysis, the regulations prohibit OPM from taking action on any annuity account based on anything other than the \u201cindividual retirement record\u201d certified by an employing agency. <em>(Id.) </em>The certified record that OPM received from Yahle\u2019s employing agency (the DVA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>did not list this $20,000 back pay award. <em>(Id.) </em>In addition, citing Board precedent, the AJ reasoned that OPM did not have to consider a lump-sum award of back pay in calculating an annuity. <em>(Id.) </em>(citing <em>Reed v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>32 M.S.P.R. 290, 293 (M.S.P.B.1987), <em>aff'd, </em>837 F.2d 1097 (Fed.Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The AJ\u2019s decision became final in April 2001. This petition for review followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We play a limited role in reviewing Board decisions. Rather than reviewing anew the issues and evidence presented by Yahle, we must affirm the Board unless its decision was (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir.1995). Applying this deferential standard of review, we reject the four arguments that Yahle now makes in her petition and affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Yahle first argues that, contrary to the AJ\u2019s statement in her opinion, she did indeed present and preserve the issue about the \u201ceffective starting date\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the effective retirement date) that she wants for purposes of calculating her annuity benefits. Yahle cites nothing in the record to actually support this assertion. The government itself, meanwhile, charitably points to the single statement of the issue in Yahle\u2019s \u201cpre-hearing submission\u201d to the AJ. Nevertheless, the government maintains that Yahle \u201cwaived\u201d this issue for our review because she failed \u201cto raise it at the MSPB hearing, and thus failed to preserve error on this issue.\u201d (Resp\u2019t Br. at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Of course, no hearing (besides the telephonic conference) ever actually took place, if only because Yahle herself had elected to forego that right. Even so, we agree with the government that Yahle failed to preserve this issue. Appellate courts ordinarily refuse to consider issues not raised before an administrative agency. <em>Kachanis v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>212 F.3d 1289, 1293 (Fed.Cir.2000). A party must raise objections to an agency while that agency \u201chas an opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wallace v. Dep\u2019t of Air Force, </em>879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed.Cir. 1989)). In addition, a party must raise that objection or issue \u201cwith sufficient specificity and clarity [so] that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in sufficient time that the agency can do so.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">Our precedents illustrate why Yahle has failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. In <em>Wallace, </em>we held that a petitioner had failed to preserve an issue about the validity of certain \u201cperformance standards\u201d when the pretrial submission filed with the AJ did not mention \u201cperformance standards\u201d in the single issue presented or else in the \u201cthree paragraphs that followed.\u201d 879 F.2d at 833. The petitioner only later explicitly presented the issue to the full Board. <em>Id. </em>at 832. By contrast, in <em>Kachanis, </em>we held that a petitioner had sufficiently preserved an issue for our review. <em>Id. </em>at 1294. Unlike here, the petitioner there described that issue at length in \u201chis written pretrial submissions\u201d to the AJ, raised the issue again \u201cin his closing brief\u2019 to the AJ, \u201cemphasized his position during his closing remarks\u201d to the AJ, and raised the issue again before the Board. <em>See </em>212 F.3d at 1293-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>This case lies somewhere between <em>Wallace </em>and <em>Kachanis; </em>but ultimately, we agree with the government that a \u201cwaiver\u201d occurred, <em>i.e., </em>that Yahle failed to exhaust or otherwise fairly present this issue for the AJ\u2019s or the Board\u2019s consideration. In the 167-page record, Yahle cites nothing to show she had squarely presented the issue for the AJ\u2019s review. True, the pretrial submission does list the issue. But the record of the telephonic conference, which occurred about a month <em>after </em>Yahle had filed her pretrial hearing submission, indicates that the AJ had given Yahle the \u201cchoice\u201d of deciding whether she wanted the 1994 or the 1998 retirement date (and the problems associated with it). <em>{See </em>J.A. 22.) Nothing after that telephonic conference \u2014 not a brief, not a closing statement, not anything else \u2014 shows that Yahle did anything to alert the AJ about her position on this issue. Thus, the AJ could have reasonably concluded that Yahle now thought that OPM had indeed given her the most \u201cadvantageous\u201d effective date (April 1994) and that she simply did not want to suffer the tax consequences, or pay back money into the annuity system, or else incur any of the other problems related to the 1998 effective date. <em>{See </em>J.A. 2 n. 1.) Accordingly, we conclude that Yahle failed to preserve this issue for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Having concluded that Yahle essentially accepted the June 1994 effective retirement date, we also conclude that the Board correctly affirmed OPM\u2019s decision not to use 1998 pay rates to calculate Yahle\u2019s annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">As stated earlier, an \u201cemployee\u201d must complete \u201cat least 18 months of civilian service\u201d to qualify for disability retirement annuity benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8451(a)(1)(A). By definition, an employee who ultimately qualifies for these annuity benefits \u2014 an \u201cannuitant\u201d \u2014 must have also become \u201ca' <em>former employee\u201d </em>in order to receive these benefits. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(2) (defining \u201cannuitant\u201d for purposes of the federal employees\u2019 retirement system) (emphasis added). In calculating that annuitant\u2019s annuity, OPM must also calculate that annuitant\u2019s \u201caverage pay.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8452(a)(1)(A)\u00ae and (ii). \u201cAverage pay\u201d refers to \u201cthe largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee\u2019s [i.e., active employee\u2019s] ... rates of basic pay in effect over 3 consecutive years of service.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(3) (emphasis added). If awarded, the disability annuity payments will begin \u201con the day after the employee separates or the day after pay ceases.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.301. In short, annuitants (like Yahle) have the amount of their annuity calculated by using the years of basic pay that they were earning when, indeed, they were still working as an active \u201cemployee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">And so, because Yahle effectively settled on June 1994 as her retirement date (the date on which she became an \u201cannuitant\u201d or \u201cformer employee\u201d) OPM did not err by using the rates of pay applicable to 1994 and earlier \u2014 the \u201caverage pay\u201d applicable at the time when Yahle was still technically an \u201cemployee.\u201d Thus, based on the effective 1994 retirement date, the Board correctly affirmed OPM\u2019s decision not to use 1998 pay rates to calculate Yahle\u2019s annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Next, the Board correctly upheld OPM\u2019s decision to exclude from its annuity calculation the pay increases that Yahle claims she should have received over the time she worked for DVA, <em>ie., </em>for the years in which, under the settlement agreement, the government had granted Yahle \u201cleave without pay\u201d status so as to make Yahle eligible for disability retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ment benefits. A pay increase in an employee\u2019s \u201cbasic pay\u201d \u2014 to which these within-grade pay increases would apply\u2014 would also ultimately raise the amount of the disability retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The relevant regulation states that, for purposes of determining credit for the time or \u201cwaiting period\u201d needed to qualify for a \u201cwithin-grade\u201d pay increase, \u201c[t]ime in a nonpay status\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>leave without pay status) counts as credit so long as it \u201cdoes not exceed an aggregate of two workweeks in the waiting period for an employee whose basic rate of pay is less than the rate of basic pay for step 4 of the applicable period.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 581.406(b)(2)\u00ae. In other words, an employee cannot credit time spent on nonpay status to the \u201cwaiting period\u201d needed to become eligible for a within-grade pay increase when, as here, that time exceeds two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Accordingly, because Yahle \u2014 by virtue of the settlement agreement \u2014 spent several months on LWOP (or nonpay) status, she could not receive credit for these months for purposes of awarding her \u201cwithin-grade\u201d pay increases. Thus, as the Board held, OPM did not err by excluding these within-grade pay increases from the calculation used to determine her annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In a two-sentence argument, Yahle asserts that the Board erred in this regard because 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.406(b)(3) does allow credit for time spent in nonpay status. But that regulation instead mandates that time spent in nonpay status actually <em>extends </em>the \u201cwaiting period\u201d needed to become eligible for a within-grade pay increase: \u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, time in a nonpay status ... that is in excess of the allowable amount <em>[e.g., </em>two \u201cworkweeks\u2019] shall extend a waiting period by the excess amount.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.406(b)(3). Paragraph (c), meanwhile, simply lists exceptions to this general rule. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 531.406(c)(1)\u00ae (creating exception to the rule about extending the \u201cwaiting period\u201d for employees who take nonpay status to engage in military service); \u00a7 531.406(c)(1)(h) (exception for employees receiving \u201cinjury compensation\u201d); \u00a7 531.406(c)(l)(iii) (exception for employees who take nonpay status to serve as a volunteer as defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8332(b)); \u00a7 531.406(c)(l)(iv) (exception for employee who \u201cis temporarily employed by another agency in a position covered by this subpart\u201d); \u00a7 531.406(c)(l)(v) (exception for employees \u201cassigned to a State or local government or institution of higher education\u201d). Yahle does not assert that any of these exceptions apply to her. Thus, we affirm the Board\u2019s ruling here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Finally, Yahle suggests that the Board should have remanded her case to OPM so that DVA could \u201cre-certify\u201d Yahle\u2019s retirement record and thereby have the $20,000 back pay award added to that record for purposes of calculating Yahle\u2019s annuity. Yahle cites no authority to support this suggestion. For at least two reasons, moreover, the Board had no obligation to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">First, the regulations instruct OPM to base its calculations of Yahle\u2019s annuity amount by examining only the certified record sent by Yahle\u2019s employing agency (the DVA). <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 841.106(b)(1) (stating that the \u201cindividual retirement record ... is the basic record for action on all claims for annuity or refund\u201d). The only exception does not apply here. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 841.106(b)(2) (allowing OPM to \u201caccept such inferior or secondary evidence that it considers appropriate under the circumstances\u201d when \u201cthe official records repository for the records in question certifies that the records are lost, destroyed, or incomplete\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Second, the annuity statute requires only that OPM include \u201cbasic pay\u201d in its annuity calculations. The annuity of a retiring employee consists of a certain percentage of that employee\u2019s \u201caverage pay.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8339(a). \u201cAverage pay\u201d consists of an annual average of the employee\u2019s \u201cbasic pay.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(4). And \u201cbasic pay\u201d does not include \u201cbonuses, allowances, overtime pay, military pay, pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation .... \u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8331(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Thus, because the $20,000 back pay at issue here came from a settlement agreement and therefore constitutes \u201cpay given in addition to the base pay\u201d of Yahle\u2019s position, OPM correctly excluded it from its calculation of Yahle\u2019s annuity. <em>See id.; see also Reed v. Office Pers. Mgmt., </em>837 F.2d 1097, 1987 WL 25756, at *1 (Fed.Cir. Dec. 17, 1987) (Table) (\u201cThe board correctly held that under the applicable statutes, an annuitant\u2019s retirement is calculated on the basis of an employee\u2019s basic pay. \u2018Basic pa/ ... does not include \u2018bonuses, allowances, overtime pay, military pay, [or] pay given in addition to the base pay of the position as fixed by law or regulation ... \u2019 Therefore, petitioner\u2019s back pay award was properly excluded in calculating her retirement annuity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">As a result, since OPM could not base its annuity calculations on anything more than the record certified by DVA, and since that certified record did not need to include the back pay award that Yahle received via her settlement agreement, we decline Yahle\u2019s invitation to have this matter remanded to the Board and, in turn, to OPM. We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
