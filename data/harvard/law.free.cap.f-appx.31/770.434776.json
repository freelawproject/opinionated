Telesca, Judge), entered on July 19, 2001, granting defendant-appellee Frank A. Aloi\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denying Schafler\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Schafler\u2019s complaint in its entirety with prejudice. In her complaint, Schafler set forth various claims sounding in libel, slander, invasion of privacy, racketeering, conspiracy, terrorism, fraud, perjury, harassment, filing false documents, malpractice, breach of professional responsibility duties, \u201csevere harm and economic loss\u201d (which the court liberally construed as a prima facie tort claim), negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court carefully addressed each of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">First, the court dismissed the libel, slander, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, harassment, conspiracy to libel, and conspiracy to slander claims on the basis of New York\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Second, the court determined that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for the terrorism, perjury, filing false documents, lack of candor before judicial tribunals, and remaining conspiracy-based claims. Third, the court determined that the plaintiff had failed to state a prima facie case for the legal malpractice, breach of professional responsibility duties, negligent infliction of emotional distress, \u201csevere harm and economic loss,\u201d fraud, and racketeering claims. We find no error in the court\u2019s thorough analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
