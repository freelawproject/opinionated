Kaplan, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b78-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of said District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">Vincent Giattino appeals from an order denying his motion, made under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, for vacation of his conviction. On November 24,1999, Giattino filed a Section 2255 motion dated April 16, 1997, in the Office of the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In an accompanying affidavit, Giattino explained that this motion was a photocopy of one he had mailed to the Clerk\u2019s office on April 14, 1997. He noted that in 1997 he was aware of a need to file his petition by April 23, 1997, under the new Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s one year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 116. Giattino also said that he was \u201cquite certain\u201d of the date of mailing because it was his birthday. Robert M. Barry, an inmate law clerk, submitted an affidavit in which he claimed that he observed Giattino placing the motion in a legal mailbox and that the two joked that the petition was Giattino\u2019s birthday present to himself. Giattino claimed that he was lulled into inaction during the months after his mailing by another inmate\u2019s assurance that the courts were overwhelmed with Section 2255 motions due to the new accelerated filing deadline. By January 1999, Giattino had become concerned enough to ask Barry whether the delay in his case was unusual. Barry\u2019s wife called the Clerk\u2019s office on Giattino\u2019s behalf and found that the Clerk had no record of ever receiving Giattino\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-17\">Giattino\u2019s motion is based on the alleged failure of the government to disclose a witness\u2019 prior cooperation with law enforcement and on ineffective assistance of counsel. In his affidavit, Giattino claimed that his attorney, James Froccaro, denied him the right to testify in his own defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Froccaro submitted an affidavit in which he stated that he \u201cdid not permit [Giattino] to testify at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The district court (Reena Raggi, <em>Judge) </em>appointed counsel for Giattino and scheduled a hearing to consider the timeliness of his petition and the merits of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Giattino, Froccaro, and the Assistant United States Attorney who prosecuted Giattino testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">At the close of the hearing, Judge Raggi denied Giattino\u2019s petition, finding that it was untimely and, in any case, lacked merit. She nevertheless granted a certificate of appealability on both timeliness and ineffective assistance of counsel. With respect to the timeliness issue, the judge found Giattino\u2019s testimony that he mailed the motion in mid-April 1997 to be incredible. She cited several factors supporting her conclusion including Giattino\u2019s initial assertion that he was certain he mailed the motion on April 14, 1997, which conflicted with the date of the motion; Giattino\u2019s failure to explain this discrepancy at the hearing; the general incoherence of Giattino\u2019s testimony; and the long delay between Giattino\u2019s learning that his motion had not been received by the court and his filing of an alleged copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">On appeal, Giattino argues that trial counsel was deficient in prohibiting Giattino from testifying in his own behalf and, citing <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), that his motion should have been deemed timely under the so-called \u201cprison mailbox rule.\u201d Giattino fails to confront directly or plausibly the district court\u2019s factual finding that he did not attempt to file his motion at any time \u201cup to early 1998,\u201d which, because Giattino had a direct appeal pending until November 1996 and was entitled to an additional period to file a certiorari petition, the district court found was the latest possible time during which he could have filed his motion. We may reverse this factual finding \u2014 and thus reach Giattino\u2019s arguments \u2014 only if it is clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>cf. Whaley v. Rodriguez, </em>840 F.2d 1046, 1050 (2d Cir.1988) (holding on appeal from a district court\u2019s grant of a habeas petition that this court may reject \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of basic historical fact, if they are clearly erroneous\u201d). The district court carefully considered Giattino\u2019s testimony and gave persuasive reasons for rejecting it. Therefore, there was no clear error in the court\u2019s finding that Giattino\u2019s motion was not timely, and we do not reach Giattino\u2019s arguments concerning the ineffectiveness of his counsel or the prison mailbox rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
