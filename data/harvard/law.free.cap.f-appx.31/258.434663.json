We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Whitaker\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-22\">In criminal cases, the defendant is accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v.
