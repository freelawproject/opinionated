We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Ahir does not dispute that he received notice of the hearing as required by law. However, he asserts that an exceptional circumstance prevented his attendance. We have considered his reason and we agree that on the facts of this case, it does not constitute an exceptional circumstance within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3), (f)(2), now replaced by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(i), (e)(1); <em>Shaar v. INS, </em>141 F.3d 953, 957 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547-48 (9th Cir.1996). The BIA did not abuse its discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Singh v.

In his opinion, exceptional circumstances exist here.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-37\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AJys\">. Ahir also argues that the BIA was not explicit enough when it rejected his motion to reopen. However, it was. <em>See Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir.1995); <em>Hassan </em>v. <em>INS, </em>927 F.2d 465, 467-68 (9th Cir. 1991); <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 909 (9th Cir. 1987). The issue was simple, and the reasoning sufficiently explicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
