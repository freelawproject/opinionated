We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-22\">Prior to the BIA\u2019s decision, Hernandez^ Pinon filed a motion for consideration of his brief after it had been rejected as untimely, supported by an affidavit of counsel and a postal receipt, indicating the brief was delivered to the BIA\u2019s post office address on the due date but after the BIA\u2019s courier had gathered the mail that day. Because the record does not indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>whether the BIA ruled on this motion, we remand to the BIA with instructions to rule on Hernandez-Pinon\u2019s \u201cMotion for Consideration of Late-Filed Brief.\u201d <em>See Escobar-Ramos v. INS, </em>927 F.2d 482, 485-86 (9th Cir.1991). If the BIA finds the brief was timely filed, it should consider on the merits the arguments contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b472-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
