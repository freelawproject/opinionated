The only issue in this appeal concerns the proper onset date for Hatfield\u2019s award of benefits. Under the applicable regulations, benefits are due from the date of the onset of disability or, where such date cannot be specifically determined based on the evidence of record, from the beginning of the month the miner filed his application for benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503(b). The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hatfield became totally disabled in October 1996 and, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>cordingly, found benefits awardable from that date. We review the Board\u2019s decision to determine whether it properly found that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law. <em>See Dehue Coal Co. v. Ballard, </em>65 F.3d 1189, 1193 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The ALJ based his onset determination on Dr. Ranavaya\u2019s finding of total disability in October 1996. We have held, however, that medical evidence of total disability does not establish the date of disability but rather that the claimant became disabled at some point prior to that date. <em>See Green v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>790 F.2d 1118, 1119 n. 4 (4th Cir.1986). The record in this case contains extensive evidence suggesting that Hatfield was disabled prior to October 1996, including a January 1995 medical opinion from Dr. Ranavaya finding disability, and no affirmative evidence of the absence of disability after Hatfield filed his application for benefits in October 1994. While the evidence does not pinpoint a specific date that Hatfield became disabled, it suggests disability at least as of the date of Hatfield\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Accordingly, we vacate the Board\u2019s affirmance of the ALJ\u2019s onset date finding, and remand with instructions, under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.503(b), to substitute an onset date of October 1, 1994, the first day of the month in which Hatfield applied for benefits. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
