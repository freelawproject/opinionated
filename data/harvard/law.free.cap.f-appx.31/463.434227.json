The IJ is required to advise an alien of relief for which he is apparently eligible at the time of the deportation proceeding. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 242.17(a)(1990). Lopez-Zamora was not apparently eligible for any relief at the time of the hearing, so the IJ acted appropriately. Lopez-Zamora\u2019s corollary contention that his attorney in the 1995 deportation proceedings provided inadequate counsel by failing to challenge the 1990 proceedings is similarly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-23\">Any error in the plea colloquy was merely technical, regardless of the standard applied. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>224 F.3d 1152 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>531 U.S. 1189, 121 S.Ct. 1185, 149 L.Ed.2d 102 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b533-36\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
