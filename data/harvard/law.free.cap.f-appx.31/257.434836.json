In that motion, White argued the interstate com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>merce requirement of \u00a7 922(g) could not be satisfied by simply possessing a firearm that had traveled in interstate commerce. However, because this theory has been rejected, <em>see Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808, 811 (4th Cir.1996), we find the district court properly denied White\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s conviction and sentence and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
