Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-22\">Plaintiff, the Louis Fink Realty Trust, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-23\">Consideration of the Trust Agreement did not require the district court to convert Defendant\u2019s motion into a motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff alleged the contents of the Trust Agreement in the complaint. The parties do not contest the Trust Agreement\u2019s validity or authenticity. <em>See Branch v. Tunnell, </em>14 F.3d 449, 453 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that consideration of documents whose authenticity is uncontested and whose contents are alleged in complaint does not convert motion to dismiss into motion for summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-24\">Plaintiffs claims are time-barred under Florida law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fla. Stat. \u00a7 733.710. In <em>May </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>v. Illinois National Insurance Co., </em>771 So.2d 1143, 1155 (Fla.2000), the Florida Supreme Court concluded that the applicable probate statute cannot be tolled by fraud. Two years from the date of death is the outside time limit to sue an estate. <em>Id. </em>at 1157. Plaintiff sued outside that time limit. None of the statutory exceptions applies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The third-party beneficiary claim is barred by California\u2019s \u201cone form of action\u201d rule. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 726. Assuming that Plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary of the Chase loan agreement, it can claim rights no greater than those of Chase. <em>Marina Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Deauville Marina Dev. Co., </em>181 Cal.App.3d 122, 226 Cal. Rptr. 321, 327 (1986). Chase\u2019s remedy would be limited to a foreclosure action. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs remedy is similarly constrained. Even assuming that the parties agreed <em>not </em>to foreclose, such an agreement is void. Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 2953.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Plaintiff leave to amend. <em>See Roth v. Garcia Marquez, </em>942 F.2d 617, 628-29 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that leave to amend is not necessary when any amendment would be futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b428-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-26\">. The district court applied Florida law to all claims except the third-party beneficiary claim. The court applied California law to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>that claim. The parties do not contest the court\u2019s choice-of-law decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b429-10\">. Originally there were claims against both the estate and the executrix. The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the executrix, and that ruling has not been appealed. Consequently, only claims against the assets of the estate remain, to which the two-year statute of repose applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
