We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-17\">Pierce\u2019s first contention is that the district court\u2019s determination of loss for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(P) violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 </em>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Reviewing de novo, <em>United States v. Martin, </em>278 F.3d 988, 1005 (9th Cir.2002), we conclude that this contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">Pierce\u2019s 63-month sentence does not exceed the 5-year statutory maximum for his multiple counts of conviction because the district court properly stacked his sentences. <em>See United States v. Scarano, </em>76 F.3d 1471, 1476 (9th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Where a defendant\u2019s actual sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum for the offense to which he pleaded guilty, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See United States v. Scheele, </em>231 F.3d 492, 497 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 488-89 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">Secondly, Pierce contends that the district court\u2019s calculation of loss was erroneous because it did not deduct the amount of money that was repaid to the victims. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Munoz, </em>233 F.3d 1117, 1125 (9th Cir.2000), and find none. It was proper for the district court to use the amount of loss that Pierce attempted to inflict, without offsetting it by the amount recovered by the victims. <em>Id. </em>at 1125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-25\">Pierce\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred by applying an upward adjustment for abuse of a position of trust pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3. Based upon our de novo review, <em>United States v. Medrano, </em>241 F.3d 740, 746 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 963, 121 S.Ct. 2622, 150 L.Ed.2d 775 (2001), we find this contention unpersuasive. Because Pierce abused a position of trust with his victims in order to facilitate commission of the fraud, the upward adjustment was appropriate. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>States v. Hill, </em>915 F.2d 502, 507 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
