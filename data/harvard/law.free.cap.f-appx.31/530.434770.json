Ruiz, a federal prisoner serving 168 months for controlled substance violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C) and 846, appeals pro se the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Ruiz contends the district court erred by denying, without an evidentiary hearing, his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate Ruiz\u2019s psychological condition and failing to move for a downward departure based on diminished capacity. We review de novo the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, as well as the determination that a prisoner was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Frazer v. United States, </em>18 F.3d 778, 781 (9th Cir.1994). We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>We find Ruiz\u2019s contentions unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Ruiz failed to explain what a psychological evaluation might show or how it would be useful for his defense. His contention that evidence that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder would have been relevant to a defense of insanity, entrapment, or to negate specific intent is belied by his own admission that he committed these offense because he had been seduced by a confidential informant. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that prisoner is entitled to evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion \u201c[ujnless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). Consequently, there is no need for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Ruiz\u2019s psychological condition was deficient, prejudicial and, consequently, ineffective. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (requiring petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel to show deficient performance that prejudiced the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">The district court also properly denied Ruiz\u2019s ineffective assistance claim without an evidentiary hearing as to the failure to move for downward departure. Even if Ruiz could prove his allegation that post-traumatic stress disorder rendered him more susceptible to committing this offense, such an allegation is not responsive to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5K2.13, cmt. n. 1 (permitting downward departure if defendant has a significantly impaired ability to understand wrongfulness of behavior comprising offense, or to exercise power of reason, or to control behavior that defendant knows is wrongful).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
