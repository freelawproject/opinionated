We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>181 F.3d 1129, 1134-35 (9th Cir.1999), and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of a particular case for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Leon-Reyes, </em>177 F.3d 816, 824 (9th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">Rowe contends that, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled in part by United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1181 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), he cannot be sentenced to a supervised release term of four years because the indictment did not allege a specific drug quantity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">In his plea agreement, Rowe expressly admitted possessing with intent to distribute between 100 and 400 kilograms of marijuana \u2014 an admission repeated during the plea colloquy. By pleading guilty and admitting the quantity of marijuana involved, Rowe waived his right to have a jury determine the amount of marijuana at issue. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>247 F.3d 1051, 1060 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-24\">Correspondingly, the sentence and supervised release term imposed by the district court is well within the maximum statutory term,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>sentencing was governed by either 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) or 21 U.S.C \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Barragan, </em>263 F.3d 919, 925 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b456-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-26\">. Rowe argues that if he were sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), then 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b) limits the term of supervised re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>lease to three years. Even if \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) applied in this case, which it clearly does not, given the quantity of marijuana admitted, we have previously held that the supervised release terms authorized by \u00a7 841 trump the m\u00e1ximums set forth in \u00a7 3583(b). <em>See United States v. Barragan, </em>263 F.3d 919, 925 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
