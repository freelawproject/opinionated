We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We review de novo the judgment of the district court affirming the judgment of the bankruptcy court. <em>Neilson v. Chang (In re First T.D. &amp; Inv., Inc.), </em>253 F.3d 520, 526 (9th Cir.2001). We review de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Kenneth argues that B &amp; B\u2019s acquiescence to treating the alleged discount on the promissory note as separate from the Playa Pacifica II, Ltd. (\u201cPlaya\u201d) bankruptcy estate bars B &amp; B from arguing that his claims in this action are res judicata by Playa\u2019s confirmed Chapter 11 reorganization plan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">The doctrine of acquiescence may bar a party from raising res judicata as a defense against a claim where the party assented to simultaneous prosecutions of a single claim or the splitting of one claim into two separately prosecuted claims. <em>Dodd v. Hood River County, </em>59 F.3d 852, 862 (9th Cir.1995). The case on which Kenneth relies, <em>Calderon Rosado v. General Electric Circuit Breakers, Inc., 805 </em>F.2d 1085 (1st Cir.1986), involves a claim dismissed in favor of <em>continued </em>prosecution of the same claim in a separate action. <em>See id. </em>at 1086. None <em>of </em>these situations is present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">Kenneth did not list the discount as an asset of his estate until after the Playa plan was confirmed. Acquiescence to splitting a claim or to its continued prosecution in another forum does not waive the defense of res judicata against a <em>subsequent </em>claim. The doctrine of acquiescence is inapplicable. <em>Clements v. Airport Auth., </em>69 F.3d 321, 328-29 (9th Cir.1995). Kenneth does not otherwise show that B &amp; B waived the res judicata defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">Kenneth challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that his claim for breach of contract is barred by the confirmed Playa plan. We reject his challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">A confirmed plan \u201cis binding on all parties[,] and all questions that could have been raised pertaining to [it] are entitled to res judicata effect.\u201d <em>Trulis v. Barton, </em>107 F.3d 685, 691 (9th Cir.1997) (citing 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(a)). Kenneth and B &amp; B were parties to both bankruptcy proceedings. If the alleged discount on the note should have been disclosed in the plan, claims founded on the discount are barred by the confirmed plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">Any contractual right Kenneth had to a prepayment discount should have been disclosed in the Playa plan. Playa was the note\u2019s guarantor. As Playa\u2019s creditor, Kenneth had to disclose all claims pertaining to the estate. <em>See Kelley v. S. Bay Bank (In re Kelley), </em>199 B.R. 698, 702 (9th Cir.BAP 1996). As Playa\u2019s general partner, Kenneth is bound by the confirmed plan\u2019s terms. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(a) (2000). \u201c \u2018[Creditors who do not wish to release third party debtors pursuant to the principal debtor\u2019s plan of reorganization should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>object to confirmation .... <em>[CJollateral attack [on the plan] is unavailable.\u2019 \u201d Trulis, </em>107 F.3d at 691 (emphasis added in original) (quoting 5 Collier on Bankruptcy 111141.01[1] (L. King ed., 15th ed.1995)). The alleged discount contract was not disclosed in the confirmed Playa plan. Kenneth\u2019s breach of contract claim based on the alleged discount contract is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Kenneth argues that he had a mistaken understanding of the confirmed plan\u2019s effect. Such an oversight does not change the res judicata effect of the confirmed plan upon his breach of contract claim. <em>Lea v. Republic Airlines, Inc., </em>903 F.2d 624, 634 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Kenneth argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment deprived his creditors of property without due process. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Kenneth\u2019s creditors had adequate notice and opportunity to participate in the Playa bankruptcy. Applying the preclusive effects of the confirmed Playa plan to Kenneth\u2019s personal bankruptcy does not violate due process. <em>Clements, </em>69 F.3d at 331-32; <em>California v. FCC, </em>905 F.2d 1217, 1245 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">We conclude that the bankruptcy court properly granted summary judgment on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Kenneth waived his fraud claim at oral argument.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He raises no arguments on appeal regarding his promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, or conversion claims. We deem them abandoned. <em>Paciulan v. George, </em>229 F.3d 1226, 1230 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1077, 121 S.Ct. 775, 148 L.Ed.2d 673 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-11\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
