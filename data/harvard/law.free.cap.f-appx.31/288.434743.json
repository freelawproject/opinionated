Davis\u2019 counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct as potential issues. Davis has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which she contends that she received ineffective assistance of counsel, that the district court erred in determining her sentence, and that the indictment under which she was convicted was tainted. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-22\">On appeal, Davis contends she received ineffective assistance of counsel, because her attorney failed to call a character witness at her sentencing hearing and failed to obtain a downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (1998) and Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are generally not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must ordinarily be pursued in a 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2000) motion. <em>United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). An exception to this general rule applies when the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>King, </em>119 F.3d at 295. A review of the record does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and Davis\u2019 ineffective assistance claims are therefore not cognizable in this direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Davis\u2019 counsel next suggests Davis was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct. Davis alleges no facts to support this contention. Moreover, we find no evidence of such misconduct in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Davis next contends that the district court erred in determining her sentence, and that her indictment was tainted. We find these claims barred by Davis\u2019 knowing and voluntary waiver of her appellate rights. <em>See United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Hall v. McKenzie, </em>575 F.2d 481 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Davis\u2019 conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
