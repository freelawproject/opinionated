We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Gomez-Montez argues that his plea hearing did not satisfy the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1) because the district court used the term \u201creentry,\u201d instead of \u201cfound in,\u201d to describe the nature of the crime charged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Gomez-Montez did not raise this objection below, it is his burden to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s omission constituted plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn,</em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1043,\u2014L.Ed.2d-(2002). He has failed to do so. In fact, the record plainly shows that Gomez-Montez\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. At the plea hearing, Gomez-Montez admitted that he \u201cwas found in Los Angeles County.\u201d He also acknowledged that he had read, reviewed and signed a plea agreement admitting that he was \u201cfound in\u201d the United States in violation of \u00a7 1326. We, therefore, conclude that the district court did not commit plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">Gomez-Montez also argues that his enhanced sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have, however, already considered and rejected that same argument. <em>See United States v. Ramos-Godinez, </em>273 F.3d 820, 825 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AcQ\">.
