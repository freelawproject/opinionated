We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-22\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s application of a two-level aggravating role enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) of the Sentencing Guidelines to Nava-Vargas\u2019 guidelines calculation. <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1172, 121 S.Ct. 1141, 148 L.Ed.2d 1004 (2001). In order to conclude that clear error has occurred, we must have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-23\">On appeal, as in the district court, Nava-Vargas does not contest the validity of the summaries of his offense conduct contained in both the plea agreement and the presentence report. Rather, he challenges the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that these facts are sufficient to prove that he was an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor,\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). Given these uncontested facts, however, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred by finding that the enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>applied. <em>See Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d at 1050-51 (concluding that merely a \u201csingle incident of persons acting under a defendant\u2019s direction is sufficient to support a two-level role enhancement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
