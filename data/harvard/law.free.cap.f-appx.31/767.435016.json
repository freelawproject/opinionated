The parties resolved their dispute in an arbitration proceeding, and the arbitration award was confirmed by a judgment of the district court. On appeal, Kosher Overseers Association of America, Inc (\u201cKOA\u201d) raises numerous arguments challenging the enforceability' of the arbitration award. It argues: 1) the district court erred in referring to the arbitrator as to whether Donel Corporation (\u201cDonel\u201d) could be substituted as a claimant in the arbitration proceedings for Rabbi Don Yoel Levy and Eliezer Levy (\u201cLevy brothers\u201d), doing business as Organized Kashruth Laboratories (\u201cOK Labs\u201d); 2) the arbitration agreement is voidable because of an allegedly false representation by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel that OK Labs and the Levy brothers owned the trademark at issue; 3) Donel was not a proper successor in interest to OK Labs and therefore has no right to sue for trademark infringement occurring before OK Labs\u2019 assignment of the mark; 4) the arbitrator exceeded its authority by awarding legal fees to Donel; and 5) OK Labs\u2019 counsel had no authority to enter into the arbitration agreement on behalf of the estate of Eliezer Levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">As to the first claim, we disagree with KOA\u2019s assertion that the district court wrongly referred the question whether Donel could be substituted as a claimant. We do not see how the district court\u2019s August 25, 2000 decision can be construed to refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the question, when the decision stated that OK Labs and the Levy brothers \u201chad no obligation to substitute Donel\u201d and that KOA \u201cwas not prejudiced in any way by the failure to substitute Donel as plaintiff, as the substantive rights sought to be enforced against defendant did not change.\u201d The district court stated further that the \u201ceffect, if any, of the substitution of Donel as claimant in the arbitration proceedings is best decided as part of those proceedings.\u201d Even if this statement is construed as referring the matter in the first instance to the arbitrator, such referral was not inappropriate when the district court subsequently reached the same conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Broad. Employees &amp; Technicians v. Am. Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>140 F.3d 459, 462-63 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We find no merit to KOA\u2019s claim that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because OK Labs falsely represented ownership of the trademark. The interests of OK Labs and Donel were identical for all practical business purposes, and KOA has not shown that it suffered any prejudice from the failure to substitute Donel as plaintiff prior to agreeing to arbitrate. We agree with the district court that \u201cthe transfer of rights to Donel did not change in any way the substantive rights sought to be enforced against KOA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">With regard to KOA\u2019s third and fourth claims, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion, as explained in its March 8, 2001 decision, that Donel was a proper successor in interest to OK Labs\u2019 trademark. Furthermore, the arbitrator\u2019s decision as to attorneys\u2019 fees was not in \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>See DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>121 F.3d 818, 821 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">We reject KOA\u2019s claim that OK Labs lacked the authority to enter into an arbitration agreement on behalf of Eliezer Levy\u2019s estate for substantially the reasons given by the district court in its August 25, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Finally, we have considered KOA\u2019s remaining arguments and, for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s decisions on March 20, November 17, and December 29, 2000, we find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
