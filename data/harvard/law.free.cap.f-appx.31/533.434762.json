She also seeks review of the Board\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen and its refusal to exercise its authority to reopen <em>sua sponte. </em>We deny the petitions in all respects.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-21\">Francisco argues that she was not afforded effective assistance of counsel. Therefore, she claims, she is entitled to a new hearing on her deportability. She fails, however, to explain to this court what evidence she would present on remand to support possible granted relief from deportation. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence supported the finding of the Immigration Judge that Francisco\u2019s explanation of her certificate of earlier marriage was incredible. Francisco now simply maintains, without specifics, that she might be able to demonstrate a valid claim if her case were remanded. <em>See id. </em>Absent any showing of evidence that Francisco is eligible for relief from deportation, we must presume that there is no such evidence and that, therefore, she has not been prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>We therefore affirm the Board\u2019s decision upholding Francisco\u2019s deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">Francisco also appeals the Board\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen, filed after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Francisco obtained new counsel. We review such denials for an abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). The Board\u2019s order rejecting Francisco\u2019s motion due to procedural defects informed her that she could refile within 15 days. She did not refile until 36 days later. The Board did not abuse its discretion by denying the late motion to reopen. In any event, as the Board noted, Francisco has shown no prejudice arising from the tardy filing because of her insufficient showing on the merits of her claims, which we have already discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Finally, Francisco attempts to appeal the Board\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte. </em>The Board has authority to reopen proceedings on its own motion in exceptional circumstances. <em>In re J-J-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 976, 984 (1997); <em>see also Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1183 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (recognizing holding in <em>In re J-J-). </em>We need not address the very considerable procedural hurdles to our review raised by the government, because Francisco presented neither a sufficient showing on the merits of her case to establish prejudice nor exceptional circumstances to trigger the Board\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
