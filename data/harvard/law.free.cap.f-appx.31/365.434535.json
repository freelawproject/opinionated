The district court held that Marquez-Centeno\u2019s two prior convictions under Arizona law for drug possession were \u201caggravated felonies\u201d warranting a 16-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2000). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusion that Marquez-Centeno\u2019s prior convictions are aggravated felonies triggering the enhancement. <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 907 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-21\">Because the sentences for MarquezCenteno\u2019s prior state convictions were governed by Arizona\u2019s Proposition 200, this case is controlled by our decision in <em>United States v. Robles-Rodriguez, </em>281 F.3d 900 (9th Cir.2002). For the reasons stated in <em>Robles-Rodriguez, </em>we hold that Marquez-Centeno\u2019s Arizona drug possession convictions are not \u201caggravated felonies\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the Sentencing Guidelines. We also hold that, under <em>Robles-Rodriguez, </em>Marquez-Centeno\u2019s prior convictions do not fall into the category of \u201cother felonies\u201d warranting a 4-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). We therefore vacate Marquez-Centeno\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Robles-Rodriguez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
