Cent. Intelligence Agency, </em>958 F.2d 26, 28 (2d Cir.1991)(per curiam). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for substantially the reasons stated below. The Court recognizes that in some cases, a pro se plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis may be entitled to an opportunity to amend the complaint before \u00a7 1915(e)(2) dismissal is ordered. <em>Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>171 F.3d 794, 796 (2d Cir.1999)(per curiam). In this case, however, the Court finds that, as the district court appears to have concluded, there was no possibility that an amended complaint would properly state a claim. <em>Id. </em>The Court, therefore, finds no error in the district court\u2019s failure to allow Cieszkowska the opportunity to amend before the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Finally, this Court denies Gray Line\u2019s sanctions request and orders the parties to bear their own costs. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 39(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-12\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Cieszkowska\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
