He contends that the district court erred in finding that he violated the terms of his supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release and impose a sentence after revocation. <em>United States v. Copley, </em>978 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir.1992). The district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000); <em>Copley, </em>978 F.2d at 831. We find that there was sufficient evidence for the district court to revoke Lacy\u2019s term of supervised release. We find no abuse of discretion, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
