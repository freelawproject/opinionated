Paul R. Michel, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b867-15\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b867-16\">SLOVITER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">As appellant Quintino Vasquez states in his brief: \u201cThe only issue raised in this appeal is the extent of the departure granted by the Court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3. Vasquez, who was charged in a five-count indictment, pled guilty to three counts: conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (count one); possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance within one thousand feet of a school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860 (count four); and carrying and aiding and abetting the carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (count five). Vasquez entered the guilty plea pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-22\">The Presentence Investigation Report found that the base offense level was 31 and the criminal history was O. Because there was a ten year mandatory on counts one and four, and a five year consecutive mandatory on count five, the range became 180 to 195 months. During the sentencing hearing, the government confirmed the assistance given by Vasquez, stating that he \u201cprovided some important additional details\u201d and that even the information that he provided that was untimely \u201cwas still helpful to the government.\u201d App. at 21-22. The government moved for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). The District Court granted the motion and departed downward 36 months in total, making the net sentence 144 months of incarceration followed by five years of supervised release. Vasquez filed a timely notice of appeal. He asks this court to review the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision to grant a three year departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-24\">Although this court may review sentencing errors based upon a mistake of law or incorrect application of the Guidelines, <em>United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138, 145 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Spiropoulos, </em>976 F.2d 155, 160 n. 2 (3d Cir. 1992)), we lack jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision to depart only three years. <em>See Torres, </em>251 F.3d at 143; <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>132 F.3d 897, 898 (3d Cir.1997) (holding that extent of district court\u2019s discretionary downward departure from applicable sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>fencing guidelines range, pursuant to government\u2019s motion for departure based on defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to government, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 was not subject to appellate review).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">First, appellant attacks the propriety of the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision to depart only three years from the guidelines. Pursuant to <em>Torres, </em>this court lacks jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>Torres, </em>251 F.3d at 143; <em>Khalil, </em>132 F.3d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Second, Vazquez appears to suggest that the District Court did not adequately analyze the evidence before it when considering the government\u2019s departure motion. In <em>Torres, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">[Wjhen presented with a motion for downward departure a sentencing judge must, at the very minimum, indicate his or her consideration of \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s five factors in determining whether and to what extent to grant a sentencing reduction. Further, a sentencing judge must indicate his or her consideration of any factors outside those listed in \u00a7 5K1.1. We strongly urge sentencing judges to make specific findings regarding each factor and articulate thoroughly whether and how they used any proffered evidence to reach their decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">251 F.3d at 147. This is to ensure that a sentencing judge \u201cis meeting his or her solemn duties in the most responsible way possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u201cseriousness of the crime\u201d and the \u201cimpact on the victim\u201d in determining the extent of a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1. is well within its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 148 (citing <em>United States v. Casiano, </em>113 F.3d 420, 431 (3d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">A district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors will be adequate if it balances the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense against his or her efforts to assist the government\u2019s investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 149. Although in <em>Torres </em>the government characterized Torres\u2019 assistance as \u201csubstantial and important,\u201d \u201cvital,\u201d \u201cdiligent! ] and aggressive,\u201d \u201cvery helpful,\u201d \u201cextraordinary,\u201d \u201cpro-active,\u201d \u201ctremendously significant,\u201d \u201cimmensely significant,\u201d and of \u201cenormous benefit,\u201d <em>Torres, </em>251 F.3d at 144, the district departed only one month from the guidelines. The district court in Torres explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-10\">We have heard what he has said. We have heard what his attorney has said with regard to this apparent rehabilitation of Mr. Torres. However, it remains that Mr. Torres, nevertheless, committed a serious crime in 1991 and for that he should be punished.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-11\">Now, the extent of punishment can readily be tempered by the grant, which I do, of the motion 5K1.1. But, I\u2019m not placing him on probation because what he did cannot just be forgotten or erased or made to disappear because of the subsequent cooperation with the Government, nevertheless, even though, according to the Government, it was fruitful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 149 (quoting district court transcript). This court concluded that the district court\u2019s consideration in <em>Torres </em>was adequate, even if minimally so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-13\">The District Court in Vasquez\u2019s case gave Vasquez equal, if not more, consideration than the court gave in <em>Torres. </em>The District Court heard evidence presented by the government that Vasquez:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">(1) \u201cwas prepared to provide collaborative testimony at the preliminary hearing and also at a trial\u201d regarding a murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-15\">(2) helped provide information regarding a criminal appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-16\">(3) provided help in a timely fashion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-17\">(4) \u201cwas a highly culpable person,\u201d who \u201cloaned a firearm!,]\u201d and who said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>he would \u201chit [a police officer] with a car, make it look like an accident\u201d instead of shooting him if he \u201cinterfered with the drug deal[;]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">(5) \u201cenlisted the aid of his live-in girlfriend,\u201d who took \u201cextraordinary steps to assist him[;]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">(6) \u201ccooperated peacefully about the arrest\u201d and \u201cnever attempted to go for the gun or assaulted anyone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">App. at 20-25. The District Court departed 36 months, based on the government\u2019s motion, and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-8\">Mr. Vasquez, I have given you three years off of the sentence that you faced ... I feel that is warranted under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">But, I also feel that you should be punished significantly for your criminal activity, and being actively involved and basically setting this up and organizing it to the degree that the guns and the cocaine were available for this transaction ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">App. at 31-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Though the District Court did not \u201cmake specific findings regarding each factor and articulate thoroughly whether and how [it] used any proffered evidence to reach [its] decision[,]\u201d <em>Torres, </em>251 F.3d at 147, the record does reveal that it balanced the seriousness of Vasquez\u2019s offense against his substantial efforts to assist the government. <em>Id. </em>at 149. Furthermore, the District Court considered the seriousness of Vasquez\u2019s crime when it took note of Vasquez\u2019s active involvement in and organization of the narcotics activity. Consideration of the \u201cseriousness of the crime\u201d in determining the extent of a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 is a consideration well within the District Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Torres, </em>251 F.3d at 148 (citing <em>United States v. Casiano, </em>113 F.3d 420, 431 (3d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">In summary, we lack jurisdiction to review the extent of the departure granted by the District Court. We reject Vasquez\u2019s contention that the District Court gave inadequate justification for its decision. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
