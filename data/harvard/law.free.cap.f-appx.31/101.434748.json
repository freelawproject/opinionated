We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and agree with the district court that Thomas failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Title VII. Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at the hearing on the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we find no reversible error and affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Thomas v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>No. CA-00-48-4 (WD.Va. June 18, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
