Chavez argues that there was a fatal variance between the indictment and proof because a single conspiracy was charged and multiple conspiracies were proven at trial. Chavez also challenges his 360 month sentence, arguing that the provisions under which he was sentenced, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B), are facially unconstitutional. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">Subsequent to the filing of briefs in this appeal, an en banc panel of this court decided that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B) are constitutional. <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1187 (9th Cir. 2002). Chavez\u2019 argument on this score must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-23\">As to Chavez\u2019 variance claim, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of a single conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. We therefore reject Chavez\u2019 variance argument. <em>United States v. Duran, </em>189 F.3d 1071, 1078 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">The jury found Chavez\u2019 co-conspirator not guilty on some charged offenses in a manner that Chavez characterizes as inconsistent with the conviction on the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>spiracy charge. However, it is well settled that even verdicts that acquit on predicate offenses do not undermine the jury\u2019s finding of guilt on the compound offense of conspiracy. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>469 U.S. 57, 64-5, 105 S.Ct. 471, 88 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984). Chavez\u2019 argument here must therefore fail as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b550-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
