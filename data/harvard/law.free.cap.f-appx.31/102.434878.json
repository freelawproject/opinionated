R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v.

Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Because Richards failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> The district court\u2019s order, which simply stated that Richards\u2019 reconsideration motion was denied, satisfied the \"separate document\" requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58. <em>See Quinn v. Haynes, </em>234 F.3d 837, 843 (4th Cir.2000) (stating that the time to appeal does not begin to run when a district court does not enter its judgment on a separate document); <em>Hughes v. Halifax County Sch. Bd., </em>823 F.2d 832, 835 (4th Cir.1987) (stating that a succinct order accompanied by no explanation is a \"separate document\u201d for Rule 58 purposes).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
