The district court also denied Michael\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">The district court found that there was substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s determination that, despite Michael\u2019s severe reading difficulties, he was ineligible to receive disability insurance and Supplemental Security income benefits because he did not \u201cmeet or equal a listed impairment.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). We review the administrative record as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, a burden of proof that we have defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance; it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">Our review of the record confirms that the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Michael\u2019s impairment did not fall within the scope of the relevant listing (Listing 12.05(c)) is supported by substantial evidence. To qualify under that listing, a claimant must demonstrate that his impairment imposes \u201can additional and significant work-related limitation of function,\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P., App. 1, such as an \u201ceffect on [his] ability to perform basic work activities [that is] more than slight or minimal.\u201d <em>Fanning v. Bowen, </em>827 F.2d 631, 633 (9th Cir.1987). Here, mental health care professionals employed by the State of California determined that Michael\u2019s reading difficulties did not impair various functions germane to manual work, including his ability to comprehend basic instructions, perform tasks in coordination with his co-workers, and fulfill scheduling requirements. Moreover, we note that on September, 29 1997 (more than a year after Michael applied for benefits), a psychologist employed by the California Department of Rehabilitation determined that Michael was capable of performing millwork despite his impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Consequently, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in the Commissioner\u2019s favor and denying Michael\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b628-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
