We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Paul Krofcheck (the \u201cminer\u201d) worked in underground mines for fifteen and one-half years. A blood gas study performed in 1973 yielded values too high to qualify him for a statutory presumption of pneumoconiosis, or \u201cblack lung\u201d disease. He filed a claim for miner\u2019s benefits on May 22, 1978. On August 23, 1978, he was admitted to the hospital with partial paralysis of his right side. Three days later he suffered congestive heart failure. A pulmonary function test administered on September 11, 1978, found results that qualified him for a statutory presumption of pneumoconiosis. At the time of this test the examining doctor concluded that he suffered from \u201cmoderately severe obstructive ventilatory pattern, with excellent response to bronchodilators. Compatible with reversible bronchospasm.\u201d He was released and readmitted several times during the next months, each time with diagnoses of congestive heart failure. He died on February 24, 1979, with the cause of death listed as \u201ccardiac arrest due to coronary occlusion with myocardial infarction due to arteriosclerotic heart disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">The procedural history of this action spans twenty-three years, and is well known to the parties. We will summarize it briefly. Ann Krofcheck, the miner\u2019s widow, filed a claim for survivor\u2019s benefits on March 11, 1979. The Department of Labor denied both survivor\u2019s benefits and miner\u2019s benefits after determining that the evidence did not show that the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis at the time of his death. After a series of hearings, remands, and requests for reconsideration, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied benefits once again on March 17, 2000, and the Board affirmed on May 22, 2001. Claimant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-18\">We review the Board\u2019s decision for errors of law and to determine if it adhered to its statutory scope of review. <em>Kertesz v. Crescent Hills Coal Co., </em>788 F.2d 158, 162 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>(3d Cir.1986). The ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by \u201csubstantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3) (2001), 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932(a) (2001). We must independently review the record to determine if substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>Lango v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>104 F.3d 573, 576 (3d Cir.1997). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted). It is not \u201ca large or significant amount of evidence, but rather \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">On March 2, 2001, the Board requested that the parties brief the question of whether 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.104(d) (2002) applies to the claim at issue. Revisions to this regulation require the adjudicator of a claim to \u201cgive consideration to the relationship between the miner and any treating physician whose report is admitted into the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The adjudicator may give controlling weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201cprovided that [the weight assigned] shall also be based on the credibility of the physician\u2019s opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation, other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board held that \u201c[t]he revisions to the regulation at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.104(d) apply to claims filed after January 19, 2001. Consequently, the provision requiring that special consideration be accorded to the report of a treating physician does not apply to the instant claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The Board did not err in its conclusion that the \u201ctreating physician rule\u201d of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.104(d) does not apply here. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.101(b) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-9\">The standards for the administration of clinical tests and examinations contained in this subpart shall apply to all evidence developed by any party after January 19, 2001 in connection with a claim governed by this part ... These standards shall also apply to claims governed by part 727 [Review of Pending and Denied Claims under the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977] ... but only for clinical tests or examinations conducted after January 19, 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">(emphasis added). Because \u00a7 718.101 applies the new standards its subpart sets out only to examinations conducted after January 19, 2001, \u00a7 718.104\u2019s treating physician rule does not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Claimant attempts to use \u00a7\u00a7 725.2(b) and (c) to justify applying the rule retroactively to her case. As she points out, these sections provide that \u201cthis part\u201d applies to claims pending on August 18, 1978 and to claims pending on January 19, 2001. However, it is clear from the context that the words \u201cthis part\u201d refer to the provisions of \u00a7 725, not to those of \u00a7 718. Claimant cannot use \u00a7 725\u2019s language to justify applying the treating physician rule of \u00a7 718.104.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Claimant next argues that the ALJ and Board erred in not invoking the interim presumption in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203 (1999) of death due to pneumoconiosis, established if one of four conditions is met and the miner has worked in a mine for ten years. These conditions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-13\">(1) A chest roentgenogram (X-ray), biopsy, or autopsy establishes the existence of pneumoconiosis ...; (2) Ventilatory studies establish the presence of a chronic respiratory or pulmonary disease ... as demonstrated by values which are equal to or less than the val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>ues specified in the following table; (3) Blood gas studies which demonstrate the presence of an impairment in the transfer of oxygen from the lung alveoli to the blood as indicated by values which are equal to or less than the values specified in the following table; (4) Other medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203 (1999). Claimant argues that \u00a7 727.203(2)\u2019s presumption is invoked because ventilatory studies establish that the miner had qualifying forced expiratory volume (FEV) values. Claimant also argues that pneumoconiosis is established under \u00a7 727.203(4), which invokes the presumption if \u201c[o]ther medical evidence, including the documented opinion of a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment, establishes the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The ALJ determined that the studies claimant relies upon were not valid and credible, and therefore did not invoke \u00a7 203(a)(2)\u2019s interim presumption. Specifically, he pointed to the lack of spirometric tracings and to the absence of a statement of the miner\u2019s understanding and cooperation that 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 410 requires. <em>Id. </em>Claimant argues that the tracings were destroyed in accordance with regular hospital procedure, and that Dr. C. Vaughn Strimlan\u2019s assurances that the miner\u2019s effort and cooperation were good should cure any deficiencies. She argues that the ALJ erred in holding that these tracings were mandatory. In fact the ALJ did not so hold, but rather evaluated Dr. Strimlan\u2019s assurances that the test results were valid and discounted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">There was substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. The ALJ faulted Dr. Strimlan for failing to consider the effect of the miner\u2019s stroke. He concluded that Dr. Strimlan\u2019s statement at the time of the test (that the miner suffered from \u201cmoderately severe obstructive ventilatory pattern, with excellent response to bronchodilators. Compatible with reversible bronchospasms\u201d), which is inconsistent with \u201cthe progressive and irreversible nature of pneumoconiosis,\u201d was more credible than the statements he made years later. The ALJ gave greater weight to the opinion of Dr. Leon Cander, who concluded that heart failure caused the pulmonary test results, citing the normal results obtained prior to the miner\u2019s heart failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">The record also provides substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision not to invoke \u00a7 203(a)(4)\u2019s interim presumption, thereby rejecting the opinions of Drs. Strimlan and Allan Freedman, who believed that the miner was disabled by pneumoconiosis, and that it in part caused his death. The ALJ cited the negative X-ray evidence and the fact that the pulmonary function test the doctors relied upon revealed results inconsistent with pneumoconiosis (\u201cexcellent response to bronehodilator\u201d). He noted that the miner\u2019s arterial blood gas results were normal thirty years after he left the mine, and only became abnormal following his stroke. Coupled with Dr. Cander\u2019s analysis, this was substantial evidence for not invoking the interim presumption under \u00a7 727.203(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Claimant argues that the ALJ erred in holding that even if an interim presumption under \u00a7 727.203(a) were invoked, it was rebutted. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20-21. We need not reach this issue because the ALJ relied upon substantial evidence to determine that no such presumption was invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">Finally, claimant contends that the ALJ erred in not performing a de novo review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>of the lay evidence under \u00a7 727.203(a)(5) and that the Board erred in holding this to be harmless error. Section 727.203(a)(5) provides that \u201c[i]n the case of a deceased miner where no medical evidence is available, the affidavit of the survivor of such miner or other persons with knowledge of the miner\u2019s physical condition, demonstrates the presence of a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.\u201d The ALJ stated that \u201cthis decision is based upon a complete and thorough de novo review of all of the lay and medical evidence.\u201d He \u201ccarefully reviewed and weighed the testimony of the miner\u2019s widow ... and [her] lengthy handwritten letter dated October 26, 1982.\u201d He concluded \u201calthough the lay evidence (as well as the medical' evidence) indicates that the miner was disabled by health problems (e.g., heart disease, stroke), it fails to establish total disability due to a respiratory or pulmonary condition.\u201d These statements indicate that the ALJ did perform a de novo review of the lay evidence; hence we need not decide whether his failure to do so constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
