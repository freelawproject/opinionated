We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in removal proceedings. <em>Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 777 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Fuadi contends that the IJ deprived him of a fair hearing by denying him counsel. The record, however, indicates that the IJ informed Fuadi of his right to counsel at his own expense, gave him a list of local attorneys and continued the hearings four times to allow him to secure an attorney. <em>See Acewicz v. INS, </em>984 F.2d 1056, 1062-63 (9th Cir.1993) (describing regulations governing right to counsel in immigration hearings). Furthermore, Fuadi has not made the required showing that counsel might have obtained a different result by a more skillful marshalling of the facts and arguments. <em>See id. </em>Fuadi\u2019s lack of counsel did not constitute a due process violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Fuadi also contends that the IJ did not allow him to fully explain his testimony. The BIA explicitly considered the information Fuadi contends the IJ failed to elicit. <em>See Elnager v. INS, </em>930 F.2d 784, 785 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
