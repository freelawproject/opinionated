(\u201cMaersk\u201d). The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d) of United States Magistrate Judge Joan M. Azrack.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Sang had been removed from his position as the Master of the MTV William B. Baugh, which was operating under a Charter Agreement between Maersk and the U.S. Navy, Military Sealift Command (\u201cMSC\u201d). On June 9, 1998, MSC sent a letter to Maersk instructing it to remove Sang from the position; Sang does not dispute the fact that MSC had the right to do so pursuant to both the Charter Agreement and the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) between AMO and Maersk or the fact that Maersk was obligated to remove him from the position. Sang concedes that his termination from his position on the Baugh is non-reviewable and non-grievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">On June 10, 1998, Maersk sent a letter to Sang terminating him from his position as Master of the M/V William B. Baugh <em>and </em>stating that \u201cit is in the best interests of all concerned that you no longer be associated with Maersk Line, Limited, or the MPS program.\u201d Essentially, Maersk decided that Sang would not be rehired to work on any of Maersk\u2019s other vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-18\">Sang requested that AMO commence a grievance proceeding on his behalf. Thomas Kelly, an AMO Vice President, reviewed Sang\u2019s submissions, the CBA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>and relevant documentation and informed Sang that the AMO would not pursue the grievance because it lacked merit. Sang appealed internally, but the AMO affirmed the decision not to pursue the grievance to arbitration, concluding that MSC exercised its non-reviewable right of approval for the Master position and that upon termination from that position, Sang had no contractual right to employment, retention or reemployment with Maersk.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Consequently, Sang brought this action claiming that AMO breached its duty of fair representation by not pursuing to arbitration a grievance on his behalf. It is well-established that \u201ca union breaches the duty of fair representation [only] when its conduct toward a member of the bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>Marquez v. Screen Actors Guild, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 33, 44, 119 S.Ct. 292, 142 L.Ed.2d 242 (1998) (citing <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 190, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967)). <em>See, e.g., Spellacy v. Airline Pilots Ass\u2019n-Int\u2019l, </em>156 F.3d 120 (2d Cir.1998) (same); <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l v. O\u2019Neill, </em>499 U.S. 65, 111 S.Ct. 1127, 113 L.Ed.2d 51 (1991) (same). For substantially the same reasons as set forth in the R <em>&amp; </em>R, which was adopted by the district court, we find that AMO\u2019s actions were reasonable and not \u201carbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. \u2022</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
