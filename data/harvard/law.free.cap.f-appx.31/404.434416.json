FLETCHER, T.G. NELSON, and TALLMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-19\"> The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b474-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">Mohamed Benbedi Gdaiem, a native and citizen of Tunisia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cConvention Against Torture\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. '\u00a7 1252. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-23\">Gdaiem does not dispute that he was convicted of a crime of domestic violence under California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5. Therefore, the IJ properly found that Gdaiem was removable on that basis. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Gdaiem failed to file his asylum application within one year of his entry into the United States. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-25\">The BIA\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture was supported by substantial evidence. Numerous inconsistencies between Gdaiem\u2019s oral testimony and his wife\u2019s testimony support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 394 (9th Cir.1997). Therefore, Gdaiem failed to demonstrate that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted or tortured were he to return. <em>See Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1159 (9th Cir.1999) (standard for withholding of deportation); <em>see Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001) (standard under Convention Against Torture).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-26\">We do not reach Gdaiem\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument because it was not presented to the BIA. <em>See Cortez-Acosta v. INS, </em>234 F.3d 476, 480 (9th Cir.2000) (failure to raise an argument before the BIA deprives this court of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b474-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
