In support of his claim, he presented the medical report of a neuro-psychologist who opined that Sinclair suffers from significant deficits in cognitive ability and information processing. However, the psychologist also opined that Sinclair was competent to plead when he did so and was competent to proceed with the resolution of his case, so long as special care was taken to make sure he understood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-20\">Because there were no abnormalities in Sinclair\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy such that the district court should have questioned Sinclair further as to his mental competency, and given the opinions in the expert\u2019s report as to Sinclair\u2019s competency, we find no error by the district court in failing to revisit the issue of Sinclair\u2019s competency at sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Sinclair\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-15\">. We note that both the district court and counsel took special care to fully explain to Sinclair the proceedings against him and the effect of his plea on his rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-16\">. Sinclair's reliance upon <em>United States v. Damon, </em>191 F.3d 561 (4th Cir.1999), is misplaced. In <em>Damon, </em>we remanded for further inquiry into Damon\u2019s competence because he, unlike Sinclair, testified at his plea colloquy that he was under the influence of anti-depressant medication, which in some circumstances is known to impair judgment. Here there were no circumstances present which required the district court to conduct a more searching inquiry into Sinclair's competence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
