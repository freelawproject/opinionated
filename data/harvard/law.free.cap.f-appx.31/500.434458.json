He received a sentence of 40 months imprisonment followed by 36 months of supervised release and a special assessment of $100.00. As part of his plea agreement, he waived his right to appeal. He now contends \u201cthat there was no discussion during the plea proceedings referring specifically to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>waiver of the appeal of his sentence. The court merely referred to the written plea agreement.\u201d The court, however, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">\u201cDo you understand that once the plea agreement is accepted or you were to accept the Judge\u2019s proposed modification, if one of those things happens, you lose your right to appeal the conviction, as well as any sentence that might be imposed?\u201d Flores-Mendoza answered \u2018Tes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Because the record clearly indicates that Flores-Mendoza understood the significance of the appellate waiver, and he presents no valid argument why it should not be given effect, his appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Counsel\u2019s request to withdraw from further representation of the appellant in this matter is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b570-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
