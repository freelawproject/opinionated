The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), and we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction, <em>see Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">We lack jurisdiction over Farshidian\u2019s petition because he was convicted of felony false imprisonment by violence for which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment and therefore is an aggravated felon pursuant to IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(e)(1) (the Convention does not expand the scope of judicial review under IIRIRA); <em>Briseno v. INS, </em>192 F.3d 1320, 1322-23 (9th Cir.1999) (no jurisdiction to review motions to reopen brought by aggravated felons). We also lack jurisdiction to review Farshidian\u2019s due process challenge. <em>See Calcano-Martinez v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 348, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001) (IIRIRA permanent rules); <em>Magana-Pizano v.
