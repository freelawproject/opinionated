(American), in his racial discrimination and retaliatory discharge action, filed after he was terminated for insubordination and threatening a coworker. Because the district court correctly granted summary judgment on both of his claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">Smith, an African American, worked as a fleet service crew chief for American at O\u2019Hare Airport in Chicago. In 1996 he was disciplined for failing to verify whether his crew had loaded a shipment of mail onto an outgoing flight. A written disciplinary notice was placed in his file after that incident. Several months later Smith apparently had an upsetting conversation with a \u201cSupervisor Sedlack\u201d (the record is unclear as to the details), and in September 1997 Smith wrote a letter to American, complaining that the company racially discriminated against African Americans and consisted of a \u201cgood old boys\u201d network. It appears that no formal action was taken with respect to Smith\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">On December 10, 1997, Smith was working his usual shift when a customer service manager, Mark Behrendsen, told him to load \u201cadvance\u201d bags onto a flight. Smith refused. After Behrendsen repeatedly directed him to comply, Smith eventually loaded the bags. Smith states that he then called American\u2019s human resources department to complain that Behrendsen was giving him unnecessary instructions that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Shortly thereafter, a different customer service manager, Dave Ellis, instructed Smith to follow Behrendsen\u2019s orders and load all \u201cadvance\u201d bags for the remainder of the day. Smith responded by using obscene language and calling Ellis, who is also African American, a \u201clying bastard,\u201d \u201ca coon,\u201d and an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d Smith then lunged at Behrendsen and backed him up against a wall. When Ellis asked Smith to hand over his employee identification and keys, Smith announced to Ellis and Behrendsen that \u201cif anybody is going to touch me, I\u2019m going to kill them.\u201d In response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>to American\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Smith admitted that he cursed at Ellis and that he threatened both Ellis and Behrendsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Five days later, on December 15, 1997, American terminated Smith for failing to follow its employee conduct rules. In its written notice of termination, American cited Smith\u2019s violation of Rule 7 (Insubordination) and Rule 32 (Threatening Employees). Smith challenged his termination through his union\u2019s grievance process, but an adjustment board found that American had \u201cjust cause\u201d to fire Smith due to his abusive and threatening behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In 1998 Smith filed a charge of racial discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC and was issued a right-to-sue letter. He then timely filed this complaint, alleging racial discrimination and retaliatory discrimination. The district court granted American\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Smith failed to establish a prima facie case on either of his claims. The district court also determined that even if Smith had presented a prima facie case on either claim, he did not demonstrate that American\u2019s reasons for terminating him were pretextual. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo and draw all inferences in favor of Smith. <em>See Logan v. Kautex Textron N. Am., </em>259 F.3d 635, 638 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On appeal Smith challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that he had not established a prima facie case of on either of his claims. Under the familiar <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>burden shifting analysis, however, even if Smith is correct that he did establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination and retaliation, American offered two legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons \u2014 insubordination and threatening a coworker \u2014 for his termination. Therefore, the burden shifted to Smith to prove that American\u2019s given reasons for terminating him are pretextual. <em>See Curry v. Menard, </em>270 F.3d 473, 477 (7th Cir.2001). But Smith offered no evidence to suggest that American did not honestly believe he committed the violations of company rules that it listed for his termination. <em>See Kulumani v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>224 F.3d 681, 685 (7th Cir.2000) (defining pretext as \u201ca dishonest explanation, a lie rather than an oddity or an error\u201d). Because Smith did not show that American\u2019s reasons for his termination were pretextual, the district court properly granted summary judgment on both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
