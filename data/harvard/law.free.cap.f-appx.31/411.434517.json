We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact. <em>See Lee v. Katz, </em>276 F.3d 550, 553 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusions that the officials\u2019 actions were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>deliberately indifferent and that the risks to Dudley were not so serious as to put the officials on notice, because these are mixed conclusions of law and fact. <em>See Church of Scientology v. Comm\u2019r, </em>823 F.2d 1310, 1320 (9th Cir.1987). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Judgment in favor of defendants was proper because Dudley did not show prison officials were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk to Dudley\u2019s health or safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b481-26\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
