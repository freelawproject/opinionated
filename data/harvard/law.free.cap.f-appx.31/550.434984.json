Nunez-Garcia\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that there are no issues to raise on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">As part of his plea agreement, Nunez-Garcia waived his right to appeal the judgment and sentence. He received a sentence consistent with the plea agreement, and there is no evidence that the waiver of the right to appeal was not knowing or was not voluntary. Therefore, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>States v.
