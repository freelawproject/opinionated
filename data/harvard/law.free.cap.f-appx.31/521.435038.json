We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-23\">Mendoza-Valencia contends that the waiver of appeal contained in his plea agreement is unenforceable because his conviction was the result of vindictive prosecution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-24\">Without deciding whether a claim based on vindictive prosecution renders an otherwise valid waiver of appeal unenforceable, we conclude that the waiver at issue here is enforceable because Mendoza-Valencia has not presented facts warranting the appearance of vindictiveness. <em>See United States v. Edmonds, </em>103 F.3d 822, 826 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that to prevail on a claim of vindictive prosecution, a defendant must show \u201c... facts that warrant an appearance of such.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-25\">Mendoza-Valencia\u2019s vindictiveness claim is based on the fact that the government charged him under \u00a7 1326 after he declined the initial offer to plead to a lesser offense under \u00a7 1325. \u201cHowever, ... vindictiveness will not be presumed simply from the fact that a more severe charge followed, or even resulted from, the defendant\u2019s exercise of a right.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Herrera, </em>273 F.3d 1213, 1217 (9th Cir.2001). Because, Mendoza-Valencia has failed to present facts warranting the appearance of vindictive prosecution, his written waiver of appeal is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-26\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b591-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
