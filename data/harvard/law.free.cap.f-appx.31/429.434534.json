See Fed.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Yerena contends that the district court committed a substantive error by referring to its cautious estimate of the amount of methamphetamine and corresponding reduction of offense level as a \u201cdownward departure.\u201d This contention lacks merit. Yerena has failed to articulate any negative effect that the court\u2019s mischaracterization had on his sentencing. Accordingly, the misstatement was harmless. <em>Cf. United States v. Mendoza, </em>121 F.3d 510, 513-14 (9th Cir.1997) (applying harmless error analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Yerena also contends that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to depart based on an over-representation of his criminal history. The record shows that the district court was aware that it had the authority to depart and exercised its discretion in choosing not to do so. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See United States v. Eyler, </em>67 F.3d 1386, 1390 n. 5 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Finally, Yerena contends that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward adjustment for his minor role. This contention also lacks merit. In denying Yerena a minor role adjustment, the district court adopted the findings of the presentence report which noted that it was Yerena who introduced the parties, thus making the transaction possible, and that Yerena was present while the deal was being made. As Yerena has presented no facts to refute the district court\u2019s findings, he has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to a minor role adjustment. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. background; <em>United States v. Benitez, </em>34 F.3d 1489, 1497 (9th Cir.1994) (providing that in order to be entitled to a minor role adjustment, a' defendant must be substantially less culpable than his co-participants). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of the adjustment was not clearly erroneous. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b500-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
