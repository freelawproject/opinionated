R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">Defendant Mike King seeks a certif\u00edcate of appealability to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Because he has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">King pled guilty to one count of distribution and possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) and \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), and was sentenced to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. It is uncontroverted that, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>King\u2019s offense involved crack cocaine, his sentence was significantly higher than it would have been if the offense involved cocaine powder or a non-crack form of cocaine base. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) &amp; Note D (1998); <em>United States v. Kissick, </em>69 F.3d 1048, 1052 (10th Cir.1995) (discussing the 1993 amendment to \u00a7 2Dl.l(e) that clarified the meaning of the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d). Following this court\u2019s affirmance of his sentence on direct appeal, <em>United States v. King, </em>No. 96-1040, 1996 WL 470321 (10th Cir. Aug.20, 1996), King filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. In support of his motion, King argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the enhanced sentence or to require the government to prove that the controlled substance involved in the offense was \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d The district court rejected King\u2019s motion, concluding \u201cthat the substance used in calculating defendant\u2019s base offense level was crack cocaine, that counsel was not ineffective for not arguing otherwise, and that defendant has not demonstrated the prejudice necessary to prevail\u201d on his ineffective assistance claim. App. at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">To obtain relief on his \u00a7 2255 motion on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, King must show a constitutionally deficient performance by his counsel and that prejudice resulted therefrom. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). King contends there was nothing in the record demonstrating that the substance for which he was sentenced was crack cocaine. Thus, King argues, his counsel \u201cknew or should have known that the failure of the government to meet its burden under the guideline definition of \u2018crack\u2019 warranted a guideline sentence for powder cocaine.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">After reviewing the record on appeal, we agree with the district court that King has failed to establish deficient performance or prejudice. During his change-of-plea hearing, King was asked by the district court to describe the conduct that formed the basis of his plea. King responded, under oath, that he \u201chad packages sent through mail to\u201d a friend\u2019s house, that he \u201cflew there the day before ... and ... received the package, signed for it, and on that day ... [was] arrested.\u201d App. at 53. When asked by the district court what the package contained, King responded, again under oath, that it contained \u201c506 grams\u201d of \u201c[c]rack cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. King\u2019s admissions thus \u201crelievefd] the government of any burden it had at sentencing to show that the drug involved was crack\u201d cocaine, and King\u2019s attorney was not ineffective for failing to put the government to its burden. <em>United States v. Gray, </em>182 F.3d 762, 768 (10th Cir.1999) (rejecting similar ineffective assistance claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">King\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
