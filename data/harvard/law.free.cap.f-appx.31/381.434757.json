R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">California state prisoner John Allen Du-chine appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition as untimely. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the dismissal of a habeas petition on statute of limitations grounds, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Duchine contends that the one-year statute of limitations under the AEDPA was tolled by the prison law library\u2019s failure to keep a copy of the AEDPA, or otherwise provide competent legal assistance regarding its statute of limitations, until August or October 1998. He argues that the district court erred by ruling that this was not a sufficient basis for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Since the district court\u2019s dismissal of Duehine\u2019s petition, we have held that an inadequate prison law library might constitute an \u201cimpediment\u201d under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), or, alternatively, justify equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations. <em>See Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam); <em>see also Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 et seq. (1996) (discussing constitutional right of access to the courts). In <em>Whalem/Hunt, </em>because the district court had not developed the factual record regarding the library issue, and because \u201cdeterminations of whether there was an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) and whether there are grounds for equitable tolling are highly fact-dependent,\u201d we remanded. <em>Whalem/Hunt, </em>233 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">Likewise, because the state was not directed to respond to Duchine\u2019s allegations and there was no evidentiary hearing, the record is inadequate to determine whether Duchine\u2019s petition is timely. It cannot be said that there are \u201cno circumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition and declaration under which he would be entitled to a finding of an \u2018impediment\u2019 under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B) or to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201cthe district court is in a better position to develop the facts and assess their legal significance in the first instance,\u201d <em>id., </em>we vacate and remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b452-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-19\">. Duchine\u2019s motions for judicial notice are denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
