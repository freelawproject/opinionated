Watkins appeals a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment that dismissed his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit. The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-18\">Seeking monetary damages, Watkins sued several defendants employed by the Tennessee Department of Corrections. He claimed that, in 1993, he served twenty-two days of incarceration that he should not have served because the defendants mistakenly interpreted a judgment to provide for a consecutive sentence when it was actually to be served concurrently with his other sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-19\">The magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Over Watkins\u2019s objections, the district court granted summary judgment and dismissed Watkins\u2019s suit as barred by the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because an award of damages in his favor would imply the invalidity of his confinement and because Watkins had not challenged the sentence through available appeals or habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-20\">In his timely appeal, Watkins argues that the district court erred by dismissing his suit. Both parties have filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-21\">Upon de novo review, we conclude that summary judgment for the defendants was proper. Watkins\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit is not cognizable in the light of <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner cannot make a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for an alleged unconstitutional conviction or for \u201charm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid\u201d unless a prisoner shows that the conviction or sentence has been invalidated. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Furthermore, the claim is not cognizable and must be dismissed whether the plaintiff seeks to obtain monetary damages or to attack the validity of his confinement. <em>Id.; see also Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 488-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973) (stating that habeas corpus proceeding, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00a7 1983, is appropriate remedy for a state prisoner to attack the validity or length of his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Because Watkins\u2019s claims necessarily attack the legality of his confinement, his civil rights action is barred by the holding in <em>Heck. See Shamaeizadeh v. Cunigan, </em>182 F.3d 391, 396 (6th Cir.1999). It is noted that Watkins\u2019s claims are not viable, even though he may not now be able to seek habeas relief because he no longer satisfies the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Huey v. Stine, </em>230 F.3d 226, 230 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34{j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
