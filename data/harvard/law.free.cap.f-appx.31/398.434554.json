We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of Nino\u2019s habeas petition, <em>see Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Nino contends that his constitutional rights were violated when, at the time he pleaded guilty, he was not advised that he was subject to a mandatory parole term upon completion of his period of imprisonment. His contention is unpersuasive. Because Nino was advised that the maximum possible period of confinement was life, the sentencing court\u2019s failure to advise him of the potential for a lower period of confinement was neither contrary to nor involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1149 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Carter v. McCarthy, </em>806 F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir.1986) (acknowledging that guilty plea is voluntary and intelligent if entered by one fully aware of direct consequences of plea) (interpreting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
