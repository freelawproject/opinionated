This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-29\">In 1997, a jury convicted Pirtle of aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and two counts of felonious assault. The court sentenced him to a total of twelve years of incarceration. The Ohio Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>affirmed the convictions and sentences in December 1998, the Ohio Supreme Court denied review in May 1999, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in October 1999. Pirtle filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in March 2000, raising one claim: \u201cMr. Pirtle\u2019s conviction was obtained in violation of his federal constitutional right to equal protection of the law because the trial court allowed the State to exercise a peremptory challenge to remove a black juror for a reason that was not race neutral.\u201d The state filed a return of the writ with exhibits from the state court record and Pirtle filed a traverse. The magistrate judge recommended denying the petition on the merits. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation over Pirtle\u2019s objections and denied the petition. The court granted a certificate of appealability on Pirtle\u2019s only claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In his timely appeal, Pirtle argues that he was denied a fair and impartial trial due to race discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in habeas corpus actions and reviews its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lucas v. O\u2019Dea, </em>179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir.1999). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a district court shall not grant a habeas petition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state courts unless the adjudication resulted in a decision that: (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The habeas petitioner has the burden of rebutting, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption that the state court\u2019s factual findings were correct. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Warren v. Smith, </em>161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly denied Pirtle\u2019s petition. Pirtle, who is black, claimed that his conviction violated his right to equal protection because the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge to remove the only black juror from the jury panel. The prosecutor explained that he struck the juror because he detected a high degree of resentment of police on the juror\u2019s part. The trial court accepted the state\u2019s reason and excused the juror. Relying on <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision. The court found that the record supported the trial court\u2019s determination that the prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for challenging the black juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Pirtle did not rebut, by clear and convincing evidence, the presumption that the state court\u2019s factual findings were correct, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Warren, </em>161 F.3d at 360-61, nor were the state courts\u2019 decisions unreasonable applications of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495. First, it is undisputed that Pirtle is a member of a racial group, that the prosecution removed a member of this racial group, and that circumstances raised an inference that the challenge was motivated by race. <em>See Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96-97, 106 S.Ct. 1712.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Second, the prosecution\u2019s race-neutral explanation was facially valid. <em>See Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-69, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). Peremptory strikes based on a juror\u2019s perceived hostility to law enforcement are permissible. <em>See, e.g., Caldwell v. Maloney, </em>159 F.3d 639, 653 (1st Cir.1998); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>United States v. Gibson, </em>105 F.3d 1229, 1232 (8th Cir.1997). Moreover, the fact that a juror\u2019s hostility to police is based on race does not mean that a decision to strike such a juror is based on race. <em>Tolbert v. Gomez, </em>190 F.3d 985, 989 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>111 F.3d 509, 512 (7th Cir.1997). The prosecutor\u2019s explanation for striking the juror was not inherently discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Finally, the district court properly deferred to the state court\u2019s conclusion that Pirtle did not establish purposeful discrimination. <em>See Purkett, </em>514 U.S. at 767-69, 115 S.Ct. 1769. Pirtle\u2019s trial counsel objected to the prosecution\u2019s strike because the venire would be all white, but did not point to any other indication that the prosecutor\u2019s decision was based on race. The prosecutor came forward with a facially valid race-neutral explanation, and the state court\u2019s assessment of the prosecutor\u2019s credibility is entitled to deference. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 364-65, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991). Accordingly, Pirtle has not established that he was denied equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Pirtle\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
