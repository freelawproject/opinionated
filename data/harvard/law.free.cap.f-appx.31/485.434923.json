Appellants have now acknowledged that the injunctive relief they sought is no longer necessary because Cheyenne is now attending school. Thus this claim is moot and the appeal on this issue should be dismissed. The primary question on appeal is whether the district court\u2019s decision should be vacated in order to allow plaintiffs to seek attorney\u2019s fees. As to the damages claim, we agree with the district court that plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>ingly, plaintiffs were not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Appeal DISMISSED as moot as to the claim for injunctive relief; AFFIRMED, in all other respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-25\"> This disposition, is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
