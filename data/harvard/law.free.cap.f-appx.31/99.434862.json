We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment and construes the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Scheduled Airlines Traffic Offices, Inc. v. Objective, Inc., </em>180 F.3d 583, 590-91 (4th Cir. 1999). Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Once the moving party discharges its burden by showing there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case, <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). Summary judgment will be granted unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party on the evidence presented. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">Terrill asserts that participation in his employer\u2019s \u201cDiversity Day\u201d as a cultural exhibitor was a benefit of his employment that he was denied due to his national origin as a \u201cConfederate American.\u201d We agree with the district court that Terrill failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-15\">In order to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, Terrill must show that: (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) at the time of the adverse action he was performing to his employer\u2019s expectations; and (4) other similarly situated employees who are not members of the protected class did not suffer the same adverse action. <em>Brinkley v. Harbour Recreation Club, </em>180 F.3d 598, 607 (4th Cir.1999). Terrill fails to establish that he is either a member of a protected class or that he suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order based on its reasoning as stated from the bench at its summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>judgment hearing. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
