We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Brown first contends that the district court incorrectly calculated his criminal history category. We decline to address this contention, because we find that Brown waived the specific objections he now raises on appeal. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>63 F.3d 1478, 1500 (9th Cir.1995) (en banc) (declining to address government\u2019s cross-appeal of defendants\u2019 sentences, because \u201cA challenge to an adjustment of an offense level must be raised <em>specifically </em>at sentencing in order to afford the district court an opportunity to correct any potential error. A challenge that is not properly raised in the district court is waived.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">To the extent Brown has not waived this objection, it lacks merit because the Sentencing Guidelines range would remain unaffected. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>109 F.3d 1413, 1422-23 (9th Cir.1997) (finding harmless any alleged error, where resulting sentence would remain the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Brown also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 841(a) in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, 1175 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (upholding facial constitutionality of \u00a7 841), and is further undermined by Brown\u2019s own admission in his guilty plea and at the plea hearing as to the amount and type of controlled substance at issue herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\">. We find no waiver of appellate rights here, because Brown reasonably could have believed from the district court\u2019s statements made during the plea hearing that he retained his right to file this appeal. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Buchanan, </em>59 F.3d 914, 917 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that district court\u2019s unambiguous oral pronouncement of sentence controls to the extent that it directly conflicts with written judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
