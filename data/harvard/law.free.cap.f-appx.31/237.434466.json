On appeal, DeTemple claims that the district court erred in: (1) denying his motions for recusal; (2) failing to grant him bond pending the disposition of his \u00a7 2255 action; and (3) the denial of his motion to stay the collection of his special assessment. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-24\">As to the district court\u2019s denial of DeTemple\u2019s motion for recusal, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the order is not appealable. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (1994); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The order here appealed is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-25\">Next, DeTemple appeals the district court order denying his request for release on bond pending the disposition of his \u00a7 2255 action. A denial of bond is an appealable collateral order. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>835 F.2d 1048, 1049-50 (3d Cir.1987); <em>Cherek v. United States, </em>767 F.2d 335, 337 (7th Cir.1985). A person seeking interim release during pursuit of \u00a7 2255 relief, however, faces a formidable barrier created by the fact of conviction and the government\u2019s interest in executing its judgment. \u201c[I]n the absence of exceptional circumstances ... the court will not grant bail prior to the ultimate final decision unless [the applicant] presents not merely a clear case on the law, ... but a clear, and readily evident, ease on the facts.\u201d <em>Glynn v. Donnelly, </em>470 F.2d 95, 98 (1st Cir.1972) (citation omitted); <em>see also Martin v. Solem, </em>801 F.2d 324, 329 (8th Cir.1986). Having reviewed the record, we find DeTemple has failed to meet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>burden. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying DeTemple\u2019s request for release on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Finally, DeTemple appeals the denial of his motion to stay the collection of his special assessment. Specifically, DeTemple challenges the methods and amounts employed by the Bureau of Prisons to collect the special assessment. This court has held in <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 78 (4th Cir.1996), that a district court may not delegate its authority to set the amount and timing of fine payments to the Bureau of Prisons. Because the district court instructed DeTemple to pay the special assessment amount immediately, and further set a schedule of monthly payments of at least $50 per month, the district court satisfied the requirements of <em>Miller. </em>We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying DeTemple\u2019s motion to stay collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, we dismiss DeTemple\u2019s appeal as to the motions for recusal and affirm the district court as to DeTemple\u2019s motion for bond and motion to stay collection. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
