We cannot accept Appellant\u2019s argument that he did not receive a proper opportunity to make a complete record in this case. We reject his contention that the Communications Workers of America breached its duty of fair representation to him regarding the security report. The District Court did not err when it upheld the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, after in camera review, that Bell Atlantic NJ, Inc. need not disclose its security report to Douglas Sinopoli.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">We agree with the District Court that the matters at issue in Sinopoli\u2019s complaint do not relate to any violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). An FMLA violation occurs when a person exercises a right protected under the Act, and, as a result, the employer discharges or otherwise discriminates against that person. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">We hold that the District Court properly dismissed Sinopoli\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s arguments and find no ground to reverse. The Order of the District Court on August 14, 2000 is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
