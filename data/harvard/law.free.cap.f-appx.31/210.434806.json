This long process involving alternative excuses, changed positions, inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and outright refusals, which are well documented by both the magistrate judge and the district judge, prompted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>district court to dismiss the action and award Polymer Group and Bonlam S.A. attorneys fees of $42,722.18 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 87. PVD appealed the district court\u2019s decision, arguing principally that the sanctions were too severe and that lesser sanctions would have been adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The district court found that PVD\u2019s bad faith, even after receiving clear warnings about its conduct, caused the defendants prejudice. The court expressly explored less severe sanctions but concluded that the sanctions already imposed by the magistrate judge had been \u201cineffective.\u201d As the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">These lesser sanctions did nothing to motivate compliance by PVD. Even clear warnings of dismissal and the motion for sanctions have not motivated PVD to bring itself into compliance. Therefore, this court is convinced that any lesser sanction would fail to cure PVD\u2019s determined obdurateness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">We have carefully reviewed the record and considered PVD\u2019s arguments. For the reasons ably and fully given by the district court in ordering dismissal and attorneys fees, <em>see PVD Plast Mould Industries, Ltd. v. Polymer Group, Inc., et al., </em>C.A. No. 2:98-2929-23 (D.S.C. February 1, 2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
