We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court examines the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution,\u201d determining whether \u201cany trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>United States v. Orozco-Santillan, </em>903 F.2d 1262 (9th Cir.1990). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recite them except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Gothard first argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of \u201cthreat.\u201d A statement is a \u201cthreat\u201d if a \u201creasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265-66. The only intent requirement is that the speaker knowingly <em>communicates </em>his threat; he need not have the ability or intent to <em>carry out </em>the threat. <em>Id. </em>at 1266 n. 3. Here, the jury reasonably could have interpreted Gothard\u2019s letter to Judge Suko, instructing him to \u201cwrite his \u2018last will and testament\u2019 because he will die,\u201d as a serious expression of intent to harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">Next, Gothard argues that the government did not sufficiently establish that Judge Suko was a federal judge or that Gothard intended to threaten someone in that position. Judge Suko\u2019s status as a federal judge was established by Judge Suko\u2019s own testimony. This evidence is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Judge Suko is a federal judge and that Gothard wrote to him in that capacity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bellucci, </em>995 F.2d 157, 159 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>****</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"Abv\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"Aok\"> jjjg panej accepts the documents Mr. Gothard presented to the Court at the time of argument for filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
