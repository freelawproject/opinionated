Almost three months later, days before sentencing, Sofsky indicated to the district court for the first time that he wished to withdraw his plea. He made a formal motion pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e), attempting to resurrect a defense that he had intended to raise at trial \u2014 that he was innocent because his brother, Steven Sofsky, had committed the crime, and claiming that he entered into the plea as the result of \u201coverwhelming pressure.\u201d The district court denied the motion in an oral ruling, finding an evidentiary hearing unnecessary because the allegations in the affidavits submitted by Sofsky to support his motion \u201cmerely contradicted\u201d the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court explained in detail on the record that the evidence presented by the government overwhelmingly refuted Sofsky\u2019s claim of innocence, his brother\u2019s claim of sole responsibility and guilt, and Sofsky\u2019s alleged bases for \u201coverwhelming pressure.\u201d Consequently, the court concluded that Sofsky failed to satisfy his burden of showing a fair and just reason for withdrawing the plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that the district court acted well within its discretion in denying Sofsky\u2019s motion We note that, although Sofsky\u2019s brother has submitted a statement admitting his role in the offense, he has not indicated a willingness to plead guilty to the offense for which Sofsky stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. We address in a published opinion filed today Sofsky\u2019s claim that the district court erred in imposing a condition of supervised release that prohibited Sofsky from accessing a computer, the Internet or bulletin board systems, unless approved by a probation officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">. \u201cA defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right whenever he seeks to withdraw his guilty plea.....No hearing need be granted when the allegations on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing merely contradict the record, are inherently incredible, or are simply conclusory.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b825-9\">. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(e) states that a \"court may permit [a] plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.\u201d However, \"[a] defendant has no absolute right to withdraw his plea of guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>23 F.3d 629, 634 (2d Cir.1994). Instead, the defendant bears the burden of showing that relief should be granted. <em>See United States v. Maher, </em>108 F.3d 1513, 1530 (2d Cir.l997)(\"burden of a defendant who has been convicted after pleading guilty, and who contends thereafter that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea because he is innocent, is plainly no less heavy\u201d than \"a defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction after a jury verdict\u201d). If the defendant sets forth sufficient grounds to withdraw the plea, a court should consider the potential prejudice to the government. <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>129 F.3d 710, 715 (2d Cir. 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
