The government appeals the district court\u2019s decision not to treat Diaz\u2019s prior state court conviction for criminal aggravated sexual abuse as an aggravated felony. We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-22\">Diaz was sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. As it read at the time of Diaz\u2019s illegal reentry, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) imposed a sixteen-level enhancement if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2000). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) applies the definition of ag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>gravated felony found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 U01(a)(43), which includes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in the definition. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt., n. 1 (2000). Hence, the task for the district court was to determine whether Diaz\u2019s Illinois conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault qualifies as \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Diaz concedes that the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), governs this determination. <em>See United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>247 F.3d 905, 907-08 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Instead of applying it, however, the district court looked behind the facts of the underlying felony, which <em>Taylor </em>precludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Applying the categorical approach, Diaz\u2019s prior conviction clearly constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d 111. Comp. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 5/12 \u2014 16(d) and 5/12-17(b), is virtually identical to the federal statute criminalizing sexual abuse of a minor, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, and the phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d includes all of the conduct prohibited by the Illinois statute. <em>See also United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1167, 121 S.Ct. 1130, 148 L.Ed.2d 996 (2001). Therefore, Diaz\u2019s prior conviction is an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes. He must be resentenced on remand accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
