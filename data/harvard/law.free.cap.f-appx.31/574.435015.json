We have jurisdiction to review a final order of the BIA pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 llOhala),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s determination that Larin-Bonilla did not demonstrate a prima facie case for asylum based upon the August 2000 murder of his father in El Salvador. <em>See Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279, 1281 (9th Cir.1998). Because Larin-Bonilla failed to demonstrate the murder was politically motivated, <em>see Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1490 (9th Cir.1997), the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Larin-Bonilla did not establish a prima facie case of a well-founded fear of future persecution, <em>cf. Mendez-Efrain v. INS, </em>813 F.2d 279, 282 (9th Cir.1987) (absent \u201cspecific evidence,\u201d alien\u2019s \u201cbelief\u2019 that he would be subject to persecution upon return to El Salvador was insufficient to sustain burden of proving a well-founded fear of future persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review the decision denying Larin-Bonilla\u2019s initial application for asylum and withholding of deportation because he did not timely file a petition for review of that decision. <em>Cf. Chudshevid v. INS, </em>641 F.2d 780, 784 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-12\">. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, deportation proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997, for which a final order of deportation is issued after October 30, 1996, are subject to the transitional rules. <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). Because deportation proceedings were initiated against Larin-Bonilla on March 6, 1993, and a final order of deportation was issued on February 2, 2001, the transitional rules apply to his case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
