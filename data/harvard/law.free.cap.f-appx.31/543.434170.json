We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Stephenson contends that the district court erred by finding that it did not have authority to depart on the basis he requested. A review of the record reveals that the district court made no such finding, but rather merely indicated that it would continue Stephenson\u2019s sentencing hearing in order to provide both Stephenson and the government adequate notice of and an opportunity to respond to the sentencing issues each party had raised on the day of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">To the extent that Stephenson has not waived appellate review of the district court\u2019s decision by withdrawing his departure request and agreeing to proceed immediately with the sentencing hearing without the district court considering either party\u2019s last-minute suggestion, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See United States v. Zamora-Hernandez, </em>222 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1200, 121 S.Ct. 1208, 149 L.Ed.2d 122 (2001) (reviewing the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a continuance for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v.
