Eaton, granting defendants-appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Stroud\u2019s complaint in its entirety with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">Based on our review of the record, we find that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants. We find no error in the R &amp; R and therefore affirm for substantially the same reasons stated therein. In her appellate brief, Stroud argues for the first time that Magistrate Judge Eaton should have recused himself from the case because of his prior employment with the New York City Corporation Counsel. Without more than a conclusory assertion of bias, we decline to address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
