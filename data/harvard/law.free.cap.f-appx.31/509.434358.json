We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 llOSaia).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-23\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Rodriguez-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number><em>Roman v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 416, 425 n. 11 (9th Cir.1996). We review for substantial evidence the factual findings underlying the BIA\u2019s determination that a petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum, and will reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only if the record compels a contrary result. <em>Sangha v. INS </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Because Melendez-Corvera failed to establish that guerrillas persecuted him on account of political opinion, <em>see id. </em>at 1489-90, and failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion, <em>see Ramos-Vasquez v. INS, </em>57 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201c[M]ere apprehension is not enough to establish a well-founded fear entitling an alien to asylum .... \u201d), substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Melendez-Corvera was not eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Because Melendez-Corvera failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily did not meet the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Kazlauskas v. INS, </em>46 F.3d 902, 907 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
