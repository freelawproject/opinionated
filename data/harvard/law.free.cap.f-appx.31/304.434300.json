On appeal, he originally contended that a portion of his trial should have been severed from that of a co-defendant, that he was denied a speedy trial, and that the sentence imposed upon him violated legal principles enunciated in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded that he had waived the severance issue by failing to renew his motion to sever at the end of all the proof and that the facts of the case failed to make out a violation of the Speedy Trial Act. In addition, he effectively conceded that the government did not try him in contravention of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, indicating that the only period of delay to which he objected was the six-month period between the initial indictment and the superceding indictment. This delay, he argued, was presumptively prejudicial. However, he was unable to cite legal authority to support this argument, and we have found none. We therefore conclude that there is no basis for overturning the convictions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">On the other hand, the government concedes error in Hawkins\u2019s sentencing order, which was entered shortly before the <em>Apprendi </em>decision was announced. Without the benefit of that decision, the district court evaluated the evidence presented at trial and the facts offered by the probation office in Hawkins\u2019s presentence report and concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was responsible for between five and 15 kilograms of cocaine. Consequently, even though the applicable guidelines range for the offense was only 168-210 months, the court cited the mandatory minimum sentence provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and, because the defendant had previously been convicted of another felony drug offense, ordered Hawkins to serve 20 years (240 months) in prison. This order fails to comply with <em>Apprendi </em>and with our subsequent opinion in <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>For this reason, we AFFIRM that portion of the district court\u2019s order relating to the defendant\u2019s convictions but REVERSE as to the sentencing order and REMAND the case for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
