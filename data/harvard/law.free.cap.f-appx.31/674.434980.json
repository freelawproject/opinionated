The Merit Systems Protection Board does not oppose. Frank Santella and Joseph Jech oppose.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-23\">The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) filed a complaint against Santella and Jech, each an Internal Revenue Service supervisor, charging retaliation in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(8). The Board\u2019s Chief Administrative Law Judge (CALJ) sustained the four charges. On review, the Board vacated and remanded in light of intervening case law that established a different standard of proof. On remand, the CALJ sustained none of the charges. The Board adopted the CALJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the complaint. Pursuant to the Office of Special Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(m), Santella and Jech moved for attorney fees, which were granted in part by the Board. OPM moved for reconsideration and the Board denied OPM\u2019s motion. OPM now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>petitions this court for review of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(d), OPM may obtain review of a final Board decision if OPM \u201cdetermines, in [the Director\u2019s] discretion, that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board\u2019s decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule regulation, or policy directive.\u201d The statute further provides that \u201c[t]he granting of the petition for review shall be at the discretion of the court of appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">At issue is the attorney fee provision pertaining to actions by OSC in whistle-blower cases. Section 1204(m) of 5 U.S.C. provides that the Board may require payment of fees to an employee who is a \u201cprevailing party\u201d if the Board determines that payment by the agency is warranted in \u201cthe interest of justice.\u201d The Board interpreted \u00a7 1204(m) to authorize an award of fees to an employee who is \u201csubstantially innocent\u201d and held that these employees were substantially innocent because none of the charges was sustained. OPM argues that the Board\u2019s interpretation is wrong because it conflates the two requirements of the statute \u2014 the prevailing party requirement and the interest of justice requirement \u2014 to a single outcome-based test. OPM argues that the Board\u2019s standard will place OSC at risk for fee awards in any case in which it ultimately does not prevail and that will discourage OSC from vigorously enforcing the whistleblower statute in contravention of Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">\u201c[I]t is the duty of this court independently to assess whether an exercise of our discretionary jurisdiction is warranted.\u201d <em>Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>724 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983). OPM and the Board agree that the decision will have a substantial impact on the administration of the civil service system. Additionally, the Board\u2019s decision involves an issue of statutory interpretation. Thus, the case is deemed appropriate for appellate review. <em>See Devine v. Nutt, </em>718 F.2d 1048, 1053 (Fed.Cir.1983), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom., Cornelius v. Nutt, </em>472 U.S. 648, 105 S.Ct. 2882, 86 L.Ed.2d 515 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">OPM\u2019s petition for review is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
