As a result of Sombrero\u2019s assault, the victim suffered several deep lacerations to his head, a broken nose, a broken collarbone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and fractured ribs. The district court instructed the jury that it had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the victim \u201csuffered serious bodily injury\u201d as a result of Sombrero\u2019s assault. The district court defined the term \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d according to the definition of that term set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(g)(3). The court also permitted Sombrero\u2019s counsel to argue, in closing, that the victim\u2019s injuries did not rise to the level of \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d based upon the definition of mere bodily injury contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We conclude the district court\u2019s instructions, viewed in their entirety, adequately covered Sombrero\u2019s theory of defense. <em>See United States v.
