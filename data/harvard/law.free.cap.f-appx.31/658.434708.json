The district court granted Balboa\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, and Gecko has appealed. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting preliminary injunctive relief to Balboa, and we therefore <em>affirm </em>the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>On appeal, Gecko invites this court to review not only the district court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction, but also its orders granting Balboa summary judgment of infringement and denying Gecko\u2019s motion for summary judgment of invalidity, on the grounds that all three orders are \u201cinextricably intertwined.\u201d <em>Helifix Ltd. v. Blok-Lok, Ltd., </em>208 F.3d 1339, 1345, 54 USPQ2d 1299, 1303 (Fed. Cir.2000). Although we agree that all three orders are based on closely related matters of claim construction regarding claims 12 and 13 of the \u2019720 patent, we decline to review the district court\u2019s summary judgment orders at this point in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The grant of a preliminary injunction is within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, 239 F.3d 1343, </em>1350, 57 USPQ2d 1747, 1751 (Fed.Cir.2001). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be established by showing that the court made a clear error of judgment in weighing relevant factors or exercised its discretion based upon an error of law or clearly erroneous factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Novo Nordisk of N. Am., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., </em>77 F.3d 1364, 1367, 37 USPQ2d 1773, 1775 (Fed.Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Claim 13 of the \u2019720 patent depends from independent claim 12. Both claims are reproduced below, with the pertinent claim terms emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">12. A water control system for bathing, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">an open container for holding water for bathing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">a heater element for heating said water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae1\">a temperature sensor for monitoring the temperature of the water in said container;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">a control panel positioned adjacent said container for controlling the temperature of said water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">a microprocessor electrically coupled to said control panel, said microprocessor programmable by a user via said control panel to control the operation of said heater element, said microprocessor also being <em>capable of diagnosing failures in said water control system and providing an output signal to the control panel indicative of a source of the failures.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axf\">13. A system as in claim 12, wherein said microprocessor comprises an <em>8-bit CMOS </em>device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">In its opinion accompanying the order granting the preliminary injunction, the district court construed the phrase \u201cdiagnosing failures in said water control system\u201d to mean \u201cdisplaying error codes when there is a failure in the water control system.\u201d The district court also construed the phrase \u201cindicative of a source of the failures\u201d to require that \u201cthe system be capable of displaying multiple error codes dependent on the source of the failures, such as, for example, heater not heating, pump not operating, lack of water flow, or a microcomputer failure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-13\">As this appeal arises from the grant of a preliminary injunction, we recognize that the district court\u2019s claim construction may evolve with greater understanding of the dispute. Although we agree generally with the district court\u2019s claim construction, we suggest the following clarifications subject, of course, to the district court\u2019s plenary consideration during subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-14\">First, it would seem that the phrase \u201cdiagnosing failures\u201d connotes the process of detecting the causes or symptoms of failures in the water control system. Second, the phrase \u201cindicative of a source\u201d connotes the ability to indicate where in the water control system the failures might be occurring. The minor differences between our claim construction and the district court\u2019s, however, are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sufficient to convince us that the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction. In particular, we agree with the aspect of the district court\u2019s claim construction that is most relevant to this appeal, i.e., the court\u2019s determination that the plural form of the word \u201cfailures\u201d requires that the microprocessor be capable of diagnosing and indicating a source of more than one failure in the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Gecko\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that its accused spa controls are identical in all material respects to a prior art spa control. Under Gecko\u2019s theory, therefore, either its accused spa controls do not infringe claim 13 or claim 13 is invalid. Based on the record before us, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The pertinent prior art device is a spa control called the SC-200, which contains an 8-bit NMOS microprocessor rather than the 8-bit CMOS microprocessor found in the Gecko spa controls. The display panel of the SC-200 has a vertical, linear arrangement of seven lights. If the spa water is \u201ctoo hot,\u201d i.e., above 110\u00b0F, the top three lights of the SC-200 display panel will flash. If the spa water is \u201ctoo cold,\u201d i.e., below 45\u00b0F, the bottom three lights of the SC-200 display panel will flash. The SC-200 display panel is capable of producing a third signal, referred to as the \u201cno probe\u201d signal, which consists of an alternating pattern of flashing by the even and odd numbered lights on the display panel. The \u201cno probe\u201d signal indicates a failure in the water control system, such as the disconnection of the temperature probe from the control board, or a break in the probe wire. Nonetheless, dependent claim 13 requires a microprocessor capable of diagnosing and indicating a source of <em>multiple </em>failures. Although the \u201ctoo hot\u201d and \u201ctoo cold\u201d signals displayed by the SC-200 indicate that the spa water temperature is outside a certain temperature range, the district court found (albeit in the court\u2019s order denying Gecko\u2019s motion for summary judgment of invalidity) that a reasonable jury could conclude that the \u201cflashing signals provided on the display panel of the SC-200 simply indicate that the water is too hot or too cold and not that a malfunction in the pump or heating element has occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">On the other hand, the district court found that the Gecko spa controls are capable of diagnosing and indicating the source of at least two failures in the water control system: a faulty temperature probe and a lack of water flow. First, the district court found that the \u201cPRR\u201d error message relates to the temperature regulation probe in the spa. In addition, the court found that the error code \u201cFLO\u201d may be displayed if the microprocessor has indicated that the pump should be on and the flow switch does not detect flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Based on the findings summarized above, the district court concluded in its preliminary injunction order that the SC-200 is not capable of diagnosing and indicating the source of multiple failures and that the accused Gecko device differed from the SC-200 prior art device in that respect. Accordingly, the court concluded that Gecko was unlikely to prevail on the issue of invalidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Gecko correctly observes that the \u201cFLO\u201d error code can be triggered by any one of several causes; the record indicates that the \u201cFLO\u201d error code can be triggered by (1) a wrong parameter for the circulation pump in the microprocessor\u2019s low level programming, (2) an insufficient amount of water in the spa, (3) a dirty filter, (4) an obstruction of water flow, (5) a defective pump, (6) a defective or uncalibrated pressure switch, (7) a defective cable, or (8) a defective board. For that reason, Gecko contends that the \u201cFLO\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>error code does not indicate a source of the failure in the system.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">For purposes of our review of the preliminary injunction, we accept the district court\u2019s finding that the \u201cFLO\u201d error code is indicative of a source of a failure in the system, i.e., the lack of water flow, even though that failure could have been triggered by any one of several different malfunctions. We also accept, for purposes of the preliminary injunction proceedings, the district court\u2019s finding that a reasonable jury could conclude that the flashing signals on the display panel of the SC-200 do not indicate that a malfunction in the spa has occurred. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Gecko failed to raise a substantial question of invalidity with respect to claim 13 of the \u2019720 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In subsequent proceedings in this case, Gecko is free to press its argument that the \u201cFLO\u201d error code in the Gecko spa is not indicative of a source of a system failure because it does not identify the precise malfunction that caused the lack of water flow. Gecko is also free to argue in subsequent proceedings that the flashing signals that are triggered by water temperature deviations in the SC-200 diagnose and indicate a source of system failure, as those terms are used in the \u2019720 patent. Neither the district court\u2019s finding on the preliminary injunction nor our order sustaining the court\u2019s ruling constitutes law of the case on that issue or on claim construction. <em>See Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, </em>451 U.S. 390, 395, 101 S.Ct. 1830, 68 L.Ed.2d 175 (1981) (\u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law made by a court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Because we sustain the district court\u2019s ruling that Gecko failed to show that the SC-200 spa was \u201ccapable of diagnosing failures ... and providing an output signal to the control panel indicative of a source,\u201d we do not address Gecko\u2019s argument regarding the CMOS limitation of claim 13 in light of the SC-200 and the 1984 CMOS Databook.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">Gecko has raised several other objections to the preliminary injunction, including claims that Balboa failed to demonstrate irreparable harm and that the district court erred in finding that the balance of hardships and the public interest both weighed in Balboa\u2019s favor. Gecko\u2019s arguments are insufficient to persuade us that the district court abused its discretion in granting preliminary relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
