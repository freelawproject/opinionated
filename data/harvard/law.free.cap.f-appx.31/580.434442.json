Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the transitional rules apply and we therefore have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir.1996). An order of deportation entered in absentia may be rescinded if the petitioner demonstrates that she failed to appear because of exceptional circumstances. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3)(A) (1994), Exceptional circumstances are defined as \u201ccircumstances (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances) beyond the control of the alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(f)(2) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">With her motion to reopen, Garcia de Rodriguez provided a doctor\u2019s note that stated, \u201cLucia Garcia de Rodriguez was seen in our office on 7/22/96. She was advised to get bed rest until 7/25/96.\u201d The BIA did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the doctor\u2019s note did not establish exceptional circumstances due to serious illness. <em>See Sharma, </em>89 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Garcia de Rodriguez\u2019s contention that the BIA applied a newly-created evidentiary standard lacks merit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(f)(2); <em>Sharma, </em>89 F.3d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b650-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
