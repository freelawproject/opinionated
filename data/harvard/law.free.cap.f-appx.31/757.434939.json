Pauley, III, Judge), entered July 25, 2001, granting Plaintiff-Appellee MCI Worldcom, Inc.\u2019s motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and entering default judgment against Levin.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-24\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s entry of default judgment, and the imposition of sanctions under Rule 37 generally, for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Bambu Sales, Inc. v. Ozak Trading Inc., </em>58 F.3d 849, 852 (2d Cir.1995); <em>Bobal v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., </em>916 F.2d 759, 764 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 943, 111 S.Ct. 1404, 113 L.Ed.2d 459 (1991). The record reveals that Levin willfully and repeatedly failed to appear for depositions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>and comply with the District Court\u2019s orders, and that the District Court warned Levin that failure to comply with court orders could result in sanctions, including the entry of default judgment. We find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in entering default judgment against Levin. <em>See, e.g., Valentine v. Museum of Modern Art, </em>29 F.3d 47, 47-50 (2d Cir.1994) (district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing action with prejudice where <em>pro se </em>plaintiff unjustifiably failed to appear for a deposition after being warned that failure to appear would result in dismissal of the case); <em>Bobal v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst., </em>916 F.2d 759, 765-66 (2d Cir.1990) (same). Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s order of July 18, 2001, <em>MCI Worldcom, Inc. v. Empire Tel Inc., </em>00 Civ. 3546, Slip Op. at 1-3 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2001), the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
