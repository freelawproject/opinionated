Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Camarena-Rodriguez\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no arguable issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Counsel has identified and correctly rejected as a potential issue for appeal whether the district court erred by denying Camarena-Rodriguez\u2019s request for a cultural assimilation downward departure. A district court\u2019s discretionary decision to deny a downward departure request is unreviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726, 729, 731-32 (9th Cir.1997). Camarena-Rodriguez has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">Having conducted an independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v.
