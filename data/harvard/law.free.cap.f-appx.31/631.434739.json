We deny a COA and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), prisoners generally have one year from the date on which their convictions become final to petition for federal habeas corpus relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). A conviction becomes final \u201cby the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Alternatively, the AED-PA limitation period may run from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). AEDPA also provides that \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">We agree with Solis that the \u201ctimeliness of [his] petition for writ of habeas corpus depends on whether the limitations period was tolled ... while he sought certiorari in the United States Supreme Court from the Wyoming [state] court\u2019s judgment on his application for state post-conviction relief.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11.) In <em>Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153 (10th Cir.1999), we held that the AEDPA limitation period is \u201ctolled only while petitioner was seeking <em>state court review </em>of his post-conviction application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1155 (emphasis added). \u201cState court review\u201d does not include a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 1156. As a result, Solis\u2019s claim that the district court \u201cerred when it concluded that the statute of limitations was not tolled during the time that [he] sought certiorari review from the United States Supreme Court from the state court decision on his post-conviction petition\u201d fails. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Solis himself acknowledges the applicability of <em>Rhine\u2019s </em>holding to his case, but argues that <em>Rhine </em>was incorrectly decided. That argument presents but a faint hope; we are bound by this Circuit\u2019s prior holding in <em>Rhine </em>absent en banc reconsideration by this Court or a superceding decision by the Supreme Court, neither of which has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Solis\u2019s application for a COA is DENIED, and the matter is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
