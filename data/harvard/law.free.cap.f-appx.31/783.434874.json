On September 13, 1999, Luna pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and one count of aiding and abetting in the distribution of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On February 3, 2000, Luna was sentenced to 87 months imprisonment and supervised release of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">Luna\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the District Court erred in applying a two point sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>weapon during the drug offense. In order for the enhancement to apply, the government must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant possessed the weapon and that the connection between the weapon and the drug offense was not clearly improbable. See <em>United States v. Price, </em>13 F.3d 711, 733 (3d Cir. 1994). From our review of the record, we find that there was sufficient evidence before the District Court to support its finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Luna was in possession of a firearm at the time of the drug offense. Therefore, the District Court properly applied a two point sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
