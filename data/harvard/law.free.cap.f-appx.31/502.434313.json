Civ.Code \u00a7 1639; <em>see also Beck v. Am. Health Group Int'l, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>211 Cal.App.3d 1555, 260 Cal.Rptr. 237, 242 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We reject James\u2019s contention that the agreement conveyed only the rights associated with the copyright. The conjunction \u201cand,\u201d which follows the reference to \u201cthe copyright,\u201d makes it clear that James assigned some additional rights; given the specific conveyance of the copyright, an alternative interpretation would render the reference to \u201call rights ... in and to the results and proceeds\u201d meaningless. <em>Cf. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Vars, Pave, McCord &amp; Freedman, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1469, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 479, 487 (1998). Given that the contract defines the \u201cservice\u201d that James was to provide as the illustration of children\u2019s books, the phrase \u201call rights of every kind and nature in and to the results [of James\u2019s] services\u201d can only be interpreted to include the ownership right to James\u2019s original artwork.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Given that James\u2019s claim fails as to liability, we must also reject James\u2019s claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-20\">. Because the 1982 contract terminated whatever rights James may have had under her earlier agreements with Price Stern, our determination is governed by the language of the 1982 agreement. In any event, the earlier agreements contained identical language, and therefore our analysis would apply to them as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\">. Because we conclude that the contract is not susceptible to the interpretation that James advances, the extrinsic evidence she offers in support of her contention is inadmissible. <em>Davlar Corp. v. Superior Court, </em>53 Cal. App.4th 1121, 62 Cal.Rptr.2d 199, 201 n. 2 (1997); <em>Banco do Brasil, S.A. v.
