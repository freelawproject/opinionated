We have jurisdiction to determine whether the petitioner is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Matsuk v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 999, 1000-02 (9th Cir.2001). We review de novo legal questions under the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1994). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-24\">On May 28, 1993, the petitioner was convicted of driving under the influence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>alcohol with prior multiple convictions in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7\u00a7 23152(a) and 23175. A violation of sections 23152(a) and 23175 is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. <em>Montiel-Barraza v. INS, </em>275 F.3d 1178, 1180 (9th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (applying the analysis of <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir.2001), and reasoning that \u201cif driving under the influence with injury to another does not amount to an aggravated felony, then logically a violation of the lesser offense cannot qualify as an aggravated felony\u201d). We therefore find that the petitioner\u2019s conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">We grant the petition and remand to the BIA to find petitioner not removable.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
