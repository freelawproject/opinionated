Hughes, an African American woman who is more than forty years old, alleged that her June 1999 demotion at WorldCom was motivated by discriminatory animus and that she was being paid less than certain white male WorldCom employees who held the same position that she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">This case was properly removed to federal court, and we have jurisdiction over the instant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The applicable standard of review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Ersek v. Township of Springfield, </em>102 F.3d 79, 83 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-18\">Upon reviewing the evidence adduced, the District Court determined that there was no triable issue of fact in dispute as to whether WorldCom\u2019s proffered rationales for Hughes\u2019s demotion and alleged comparatively lower pay were pretextual. It further determined that Hughes\u2019s claim of discrimination based upon national origin should be dismissed, as it was not pursued in the course of arguing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">After a careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned findings. We will therefore AFFIRM the judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
