We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">The district court properly determined that Smith\u2019s section 1983 action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations pursuant to Nevada state law, <em>see Perez v. Seevers, </em>869 F.2d 425, 426 (9th Cir.1989) (per curiam), because Smith had reason to know of his injury over two years prior to filing his action, <em>see Bagley v. CMC Real Estate Corp., </em>923 F.2d 758, 760-61 (9th Cir.1991), and because he failed to establish a basis for equitable tolling, <em>see </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 11.250 (Nevada\u2019s tolling statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">Because Smith did not show clear error or present new evidence, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County, Oregon v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\">Because Smith\u2019s proposed second amendment would have been futile, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to further amend his complaint. <em>See Eaglesmith v. Ward, </em>73 F.3d 857, 860 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>To the extent Smith intended to raise additional issues on appeal, we decline to consider them because he failed to specifically argue them in his opening brief. <em>See Entertainment Research Group, Inc. v. Genesis Creative Group, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir.1997) (stating that this court reviews only issues that are argued specifically and distinctly in a party\u2019s opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b497-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
