Green. <em>See IBM &amp; Communications Workers of America, Local 1120, AFL-CIO, </em>333 NLRB No. 26, 2001 WL 114159 (Jan. 31, 2001). We have jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 160(e) (application for enforcement) and (f) (petition for review).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">We assume familiarity with the factual findings below. Essentially, IBM has a long-standing rule prohibiting employees from having signs on their vehicles in IBM parking lots \u201cwhen in the judgment of the facility\u2019s manager, the prominence, size, etc., of the sign indicates the vehicle is being used for commercial solicitation or advertising.\u201d Two IBM employees, Peter Plavchan and Bill Costine, displayed pro-union signs from their vehicles. Initially, security guards, and subsequently, their supervisors informed Plavchan and Cos-tine that further display of the signs would violate IBM policy. After finding out from his supervisor that further display of his sign would not lead to dismissal, Costine continued to display his sign as a sunscreen in his car without further incident. Neither Plavchan nor Costine was disciplined in any manner, although IBM reserves its right to discipline employees who violate its rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">The employees\u2019 prospective Union, Communications Workers of America, brought a charge of unfair labor practices against IBM before the NLRB. The NLRB designated an administrative law judge, who recommended issuance of a cease and desist order. The Board affirmed the ALJ, concluding that IBM violated its employees\u2019 rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, by committing an unfair labor practice. The Board issued a cease-and-desist order prohibiting IBM from (1) maintaining the rule \u201cto the extent that it would preclude its employees from displaying signs supporting\u201d their union; (2) \u201ctelling employees that the display of large signs on their cars in company parking lots in support of a union, constitutes a violation of company policy;\u201d and (3) otherwise \u201cinterfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the rights guaranteed them by Section 7 .Id at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">In <em>United Technologies, </em>we held that \u201cany restriction of employees\u2019 on-premises communication in nonworking areas during nonworking hours \u2018must be presumed to be an unreasonable impediment to self-organization ... in the absence of evidence that special circumstances make the rule necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>District Lodge 91, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists v. NLRB </em>(\u201c <em>United Technologies </em>\u201d), 814 F.2d 876, 880 (2d Cir.1987)(quoting <em>Republic Aviation Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>v. NLRB, </em>324 U.S. 793, 803-04 <em>&amp; </em>n. 10, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372 (1945)(internal quotation marks omitted)), vacating and remanding <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>279 NLRB 973 (1986). In light of this rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness, the Board and the courts have consistently imposed on employers the burden of proving \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that the restriction is necessary to protect \u201clegitimate, recognized managerial interests,\u201d such as maintaining production, discipline, safety, or otherwise preventing disruption of company operations. 814 F.2d at 880 (citations omitted). In this case, the Board concluded that IBM failed to present sufficient evidence that restricting pro-union signs in its parking lots is justified by \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d such as safety or corporate image concerns. Based on our review of the record, we believe the Board\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">We find that the problem here is not IBM\u2019s rule in itself, but rather the manner in which it was applied. On its face, the rule only bans signs used for commercial solicitation or advertising. The pro-union posters at issue in this case do not fall within the reach of the rule. Thus, the NLRB\u2019s cease-and-desist order is perfectly reasonable because it only addresses IBM\u2019s <em>extension </em>of its rule to restrict employees\u2019 display of union posters. IBM has failed to present evidence sufficient to show that extending its rule from \u201ccommercial solicitation or advertising\u201d to union solicitations is justified by \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d <em>See generally United Technologies, </em>814 F.2d 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Accordingly, we deny IBM\u2019s petition for review and grant the NLRB\u2019s cross-application for enforcement of its order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
