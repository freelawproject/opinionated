The conviction was entered under a conditional plea of guilty so that Haines could challenge the denial of his motion to suppress the marijuana found in his truck, and challenge the denial of his motion for discovery. Haines contends that the Border Patrol lacked suspicion to prolong his detention beyond the initial stop at the immigration checkpoint. The Border Patrol agents had the requisite \u201carticulable suspicion ... of criminal activity\u201d, however, because while conducting the initial routine immigration questioning, an officer saw the duffel bags in the bed of the truck and noted the outline of square bricks. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>934 F.2d 218, 221 (9th Cir.1991). The bags were large enough to contain possible aliens, and the blocks were, in the experience of one of the agents, similar to those used to package marijuana. The bags and their contents, coupled with Haines\u2019 nervous behavior, created more than adequate articulable suspicion to justify the brief further detention. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-21\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Haines\u2019 motion for discovery regarding the number of drug seizures versus immigration arrests at the checkpoint. He relies only upon the dissenting opinion in <em>United States v. Soyland, </em>3 F.3d 1312, 1316-20 (9th Cir.1993). We rejected a similar systemic argument in the context of temporary checkpoints in <em>United States v. Soto-Camacho, </em>58 F.3d 408, 411-12 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-22\">Haines\u2019 challenge to his sentence and conviction under \u00a7 841 is controlled by our recent en banc decision in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), and must also be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
