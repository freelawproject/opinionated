This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-18\">Seeking monetary, declaratory, and injunctive relief, Harbin-Bey sued two prison officials for his confinement in administrative segregation. The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A(b) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">In his timely appeal, Harbin-Bey states that the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint before dismissal, that he did state a cause of action, that he stated an Eighth Amendment violation, and that he established a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">The district court\u2019s judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">Harbin-Bey contends that the district court should not have dismissed his complaint without first allowing him the opportunity to amend the complaint. Harbin-Bey cites <em>Tingler v. Marshall, </em>716 F.2d 1109 (6th Cir.1983) to support his position. However, <em>Tingler </em>has been overruled. <em>McGore, </em>114 F.3d at 612. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(a), a court is required to dismiss a case if it fails to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>Courts have no discretion in permitting a plaintiff to amend a complaint to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>sua sponte dismissal. <em>Id. </em>As Harbin-Bey\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim, the district court did not err in sua sponte dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The district court properly dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. The district court noted that Harbin-Bey had not exhausted his available administrative remedies concerning his complaint against the named defendants. Harbin-Bey concedes in his brief before this court that he had not exhausted his available administrative remedies when he filed his complaint. As Harbin-Bey admits that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies before filing the complaint, the district court properly dismissed the complaint. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 1823-24, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001); <em>Brown v. Toombs, </em>139 F.3d 1102, 1104 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
