We remand the petition to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Gudiel-Paul and his family were members of the Assembly of God Pentecostal Church in rural Guatemala. His father was active in working for the church, telling his family \u201cto talk to everyone about God, to [tell] all the people that didn\u2019t know about God.\u201d His mother and his brothers and his sisters acted on his father\u2019s advice: \u201cwe were dedicated to that, to talk to everyone.\u201d Their talk caused \u201cproblems\u201d with the guerrillas. When Gudiel-Paul was 16, the guerrillas \u201ctook my father and my mother, they put them in the kitchen, and they let us out in a room so we were listening, hearing how they were beating my father and my mother in the kitchen.\u201d Gudiel-Paul heard shooting and thought that his parents\u2019 assailants had killed them. In fact, the guerrillas had beaten his father on the head with such force that his father lost one eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In another assault on the family, the guerrillas raped his older sister, Amalia Maria. She bore the child, conceived in the rape. As Gudiel-Paul put it: \u201cI can\u2019t forget that because my sister now she has a child that has not a father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Gudiel-Paul\u2019s parents moved the younger children to a neighboring village, leaving behind his older brother Ervin Eduardo. A little later Ervin Eduardo was killed by the guerrillas. His body was found hung from a tree on the ranch his father cared for. A note on his body read that it was a warning for the boy\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">A mutilated father, a raped sister, a murdered brother \u2014 the horrors accumulated. Asylum might well be granted, <em>see Lopez-Galarza v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 954, 961 (9th Cir.1996), except for the Board\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Under our precedents, as the Board\u2019s own decision acknowledged, Gudiel-Paul should be given the opportunity to explain any inconsistencies noted by the Board in his case. We remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In passing, we note that the Board decision relied heavily on inconsistencies between Gudiel-Paul\u2019s asylum application and his live testimony. In the experience of this court, asylum applications are often perfunctorily prepared by personnel not attentive to the exact words of the applicant and often handicapped by inadequate translation. We assume that the Board\u2019s experience has been similar. If it has, the Board\u2019s focus should be on the live testimony. At Gudiel-Paul\u2019s hearing, the horrifying facts came out slowly not as a rehearsed story but as memories he could not forget. It was the government\u2019s cross-examination, for example, that reminded him of the guerrillas\u2019 rape of his sister Amalia Maria. We also note that it is established law that minor inconsistencies, not bearing on the heart of the case, do not make a witness perjurious. Indeed it is often the minor inconsistencies that show the basic story is not a fiction but what is really remembered. For almost two thousand years critics have noted the minor inconsistencies among the Four Gospels, but only a determined sceptic will conclude from them that the evangelists were liars.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The petition for review is GRANTED. The case is REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b537-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
