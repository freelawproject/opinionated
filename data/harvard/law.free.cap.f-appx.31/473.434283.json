We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) de novo, <em>Zimmerman v. City of Oakland, </em>255 F.3d 734, 737 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-24\">O\u2019Connor is a retired teacher formerly employed by the Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles Community College. He disputed STRS\u2019s calculation of his retirement benefits in a number of actions before California administrative law courts and state courts. When he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>unable to obtain the ruling he desired, O\u2019Connor filed a complaint in the Central District of California. The district court dismissed O\u2019Connor\u2019s action on two grounds. First, it concluded that dismissal was appropriate under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Second, it found that the action was barred by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Notwithstanding O\u2019Connor\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court correctly concluded that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars jurisdiction over this case. The district court could not grant the relief O\u2019Connor was seeking without reviewing the state court\u2019s decision. As such, the claims in O\u2019Connor\u2019s district court complaint were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the earlier state court decisions, and dismissal was appropriate under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Ahmed v. Washington, </em>276 F.3d 464, 467 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted); <em>Doe &amp; Assocs. Law Offices v.

Because the district court properly dismissed the action in accordance with the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we need not address O\u2019Connor's claim that his action is not barred by res judicata.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
