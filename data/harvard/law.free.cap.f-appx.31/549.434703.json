Robles-Ruiz contends that this court has jurisdiction to address his appeal since: (1) his guilty plea is invalid under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>cause the district court conducted two simultaneous plea hearings; and (2) his plea waiver is invalid because his sentence was not consistent with the terms of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">A review of the record demonstrates that the court conducted a thorough Rule 11 guilty plea colloquy, and that Robles-Ruiz knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>67 F.3d 200, 201-202 (9th Cir.1995) (enforcing a defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal even in the face of an intervening change of law since (1) the waiver intended to encompass the issue raised; and (2) the waiver was knowingly and voluntary despite change in law). Robles-Ruiz\u2019 Rule 11 contention lacks merit since Rule 11 does not prohibit the court from conducting simultaneous hearings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Robles-Ruiz\u2019 sentence was consistent with the terms of the written plea agreement because his sentence was within the sentencing range agreed upon in the plea agreement. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(1)(C). Therefore, we enforce Robles-Ruiz\u2019 valid appeal waiver and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
