Austin held one of 47 grazing allotments that the Center challenged in the underlying action. Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1531-38, the U.S. Forest Service must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service before allowing any activities, including grazing, that may affect certain endangered species. Id at \u00a7 1536. Once the Forest Service had completed its consultation and determined that the \u201ctake\u201d of endangered species on the challenged allotments was \u201cincidental,\u201d and therefore lawful, the Center moved to have its suit dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">Austin objected to the Court\u2019s dismissal of the action as moot, at which point the Court recharacterized the dismissal as being \u201cwith prejudice\u201d to allow the parties to collect fees and costs from each other. The Forest Service paid the Center a portion of its fees, and the Center and the other parties agreed to have each party bear its own fees and costs. Only Austin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>and the Center submitted motions to collect fees from each other. The District Court granted Austin\u2019s motion, and denied the center\u2019s motion, without explanation. Approximately six weeks later the Court filed a memorandum disposition explaining that it had awarded Austin fees and costs because the litigation affecting the Austin\u2019s allotment had been filed in bad faith. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u201cThis court reviews for abuse of discretion a District Court\u2019s decision on a motion for attorney fees.... This court reviews the District Court\u2019s analysis of the law de novo and its factual determinations for clear error.\u201d <em>Cline v. Indus. Maint. Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co., </em>200 F.3d 1223, 1235 (9th Cir.2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u201cThe bad faith requirement sets a high threshold.\u201d <em>Primus Automotive Financial Services, Inc. v. Batarse, </em>115 F.3d 644, 649 (9th Cir.1997). In order to support a finding of bad faith, the litigation must have been frivolous or filed for an improper purpose. <em>Fink v. Gomez, </em>239 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). The District Court did not suggest that the litigation was frivolous, so we must determine whether it was filed for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u201cLike other sanctions, attorney\u2019s fees certainly should not be assessed lightly or without fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.\u201d <em>Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 767, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980). \u201cA specific finding of bad faith ... must \u2018precede any sanction under the court\u2019s inherent powers.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Stoneberger, </em>805 F.2d 1391, 1392 (9th Cir.1986) (quoting <em>Roadway Express, </em>447 U.S. at 767, 100 S.Ct. 2455).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The District Court failed to conduct any hearing on the subject of attorney\u2019s fees, and it awarded the fees prior to making any factual findings regarding bad faith. Moreover, our review of the record does not reveal conduct rising to the level of bad faith. Appellant\u2019s initial claim was meritorious. Its motion to dismiss the case was proper. The District Court erred in finding that its claim for injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 9 of the ESA was not rendered moot by the Biological Opinion and that the dismissal motion was in bad faith. Once the \u201ctake\u201d had been deemed \u201clawful,\u201d there was no possibility of pursuing an injunction for an unlawful take. The District Court otherwise failed to make specific findings of bad faith as required by <em>Primus, </em>115 F.3d at 649, and we find insufficient evidence in the record to remand for a further inquiry into whether the \u201chigh threshold\u201d was reached.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">The Austins have demonstrated to this Court an impressive and commendable commitment to the environment, and this lawsuit was doubtless vexing to them. It was not, however \u201cvexatious\u201d in the legal sense required to receive an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 32, 45, 111 S.Ct. 2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991). The District Court erred in awarding the sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">Southwest Center\u2019s contention that it was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>and Human Resources, </em>532 U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001), which rejected the \u201ccatalyst theory\u201d of determining whether a party is a prevailing party for the purposes of fee-shifting statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The award of attorney\u2019s fees to Austin is REVERSED. The denial of attorney\u2019s fees to Southwest Center is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b433-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-7\">. The District Court apparently relied on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) as an alternate basis for its holding. That rule, which allows a court impose terms and conditions upon its dismissal of a case, is not applicable here, where the court attempted to impose new conditions several months after dismissing the case. The Center had no reasonable opportunity to decide whether or not to accept the court's terms prior to the case\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
