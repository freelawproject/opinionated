Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Carlos F. Bell-Outlaw\u2019s appeal because of lack of jurisdiction or in the alternative, to summarily affirm the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision. Bell-Outlaw has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-22\">In the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims Bell-Outlaw claimed to be appealing from a November 13, 2000 final decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BVA). Bell-Outlaw did not submit a copy of a November 13, 2000 BVA decision; instead, he provided the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with a Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) decision of that same date. The Secretary advised the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims that no final BVA decision in Bell-Outlaw\u2019s name had issued on or around November 13, 2000. Because the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that it had no jurisdiction to review an MSPB decision, it dismissed Bell-Outlaw\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a) (granting the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims authority to review final decisions of the BVA). Bell-Outlaw appealed the dismissal to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which transferred the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-23\">Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, not every decision entered by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is appealable. Section 7292(a) provides that a party may only seek review of a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims with respect to the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation relied on by the court in making its decision. Further, except to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue, this court may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). If an appellant\u2019s case does not meet these criteria, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) requires this court to dismiss the appeal. <em>See In re Bailey, </em>182 F.3d 860 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>In his informal brief, Bell-Outlaw concedes that his arguments do not implicate a constitutional issue or the validity or interpretation of a statute or regulation relied on by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to review Bell-Outlaw\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d); <em>Livingston v. Derwinski, </em>959 F.2d 224, 225-26 (Fed.Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s alternative motion to summarily affirm is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
