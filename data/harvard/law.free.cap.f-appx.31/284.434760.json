We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Rivers v. Avis Construction Co., </em>CA-01-749-1 (W.D.Va. Jan. 10, 2002). Additionally, we deny Rivers\u2019 motions to subpoena all parties involved and for production of documents. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
