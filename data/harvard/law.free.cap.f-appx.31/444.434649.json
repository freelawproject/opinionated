Accordingly, the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward under \u00a7\u00a7 5H1.3 and 5K2.13 is discretionary and not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>264 F.3d 813, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that a district court\u2019s silence regarding authority to depart is not enough to indicate that it believed it lacked power to depart).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b514-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
