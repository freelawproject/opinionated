We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Frost v. Symington, </em>197 F.3d 348, 353 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Turner\u2019s First Amendment claim because Turner failed to raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>a genuine issue of material fact about whether the prison regulations were rationally related to legitimate penological objectives. <em>See id. </em>at 356-58. Similarly, summary judgment on Turner\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process claim was proper because Turner failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he received notice that the magazines were withheld or had an opportunity to respond. <em>See id. </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Turner\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b489-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
