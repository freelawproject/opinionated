Ruther appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his civil action and motion to reconsider. The record does not contain a transcript of the hearing conducted on September 7, 2001, at which the district court gave its reasons for dismissing the action. Ruther has the burden of including in the record on appeal a transcript of all parts of the proceedings material to the issues raised on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); 4th Cir. Local R. 10(c). Appellants proceeding on appeal in forma pauperis are entitled to transcripts at government expense only in certain circumstances. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) (1994). By failing to produce a transcript or to qualify for the production of a transcript at government expense, Ruther has waived review of the issues on appeal which depend upon the transcript to show error. <em>Keller v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>827 F.2d 952, 954 n. 1 (4th Cir.1987). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
