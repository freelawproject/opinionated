The Board found that petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen had been withdrawn because he left the United States prior to the disposition of the motion. We have jurisdiction and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">On November 7,1994, a California Superior Court terminated petitioner\u2019s probation and expunged his conviction for possession of cocaine. Petitioner then filed a motion to reopen, asking the Board to reconsider its final deportation order. On December 12, 1994, petitioner left the United States and traveled to Mexico. Petitioner returned on January 4, 1995. The INS served petitioner with an Order to Show Cause pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 243.5 alleging that petitioner\u2019s departure constituted self-deportation. On November 9, 2000, the Board, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2 found that petitioner\u2019s self-deportation constituted a withdrawal of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-20\">The Board\u2019s determination of legal questions is reviewed de novo. <em>Chowdhury v. INS, </em>249 F.3d 970, 972 (9th Cir.2001). However, the Board\u2019s interpretation and application of immigration laws is entitled to deference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-21\">The applicable regulation clearly provides that if an alien departs the United States subsequent to filing a motion to reopen, the departure constitutes a withdrawal of the motion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(4)(d). Petitioner self-deported the United States subsequent to filing a motion to reopen and prior to the Board\u2019s determination on that motion. The Board properly deemed the motion as withdrawn. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this-circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
