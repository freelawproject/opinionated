We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Seals\u2019 habeas petition, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Seals contends that his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (ADE-PA) one-year limitation period was tolled during the pendency of several preceding state habeas petitions. This contention is unpersuasive. Even according Seals the benefit of tollmg during the pendency of each of his state petitions filed withm the one-year limitations period, his \u00a7 2254 petition was still untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The AEDPA\u2019s limitation period began to run when Seals\u2019 state conviction became final on May 14, 1996. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>Bowen v. Roe, </em>188 F.3d 1157, 1158-59 (9th Cir.1999). The AEDPA limitations period was tolled during the pendency of his properly filed applications for state post-conviction relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); <em>Nino v. Galaza, </em>183 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.1999). Accordingly, the limitation period was tolled during the pendency of Seals\u2019 petitions, the first of which was filed on August 19, 1996,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the last of which was demed on June 19, 1997. Between June 19, 1997 and the expiration of the AEDPA limitations period on December 16, 1997, Seals failed to file any habeas petitions with either the state or federal courts. Seals filed three more state petitions in the California Superior Court before fifing his first \u00a7 2254 petition on March 5, 1999. The district court therefore properly denied this federal petition as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b517-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
