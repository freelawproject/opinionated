However, Zamani failed to submit evidence that the police presence at RCC was excessive or that the police otherwise acted unreasonably. Summary judgment was therefore appropriate. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 </em>U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-22\">Because there was no \u00a7 1983 violation, Zamani\u2019s claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986 also fail. <em>Caldeira v. County of Kauai, </em>866 F.2d 1175, 1182 (9th Cir.1989); <em>McCalden v. California Library Ass\u2019n, </em>955 F.2d 1214, 1223 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-23\">Carter, Hankel, Ramirez, and Kalyn are entitled to qualified immunity because they reasonably (and correctly) believed their actions were lawful. <em>Act Up!/Portland v. Bagley, </em>988 F.2d 868, 872 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-24\">Because no constitutional violation occurred, there can be no municipal liability as a matter of law under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct., 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). <em>See City of Los Angeles v. Heller, </em>475 U.S. 796, 799, 106 S.Ct. 1571, 89 L.Ed.2d 806 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-25\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>decide whether officers are entitled to discretionary immunity under California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b418-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
