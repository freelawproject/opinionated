We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-21\">Contreras contends that the district court erred in denying a two level downward minor role adjustment pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 because his only participation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the offense was to drive the vehicle across the border. This argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u201cA district court\u2019s finding that a defendant does not qualify for a minor or minimal participant status is heavily dependant on the facts of the particular case, and we uphold such a finding unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1436 (9th Cir.1994). The mere fact that Contreras\u2019 role was \u201cto transport the alien[ ] north does not entitle him to a minor role adjustment.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Franco, </em>189 F.3d 1151, 1160 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that the appellant has the burden to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that he is substantially less culpable than the average co-participant); see <em>also United States v. Rexford, </em>903 F.2d 1280, 1282 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that \u201ca district court is not compelled to determine whether a defendant was or was not the least culpable participant in determining whether that defendant\u2019s role was \u2018minor\u2019 \u201d). Our review of the record indicates that the district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b512-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
