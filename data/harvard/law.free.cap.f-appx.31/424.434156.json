R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b494-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">Roy Gibbons Powell and Dixie Lee Powell appeal pro se the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the United States, which reduced to judgment certain federal income taxes and interest assessed against the Powells. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and, after de novo review, <em>see Hansen v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 137, 138 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-22\">The district court correctly granted the United States summary judgment as to the validity of the tax assessments against the Powells because the Powells failed to rebut the presumption that the tax assess-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>merits were accurate. <em>See Palmer v. IRS, </em>116 F.3d 1309, 1312 (9th Cir.1997). In addition, the Powells failed to come forward with any evidence to rebut the presumption that they received the requisite notice and demand for payment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303. <em>See Hughes v. United States, </em>953 F.2d 531, 536 (9th Cir.1992). The district court also correctly found that the Motoqua Common Law Trust was the Powells\u2019 alter ego, <em>cf. Standage v. Standage, </em>147 Ariz. 473, 711 P.2d 612, 615 (Ariz. Ct.App.1985), and therefore could be levied to pay the-assessments, <em>see Wolfe v. United States, </em>798 F.2d 1241, 1243 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>806 F.2d 1410 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The Powells\u2019 1993 criminal conviction for tax evasion does not preclude the current civil action pursuant to the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Helvering v. Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 399, 58 S.Ct. 630, 82 L.Ed. 917 (1938). Similarly, the voluntary dismissal of a 1999 summons enforcement action against the Powells does not preclude this action pursuant to the res judicata doctrine. <em>See Russell v. Commissioner, </em>678 F.2d 782, 785-86 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Powells\u2019 post-judgment motions for reconsideration, <em>see Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County, Or. v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993), and for a stay pending appeal, <em>see Lopez v. Heckler, </em>713 F.2d 1432, 1435-36 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Powells\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The United States moves for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912. \u201cThis appeal is frivolous because the result is obvious and the arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d <em>Gattuso v. Pecorella, </em>733 F.2d 709, 710 (9th Cir.1984) (per curiam). Accordingly, we impose a sanction of $1,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b494-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
