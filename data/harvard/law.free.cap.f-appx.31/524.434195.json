Villa\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved to withdraw as counsel of record. Villa did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-22\">Counsel raises as potential issues, the district court\u2019s denial of Villa\u2019s request for reductions for minor role and over representation of criminal history. Counsel correctly concludes that because Villa was sentenced to the statutory minimum sentence, and was not eligible for a safety valve departure because of his criminal history category, these issues lack merit for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-23\">Having conducted an independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no other arguable issues for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b594-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
