Page received a consolidated sentence of 151 months incarceration, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $4233 in restitution and $200 in special assessment. Page\u2019s attorney has filed a timely appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court erred in denying Page\u2019s request for downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3, p.s. (2000), based on Page\u2019s contention that his career offender status significantly overstated the seriousness of his prior offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-22\">Here, the district court acknowledged its authority to grant Page\u2019s motion for downward departure, but chose not to. Consequently, the district court\u2019s decision is not appealable. USSG \u00a7 4A1.3., p.s.; <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 876 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-23\">We affirm Page\u2019s conviction and sentence. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests such a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
