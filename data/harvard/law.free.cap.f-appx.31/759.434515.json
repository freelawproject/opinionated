Dodge, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. In her complaint, Dodge alleges that she was discharged from her position as an education aide at the Southeast State Correctional Facility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>in Windsor, Vermont, and that such discharge violated her rights under federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">On appeal, Dodge specifically argues that: (1) her complaint states a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; (2) defendants were constructively aware that Dodge was being denied her due process rights of notice and opportunity to be heard; and (3) in lieu of the complaint\u2019s dismissal, the District Court should have permitted Dodge to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Ikelionwu v. United States, </em>150 F.3d 233, 236 (2d Cir. 1998). Construing any well-pleaded factual allegation in the complaint in the plaintiffs favor, this Court will affirm the dismissal if the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support .of her claim which would entitle her to relief. <em>See Gagliardi v. Village of Pawling, </em>18 F.3d 188, 191 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">We find, for all of the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s opinion, that Dodge\u2019s complaint fails to state any claim for which relief could be granted. With respect to Dodge\u2019s argument about discovery, it does not appear that Dodge ever moved for discovery before the District Court. In any event, given the potential for undue harassment of state officials, and in light of our complete agreement herein as to the insufficiency of the complaint, it would not have been an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny a request by Dodge for factual discovery in lieu of the complaint\u2019s dismissal. <em>See e.g., Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[W]e see no reason to expect that discovery would have helped [plaintiff] establish a triable issue of material fact. And we are particularly reluctant to remand for unnecessary discovery because this case revolves around questions of absolute and qualified immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
