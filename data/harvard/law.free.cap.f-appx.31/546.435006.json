Arellano-Saucedo\u2019 attorney has filed a motion to withdraw and a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Arellano-Saucedo did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In the plea agreement, Arellano-Saucedo \u201cwaive[d] any right to appeal or collaterally attack the Court\u2019s entry of judgment against him ..., and waive[d] any right to appeal or collaterally attack the imposition of sentence upon him under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 (sentence appeals).\u201d Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we are satisfied that the plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal, was entered knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998). We therefore enforce the waiver, grant the motion to withdraw, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b616-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
