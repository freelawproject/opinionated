R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b450-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Miguel Angel Rivera-Garcia appeals his 63-month sentence following his guilty plea conviction for being an alien found in the United States following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-22\">Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Rivera-Garcia challenges his conviction on three grounds. First, Rivera contends that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is unconstitutional because it permits the district court to determine \u201csentencing factors.\u201d Second, he contends that the district court improperly imposed a sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) because the government neither pleaded in the indictment nor established through the guilty plea that Rivera-Garcia had sustained a prior aggravated felony conviction. Third, Gareia-Rivera contends that following <em>Apprendi </em>his case is distinguished from the specific facts and holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a sentencing factor and not a separate offense). These arguments are foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-23\">Rivera-Garcia further contends that the district court erred by relying solely on his pre-sentence report to determine that his prior felony was sufficient to enhance his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2). This contention also lacks merit because a presentence report which contains the specific statute underlying the aggravated felony on which the 16 point enhancement is based is sufficient to satisfy a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v.
