R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Cruz's request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Froylan Trinidad Cruz appeals his 101-month sentence imposed after pleading guilty to several counts of controlled substance offenses committed with a firearm, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Cruz challenges the Government\u2019s refusal to move for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, because he contends the Government\u2019s motive was unconstitutional. We review the legality of the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence de novo, and its factual findings concerning the government\u2019s motive for clear error. <em>United States v. Murphy, 65 </em>F.3d 758, 762 (9th Cir.1995). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">Notwithstanding the fact that the district court departed below the statutory minimum pursuant to the Government\u2019s motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), Cruz contends the district court should have further departed pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1, because he contends the government acted arbitrarily in refusing to make a motion under this guideline. We find Cruz\u2019s contention unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">The district court here expressly considered the Government\u2019s reason for refusing to seek a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure, and did not clearly err in finding no unconstitutional motive or arbitrary conduct rising to the level of a due process violation. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>Murphy, </em>65 F.3d at 763-64 (finding no unconstitutional motive where government refused to file \u00a7 5K1.1 motion due to failed plea negotiations); <em>United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 884 (9th Cir.1994). As such, the district court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to depart under \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>United States v. Treleaven, </em>35 F.3d 458, 460 (9th Cir.1994) (as amended on denial of rehearing) (recognizing that district court cannot depart without government motion, absent unconstitutional motive in refusing to file motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b499-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
