Ms. O\u2019Connell seeks review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) affirming OPM\u2019s decision. <em>O\u2019Connell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. BN-0831-00-0202-I-1, 90 M.S.P.R. 455 (M.S.P.B.2000), <em>recons, denied, </em>No. CH-0752-00-0622-1-1, 88 M.S.P.R. 302 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 26, 2001). For the reasons stated below, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-25\">Ms. O\u2019Connell worked full-time for the Social Security Administration until May 1982. Thereafter, she worked as an intermittent employee until October 29, 1983, with no intervening break in service.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-26\">On February 22, 1985, Ms. O\u2019Connell sent OPM an Application for Refund of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Retirement Deductions. Along with the application, she enclosed a letter making a number of inquiries, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">Do you have any literature which would explain to me how the current system works?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">If I am later re-employed by the U.S. Govt., as I intend to be, and I repay my Retirement, as I intend to do, am I forfeiting any rights by taking my retirement out now?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">On March 13, 1985, OPM authorized a refund of $10,970 without answering any of Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Ms. O\u2019Connell later returned to Government service. On January 11, 1999, she filed with OPM an Application to Make a Deposit or Redeposit to the Retirement Fund. Upon receipt of this application, OPM sent Ms. O\u2019Connell a bill for redeposit in the amount of $32,905. This amount represented the $10,970 refunded to Ms. O\u2019Connell plus interest of $21,935, calculated using the variable annual rates determined by the Department of the Treasury, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(e)(3). On May 24, 1999, Ms. O\u2019Connell requested that OPM recompute the interest using the <em>3% </em>fixed rate that applied to redeposits of all withdrawals requested before October 1, 1982. On July 14, 1999, OPM issued a decision denying this request. Ms. O\u2019Connell requested reconsideration of the decision by OPM, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Ms. O\u2019Connell appealed this denial to the Board. She argued that OPM\u2019s failure to counsel her regarding the disparate effect of withdrawing her deposits before or after October 1,1982, was unfair in light of her letter of February 22, 1985. She further argued that OPM\u2019s regulations are difficult to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) held that Ms. O\u2019Connell had presented the Board with no authority upon which it could reverse OPM\u2019s calculation of the interest required to make her redeposit. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>No. BN-0831-00-0202-I-1, slip op. at 5. Ms. O\u2019Connell petitioned the Board to reconsider the AJ\u2019s decision. The Board concluded that Ms. O\u2019Connell had presented no new, previously unavailable evidence, and that the AJ made no error of law or regulation that would affect the outcome of Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s appeal. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>No. CH-0752-00-0622-I-1, slip op. at 1. Accordingly, the Board denied Ms. O\u2019Connell\u2019s petition for review. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Ms. O\u2019Connell now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994). This court\u2019s scope of review over decisions of the Board is limited by statute. This court must affirm a decision of the Board unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation- having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2001); <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">We find that the Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in error. Interest due on a redeposit of a lump-sum refund is determined pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(e)(3) (2001), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-13\">The rate of interest is 4 percent a year through December 31, 1947, and 3 percent a year beginning January 1, 1948, through December 31, 1984. Thereafter, the rate of interest for any calendar year shall be equal to the overall average yield to the Fund during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury during such fiscal year under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>8348(c), (d), and (e) of this title, as determined by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Beginning January 1, 1985, the Department of the Treasury determined the variable rate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">Year Interest Rate</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH8\">1985 13.0%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8o\">1986 11.125%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4D\">1987 9.0%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATk\">1988 8.375%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-h\">1989 9.125%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A59\">1990 8.75%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADB\">1991 8.625%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIY\">1992 8.125%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUV\">1993 7.125%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">1994 6.25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AodH\">1995 7.0%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adl\">1996 6.875%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-I\">1997 6.875%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALH\">1998 6.75%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-36\">By way of an uncodified statute, Congress exempted the redeposits of one group of people from the application of these interest rates \u2014 former employees who filed applications for lump sum refunds prior to October 1,1982. Act of Oct. 15, 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-46, \u00a7 3\u00a9(1), 96 Stat. 1647, 1649, <em>amending </em>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-253, \u00a7 303(d)(1), 96 Stat. 763, 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-41\">Ms. O\u2019Connell did not file for a lump sum refund prior to October 1, 1982. She also has not pointed this Court to any authority, nor could we find any, that would allow OPM, the Board, or this Court to exempt her from the clear and unambiguous provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(e)(3) and the interest rates determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-42\">Assuming for the moment that OPM was aware prior to October 15,1982, of the impending change in the law, Ms. O\u2019Connell may be correct in arguing that OPM could have warned all former employees that if they wished to withdraw their retirement contributions but planned to return to government service some day that they might want to make any such withdrawal prior to October 1,1982, in order to obtain the benefit of the fixed 3% interest rate on redeposits. However, Ms. O\u2019Connell was not a former employee until October 29,1983; even if OPM had issued such a warning, she would not have received it. In any event, OPM\u2019s failure to warn her of an impending change in the law with respect to the withdrawal and redeposit of retirement contributions did not provide OPM, the Board, or this Court with the requisite legal authority to exempt Ms. O\u2019Connell from the explicit directives of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-44\">For these reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-45\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
