Hunter seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss his \u00a7 1983 action. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Hunter\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Hunter\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on November 16, 2001. Because Hunter failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\"> Because Hunter was not incarcerated when he noted his appeal, he does not benefit from <em>Houston v.
