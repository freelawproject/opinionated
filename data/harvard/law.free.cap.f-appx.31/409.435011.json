Because the facts are well-known to the parties, we do not repeat them here. Our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of Taimorian\u2019s motion arises under the old \u00a7 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The BIA correctly found that Taimorian\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely because he filed it more than ninety days after a final administrative decision was issued in his case. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(2). The exception to the statute of limitations for \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(c)(3)(h), does not apply because none of the evidence proffered by Taimorian shows that conditions in Iran have changed since his asylum claim was adjudicated. We must therefore affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Taimorian\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The Immigration Judge granted Taimorian voluntary departure within thirty days. This period will start to run upon the issuance of our mandate affirming the BIA\u2019s denial of Taimorian\u2019s motion. <em>See Contreras-Aragon v. INS, </em>852 F.2d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir.1988) (en banc) (holding that \u201cthe voluntary departure period does not expire until after our affirmance of the deportation order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 ('TIRIRA\u201d) has replaced \u00a7 106 with a new judicial review provision, IIRIRA \u00a7 242, codified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The old provision rather than the new provision applies in this case because deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997 (on June 13, 1995) and a final order of deportation was issued under \u00a7 241 of the INA after October 30, 1996 (on January 27, 1997). <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1); <em>Arrozal v. INS, </em>159 F.3d 429, 432 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
