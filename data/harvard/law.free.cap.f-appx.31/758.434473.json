Sweet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Judge), following his plea of guilty.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Carraballo contends that the District Court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court in its well-reasoned opinion of February 8, 2001. <em>United States v. Carraballo, </em>No. S12 98 Cr. 1316, 2001WL 111284 (S.D.N.Y.

California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
