We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The district court properly executed the terms of this Court\u2019s mandate, which prohibited it from awarding Wilborn past disability benefits. <em>See United States v. Kellington, </em>217 F.3d 1084, 1092 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that the rule of the mandate requires the district court to execute the terms of this Court\u2019s mandate). In addition, \u201cwhen ... the administrator construes a plan provision erroneously, the court should not itself decide whether benefits should be awarded but rather should remand to the administrator for it to make that decision under the plan, properly construed.\u201d <em>Saffle v. Sierra Pac. Power Co., </em>85 F.3d 455, 456 (9th Cir.1996). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Wilborn\u2019s motion to amend the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Wilborn\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs after considering the five <em>Hummed </em>factors. <em>See Hummell v. S.E. Rykoff &amp; Co., </em>634 F.2d 446, 452-53 (9th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">. In light of our holding, we do not consider Wilborn\u2019s ancillary claim that he is entitled to prejudgment interest on an award of retroactive disability benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
