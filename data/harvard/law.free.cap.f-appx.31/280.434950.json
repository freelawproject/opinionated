Hammond was convicted of five counts related to attempting to blow up an automated teller machine. Following his 1996 sentencing, counsel appealed the conviction. This court affirmed. <em>United States v. Hammond, </em>No. 96-4231 (4th Cir. Feb.11, 1997) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-24\">In November 2001, Hammond filed a notice of appeal from these convictions. He contends that he never received a copy of the appellate briefs or of a decision by this court; therefore, he believes that counsel did not pursue the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-25\">This court has already exercised its jurisdiction to review the final decision of the district court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1994), in ruling on Hammond\u2019s direct appeal. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(a) (West 2000). Even if we had not, Hammond\u2019s notice of appeal would be untimely. Fed. RApp. P. 4(b). The appeal periods defined in Rule 4 are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). Therefore, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
