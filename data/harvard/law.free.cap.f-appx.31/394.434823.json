See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b464-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-18\">Rafael Urena appeals his 135-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">Urena contends the district court erred by denying a minimal role adjustment pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s denial of a minor or minimal role adjustment, <em>see United States v. Ruelas, </em>106 F.3d 1416, 1419 (9th Cir.1997), and we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-22\">We conclude that Urena\u2019s role in the drug transaction cannot be viewed as minimal under \u00a7 3B1.2. <em>See United States v. Demers, </em>13 F.3d 1381, 1384 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201c[T]he touchstone of a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment is the defendant\u2019s relative culpability.\u201d). The record here reflects that Urena played an essential role in the drug transaction because he brought together the buyer and supplier of the cocaine; he was present at negotiations and key meetings; he was involved in the logistics of completing the deal; and he was to share an equal portion of the profits. <em>See United States v. Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1452 (9th Cir. 1991) (denying a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment where defendant located the source of cocaine, set the terms of the deal, arranged for the transaction to take place, and was entrusted with 50 kilograms of cocaine); <em>United States v. Flores-Payon, </em>942 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir.1991) (denying a \u00a7 3B1.2 adjustment where defendant attended negotiations and brought the drugs to the scene). Given these facts, the district court did not clearly err by denying Urena a minimal role adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b464-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
