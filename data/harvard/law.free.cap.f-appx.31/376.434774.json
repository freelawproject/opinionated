We reverse and remand for an evidentiary hearing with respect to the events surrounding the death of Holloway\u2019s jailhouse attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Holloway had one year from the date his conviction became final to file his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in federal district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Absent some form of tolling, his petition is untimely. In addition to 162 days of statutory tolling during the pendency of his state court habeas petition, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), Holloway contends that he is entitled to additional tolling as the result of his jailhouse lawyer\u2019s death. <em>See Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, 1288 (9th Cir.1997) (equitable tolling granted \u201cif \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time\u201d). A number of facts are critical to Holloway\u2019s claim, including, among others, the date on which his jailhouse lawyer died, Holloway\u2019s knowledge of the death, whether Holloway\u2019s access to his legal materials was otherwise impeded, and his efforts with respect to preparing his petition. Thus, we remand for further development of the record and consideration of the equitable tolling claim in view of the record. <em>See Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146, 1148 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (remand appropriate where there are \u201ccircumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition and declaration under which he would be entitled to a finding of ... equitable tolling\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-22\">.
