Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s determination that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum, and we must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 1998). We review de novo claims of due process violations in deportation proceedings. <em>Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-22\">Because the evidence does not compel the conclusion that the petitioners were persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground, the BIA\u2019s determination that the petitioners faded to establish eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Acewicz v. INS, </em>984 F.2d 1056, 1061-62 (9th Cir.1993). It follows that they failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-23\">Petitioners also contend that they were denied due process when the BIA cited a State Department report not part of the administrative record. Because petitioners failed to demonstrate substantial prejudice to their proceedings or that the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>come would have been different, their due process claim lacks merit. <em>See LaritaMartinez, </em>220 F.3d at 1095; <em>Acewicz, </em>984 F.2d at 1060-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b473-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
