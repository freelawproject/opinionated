We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Under the AEDPA, Morrison had until May 14, 1997, to file his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Absent equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, therefore, Morrison\u2019s petition filed November 8,1999, is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Morrison contends that the district court erred by not granting him equitable tolling for the period during which he was incarcerated outside of Montana and denied access to necessary legal materials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (concluding that when external forces, rather than the petitioner\u2019s lack of diligence, account for the failure to file a timely claim, equitable tolling may be appropriate). Because the district court did not have the benefit of our <em>en banc </em>decision in <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) (per curiam), and no evidentiary hearing was held, we reverse and remand to the district court for appropriate development of the record and factual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 1148 (determining that where it cannot be said that there are no circumstances consistent with petitioner\u2019s petition and declaration under which he would be entitled to equitable tolling, reversal is proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-15\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b460-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-13\">. We decline to consider additional issues raised by Morrison that were not certified for review. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1009, 120 S.Ct. 1281, 146 L.Ed.2d 228 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
