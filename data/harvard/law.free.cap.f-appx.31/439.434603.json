We have jurisdiction over these consolidated appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Agwe\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to support the loss amount resulting in the six-level sentence enhancement imposed by the district court pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Sl.l(b)(2). We review the factual findings underlying a sentencing decision for clear error, <em>see United States v. Jordan, </em>256 F.3d 922, 926 (9th Cir.2001), and deem Agwe\u2019s contention unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The record here shows that Agwe expressly stipulated to a loss amount of $2.5 million in connection with an oral plea agreement, and did not contest the $2.3 million loss amount attributed to him in the presentence report. Furthermore, the record also shows that Agwe made no objection to the corresponding sentence imposed by the district court. Accordingly, Agwe has waived his right to challenge this portion of his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Flores, </em>172 F.3d 695, 701 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. Assuming that Agwe has not waived his right to appeal this issue, the standard of review is plain error, due to his failure to object at sentencing. However, we do not see error, much less plain error, where the district court adopted a loss amount expressly stipulated to by Agwe and clearly calculated in the presentence report. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
