We \u25a0will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">John Vipond suffers from heart and breathing trouble and obesity. He was forty-eight years old as of his date last insured for social security disability. Vi-pond has past work experience as a dump truck driver, night maintenance man and as a clerk. He was laid off from his last job in 1991. After developing chest pains in July 1995, Vipond was diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction. On July 13, 1995, Dr. Mario Poon performed a balloon angioplasty on Vipond\u2019s left anteri- or descending coronary artery. Vipond was released from the hospital on July 14, 1995. In August 1995, Dr. Poon found Vipond was \u201cdoing very well\u201d \u2014 displaying no symptoms of angina or congestive heart failure. In February 1996, Dr. Poon told Vipond\u2019s family physician, Dr. John Meloy, that from a cardiac standpoint Vipond was doing very well.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">In 1997, two doctors made functional capacity assessments for the state agency in charge of determining disability. Dr. Sharon Wander reviewed Vipond\u2019s medical records and performed a residual functional capacity assessment, finding Vipond could perform medium work. Dr. Rita Aneja reviewed the medical evidence and also found Vipond could perform medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">For some time, Vipond complained of shortness of breath and pain to Dr. Meloy. In February and March 1998, Dr. Meloy opined that Vipond was totally and permanently disabled from gainful employment. But over the course of his treatment, Dr. Meloy\u2019s notes reflect that Vipond was generally normal. Dr. Meloy did specifically find Vipond suffered from shortness of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">Vipond filed an application for disability benefits in September 1997 alleging an onset date of October 18, 1991. The Administrative Law Judge found Vipond is limited to exertionally light jobs with a sit/stand option. A vocational expert testified that approximately five million such jobs exist in the national economy with limited climbing, balancing or stooping; no concentrated exposure to dust, fumes, chemicals or high humidity; no concentrated exposure to heights or dangerous machinery, that a person with Vipond\u2019s age, education and work experience could do. Therefore, the ALJ found Vipond is not disabled under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f) (1985). The District Court affirmed the ALJ, finding that substantial evidence in the record supported the ALJ\u2019s decision. Vipond appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-17\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s final decision to deny disability on a substantial evidence basis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1991). Substantial evidence has been defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>1999) (citations omitted). Vipond claims the ALJ erred in denying disability despite Dr. Meloy\u2019s opinion. But an ALJ is bound to give a treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight only when it is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) (1991). The ALJ found Dr. Meloy\u2019s opinion contrary to the great weight of the evidence, including the doctor\u2019s own treatment notes. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. Vi-pond claims the ALJ erred by not giving sufficient weight to his subjective complaints. The ALJ properly weighed the evidence in the record under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529 (1991) and found Vipond not fully credible. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding. Finally, Vipond claims the ALJ erred by finding he could do light work. But the ALJ in fact found Vipond could do only limited light work, as illustrated in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert. Substantial evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s finding Vipond can do limited light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
