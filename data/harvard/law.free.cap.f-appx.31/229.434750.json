The Appellees have moved to dismiss Floyd\u2019s appeal as untimely. We grant the Appellees\u2019 motion and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Floyd\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-22\">Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Floyd\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on November 27, 2001. Because Floyd failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
