We remanded No. 01-6887 to the district court for a determination of whether Cox was entitled to have the period to note an appeal reopened under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6) based on his assertion that he did not receive timely notice of the order in question. The district court denied relief under Rule 4(a)(6), and Cox has noted an appeal from that order as well, which is the subject of No. 01-7908. For the following reasons, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Cox\u2019s appeal No. 01-6887 from the denial of his \u00a7 1983 action and affirm the denial of his Rule 4(a)(6) motion in No. 01-7908.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">With respect to the dismissal of Cox\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action, parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. </em>Director, <em>Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 8, 2000, and Cox\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on May 24, 2001. As a result, Cox\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Although we remanded this appeal to the district court for a determination whether Cox was entitled to a reopening of the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6), the district court properly denied relief under that provision because Cox failed to apprise the district court of a change of address. <em>See Benavides v. Bureau of Prisons, </em>79 F.3d 1211, 1214 (D.C.Cir.1996). Accordingly, because Cox\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely, and he is ineligible to have the period for noting an appeal reopened, we grant the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Cox\u2019s appeal in No. 01-6887 for lack of jurisdiction and affirm in No. 01-7908 the district court\u2019s order denying relief under Rule 4(a)(6) on remand. Additionally, we grant the motion to dismiss filed in No. 01-7908 by Appellees West Columbia Police Department and Lexington County Jail. Finally, while we grant Cox\u2019s motion to amend his request for sanctions, we deny Cox\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for general relief and for sanctions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">No. <em>01-6887 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">No. <em>01-7908 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
