NELSON, NOONAN and HAWKINS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-22\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b548-18\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-19\">Appellant (\u201cKey\u201d) challenges the decisions of the district court with respect to liability and damages after a bench trial in Key\u2019s Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b) suit. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We find that the district court\u2019s award of $152,246 is amply supported by the record. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">The district court\u2019s findings of fact, including findings made in support of an award for damages, are reviewed for clear error. <em>Koirala v. Thai Airways Int\u2019l. Ltd., </em>126 F.3d 1205, 1213 (9th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s award of damages is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Security Farms v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>124 F.3d 999, 1015 (9th Cir.1997). The trial court\u2019s computation of damages is a finding of fact reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Simeonoff v. Hiner, </em>249 F.3d 883, 893 (9th Cir.2001). The district court has discretion to select the formula most appropriate to compensate the injured party. <em>Marsu v. Walt Disney Co., </em>185 F.3d 932, 938 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">We find Key\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in finding that the government was not liable for some of Key\u2019s injuries and that it improperly limited damages for other injuries are without merit. The district court\u2019s method of calculation of damages for Key\u2019s cervical injury is supported by the record. The district court\u2019s finding that the government was not liable for Key\u2019s lumbar injury is likewise supported by the record. While there was conflicting testimony at trial, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>cannot say that the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous or that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We find Key\u2019s other assertions of error by the district court, including claims of deviation from the pre-trial order, improper characterization of Key\u2019s medical experts, failure to award future medical expenses, limiting in time or apportioning Key\u2019s damage award, and inferences of prejudice on the part of the district court to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
