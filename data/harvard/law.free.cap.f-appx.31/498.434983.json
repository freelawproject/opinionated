We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-18\">We will affirm an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a bankruptcy case unless an abuse of discretion or an erroneous application of the law is shown. <em>See In re Jastrem, </em>253 F.3d 438, 442 (9th Cir.2001). We therefore will not reverse an award of attorney\u2019s fees unless we have a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed clear error in the conclusion it reached after weighing all of the relevant facts. <em>See In re Auto Parts Club, Inc., </em>211 B.R. 29, 32 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1997). We review findings of fact underlying the court\u2019s decision for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>See Ferland v. Conrad Credit Corp., </em>244 F.3d 1145, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">In making its fee determinations, it is sufficient for the district court to analyze a sampling of the billing statements submitted for review. <em>See In re Maruko, Inc., </em>160 B.R. 633, 641-42 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1993) (citation omitted) (noting that the district court does not need to \u201ctrack down every entry\u201d). An attorney requesting a fee award bears the burden of establishing that his services were actual, necessary, and reasonable as required by \u00a7 330. <em>See In re Xebec, </em>147 B.R. 518, 524 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-22\">B &amp; M claims that the district court made clearly erroneous findings of fact regarding Committee misconduct. A review of the district court\u2019s opinion shows that while the district court may have characterized some Committee members as having a conflict of interest, its views of the Committee were not findings of fact on which its fee determinations were based. Although consideration of issues such as the potential self-interest of Committee members may have \u201cinitially persuaded the court to disallow the entire expense,\u201d its final fee determinations were based on an analysis of which attorney\u2019s fees it deemed to be reasonable and necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>under \u00a7 330. B <em>&amp; </em>M\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s legal determinations were based on erroneous findings as to Committee misconduct is thus without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">B <em>&amp; </em>M contends that the district court erred by applying the \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d standard utilized under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503 of the Bankruptcy Code, rather than the reasonable and necessary standard under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330, in making its fee determinations. Although the district court does cite to a case which involves \u00a7 503 in its discussion, a review of the court\u2019s Memorandum Decision and of the language utilized by the district court in reducing the fee award clearly demonstrates that the district court properly based its decision on the reasonable and necessary standard under \u00a7 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">B &amp; M contends that the district court abused its discretion by reducing the amount of fees and expenses awarded to B <em>&amp; </em>M based on its determination that they were not reasonable and necessary as required under \u00a7 330. B &amp; M also claims that the district court improperly utilized a \u201cmeat-axe\u201d approach, rather than the lodestar method, in making these reductions. Starting the fee determination process with the lodestar method may be customary, but it is not mandated in all cases. <em>See Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Comm. v. Puget Sound Plywood, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1991). While across-the-board or percentage based cuts are permitted in certain circumstances, <em>see Ferland, </em>244 F.3d at 1150 (citations omitted), a review of the district court\u2019s decision reveals that such across-the-board cuts were not implemented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">B <em>&amp; </em>M provided the district court with lodestar figures for its fees based on the hours it had expended and variable rates it had charged in its representation of the Committee. From this amount, the district court made specific deductions in specific categories of requested fees. In fact, the district court in this case explicitly declined to implement an across-the-board 75% reduction as requested by the SEC. Further, the district court disallowed only those expenses and fees that it determined to be unreasonable and unnecessary under Section 330, and in so doing, provided explanations and legal support for each of the deductions. <em>Compare Ferland, </em>244 F.3d at 1149 (finding an abuse of discretion where district court did not \u201cset forth a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for choosing a given [] reduction.\u201d). The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in reducing the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded to B &amp; M.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
