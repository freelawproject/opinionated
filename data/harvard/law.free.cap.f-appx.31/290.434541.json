Benjamin challenges the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the allegedly illegal investigatory stop of his vehicle. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Benjamin contends that the information provided to the officers was not sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to support the stop of his vehicle. We disagree. Although an anonymous tip, by itself, is not sufficient to form the basis for an investigative stop under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), \u201cthere are situations in which an anonymous tip, suitably corroborated, exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (citing <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-13\">Here, in addition to the anonymous tip, the officers had information which had been provided by Benjamin\u2019s girlfriend, Ms. Walker. Benjamin argues that her statement was not reliable because she provided the information out of anger or to get revenge on Benjamin. However, some of the information provided by Ms. Walker was consistent with the officer\u2019s knowledge. Also, because Ms. Walker provided the information in person, the officer had the opportunity to judge her credibility, and Ms. Walker could have been held accountable if she had made false accusations to the officer. As in <em>United States v. Christmas, </em>222 F.3d 141 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1098, 121 S.Ct. 830, 148 L.Ed.2d 712 (2001), we find that \u201cthese factors make the information provided in this case more trustworthy and reliable than the anonymous tip at issue in <em>J.L.\u201d Id. </em>at 144; <em>see United States v. Salazar, </em>945 F.2d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that \u201cface-to-face informant must, as a general matter, be thought more rehable than an anonymous telephone tipster\u201d); <em>United States v. Gorin, </em>564 F.2d 159, 160-61 (4th Cir.1977) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-14\">We find no error by the district court in finding that, based on the two tips provided to officers \u2014 corroborated as they were by each other and by the officers\u2019 independent knowledge and further corroboration \u2014 there was sufficient articulable suspicion to stop Benjamin\u2019s vehicle. <em>See United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992) (providing standard). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Benjamin\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the investigatory stop. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
