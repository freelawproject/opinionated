Upon our <em>de novo </em>review of the record, <em>see Bluestein &amp; Sander v. Chicago Ins. Co., </em>276 F.3d 119, 121 (2d Cir.2002), we agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff failed to create a triable issue of fact regarding the defendant\u2019s motive in dismissing her shortly after she announced her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">Because the defendant has proffered a non-discriminatory reason for terminating the plaintiff \u2014 professional inadequacy \u2014 it is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff can \u201cpoint to evidence that reasonably supports a finding of prohibited discrimination.\u201d <em>James v. New York Racing Assoc., </em>233 F.3d 149, 154 (2d Cir.2000). The evidence submitted by the plaintiff, that she suffered an adverse employment action after her announcement of pregnancy and that her supervisor was also pregnant when the plaintiff was terminated, is insufficient to support a jury finding in her favor, particularly in light of the evidence proffered by the defendant as to the causes and course of her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
