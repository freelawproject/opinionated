Chase and Wright claimed that the prison diet was in violation of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s bar against cruel and unusual punishment. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Chase v. Maryland Correction, </em>No. CA-00-1509-CCB (D. Md. filed Sept. 24, 2001; entered Sept. 25, 2001). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
