Ware appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Ware contends that the district court abused its discretion by qualifying Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Gaasche as an expert witness. This court repeatedly has upheld the admission of law enforcement officers\u2019 expert opinion testimony in drug trafficking cases. <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 589 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <em>United States v. Safari, </em>849 F.2d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1988) (upholding admission of expert testimony on the size of an average dose of heroin because, \u201c[wjhile not usurping the function of the jury, this testimony aided the jury during its deliberations, for most laymen are not familiar with the quantity, purity, and dosage units of heroin\u201d)). The district court properly rejected Ware\u2019s contention that the charged conduct was garden variety drug activity that did not require expert testimony to aid the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Ware also argues that the district court erred by allowing Gaasche to testify to factual matters relating to the charges against Ware. Ware did not object to Gaasche\u2019s testimony on this ground below, and we conclude that the district court\u2019s allowance of Gaasche\u2019s factual testimony does not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">Ware next contends that his life sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ware was charged in a superseding indictment with conspiracy involving \u201cfive kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine hydrochloride\u201d and \u201c50 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base.\u201d Testimony offered by government witnesses accounted for quantities in excess of the amounts charged in the indictment. The jury was instructed that a guilty verdict only could be based upon a unanimous finding that Ware distributed or possessed for distribution five kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride, or fifty grams of cocaine base, or both. The jury returned a guilty verdict. Juries are presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206-07, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). Because the jury found Ware guilty of the charged crime, and that crime had a statutory maximum sentence of life, Ware\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Apprendi </em>Ware\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) similarly is merit-less. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Ware\u2019s conviction and sentence are accordingly affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
