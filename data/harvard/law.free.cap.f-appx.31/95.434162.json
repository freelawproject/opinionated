(J.A. 129-30). Hill\u2019s attorney has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raises the following issues, whether: (1) Hill\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary; (2) the district court had jurisdiction to accept the guilty plea for an unspecified amount of cocaine; (3) Hill\u2019s sentence is invalid in light of <em>Apprendi v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (4) Hill's sentence was properly enhanced under the Sentencing Guidelines for use of a weapon and obstruction of justice. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">First, the record reveals that Hill\u2019s plea of guilty was knowing and voluntary and that the district court did not commit reversible error in conducting its Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy with him. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 117 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Second, Hill argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea to aiding and abetting the distribution of an unspecified amount of cocaine. This claim fails under this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Dinnall, </em>269 F.3d 418, 424 (4th Cir.2001). In <em>Dinnall </em>we upheld the defendant\u2019s guilty plea conviction to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of cocaine base but remanded for the district court to resentence Dinnall within the twenty-year statutory maximum conviction under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>Id. </em>at 420-24. Thus, in the instant case, the district court had jurisdiction to accept Hill\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Third, we decline Hill\u2019s invitation to adopt the reasoning in <em>United States v. Flowal, </em>234 F.3d 932 (6th Cir.2000), in which the Sixth Circuit suggested that <em>Apprendi </em>is implicated whenever a factual finding exposes a defendant to a higher sentence. <em>Flowal </em>is inconsistent with the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion itself, and we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not require the government to submit to a jury facts relevant to sentence enhancements that do not extend the sentence beyond the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201-02 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Finally, Hill argues that his sentencing enhancements for possession of a dangerous weapon under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2000) and for obstruction of justice under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 were erroneous. Because Hill failed to object to these enhancements in the district court, we review the claims only for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Cedelle, </em>89 F.3d 181, 184-86 (4th Cir.1996). Testimony at the sentencing hearing reveals that Hill did carry a nine-millimeter pistol during at least one drug transaction and that he threatened the life of a witness who cooperated with the government. Accordingly, we find that both enhancements were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">We have examined the entire record <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in this case in accordance with the requirements of Anders, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\"> This review includes the issues raised in Hill's supplemental pro se informal briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
