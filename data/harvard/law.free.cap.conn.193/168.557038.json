The plaintiff, James McAllister, the former personnel director of the city of Waterbury, brought this action in mandamus to compel the defendants, the members of the Waterbury civil service commission (commission), to reinstate him to his position as personnel director. The trial court denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition, whereupon the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the record on appeal disclose the following. The plaintiff held the position of personnel director of the city of Waterbury from August 20, 1979 to July 20, 1981. On July 20, 1981, the mayor terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment because the mayor had determined that the plaintiff was not in compliance with the city\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>residency requirement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, contending that the mayor had no authority to fire him, requested a hearing before the civil service commission, pursuant to \u00a7 203 of the Waterbury City Charter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which he claimed provided the only proper procedure for the removal of a personnel director from office. The commission treated the hearing as an appeal from the mayor\u2019s decision and, after hearing conflicting testimony on the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s residency, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>the plaintiffs request for relief. The commission concluded \u201cthat based on the [evidence] presented there was [an] insufficient finding that residency was established . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The plaintiff then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, claiming a right to reinstatement on the grounds that the mayor had no authority to remove him from office and that the post-termination hearing before the commission did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 203. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claim and ruled that (1) the plaintiff could not challenge the propriety of his discharge by the mayor in this action against the civil service commission; (2) the plaintiff did not have a clear legal right to reinstatement because he had not proven that he was a Waterbury resident; and (3) the plaintiff was not in fact a Waterbury resident and therefore was guilty of unclean hands and not entitled to invoke the remedial jurisdiction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred (1) in concluding that he did not have a clear legal right to reinstatement; and (2) in considering evidence on the issue of the plaintiffs residence. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">As we have recently reaffirmed, \u201c \u2018[m]andamus is an extraordinary remedy. It is designed to enforce a plain positive duty. The writ will issue only when the person against whom it is directed is under a clear legal obligation to perform the act compelled and the party seeking the writ has a clear legal right to the performance.\u2019 <em>West Hartford Taxpayers Assn. </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>190 Conn. 736, 740, 462 A.2d 379 (1983). See <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Middlebury Conservation Commission, </em>187 Conn. 476, 481, 447 A.2d 1 (1982); <em>Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 513, 518, 356 A.2d 109 (1975).\u201d <em>Cheshire Taxpayers\u2019 Action Committee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Guilford, </em>193 Conn. 1, 5, 474 A.2d 97 (1984). \u201cSince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>mandamus neither gives nor defines rights which one does not already have, it cannot, and does not, act upon a doubtful and contested right. <em>Boyko </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>147 Conn. 183, 186, 158 A.2d 253 [1960].\u201d <em>Gerrity </em>v. <em>Bisciglia, </em>178 Conn. 235, 238-39, 423 A.2d 871 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In this case, the plaintiff claims that \u00a7 203<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Waterbury City Charter, which provides in part that \u201c[t]he director of personnel may be removed <em>only </em>for misfeasance, nonfeasance, or partisan activity upon notice in writing of the reason for such removal and an opportunity to be heard in his own defense before the civil service commission\u201d (emphasis added), sets forth the exclusive procedure for discharging the city\u2019s personnel director. The plaintiff argues, therefore, that he had a clear legal right to retain his position unless and until he was properly discharged in accordance with the procedure set forth in \u00a7 203. The plaintiff argues further that the post-termination hearing did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 203 because the defendants placed the burden of proof on him to prove residency, rather than requiring the city, as the moving party, to prove his nonresidency. Finally, the plaintiff argues that because the essence of his claim is procedural, the substantive question of whether he was a bona fide resident of the city of Waterbury was not properly before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The defendants dispute the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the city charter. They claim that \u00a7 203 pertains only to removals for misfeasance, nonfeasance and partisan activity, and not to removals for noncompliance with the city\u2019s residency requirement. They claim further that \u00a7 153<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the charter, which provides in part that \u201c[i]t shall be the duty of the mayor to make cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>tain that all employees comply with [the residency requirement]\u201d vests the mayor with authority to discharge the personnel director on that ground. Further, the defendants maintain that the plaintiff did receive a hearing before the civil service commission, as required by \u00a7 203, and that the plaintiff was twice proven not to be a Waterbury resident\u2014once before the civil service commission and again before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Under these circumstances, the plaintiffs right to reinstatement is far from clear. While there is a serious question concerning the mayor\u2019s power to terminate the plaintiffs employment, the plaintiff has not proven his claim that the defendants were under a plain positive duty to disregard the mayor\u2019s action. Had the plaintiff wished to contest his discharge by the mayor, he could have sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to prevent the mayor from acting under the purported authority of \u00a7 153. This the plaintiff did not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Moreover, the plaintiff\u2019s right to reinstatement is clouded by the conflicting evidence as to his residency. We disagree with the plaintiff that in considering his petition for an extraordinary writ of mandamus compelling his reinstatement to a position that plainly requires residency within the city of Waterbury, the trial court was required to ignore the substantial factual dispute concerning the plaintiff\u2019s residency. Because the plaintiff did not prove his clear legal right to reinstatement, the trial court did not err in denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\"> Section 153 of the Waterbury City Charter provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u201cAny person hired subsequent to January 1,1977, by the City of Waterbury to a position of city employment, whether classified or unclassified,</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">(a) Shall be a bona fide resident of the City of Waterbury; or</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">(b) Shall become a bona fide resident of the City of Waterbury within six (6) months of the date when he or she becomes a permanent employee of the City of Waterbury;</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">and shall remain a bona fide resident during the entire duration of his or her employment. For purposes of this section, the term \u2018City of Waterbury,\u2019 when such term is used to mean the city as employer, shall also include any city departments, including the department of education, office, board, or agency hiring employees. A bona fide resident, for purposes of this section, is a person having permanent domicile within the city, which domicile has not been adopted with the intention of thereafter, in fact, taking up or claiming a residence outside of the city limits. It shall be the duty of the mayor to make certain that all employees comply with this section. The hiring of any employee who fails to comply with the provisions of this section shall be void and said employee shall be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-11\"> Section 203 of the Waterbury City Charter provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">\u201cThe civil service commission shall be administered by a properly qualified person appointed under the rule of three and referred to as director of personnel. Said director of personnel shall become a member of the classified service except for the removal provisions specified herein. The salary of the director of personnel shall be fixed by the civil service commission, subject to the approval of the board of finance. The director of personnel may be removed only for misfeasance, nonfeasance, or partisan activity upon notice in writing of the reason for such removal and an opportunity to be heard in his own defense before the civil service commission and upon a majority vote of the full commission. A director of personnel so removed may appeal the decision of the civil service commission to the board of aldermen. The board of aldermen may reverse such decision of the civil service commission provided at least ten aldermen vote in favor of said reversal. The director of personnel shall direct and supervise the administrative work of the commission, and shall perform such other functions as maybe required of him by the commission.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-8\"> The full text of \u00a7 203 of the Waterbury City Charter is set forth at footnote 2, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\"> The full text of \u00a7 153 of the Waterbury City Charter is set forth at footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
