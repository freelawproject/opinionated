Our conclusion is that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The plaintiff, George Magnan, brought suit against his former employer of thirteen years, The Anaconda Company (hereinafter Anaconda), alleging in the first count of his amended complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he had been discharged in breach of an implied covenant of good faith, and in the second count, that his discharge was in retaliation for his refusal to sign a statement he claimed to be untrue. The jury returned a verdict for Magnan on the first count and for Anaconda on the second count. Anaconda filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied. Thereafter, Anaconda filed this appeal, claiming that the court erred in submitting the first count to the jury because (1) Connecticut law does not recognize the good faith limitation on the power to discharge an at-will employee, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The jury could have reasonably found the following facts: During the summer of 1979, Anaconda was informed that certain managerial employees were engaging in illegal activities at the Ansonia plant. Paul A. Palmer, the employee relations manager, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Charles F. Ebert, a security investigator, were requested to investigate in order to ascertain whether managerial employees were involved, and if so how many. The investigation focused upon James DellaVolpe, the yard foreman, and Jerry Host, the chief financial officer. Ebert had been told that DellaVolpe had been providing certain managerial employees with company tools, lumber, and gas, all at company expense. Palmer and Ebert also discovered that a refrigerator originally purchased by Anaconda for use in Anaconda\u2019s company store had been located at Host\u2019s former residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Marcel J. Laliberte, a purchasing agent for Anaconda and the original custodian of the refrigerator, told Palmer and Ebert that sometime in February, 1978, DellaVolpe had informed Laliberte that the refrigerator was needed in the boiler house.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Laliberte further stated that on the following day DellaVolpe and the plaintiff Magnan, who was working temporarily in the yard under DellaVolpe\u2019s supervision, came to the company store and picked up the refrigerator. Laliberte did not know, however, where the refrigerator was eventually delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Aware that they would need Magnan\u2019s cooperation in order to establish DellaVolpe\u2019s complicity in the theft of the refrigerator, Palmer and Ebert approached Mag-nan on July 20, 1979, and questioned him concerning its removal. Thereafter, on July 23, Palmer requested that Magnan sign a statement admitting his own complicity in the theft of the refrigerator and implicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>DellaVolpe. Palmer, who had drawn up the statement, claimed that the statement was merely a summary of what Magnan had told Palmer and Ebert three days earlier. Magnan disagreed, however, and refused to sign the statement, even though he was told he would not be prosecuted, because he believed the statement did not accurately reflect what he had told Palmer and Ebert.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was suspended from work on July 27 for refusing to sign the statement, and was discharged on August 16, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">For four centuries, and perhaps longer, the law governing the relationship between employer and employee has undergone many revisions. In the sixteenth century a statute enacted in England prohibited an employer from discharging an employee \u201cunless it be for some reasonable and sufficient cause or matter . . . .\u201d Statute of Labourers, 5 Eliz. C. 4 (1562) reprinted in 6 Pickering\u2019s Statutes 159-60 (1763).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the statute was eventually repealed, English courts continued to hold that a contract of employment for an indefinite duration was presumptively for a term of one year; see 1 Blackstone, Commentaries 335 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>(1832); 25 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England 480-81 (3d Ed. 1958); and permitted the employee to maintain a cause of action for breach of the employment contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Initial reception of the English rule was unsettled in America,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but by the late nineteenth century a vast majority of jurisdictions, relying upon a \u201cbusy and perhaps careless . . . American treatise writer,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had adopted the position that an employment contract of indefinite duration was terminable at the will of either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>party \u201cfor good cause, for no cause or even for cause morally wrong . . . <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Western &amp; Atlantic R. Co., </em>81 Tenn. 507, 519-20 (1884), overruled on other grounds, <em>Hutton </em>v. <em>Watters, </em>132 Tenn. 527, 179 S.W. 134 (1915). The rule, fostered in part by the predominant laissez-faire philosophy of the period, reserved to the employer absolute power to dismiss the employee, and was considered necessary to preserve the autonomy of managerial discretion in the work place and the freedom of the parties to make their own contract. See <em>Coppage </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>236 U.S. 1, 10, 35 S. Ct. 240, 59 L. Ed. 441 (1915); <em>Adair </em>v. <em>United States, </em>208 U.S. 161, 28 S. Ct. 277, 52 L. Ed. 436 (1908); <em>Somers </em>v. <em>Cooley Chevrolet Co., </em>146 Conn. 627, 629, 153 A.2d 426 (1959); <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>142 Conn. 734, 736, 118 A.2d 316 (1955); <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Godfrey, </em>119 Conn. 622, 627, 178 A. 655 (1935); see generally Feinman, \u201cThe Development of the Employment at Will Rule,\u201d 20 Amer. J. Leg. Hist. 118 (1976); Blades, \u201cEmployment at Will vs. Individual Freedom: On limiting the Abusive Exercise of Employer Power,\u201d 67 Colum. L. Rev. 1404 (1967); note, \u201cProtecting at Will Employees Against Wrongful Discharge: The Duty to Terminate Only in Good Faith,\u201d 93 Harv. L. Rev. 1816 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In more recent years we have witnessed substantial erosion of the employment at will rule. Congress, recognizing that most individual employees are powerless to demand a term contract,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has protected the right of employees \u201cto engage in . . . concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection . . . .\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. Collective bargaining agreements ordinarily contain provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>prohibiting dismissal without \u201ccause\u201d or \u201cjust cause\u201d which now serve to protect a significant portion of the work force from groundless dismissal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Government employees similarly enjoy protection from arbitrary discharge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Congress has also enacted statutes prohibiting employers from dismissing employees in retaliation for reporting employer activity in contravention of specific statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Many state statutes also restrict the employer\u2019s right to exercise a contractual power to dismiss an employee.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">For those employees not protected by collective bargaining agreements, civil service statutes or other laws, the courts have occasionally found an implied promise to discharge only for cause in the circumstances of particular employment relationships. Sometimes the promise has been found in the representations contained in an employee relations manual or handbook.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In appropriate circumstances, such an agreement may arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>when an employee, in reliance on an implied representation that the position will not arbitrarily be terminated, leaves his current employment, or otherwise acts in reasonable and significant reliance on the representation. These illustrations are not intended to encompass all of the situations in which an employment contract may be found not to be terminable at will. A majority of courts\u2014including this one\u2014have also approved a common law cause of action in tort for discharges \u201cwhere the discharge contravenes a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 474, 427 A.2d 385 (1980).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Tameny </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>27 Cal. 3d 167, 164 Cal. Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330 (1980); <em>Geary </em>v. <em>United States Steel Corporation, </em>456 Pa. 171, 319 A.2d 174 (1974); <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Frito-Lay, Inc., </em>95 Wis. 2d 372, 290 N.W.2d 536 (1980); see generally note, \u201cProtecting Employees at Will Against Wrongful Discharge: The Public Policy Exception,\u201d 96 Harv. L. Rev. 1931 (1983); Weiss, \u201cState by State: Chipping Away at Employment at Will,\u201d National L.J., Jan. 18, 1982, p. 26. (Twenty-two of the thirty states surveyed approve of the wrongful discharge tort). In the present case we are asked to adopt another emerging theory that limits the employer\u2019s right to discharge an at-will employee: the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing has been applied by this court in a variety of contractual relationships, including: leases; <em>Central New Haven Development Corporation </em>v. <em>La Crepe, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 212, 413 A.2d 840 (1979); insurance contracts; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Factory Mutual Liberty Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 156, 159, 179 A. 842 (1935); <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>117 Conn. 147, 155, 167 A. 180 (1933); cf. <em>Grand Sheet Metal Products Co. </em>v. <em>Protection Mutual Ins. Co., </em>34 Conn. Sup. 46, 375 A.2d 428 (1977) (tortious breach of covenant of good faith); and construction contracts with provisions making payment conditional upon presentation of the architect\u2019s or engineer\u2019s certificate. See <em>Grenier </em>v. <em>Compratt Construction Co., </em>189 Conn. 144, 148, 454 A.2d 1289 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Restatement (Second) of Contracts similarly recognizes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in every contract without limitation. See 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 205 (1979); see also General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-203. \u201cGood faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party . ...\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 205, comment a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>(1979) ; see also <em>Clover Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Austin Co., </em>101 Conn. 208, 214, 125 A. 646 (1924); see generally Holmes, \u201cIs There Life After Gilmore\u2019s Death of Contract? \u2014 Inductions from A Study of Commercial Good Faith in First-Party Insurance Contracts,\u201d 65 Cornell L. Rev. 330 (1980) ; Burton, \u201cBreach of Contract and the Common Law Duty to Perform in Good Faith,\u201d 94 Harv. L. Rev. 369 (1980). Essentially it is a rule of construction designed to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties as they presumably intended. The principle, therefore, cannot be applied to achieve a result contrary to the clearly expressed terms of a contract, unless, possibly, those terms are contrary to public policy. See <em>VTR, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>303 F. Sup. 773 (S.D.N.Y. 1969); 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 564, (1960); 11 Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. Jaeger) \u00a7 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The plaintiff contends that the good faith principle is applicable to the termination of an employment contract as well as to its performance and subjects the employer to liability whenever an employee is discharged without just cause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This position, of course, would write into every hiring of indefinite duration a provision requiring good cause for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The defendant maintains that the concept of good faith is too amorphous, permitting juries to police managerial decisions concerning control over the workforce guided by vague concepts of public morality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>rather than principles of law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This would result, it is claimed, in numerous lawsuits and would impair the exercise of managerial discretion. At least two states have declared that \u201c[ijmposing a good faith duty to terminate would unduly restrict an employer\u2019s discretion in managing the work force.\u201d <em>Brockmeyer </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>113 Wis. 2d 561, 569, 335 N.W.2d 834 (1983); see <em>Parnar </em>v. <em>Americana Hotels, Inc., </em>652 P.2d 625 (Hawaii 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The position we adopt lies somewhere between those of the parties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> While we see no reason to exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>employment contracts from the implication of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contractual relationship, we do not believe that this principle should be applied to transform a contract of employment terminable at the will of either party into one terminable only at the will of the employee or for just cause. We have previously acknowledged \u201cthat courts should not lightly intervene to impair the exercise of management discretion or to foment unwarranted litigation.\u201d <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 477, 427 A.2d 385 (1980). At the same time we have declared that the many employees without bargaining power to obtain employment for a definite term are entitled to judicial protection when the cause for dismissal is derived from some important violation of public policy. Id., 480. In <em>Sheets </em>our discussion was limited to the tort claim of wrongful discharge of an employee in retaliation for his reporting to his employer deviations from food quality standards which rendered the labels placed upon his employer\u2019s products false or misleading in violation of the Connecticut Uniform Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, General Statutes \u00a7 19-222. Id., 473. It was, therefore, unnecessary to consider the alternative contractual claim based upon breach of an implied condition of the employment agreement. Id., 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The Massachusetts courts have applied the good faith and fair dealing doctrine to find a breach of contract where the discharge was for a reason contrary to public policy, as in <em>Sheets, </em>and also, despite the absence of any such improper motivation, where the termination has deprived the employee of benefits attributable to past services. <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 431 N.E.2d 908 (1982); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21 (1981); <em>Siles </em>v. <em>Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>13 Mass. App. 354, 433 N.E.2d 103, further appellate review denied, 386 Mass. 1103, 440 N.E.2d 1176 (1982). Acceptance of the good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>faith principle in the context of employment, however, has not meant that only discharges for good cause are justifiable. \u201c[T]he absence of good cause to discharge an employee does not alone give rise to an enforceable claim for breach of a condition of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>supra, 303.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> As currently applied to employment contracts in Massachusetts, a breach of good faith implies an overreach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>ing upon the part of the employer by taking advantage of its superior bargaining power and depriving the employee of \u201ccompensation that is clearly identifiable and is related to the employee\u2019s past service.\u201d <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>supra, 304; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Youth Development Program, Inc., </em>390 Mass. 652, 459 N.E.2d 453 (1983); <em>Maddaloni </em>v. <em>Western Massachusetts Bus Lines, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 877, 438 N.E.2d 351 (1982); <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>supra, 29; <em>Siles </em>v. <em>Travenol Laboratories, Inc., </em>supra.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Although we do not disapprove of the application of the good faith principle to contracts of employment in the restricted manner illustrated by the Massachusetts cases, an issue not presently before us, we limit ourselves to the conclusion that a breach of such an implied covenant cannot be predicated simply upon the absence of good cause for a discharge. We decline the invitation of the plaintiff to transform the requirement of good faith into an implied condition that an employee may be dismissed only for good cause. To hold otherwise would render the court a bargaining agent for every employee not protected by statute or collective bargaining agreement, including employees whom congress has specifically excluded from the protection of the National Labor Relations Act, such as those in management positions. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Yeshiva University, </em>444 U.S. 672, 100 S. Ct. 856, 63 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1980). The complexity of the multifarious employment relationships militates against the establishment of the good cause standard for discharge to govern all at will employment relationships. See St. Antoine, \u201cYou\u2019re Fired!,\u201d 10 Human Rights 32, 36-53 (1982); Summers, \u201cIndividual Protection Against Unjust Dismissal: Time for a Statute,\u201d 62 Va. L. Rev. 481 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Whether we should return to the earlier common law conception of employment as a status not dissoluble at will is an issue which has received legislative attention. See H.B. No. 5179, 1974 Sess.; see generally Creo, \u201cArbitration of Nonunion Employees\u2019 Discharge Cases,\u201d Barrister 35, 37 (Winter 1984) (setting forth proposed state legislation). What categories of employment should be given such protection and what criteria should determine whether there exists good cause for a discharge are questions which the General Assembly may deal with more comprehensively than the courts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Although we endorse the applicability of the good faith and fair dealing principle to employment contracts, its essence is the fulfillment of the reasonable expectations of the parties. Where employment is clearly terminable at will, a party cannot ordinarily be deemed to lack good faith in exercising this contractual right. Like other contract provisions, which are unenforceable when violative of public policy, the right to discharge at will is subject to the same restriction. We see no reason presently, therefore, to enlarge the circumstances under which an at-will employee may successfully challenge his dismissal beyond the situation where the reason for his discharge involves \u201cimpropriety . . . derived from some important violation of public policy.\u201d <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>supra, 475. Whether a claim resulting from such a discharge is framed in tort or in contract should make no difference with respect to the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The first count of the complaint alleges that the plaintiff has been employed by the defendant under an oral contract at an annual salary since March 1, 1967, that he was discharged on August 16, 1979, for \u201calleged dereliction in the performance of his duties,\u201d and that his dismissal constituted a breach of the oral contract of employment and of its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The claim that Magnan was fired because he refused to sign a false statement as requested by the defendant is contained in the second count, which the jury resolved against him. On appeal the plaintiff has sought to justify the verdict in his favor on the first count wholly upon the ground that an employment contract of indefinite duration can be terminated by the employer only for good cause. We have rejected that basis for upholding the verdict and we agree with the defendant that the first count should never have been submitted to the jury. There was no evidence which would make it necessary to consider a more limited application of the good faith termination rule such as that followed in Massachusetts where the discharge has deprived an employee of clearly identifiable compensation relating to past services. All compensation earned by Magnan prior to his discharge has been paid and he has not been deprived of his vested pension benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The trial court did not, however, wholly confine the first count to the claim that the plaintiff had been discharged without a justifiable reason. A general instruction on the significance of the pleadings was given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>informing the jury that \u201c[t]he rights of the parties are to be determined upon the basis of those allegations made in the pleadings,\u201d and that evidence \u201cwith respect to facts outside the allegations or the pleadings, must be disregarded in your deliberations.\u201d The court stated the issue to be whether \u201cAnaconda act[ed] in good faith in discharging Mr. Magnan,\u201d declaring that \u201c[w]hen one who has been employed for such time as his services are satisfactory is discharged the employer must act in good faith.\u201d The charge continued: \u201cWhere there is evidence tending to show that the discharge was due to some impermissible reason, other than dissatisfaction with the services, the question is one for the jury to decide. . . . It is a question of fact for you to determine whether or not the requirement that Anaconda exercised good faith in its conduct of the employment contract with Mr. Magnan was breached by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Referring specifically to the first count as setting forth a claim for breach of an implied covenant of the employment contract as \u201cone of the exceptions to the general rule that employment is terminable at will,\u201d the court instructed the jury that \u201cthe plaintiff must do more than establish that there was no just cause for his discharge\u201d and that he must prove that \u201cthe defendant was motivated by bad faith or malice or based on retaliation and that it constitutes an aspect of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d In discussing the evidence related to the first count, the court pointed out that the defendant employer was entitled to receive Magnan\u2019s cooperation in the investigation being conducted, including his execution of the written statement which had been prepared, unless it was false. Even if the statement were false, the jury was advised, the defendant would have acted in good faith if its investigators \u201chonestly believed the statement was true in its essentials and. were trying to protect the legitimate interests of their employer . . . .\u201d The charge on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>first count concluded as follows: \u201cSo if you find that the plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that in terminating his employment the defendant acted dishonestly or fraudulently or deceitfully, you should find the liability issue for the plaintiff. But if you find the defendant terminated Mr. Magnan because its responsible employees honestly believed that he had been involved in thefts of company property or had knowledge of such thefts or that he had been untruthful about his involvement or knowledge, then you should find for the defendant on liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In charging on the second count of the complaint the court instructed: \u201c[T]he plaintiff must prove a demonstrably improper reason for his dismissal, a reason whose impropriety derives from some important violation of public policy. . . . If you find that the defendant\u2019s motive in terminating Mr. Magnan was to punish him for refusing to sign a statement which the defendant\u2019s responsible employees know to be false, then you would be justified in finding his discharge violated public policy. On the other hand if you find that the defendant discharged the plaintiff because it believed the plaintiff had been involved in thefts of company property or had knowledge about them or took part in a cover-up and refused to cooperate in a theft investigation, then you could not properly find that the plaintiff\u2019s discharge violated public policy and you would be required to return a verdict for the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Despite the broader allegations of the first count and the less precise language of the portion of the charge thereon regarding the duty of an employer to act in good faith when discharging an employee, the verdict for the plaintiff on that count could not have rested wholly upon the absence of good cause to terminate the employment contract unless the jury utterly disregarded the court\u2019s specific instruction to the contrary. It appears that the charge on both counts formulated the critical factual issue in essentially the same terms: whether the defendant\u2019s investigators had obtained Magnan\u2019s discharge for his refusal to sign a false state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ment when they knew of its untruthfulness or were unconcerned with its truth or falsity. The response of the jury to that question on the first count cannot be reconciled with its response on the second count. Although consistency of verdicts in criminal cases is not required; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>454 U.S. 339, 102 S. Ct. 460, 70 L.

There, we upheld the plaintiffs claim for future commissions based on past service when the employer terminated the plaintiffs employment without good cause and for the purpose of retaining the sales commissions for itself. In an opinion that was released after this case was argued, we considered further the question of the rights of an employee at will who was discharged without good cause. <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21 (1981). We noted that the absence of good cause to discharge an employee does not alone give rise to an enforceable claim for breach of a condition of good faith and fair dealing. Id. We recognized that termination of at-will employment could give rise to a claim where the reason for the discharge was contrary to public policy. Id. The employer\u2019s predatory motivation in the <em>Fortune </em>case can be classified as a reason contrary to public policy. In the <em>Gram </em>case, which did not involve an improper motive for the discharge, we went beyond those cases that had allowed recovery for the discharge of an at-will employee because of a motivation which was contrary to public policy.

This exception is in some ways quite similar to that which I have just discussed with you. To recover under the second count the plaintiff must prove a demonstrably improper reason for his dismissal. A reason whose impropriety is derived from some important violation of public policy. This exception forbids the discharge of an employee for exercising a right conferred upon him by law or for complying with some legal requirement or for a reason which would be injurious to the public or against the public good. That is the plaintiff would be entitled to a recovery if he can establish that he was discharged from his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ment because the defendant intended to punish his conduct as a good citizen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant\u2019s motive in terminating Mr. Magnan was to punish him for refusing to sign a statement which the defendant\u2019s responsible employees know to be false, then you would be justified in finding his discharge violated public policy. On the other hand if you find that the defendant discharged the plaintiff because it believed the plaintiff had been involved in thefts of company property or had knowledge about them or took part in a cover-up and refused to cooperate in a theft investigation, then you could not properly find that the plaintiffs discharge violated public policy and you would be required to return a verdict for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cIn making your determination of the liability issue I have explained to you, your decision will not depend on whether or not you are convinced that Mr. Magnan was, in fact, involved in stealing a refrigerator or flashlights or anything else. Whether or not the plaintiff believed the statement he was asked to sign to be false, or whether or not if you had employed the plaintiff you would have discharged him. Rather it will depend on whether you find that the defendant\u2019s responsible employees discharged the plaintiff because they believed that the plaintiff had been involved in some thefts of company property or that he was untruthful about his involvement and uncooperative in the investigation of the general theft problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\u201cIf the defendant acted on such a belief, when it terminated the plaintiff, it is entitled to a verdict in its favor. On the other hand if the plaintiff has proven to you that he was fired because he refused to sign a statement which the defendant made up and that the defendant knew the statement was false or did not care whether it was true or false, then the plaintiff would be entitled to a verdict in his favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201cThe state has abiding interest in seeing to it that men are truthful in their affairs.

Since the plaintiff in this case can prevail only in the event that his discharge involved a violation of public policy and since that claim is expressly set forth in the second count, the submission of the first count, which contains no specific reference to such a claim, would be superfluous and would tend to confuse the jury, as demonstrated by the inconsistent verdicts at the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b590-7\">Parskey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVd\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. In <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 427 A.2d 385 (1980), we held that an employee at will may not be discharged for a reason whose impropriety is derived from some important violation of public policy. <em>Sheets </em>involved a new application of an old common law principle, namely, that contractual provisions which offend public policy will not be enforced. <em>Hanford </em>v. <em>Connecticut Fair Assn., </em>92 Conn. 621, 623, 103 A. 838 (1918); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crockett Co., </em>85 Conn. 282, 287, 82 A. 569 (1912). The second count of the complaint in this case is based on the principle-ef law decided in <em>Sheets.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Respecting the first count of the complaint, the majority opinion has miscast the principal issue. This count is based on a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiff neither claimed nor did the court charge that a recovery under this count could be based on a showing by the plaintiff that his employment was terminated without just cause. To the contrary, the court charged the jury that though it could consider the absence of just cause as a factor in arriving at the ultimate conclusion that the defendant had acted in bad faith, even if it so found, that in itself would not afford a basis for recovery under this count, that in addition the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted in bad faith, that is, dishonestly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>fraudulently or deceitfully. When the first count is cast in a proper light it presents an entirely different picture than the caricature portrayed by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The first count is premised on the proposition that in every contract there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Such covenant is also not a new concept. As the majority opinion points out it is well recognized not only as part of the common law in general; 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 205; but also in related areas such as the Uniform Commercial Code. General Statutes \u00a7 42a-1-203. The majority also sees no reason to exempt employment contracts from the implication of a covenant of good faith and fair dealing. But having said that it goes on to say that a breach of such covenant will be enforced in the employment at will situation only if the basis for the termination of the employment violates public policy. If the termination violates public policy, then under <em>Sheets </em>it is wrongful and actionable and one is not required to rely on an implied covenant of good faith. When it is needed, in cases of bad faith discharges which do not violate public policy, the majority gives the employee a covenant that is nothing more than an empty vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The majority rationalizes its position by stating that all it is doing is fulfilling the Yeasonable expectation of the parties. Such reasoning begs the question. In an employment at will situation the parties may reasonably expect that the employer does not have to show good cause for terminating the relationship. They also have a right to expect, in view of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, that the termination will not be brought about as a result of the employer\u2019s bad faith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although in a number of situations, the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>foundation for both causes of action may overlap, this is not necessarily the case and when they do not there is no sound reason in my opinion why the injured party should be restricted to a single legal basis for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">A simple illustration will demonstrate the reason for giving remedial substance to a breach of the implied covenant of good faith. Assume that an employer falsely accuses an employee of theft of the employer\u2019s property. Assume further that the employer insists on the <em>employee </em>signing a statement admitting to the theft and upon the employee\u2019s refusal terminates the employment. Under these facts the employee should be able to bring an action for wrongful discharge in two counts, one based on a bad faith breach of the implied covenant, the other on a retaliatory discharge in violation of public policy. If, in such case, the plaintiff can prove that he was discharged on the basis of a false accusation of theft but could not prove that the employer demanded that he sign a false statement then his failure to recover on the second count should not preclude recovery on the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The case of <em>Pugh </em>v. <em>See\u2019s Candies, Inc., </em>116 Cal. App. 3d 311, 171 Cal. Rptr. 917 (1981), exemplifies the importance of breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as an independent ground of recovery. In that case, the plaintiff was fired after thirty-two years of employment with the defendant. He began his employment washing pots and pans and at the time of his dismissal he was vice president in charge of production and a member of the board of directors. He had never received any complaints or criticism about his job performance. He was given no explanation for his abrupt and unexpected termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>It was the plaintiff\u2019s theory that he was fired because he had objected to a provision in a proposed collective bargaining agreement that would have permitted the defendant to pay its seasonal employees at a lower rate and because he refused to be part of a team that negotiated an allegedly sweetheart contract with the union. He brought suit against the company (and the union) in two counts, claiming that his firing was in retaliation for those stands and therefore offended public policy and that it also violated the implied promise that he would be terminated only for good cause. The case went to trial before a jury and after the plaintiff concluded his case-in-chief, the trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The Court of Appeals agreed that the plaintiff had failed to establish a violation of public policy and upheld the nonsuit on that count. It did not agree, however, that the plaintiff had failed to establish an implied promise by the employer to refrain from acting arbitrarily, and it reversed the nonsuit on that count. Thus, while unable to establish a violation of public policy the plaintiff was permitted to proceed on breach of contract grounds. Under the majority\u2019s view, the defendant employer\u2019s egregious conduct would have been rewarded. To turn around an old legal aphorism it is apparent that hard law makes bad cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In this case I agree that the verdicts are inconsistent because both counts rely on the same factual foundation. If the jury found for the plaintiff on the first count they should have arrived at the same result on the second. Nevertheless, the plaintiff should not be deprived of the opportunity to present both legal theories arising out of the same transaction, one based on contract, the other on tort.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> This case focuses on the good faith aspect of the implied covenant. What is not before us and therefore what we need not decide is the fair dealing factor and its application to the reasonable expectation of job security based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>on satisfactory long term service.
