The defendant, Reginald Jones, was charged by indictment on February 22,1979, with felony murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a753a-54c.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. In the early afternoon of December 14,1978, the defendant, then seventeen years old, went to Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven. He was not enrolled at Wilbur Cross as a student. After walking around the school halls for a few minutes, the defendant approached two different individuals and asked where he could get some money or marijuana. He told one witness that if he found a drug dealer he would stick him up. One of the individuals approached by the defendant suggested that he should rob the school store, where he would find $600 or $700 in an envelope. The defendant proceeded to the store, approached the counter, pointed a gun at Anthony Annunziata, the teacher on duty, and demanded that Annunziata give him the money. When Annunziata did not respond, the defendant fired a single shot and fled. The victim died as a result of a gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Several witnesses observed the defendant in the vicinity of the school store prior to the shooting. The student who was working in the store with the victim witnessed the crime and positively identified the defendant. After a search of the defendant\u2019s residence, the police recovered a gun from the defendant\u2019s bedroom which matched a bullet found on the floor of the Yale-New Haven Hospital operating room in which the victim had died. Following his arrest, the defendant confessed his involvement in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Although the defendant objected to the admission of much of the evidence described above, he did not seriously dispute that he had shot and killed Annunziata. The defendant relied primarily on an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The defendant raises numerous claims of error on this appeal. He claims that the trial court erred (1) in failing to dismiss the indictment despite systematic discrimination against blacks and women in the selection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>of grand jury foremen in New Haven; (2) in permitting consideration of an indictment whose disjunctive language violated his right to a unanimous jury verdict; (3) in denying his motions to suppress his confession and the tangible evidence seized from his bedroom; (4) in various aspects of its charge to the jury, principally the portion defining the defense of insanity; and (5) in denying his motion to disqualify all prosecutors for the judicial district of New Haven. We will address first those claims that relate to the indictment, then those that relate to admissibility of evidence, to the jury instructions and to disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">In his first claim of error, the defendant argues that systematic discrimination against blacks and women in the selection of grand jury foremen in the judicial district of New Haven violated his rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution of the United States and article first, \u00a7\u00a78 and 20, of the constitution of Connecticut, and that, as a result, the indictment against him must be dismissed. At the pretrial hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment, the defendant introduced evidence describing the grand jury selection process from January 1, 1958, through February 22, 1979, the date he was indicted. The trial court, however, made no findings of fact when it denied the motion. Although much of the proffered evidence was statistical in nature, the state has conceded neither its accuracy nor its probative quality. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s brief fails to set out the facts on which it relies, as Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (b) requires. On this state of the record, we decline to consider this claim further.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The defendant next claims that the indictment was fatally defective because of its use of disjunctive language. The indictment charged, in the language of the felony murder statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the defendant <em>\u201cdid commit or attempt to commit a robbery </em>and in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or flight therefrom he, or another participant, caused the death of a person . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the defendant, this indictment charged two separate predicate felonies \u2014robbery and attempted robbery\u2014in the alternative, and therefore erroneously permitted the jury to convict him in the absence of a unanimous agreement among the jurors that he had committed one or the other of the predicate crimes charged. This possibility, the defendant asserts, deprived him of his right to a unanimous jury verdict. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument rests on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>553 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1977). There, the defendant was charged with selling or receiving a stolen vehicle, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court charged the jury that in order to convict the defendant they need not agree on which of the six statutorily prohibited acts the defendant had committed, as long as they were each convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>or another of the acts proscribed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>supra, 455-56. The court of appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that the instruction had violated his right to a unanimous jury-verdict. Id., 458-59. The court reasoned that the statute prohibited six acts in two distinct conceptual categories: (1) receiving, concealing and storing; and (2) bartering, selling and disposing. The challenged charge violated the defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous jury verdict because it \u201cauthorized the jury to return a guilty verdict despite the fact that some jurors may have believed that Gipson engaged in conduct <em>only </em>characterizable as receiving, concealing, or storing while other jurors were convinced that he committed acts <em>only </em>constituting bartering, selling, or disposing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>Gipson\u2019s </em>holding is inapposite to the present case because the robbery and attempted robbery charged here, unlike the two crime groups charged in <em>Gipson, </em>are not mutually exclusive. Robbery differs from attempted robbery only in that the latter requires an act constituting a \u201csubstantial step\u201d toward completion of the robbery, rather than a completed robbery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While some jurors might have believed that the defendant attempted the robbery but did not complete it, and others might have believed that he did, in fact, complete the crime, none could have believed that the defendant completed the robbery without first undertaking a substantial step toward achieving its object. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The unanimous verdict of guilty thus necessarily encompassed a unanimous finding that the defendant had at least attempted to commit robbery. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s second claim of error must fail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Giwosky, </em>109 Wis. 2d 446, 456, 326 N.W.2d 232 (1982) (jury need not be unanimous with respect to whether defendant committed assault by means of throwing log or striking victim); <em>Manson </em>v. <em>State, </em>101 Wis. 2d 413, 430-31, 304 N.W.2d 729 (1981) (jury need not be unanimous with respect to whether defendant committed robbery by use of force or threat of force).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motions to suppress the tangible evidence seized from his bedroom and the statements he gave to the police following his arrest. We find no error with respect to either motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The undisputed factual circumstances surrounding the seizures of physical evidence are as follows. On December 14,1978, shortly after the commission of the offense, members of the New Haven police department received information indicating that the defendant might be involved in the crime. Two officers proceeded to the house where the defendant resided with his father, stepmother and several other family members. After obtaining the signature of Carol Jones, the defendant\u2019s stepmother, on a consent to search form, the officers searched the defendant\u2019s bedroom and seized, inter alia, several photographs of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>numerous items of clothing and papers bearing names and addresses. Several hours later, after receiving a tip from an informant that the defendant had hidden the murder weapon inside a television set in his room, the police returned to the Jones home and obtained the signature of Sammie Jones, the defendant\u2019s father, on a second consent to search form. They then dismantled the television set and seized the gun which they found inside. The defendant was not present on either occasion. No warrant was issued authorizing either search.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The only serious issue with respect to the legality of either search is whether it was authorized by the valid consent of one of the defendant\u2019s parents. The state makes no claim that the searches were conducted pursuant to warrant or that they were supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress tangible evidence, both Carol Jones and Sammie Jones testified that they signed the consent to search forms because the police officers told them that if they did not sign, the police would obtain a search warrant. Both witnesses claimed not to have consented to the searches, but to have acquiesced because they believed they had no choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">In contrast, Officer Douglas MacDonald and Detective William White, the officers who conducted the searches of the Jones residence, testified that both of the defendant\u2019s parents wished to cooperate with the police and consented freely to the searches. Both policemen denied telling the defendant\u2019s parents that they would get a search warrant if the parents did not consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">A warrantless search is not unreasonable under either the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States or article first, \u00a7 7, of the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tution of Connecticut if a person with authority to do so has freely consented to the search. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>175 Conn. 614, 618, 402 A.2d 790 (1978). The state bears the burden of proving that the consent was free and voluntary and that the person who purported to consent had the authority to do so. <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S. Ct. 1788, 20 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1968); <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 618-19. The state must affirmatively establish that the consent was voluntary; mere acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority is not enough to meet the state\u2019s burden. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u201cThe question whether consent to a search has in fact been freely and voluntarily given, or was the product of coercion, express or implied, is \u2018a question of fact to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 227. As a question of fact, it is normally to be decided by the trial court upon the evidence before that court together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence.\u201d <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 619; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 238, 456 A.2d 288 (1983). In this case, the trial court did not make any explicit findings of fact, but merely denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress without opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In view of the evidence presented to the trial court, which related almost exclusively to the question of consent, the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress must include implicit findings that the defendant\u2019s parents had the authority to consent to the searches and did in fact voluntarily consent. We may reverse these findings on appeal only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>if they are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 238, 456 A.2d 288 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The issue concerning the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 consent revolves principally around the credibility of witnesses. Had the trial court believed the testimony of Sammie and Carol Jones, their consent, allegedly in response to police admonitions that refusal would be futile, would not meet constitutional standards of voluntariness. As we held in <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 621, \u201cthe intimation that a warrant will automatically issue is as inherently coercive as the announcement of an invalid warrant.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Faruolo, </em>506 F.2d 490, 495-98 (2d Cir. 1974) (Newman, J., concurring). The police officers alleged to have coerced the defendant\u2019s parents, however, denied making any such threats. The evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. In light of the conflicting testimony in the record and the absence of a finding by the trial court that the threat was ever uttered; see <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 621; we hold that the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the defendant\u2019s parents freely and voluntarily consented to the searches was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The parents\u2019 voluntary consent to the searches in question would, of course, be meaningless unless the state also proved that they had the authority to consent to the search of the defendant\u2019s bedroom. In order for third-party consent to be valid, the consenting party must have \u201cpossessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S. Ct. 988, 39 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>supra, 244-47; <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>According to the defendant\u2019s parents\u2019 own testimony in this case, the defendant was a minor. He lived, without paying rent, in a house owned by his father. Although the door to the defendant\u2019s bedroom was generally kept closed, it was not locked. The defendant\u2019s parents observed a policy of respecting their teenaged children\u2019s privacy, and, therefore, did not, as a matter of course, enter the children\u2019s rooms uninvited. The defendant\u2019s father believed, however, that it was his right to enter the defendant\u2019s room without permission if \u201cthere was a reason for [him] to do so.\u201d The state also introduced evidence that items of property not belonging to the defendant, such as the other children\u2019s Christmas presents and the defendant\u2019s sister\u2019s slippers, were found in the defendant\u2019s bedroom, indicating that other members of the defendant\u2019s family did in fact use the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Under all the circumstances in this case, the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that the defendant\u2019s parents retained sufficient control over their minor son and his bedroom to enable them to consent to a search of the room was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress tangible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The defendant also claims error in the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress his confession. The undisputed facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest and confession are as follows. Following the two searches of the Jones home, the police obtained two photographic identifications of the defendant from one of the photographs seized from his room. They then obtained an arrest warrant based on the identifications, other seized evidence and information received from informants. The defendant was arrested on the evening of December 15, 1978, after he was located in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>attic crawl space of a house belonging to a friend of his family. The defendant\u2019s father was present at his son\u2019s arrest, and rode with the defendant to the New Haven police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">At the police station, an officer read the defendant the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and obtained the defendant\u2019s signature on a waiver form. Another officer brought the defendant something to eat. The defendant was then, in the presence of his father, questioned about the shooting. During the course of this interrogation, the defendant confessed his involvement in the crime. In response to a police request, he then agreed to make and sign a statement. Thereafter, a statement, in question and answer format, was tape recorded, and a simultaneous stenographic transcript was produced. The statement included an acknowledgement that both of the defendant\u2019s parents were present, that the defendant had been advised of his constitutional rights in his parents\u2019 presence, that he understood his rights, that he had gone to school until the ninth grade, that he could read and write English, and that he knew he was under arrest for murder. On three occasions during the course of the recorded questioning, the defendant responded to questions by stating \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that right now.\u201d The police did not then terminate the interview, but asked other questions, to which the defendant responded. After the statement was concluded, the defendant and both of his parents signed the typed copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. At trial, the court admitted a police officer\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues (1) that the confession was the tainted fruit of the illegal searches of his bedroom; (2) that the confession was obtained in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>lation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and (3) that the state failed to prove that he had knowingly waived either his right to remain silent or his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendant\u2019s first argument, that his confession was the tainted fruit of the prior illegal searches of his bedroom, is without merit in view of our disposition of the underlying search and seizure claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The defendant next argues that the police violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights when they did not immediately terminate questioning in response to his statements that \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that right now.\u201d While the defendant is correct that the rule of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 473-74, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), requires that \u201c[i]f the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease,\u201d the transcript of the interrogation in this case does not support the defendant\u2019s claim. On three separate occasions the defendant declined to answer specific questions that sought to elicit direct confessions of guilt. He did not, however, state that he did not wish to answer any question at all. The officer conducting the interrogation did not repeat the questions that the defendant refused to answer, but asked others, to which the defendant voiced no objection. Under these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s retort to the most pointed inquiries with the statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that right now,\u201d did not constitute an invocation of his right to remain silent that would require a termination of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive either his right to remain silent or his right to counsel and that his confession was, therefore, involuntary. At the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession, the state bore the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>dence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 579, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983); that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and intelligent. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>187 Conn. 647, 677, 448 A.2d 163 (1982), cert. denied, 463 U.S. 1229, 103 S. Ct. 3570, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1411 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>183 Conn. 280, 283-84, 439 A.2d 330 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 161-62, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). The voluntariness of the waiver was essentially a question of fact to be determined by the trial court with reference to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s statements. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 374-75, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979); <em>Culombe </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (1961); <em>State </em>v. <em>Acquin, </em>supra, 677; <em>State </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>175 Conn. 398, 408, 399 A.2d 1269 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">To support his claim that his confession was involuntary, the defendant points to the following circumstances. He was a minor child. He was intellectually impaired. He had just been arrested under emotional circumstances, having been coaxed out of an attic crawl space in tears. He was charged with murder and was interrogated in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The state, however, relies on evidence before the trial court indicating that the defendant had been advised of his rights, acknowledged his understanding, and signed a written waiver. From the time of his arrest to the conclusion of his confession, he remained in the presence of his father. Both of the defendant\u2019s parents were with him during the tape recording of his statement, and both of them acknowledged their understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Upon first entering the police station, the defendant was left alone with his father, and he was permitted to confer with his parents in private before he agreed to give a written statement. The statement itself consists of responsive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>answers to questions and does not reveal a mental impairment so severe as to belie the defendant\u2019s stated understanding of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Based on all the evidence before the trial court, we cannot conclude that the court erred in finding that the confession was the product of the defendant\u2019s free will. Accordingly, we find no error in the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim of error is that the trial court erred when it charged the jury not only on the statutory defense of insanity set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but in addition instructed them on the superseded \u201cM\u2019Naghten\u201d and \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d tests of insanity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the defendant, this is precisely the error condemned by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 632-33, 424 A.2d 293 (1979), and, therefore, as in <em>Toste, </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The state does not dispute that the trial court\u2019s charge was erroneous. The state argues, however, that the trial court cured its initial error when, in response <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to a request by the jury during the course of their deliberations for a \u201ccopy of definition of legal insanity,\u201d the court twice read the statutory definition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The state asserts that this case is governed instead by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 86-87, 444 A.2d 896 (1982), in which we held that an erroneous charge similar to that given in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tost\u00e9, </em>supra, could be cured by repeating the correct statutory definition. Further, the state argues that the defendant failed to object properly to the curative charge. We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s conduct at trial indicated his acceptance of the supplemental charge as sufficient to cure the initial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The circumstances of this case fall somewhere between those presented by <em>Tost\u00e9 </em>on the one hand and <em>McCall </em>on the other. In <em>Tost\u00e9, </em>the trial court gave a charge that erroneously combined the statutory definition of insanity with several common law definitions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 631-32. The defendant promptly excepted. The following day, when the jury requested a written copy of the definition of insanity, the trial court repeated its erroneous instructions verbatim, and the defendant reiterated his exception. <em>Tost\u00e9 </em>thus presented no question with respect to a curative charge or to the clarity of the defendant\u2019s objection. In <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, by contrast, the court first erroneously charged the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, 85-86. Then, however, in response to the defendant\u2019s exception, the court reconvened the jury, acknowledged that it had \u201cused a word or two wrong\u201d in its previous insanity charge; id., 86; and read to the jury the statutory definition. The defendant agreed that the curative instruction was correct. Later, in response to a request from the jury, the court provided them with a written copy of the statute. The defendant took no further exception. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this case, it is undisputed that the court erred in its initial charge and that the defendant promptly excepted. The trial court did not immediately reconvene the jury to remedy its mistake as in <em>McCall, </em>and the supplemental charge did not, as in <em>McCall, </em>expressly acknowledge the court\u2019s previous error. The court did, however, consult with counsel before answering the jury\u2019s request for a \u201ccopy of the legal definition of insanity\u2014short definition.\u201d The supplemental instruction did not repeat the initial error, but consisted solely of a reading of the correct statutory standard. Defense counsel had agreed that this would be the best way to answer the jury\u2019s question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant excepted to the supplemental charge on only two grounds: (1) that there was no evidentiary basis for an instruction on the last sentence of the statute; and (2) that the court had denied the jury\u2019s request that they be given a written copy of the statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant did not reassert his exception to the initial charge, nor did he object to the supplemental charge as insufficient to cure the ini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tial error. He took no exception to the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury not to consider its previous definition of insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The court\u2019s initial error in this case was serious. It infected the jury instructions on the central issue in dispute\u2014the defendant\u2019s insanity defense. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, we reversed a conviction where the trial court charged the jury in terms nearly identical to the charge in this case. We explained that \u201cthe commingling of the old common-law rules with the statutory rule, could only create confusion as to what was the correct standard for determining insanity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>supra, 632-33. Such confusion, however, is not necessarily irreparable. When the jury requested clarification of the proper definition of insanity, it presented the court and counsel with an appropriate opportunity to correct the misapprehension created by the court\u2019s earlier charge. When consulted by the trial court, the experienced counsel representing the defendant could then have reminded the court of his previous exception, suggested whatever curative language he deemed most appropriate and reiterated his exception if he found the court\u2019s curative charge insufficient. The purpose of requiring an attorney to except is not merely formal. An exception serves the important function of alerting the trial court to error while there is time to correct it without ordering a retrial. In the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s failure to except to the supplementary charge is not a mechanical barrier to review. Rather, when viewed in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s participation in fashioning the supplementary charge, the failure to except supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant accepted the supplemented charge as correct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the fact that the correct charge was delivered orally rather than in written form cannot require reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. The defendant therefore cannot prevail on this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error in the jury instructions are equally without merit. First, the defendant claims that the trial court unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proving insanity to the defendant when, after charging the jury that the defendant was not criminally responsible if he lacked \u201csubstantial capacity,\u201d the court further instructed them that \u201clack of capacity is not, however, proved by [certain] evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant is correct that he had no burden of proof on the issue of sanity. Once he raised the insanity defense, the state was required to prove his sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 149, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977). Any instructions lessening the state\u2019s burden would, as the defendant claims, violate his right to due process of law. <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 524, 99 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970). The instructions in this case did not, however, shift any burden to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The defendant concedes that we must review the charge as a whole and not analyze small portions in isolation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>182 Conn. 242, 246, 438 A.2d 424 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 693, 425 A.2d 111 (1979). Where, as here, the claimed error is one of constitutional magnitude, we must determine whether, in light of the charge as a whole, it is reasonably possible that the jury were misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 585-86, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In this case the trial court carefully and correctly instructed the jury on four separate occasions that the state had the burden of proving each element of the crime, <em>including the defendant\u2019s sanity, </em>beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the circumstances, it is not reasonably possible that the jury understood the challenged instruction to impose on the defendant the burden of proving his lack of capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the element of intent were so confusing as to mandate reversal of his conviction. He objects to the trial court\u2019s mention of the specific intent to kill required by the murder statute, when he was charged not with murder but with felony murder.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the trial court\u2019s instructions could have led the jury to convict him if they believed he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>intended to kill the victim, even if they were not convinced that he had intended to commit the underlying robbery, as charged in the indictment. This claim is without merit. Immediately after the portion of the charge of which the defendant complains, the trial court correctly charged the jury that \u201cit is only required that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed or attempted to commit robbery\u201d and that in order to commit robbery \u201cthe only evidence of intention on the part of the defendant that the State must establish beyond a reasonable doubt is intent to deprive Mr. Annunziata of his property, or to appropriate his property to the defendant\u2019s use.\u201d In light of the charge as a whole, the trial court\u2019s statement that the jury might, but need not, find that the defendant had intended to kill did not dilute the state\u2019s burden to prove that the defendant intended to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to the jury charge is that the trial court erred in giving a \u201cChip Smith\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> charge without qualifying the charge with language reminding the jury that they must, in the last analysis, vote their own convictions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This court has repeatedly upheld the \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge using the same or similar language to that given in this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>188 Conn. 626, 641, 453 A.2d 418 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 928, 103 S. Ct. 2088, 77 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>2d 299 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 147-48, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981), and cases cited. We adhere to the rule of our prior cases and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify all prosecutors for the judicial district of New Haven. This court has previously rejected the defendant\u2019s claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>180 Conn. 443, 457, 429 A.2d 936 (1980). The basis for the motion was the prior representation of the defendant by a law firm of which Chief Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Richard Sperandeo was a partner. During the course of that prior litigation, involving a childhood head injury to the defendant, Attorney Sperandeo received confidential information from the defendant which bore on the defendant\u2019s insanity defense in this case. On the defendant\u2019s interlocutory \u2022appeal, we held that Sperandeo, himself, must be disqualified. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 451-52. Nevertheless, we upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to disqualify all of the other prosecutors for the judicial district. Id., 457. The defendant has pointed to no occurrence at trial that would require us now to reach a different conclusion. We therefore adhere to our prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c, as in effect at the time of the offense, provided: \u201cSec. 53a-54c. felony murder. A person is guilty of murder when acting either alone or with one or more persons, he commits or attempts to commit robbery, burglary, kidnapping, arson, sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the first degree with a firearm, sexual assault in the third degree, sexual assault in the third degree with a firearm, escape in the first degree, or escape in the second degree and, in the course of and in furtherance of such crime or of flight therefrom, he, or another participant, if any, causes the death of a person other than one of the participants, except that in any prosecution under this section, in which the defendant was not the only participant in the underlying crime, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant: (A) Did not commit the homicidal act or in any way solicit, request, command, importune, cause or aid the commission thereof; and (B) was not armed with a deadly weapon, or any dangerous instrument; and (C) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant was armed with such a weapon or instrument; and (D) had no reasonable ground to believe that any other participant intended to engage in conduct likely to result in death or serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\"> Defense counsel failed in two respects properly to preserve this claim of error for appeal. First, he failed to seek findings of fact from the trial court by filing a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3082. Second, upon this court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for leave to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>an oversize brief, the defendant set forth his statement of facts in an appendix. This practice is insufficient to satisfy the requirement of Practice Book \u00a7 3060F (b), and, accordingly, this court struck those pages from the appendix. For both of these reasons, the factual record now before us is inadequate for appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\"> The text of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c is set forth at footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-11\"> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313 provides as follows: \u201cWhoever receives, conceals, stores, barters, sells or disposes of any motor vehicle or aircraft moving as, or which is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b88-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 defines a criminal attempt, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cSec. 53a-49. criminal attempt: sufficiency of conduct; renunciation as defense, (a) A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime he: (1) Intentionally engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\"> This case differs further from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gipson, </em>553 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1977), in that this defendant challenges the sufficiency of the indictment, itself, rather than jury instructions alleged to be erroneous. Even in <em>Gipson, </em>where the defendant was charged under a statute that prohibited any one of six different acts, the court did not suggest any defect in an indictment cast in the disjunctive statutory language. The defendant in this case does not pursue any challenge to the jury charge on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\"> Particularly in cases such as this one, involving multiple, interrelated motions to suppress both tangible and testimonial evidence, we note that it is the better practice for the trial court expressly to articulate the subsidiary findings of fact on which its ruling is based.

It would not include a mind which, while weak or incapable in some measure, is still sound enough to make an essential choice in a course of conduct, and with will enough to resist an impulse which its possessor knows will result if yielded to, in exposing him to just and proper punishment for crime . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\"> The trial court responded to the jury\u2019s request as follows: \u201cGood morning, ladies and gentlemen.
