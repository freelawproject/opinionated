Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493, reh. denied, 388 U.S. 924, 87 S. Ct. 2094, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1377 (1967), can be found to have deliberately bypassed his direct appeal. We hold that he cannot and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The petitioner, Ronald Paulsen, appeals from a judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the court found that he deliberately bypassed a direct appeal and was, therefore, precluded from raising any claims concerning the legality of his confinement which could have been raised by appeal. In this habeas appeal Paulsen claims that the court erred (1) in concluding that he deliberately bypassed his direct appeal when he was denied effective assistance of counsel on direct appeal; (2) in taking judicial notice of an exhibit offered by the state but never admitted into evidence; and (3) in concluding that his substantive claim was readily foreseeable before the time for filing his direct appeal had expired. We agree with the contention that the finding of a deliberate bypass was erroneous and, therefore, do not address the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The events giving rise to this appeal are as follows: On August 11, 1976, Paulsen appeared in court, withdrew an earlier plea of not guilty, and elected to plead guilty to assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>the assistant state\u2019s attorney to set forth the factual basis for the crime charged,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> informed the defendant of the rights he was foregoing by electing to plead guilty and accepted the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Thereafter, on September 10,1976, Paulsen appeared for sentencing. Prior to the imposition of sentence he moved to withdraw his plea, alleging that the plea bargain he had agreed to was not being kept. The court denied the motion and subsequently imposed a sentence of not less than seven and one-half years nor more than fifteen years. Paulsen repeated his earlier request to withdraw his plea, and the court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">On September 10, 1976, Paulsen filed an application for waiver of fees, expenses and costs and a request for appointment of appellate counsel. The motion was granted on October 20, 1976, and Raymond Quinn, Paulsen\u2019s counsel during the earlier proceedings, was appointed to represent Paulsen.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The following day Quinn filed both a motion to withdraw as appellate counsel and, as required by <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, a brief. A transcript of the sentencing hearing was included with the brief, but the transcript of the earlier proceeding when Paulsen had pled guilty was not submitted to the court. Quinn\u2019s motion was granted and Attorney Richard Atkins was appointed to make a further review in order to determine whether there was any appealable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>On March 1, 1977, Atkins, who conceived his duty as limited to \u201creviewing] the issues raised in Attorney Quinn\u2019s brief,\u201d filed a motion to accept the report. At the hearing on that motion Atkins stated, \u201cwhen I started to prepare that report, I was advised by Mr. Paulsen he felt there were other issues he now wanted to raise on appeal, but were not dealt with in Mr. Quinn\u2019s brief nor dealt with by me because I felt my responsibility was only to review the brief filed by Mr. Quinn. In addition to feeling there were other appealable issues which involves [sic] inadequacy of counsel and due process and various other items, warranted review on appeal.\u201d Although neither Atkins nor Quinn had filed the transcript of the plea proceeding, the court accepted the report and permitted Atkins to withdraw as counsel. A motion for extension of time for filing the appeal was filed by Atkins on behalf of Paulsen, and Paulsen was given until March 22, 1977, to file an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">On March 16, 1977, Paulsen, proceeding pro se, filed a \u201cmotion for enlargement\u201d requesting a further extension in which to file his appeal. The motion was granted, and the time for filing was extended until May 15, 1977. No further action was taken by Paulsen concerning his appeal. Paulsen maintained that he did not receive notification that his motion had been granted, leading him to believe that his appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">On July 25,1980,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Paulsen filed the petition for writ of habeas corpus that is the subject of this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Thereafter, on October 14, 1981, the court rendered judgment for the state, dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In its memorandum of decision the court rejected Paulsen\u2019s claim that he had not been notified that the appeal period had been extended to May 15,1977, and also found that Paulsen had neglected to ascertain whether his motion for enlargement had been granted. Relying upon this combination of factors, the court concluded that Paulsen had not carried his burden of proof on the issue of deliberate bypass.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In his amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Paulsen alleged that the failure of the attorneys appointed for the appeal to review the transcript of the plea proceeding and submit it to the court undercuts any suggestion that he deliberately bypassed his right of appeal. Although the memorandum of decision does not expressly address this issue, we construe the decision to reject the argument pressed by the petitioner. See <em>Apostles of the Sacred Heart </em>v. <em>Curott, </em>187 Conn. 591, 600, 448 A.2d 157 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">A petitioner seeking to raise federal constitutional claims in a collateral proceeding must first allege and establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not deliberately bypass the orderly procedure of direct appeal. <em>D'Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 146-47, 476 A.2d 543 (1984); <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 576, 579, 472 A.2d 1278 (1984); <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 418, 433, 439 A.2d 430 (1981); <em>Vena </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>154 Conn. 363, 225 A.2d 802 (1966). The deliberate bypass rule serves two important functions: (1) it encourages a litigant to have all constitutional claims resolved in a single proceeding economizing the time and resources of all concerned parties and bring<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ing the case to a conclusion; and (2) it prevents a prisoner from deliberately deferring his claims of unlawful confinement until a time when a new trial, if required as a result of the collateral proceeding, would be, for all practical purposes, impossible. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 579.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The apparent harshness of the deliberate bypass rule has been softened somewhat by \u201crequiring that the record before us . . . disclose some reasonable basis for concluding that a convicted person has intelligently, understandingly and voluntarily waived his statutory right to appeal.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 146-47. Only after it is demonstrated that a petitioner\u2019s decision to forego his appeal was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made, can a court conclude that there has been an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of the right of appeal. <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 148; <em>Staton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>175 Conn. 328, 335, 398 A.2d 1176 (1978). Whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding of deliberate bypass depends, of course, on the varying circumstances of each case. See <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The facts in the present case are insufficient to establish an intentional relinquishment of the right to appeal. When Paulsen initially sought appellate review of his conviction he was given the assistance of counsel as required by our federal constitution. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 83 S. Ct. 814, 9 L. Ed. 2d 811, reh. denied, 373 U.S. 905, 83 S. Ct. 1288, 10 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1963). Subsequently, however, both Quinn and Atkins were granted permission to withdraw as his counsel. Quinn, who was the first to withdraw, failed to review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the transcript of the plea proceeding or submit it to the court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Atkins, who was appointed by the court to make a further review; see <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>152 Conn. 501, 505, 208 A.2d 756 (1965); also failed to submit the plea proceeding transcript to the court or to investigate any of the claims his client requested him to review, claiming that it was \u201chis understanding that he was appointed only to review the issues raised in Attorney Quinn\u2019s brief . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court, therefore, permitted both attorneys to withdraw and concluded that Paulsen\u2019s appeal was frivolous without a full examination of prior proceedings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a portion of which was never made available to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>It cannot be seriously maintained that Paulsen was not erroneously deprived of his right to counsel on appeal. Whenever appointed counsel seeks to withdraw from his role as appellate advocate, he is required, as a matter of constitutional law, to file <em>\u201ca </em>brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Anders </em>v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1967). This minimum level of constitutionally acceptable conduct presupposes that appellate counsel will review the transcripts of all prior proceedings in order to fulfill the \u201crole of an active advocate.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our federal constitution also requires \u201cthe court\u2014not counsel\u2014[to proceed], after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d Id. Both the court and counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>this case failed to conform their conduct to these constitutionally mandated requirements, imposing on Paulsen the burden of complying with our rules of practice for filing an appeal without the aid of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">A determination that a defendant failed to pursue his appeal after being properly advised of that right and after counsel has properly withdrawn is ordinarily sufficient to support a finding that the right of appeal was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived. <em>See D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 149, 476 A.2d 543 (1984); <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 576, 580, 472 A.2d 1278 (1984). Where, as here, however, the petitioner has been involuntarily deprived of his right to counsel on appeal without full compliance with the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, for allowing appellate counsel to withdraw, his subsequent failure to perfect the appeal cannot be characterized as a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver. <em>See Staton v. Warden, </em>175 Conn. 328, 335, 398 A.2d 1176 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>157 Conn. 398, 401, 254 A.2d 570 (1969); <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>supra. \u201cThe purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights, and the guaranty would be nullified by a determination that an accused\u2019s ignorant failure to claim his rights removes the protection of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 465, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">There is error on the finding of a deliberate bypass, the judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> At the time of the offense, which occurred on June 25, 1976, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-59 set forth the elements of the crime of assault in the first degree: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument; or (2) with intent to disfigure another person seriously and permanently, or to destroy, amputate or disable permanently a member or organ of his body, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or (3) under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of death to another person, and thereby causes serious physical injury to another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\"> The assistant state\u2019s attorney recited the following facts: \u201c[Paulsen] was accompanying one David Collins at approximately 11:35 on June 25, 1976 at or near the Middlebury-Southbury town line on Route 1-84. They were stopped by the police officer, as I mentioned, and the police officer was shot in the right arm by this man\u2019s companion, Collins. The police officer returned fire and subsequently apprehended them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Paulsen claimed, in his petition for habeas corpus, that the factual basis recited above was insufficient to support his guilty plea. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 387 A.2d 550 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> Between May 15, 1977, the date when the time for filing the appeal elapsed, and July 25, 1980, the petitioner filed a \u201cpetition for mandatory injunction\u201d in federal court and an application for writ of habeas corpus in Superior Court. The request for injunctive relief was treated by the federal court as an application for a writ of habeas corpus and dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. The application for a writ of habeas corpus presented to Superior Court was also dismissed. The state has not claimed that this disposition has any significance in relation to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-10\"> Paulsen was permitted to amend his original petition on December 5, 1980.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> Similar goals have been recognized by the United States Supreme Court in its \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice\u201d standard.

Counsel should, and can with honor and without conflict, be of more assistance to his client and to the court. His role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability. Of course, if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accomplished by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. A copy of counsel\u2019s brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points that he chooses; the court\u2014not counsel\u2014then proceeds, after a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous. If it so finds it may grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal insofar as federal requirements are concerned, or proceed to a decision on the merits, if state law so requires. On the other hand, if it finds any of the legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous) it must, prior to decision, afford the indigent the assistance of counsel to argue the appeal.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.
