Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap6\">This appeal involves a habeas corpus action instituted by the plaintiff, William McGaffin (father), to obtain custody of Cathy McGaffin (child), his four year old daughter, after the death of Lena McGaffin (mother), the child\u2019s mother who was the plaintiff\u2019s divorced wife. The habeas corpus was brought against the defendant, Cathy Roberts, the maternal grandmother (grandmother), who contested the action and requested that she be awarded custody. The trial court, after a full hearing, awarded custody to the grandmother with rights of visitation in the father as specified in its memorandum of decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Among the facts found by the trial court are the following: The child was born on January 7, 1978. Her father and mother were separated in 1980 and divorced in 1981. At the time of the divorce, both parents agreed that the mother be awarded custody of the child. In awarding custody to the mother, the dissolution court also ordered that the father pay $25 per week for the support of the child. The father remarried shortly after the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The mother died suddenly on December 9, 1982, in Clinton where she and the child had made their own living arrangement since sometime in 1981. Prior to that, the father, mother and child had come up from Virginia in 1978 and moved into the grandmother\u2019s home. The mother and child remained at that home after the mother\u2019s separation from the father until sometime in 1981 when they moved down the street from the grandmother. Although they then lived in separate quarters, the child spent a substantial portion of each week with the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">At the time of the mother\u2019s death, a custody action, instituted by the father, was pending in the New Haven judicial district because the mother had withheld visitation after she had found bruises on the child following a weekend visit with the father. Temporary visitation had been reinstated by that court during the pendency of that custody action during which the father picked up and dropped off the child at the grandmother\u2019s home. Prior to the mother\u2019s death, she and her child had been receiving state welfare assistance and the state was investigating the father for delinquent support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The trial court also found that the father exercised visitation rights \u201c on a fairly regular basis\u201d after his divorce and remarriage although visitation \u201c[had] . . . been problematic for the child.\u201d It found that on at least two occasions the child returned from visitation so ill that she had to be hospitalized, once in March, 1981, for one week and again in June, 1981, for two weeks.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On one of these occasions, the father claimed that the child had a temperature when he picked her up and that the next day he took her to his present wife\u2019s physician after she had \u201cbad vomiting fits.\u201d The father maintained that although the physician told him that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>child should be treated, the physician would not do so because the father was not the custodial parent and did not have the child\u2019s welfare medical card. The father did not contact the mother but, instead, took the child home and gave her aspirin. On the following day, a Sunday, he took the child to the beach place of his present wife\u2019s parents where the child again began vomiting and running a high temperature. He thereupon cut his visit short and dropped the child off at her grandmother\u2019s at noontime. On the other occasion, the child became ill during visitation. The father did not seek any medical attention but merely dropped the child off at her grandmother\u2019s with a high temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The trial court found that on each of these occasions the father \u201cfailed to act appropriately in the face of very apparent and serious symptoms.\u201d It also noted that the father\u2019s present wife testified that there was nothing wrong with the child when she was returned to the grandmother\u2019s house. The trial court\u2019s memorandum also develops the incident of the bruise marks found on the child\u2019s arms by the grandmother after her return on April 18, 1982, from visitation with her father. The father\u2019s explanation of the bruise marks was that he had grabbed the child to keep her from falling off a bus from which he, his present wife and the child were alighting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These bruises, which were on both arms, were observed by both a police officer to whom the child was taken and a worker with the department of children and youth services (DCYS) to whom the Clinton police had referred the matter as a suspected child abuse incident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The child told the DCYS worker that her father had inflicted the bruises. Both the Clin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ton police officer and the DCYS worker described the bruise marks as finger marks in the flesh. The trial court found that the child had been grabbed hard enough to leave handprints on the arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The father, in describing his visitation, stated that the child would be nervous when she first arrived, but thereafter she would relax and play with toys he kept for her. On the other hand, the present Mrs. MeGaffin said that the child was not nervous on her visits. Both agreed that the child \u201cgot along well with them on her visits and that there were no problems with her.\u201d At the trial, the grandmother and two maternal aunts described the child \u201cas being very fretful and upset the day before she knows she is to visit her father and as crying before she gets picked up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Additionally, the trial court pointed out that an \u201cin chambers\u201d session was held at the request of the attorneys who were allowed to question the child directly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court found that she was \u201ca poised articulate little girl\u201d who \u201cunderstood what she was being asked and was not hesitant at all in giving her responses.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[h]er responses were constantly negative as to her father and his wife and positive as to her grandmother.\u201d When asked why she said she felt \u201cnot good\u201d about her father, she replied, \u201che hurt me\u201d and when asked how, she said that he grabbed her by the arms. On the other hand, when asked how she felt about her grandmother, she answered, \u201cgood.\u201d In sum, the court opined that the child \u201cmakes it very clear that she wants to live with the grandmother.\u201d In this connection, the trial court pointed out that \u201c[s]he looked well cared for, she sounded well cared for [and] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>she acted well cared for\u201d and that \u201c[s]he wants to stay where she has been for most of her young life, with her grandmother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The position of the father at the habeas hearing was that as the sole surviving parent of the child his right to custody could not be challenged by the grandmother, who, as a stranger, lacks standing. The trial court states that while it is not disputed that the plaintiff is the father, that the mother died on December 9, 1982, and that the father\u2019s parental rights have not been terminated, what is in dispute is the father\u2019s claim \u201cthat he is a fit person to have custody and control of the child.\u201d After examining the evidence, including that given by the child as well as its own observations,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court decided that it \u201cmust weigh this against the wishes of her father who comes across as a parent asserting his rights but as having failed to demonstrate that he could be a responsible, reliable caretaker.\u201d Here the court points out that it has \u201cnoted particularly the discrepancies in the accounts given by the plaintiff and his wife as to how they perceived the child\u2019s health needs, how she got the bruise marks [and] how she interacted with them and responded to them.\u201d The father\u2019s delinquency in the support payments was noted as well as the attribution to his present wife that she did not want to take care of children including his child. The trial court concluded that it could not justify removing the child from the grandmother and therefore granted custody to the grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">In appealing from the judgment granting custody, the father has set out and briefed twenty-two claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>of error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After careful scrutiny of all of the father\u2019s claims of error, justice will be served by the consideration of certain claims of error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They are that the trial court erred in: (1) holding that the grandmother had standing to \u201cresist\u201d the father\u2019s habeas corpus petition; (2) its interpretation of <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>151 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Conn. 315, 197 A.2d 334 (1964); (3) failing to give the father the benefit of the presumption of parental fitness; (4) its interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 45-43;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (5) deciding the case solely on the basis of \u201cthe best interest of the child\u201d without regard to the father\u2019s constitutionally protected parental rights; and (6) its legal conclusion based on its finding of facts as set out in its memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">There can be no lingering doubts that the family unit, including the rights of parent and child, is accorded constitutional protection. \u201cThe integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>[262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923)], the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>[316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S. Ct. 1110, 86 L. Ed. 1655 (1942)] . . . .\u201d <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972); see <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 85 S. Ct. 1187, 14 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1965); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925). As it noted recently, the United States Supreme Court has now \u201crecognized on numerous occasions that the relationship between parent and child is constitutionally protected.\u201d Quilloin <em>v. Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S. Ct. 549, 54 L. Ed. 2d 511, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978); see <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). \u201c[A] father, no less than a mother, has a constitutionally protected right to the \u2018compan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ionship, care, custody, and management\u2019 of \u2018the children he has sired and raised, [which] undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u2019 <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651 [92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551] (1972).\u201d <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 652, 95 S. Ct. 1225, 43 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1975). Parental rights are not, however, beyond limitation in the public interest. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 64 S. Ct. 438, 88 L. Ed. 645 (1944). The United States Supreme Court has stated that \u201cbiological relationships are not [the] exclusive determina[nts] of the existence of a family.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families, </em>431 U.S. 816, 843, 97 S. Ct. 2094, 53 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1977). One court puts it this way: \u201c[T]he function of parenthood is not purely a matter of biology. Persons other than natural parents may occupy the relationship of parent to the child.\u201d <em>In re Palmer, </em>81 Wash. 2d 604, 607, 503 P.2d 464 (1972). A state\u2019s constitutional interest extends to the welfare of the child. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>266 Ark. 112, 118, 583 S.W.2d 37 (1979);In <em>re William L., </em>477 Pa. 322, 336-39, 383 A.2d 1228 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">We now turn to the father\u2019s claims of error. Initially, the father claims that the grandmother does not have standing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to \u201cresist\u201d his habeas corpus petition. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>claims in his brief that mere physical possession of the child, unaccompanied by any other right to the child, cannot confer standing upon her where she might not otherwise have a legal right to petition for custody. He goes on and argues that we should not create a rule that naked possession with no other right to the child is sufficient to allow \u201can individual to defend or resist a habeas petition.\u201d He also claims that the trial court erred in its interpretation of <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>supra. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant grandmother does have standing to \u201cresist\u201d the father\u2019s petition if for no other reason than that she is the target of the petition. The father cannot overlook the facts that he made her that target, that the <em>only </em>purpose served by the application for the writ is to secure the issuance of the writ in the discretion of the court and that \u201c[t]he issues on which any subsequent trial is held are framed by the return and the pleadings subsequent thereto.\u201d <em>Adamsen </em>v. <em>Adamsen, </em>151 Conn. 172, 176, 195 A.2d 418 (1963). Having made the grandmother a party, the father cannot claim that she is in no position to \u201cresist\u201d his petition. Black defines \u201cresist\u201d to mean \u201coppose\u201d and \u201cdefend\u201d to mean \u201c[t]o oppose, repel or resist\u201d as well as \u201c[t]o contest and endeavor to defeat a claim or demand made against one in a court of justice.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). Moreover, despite his claims under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 45-43, the time-honored function of habeas corpus in child custody cases with the ultimate question of what is in the best interests of the child militates against any such claim. The petitioner\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 45-43 strangely does not refer at all to the statutory scheme which, as we develop below, demonstrates that the legislature specifically provided that \u00a7 45-43 is a statute which \u201cshall be liberally construed in the best interests of any minor child affected . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The father also claims that the trial court erred in its interpretation of <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>supra, which it cited in the memorandum of decision as authority for the proposition that habeas corpus is the proper means for determining the right to custody of the minor child in this case. This claim is without merit. In <em>Baram, </em>we said that \u201c[t]he writ of habeas corpus has long been recognized as a proper means of determining the right to the custody of a minor child, and the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, whether the controversy is between the parents or between a parent and a stranger. <em>Antedomenico </em>v. <em>Antedomenico, </em>142 Conn. 558, 562, 115 A.2d 659 [1955]; <em>Pfeiffer </em>v. <em>Pfeiffer, </em>[99 Conn. 154, 157, 121 A. 174 (1923)].\u201d <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>supra, 318-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">We further explicated the use of habeas corpus in child custody matters in <em>Pi </em>v. <em>Delta, </em>175 Conn. 527, 530, 400 A.2d 709 (1978): \u201c \u2018The use of habeas corpus to obtain custody was established at an early date . . . . When so used, the issue is not the illegality of confinement, as is normally the case, but rather what is best for the child.\u2019 2 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 259 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>p. 1063; <em>Kearney </em>v. <em>State, </em>174 Conn. 244, 249, 386 A.2d 223 [1978]. A minor child is in the position of a ward of the state; <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>152 Conn. 460, 464, 208 A.2d 540 [1965]; and \u2018[t]he jurisdiction exercised by the court rests on its inherent equitable powers and exerts the force of the state, as parens patria[e], for the protection of its infant ward. <em>LaBella </em>v. <em>LaBella, </em>134 Conn. 312, 316, 57 A.2d 627 [1948].\u2019 <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>supra, 464-65; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 342-43 [163 Conn. 340, 342-43, 307 A.2d 166 (1972)].\u201d In <em>Howarth, </em>we said that \u201c[t]he very nature and scope of the inquiry [into what is best for the welfare of the child] and the result sought to be accomplished call for the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity. In an equitable action the court endeavors to do complete justice. . . . \u2018Equity never does anything by halves.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howarth </em>v. <em>Northcott, </em>152 Conn. 460, 465, 208 A.2d 540 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Moreover, there is also statutory authority permitting a grandmother to intervene in a habeas corpus child custody controversy. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-57<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> permits such intervention of \u201cany interested third party . . . upon motion ...\u201d and provides that the court, in making any order thereunder, \u201cshall be guided by the best interests of the child . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The father next claims that the trial court erred in failing to give him the presumption of \u201cparental fitness.\u201d As that claim implicates his claim that the court erred not only in its interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 45-43, but also in deciding the case solely on the basis of the best interests of the child without regard for his constitutionally protected parental rights, we will consider all these claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The father argues that as the surviving biological parent he was entitled to the presumption of parental fitness under General Statutes \u00a7 45-43,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which marks him as \u201ca fit and proper parent\u201d unless or until a third party disproves this fact. The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, he claims, however, clearly required <em>him </em>to establish that he was a fit and proper parent. In support of his claim that the trial court decided the case solely in the best interests of the child without regard to his constitutionally protected rights, the father makes the astonishing statement that \u201c[tjhere is a constitutional right which mandates that custody of a child be given to a biological parent\u201d referring to <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982). <em>Santosky, </em>unlike this custody case, was a termination of parental rights case and, in any event, is hardly authority for the father\u2019s unusual statement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">First, with reference to his presumption of parental fitness under \u00a7 45-43, he depends upon his biological nexus with the child. We cannot accept this claim. As we have already said, the genetic connection is not determinative of the issue of the best interests of the child although it is certainly a factor. Additionally, the fact that he is the sole surviving parent whose parental rights have not been terminated hardly makes inevitable his entitlement to custody in this habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>corpus proceeding. This latter circumstance, however, is a significant consideration on the issue of custody. We remain unconvinced that it is a \u201cpresumption\u201d as that term is commonly referred to in our law. Rather, we view it as an expression of the natural importance of parenthood as a factor in the determination of what is in the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In considering this claim of \u201cpresumption\u201d as that term is referenced in our law; see, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>85 Conn. 438, 440-41, 83 A. 530 (1912), and cases there cited; we must remember that in this case the issue is not that of termination of parental rights but one of custody. This difference in the issues is a difference in kind and not in degree. This is so because of the substantial difference in the mandated result in each instance, i.e., the termination of parental rights which is final versus the award of custody which is modifiable. Compare <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>182 Conn. 545, 438 A.2d 755 (1980), with <em>Baram </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>supra, and <em>Claffey </em>v. <em>Clajfey, </em>135 Conn. 374, 64 A.2d 540 (1949). Acknowledging the natural importance of parenthood as we have, we must recognize that \u00a7 45-43 is under the explicit \u201cbest interest\u201d mandate of \u00a7 45-42b.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the factor of parenthood is to be properly considered in the aggregate of all those circumstances that a trial court is entitled to consider in exercising its broad discretion in deciding what is in the best interests of a minor child. Section 45-42b is a clear legislative recognition that any formulation which focuses <em>entirely </em>on the respective rights of the contesting parties has no real part in this statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>scheme since the crucial issue is the best interest of the child. The constitutional concerns are not entirely parental because the preservation of family integrity \u201cencompasses the reciprocal rights of both parent[s] and children.\u201d <em>Duchesne </em>v. <em>Sugarman, </em>566 F.2d 817, 825 (2d Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The father would have us view his claim to custody solely under that language contained in \u00a7 45-43. In doing so, he does not refer to \u00a7 45-42b which immediately precedes \u00a7 45-43 and expressly provides: \u201c(a) The provisions of section 45-42 to 45-45g, inclusive, <em>shall be liberally construed in the best interests of any minor child affected by them . . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This statute was enacted quite some time after \u00a7 45-43. This subsequent legislative act throws light on the legislative intent of an earlier related act. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>152 Conn. 312, 317, 206 A.2d 428 (1965); see, <em>Bisi </em>v. <em>American Automobile Ins. Co., </em>137 Conn. 424, 431, 78 A.2d 533 (1951). Even if it were claimed that it merely codified an equitable principle that existed prior to its passage; <em>General Realty Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 238, 242, 50 A.2d 59 (1946); and articulated the authority which the court had under its general equitable powers, it is an unambiguous declaration of legislative intent and an acknowledgement of the standard to be used on the issue of custody even where the surviving biological parent claims entitlement to custody of the person of his minor child under \u00a7 45-43. We need hardly say here that \u201c[i]t is ancient [and yet enduring] wisdom that statutes should be interpreted so as to effectuate their manifested purpose or object.\u201d 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 58.06, p. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Further, we also cannot accept the father\u2019s claim that the trial court clearly required him to establish that he was a fit and proper parent. In the trial court\u2019s lengthy memorandum of decision there are two statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>upon which this claim appears to be based. We find that these statements are clearly interrelated. First, after pointing out that it was not disputed that the father was the surviving parent of the child and that his parental rights had not been terminated, the trial court said that \u201c[w]hat is disputed is [his] claim that he is a fit person to have custody and control . . . .\u201d Second, after a thorough discussion of facts found on which the trial court had obviously resolved conflicts in the evidence in favor of the grandmother\u2019s claim to custody, the memorandum contains this statement: \u201cThe court must weigh this against the wishes of her father who comes across as a parent asserting his rights but as having failed to demonstrate that he could be a responsible, reliable caretaker.\u201d It then goes on to indicate certain conclusions that resulted in its award of custody to the grandmother with visitation rights to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The memorandum of decision must be read as a whole to put these statements in fair context. We examine the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision to understand better the basis of the court\u2019s decision and to determine the reasoning for the conclusion reached by the trial court. <em>Bierman </em>v. <em>Westport Planning and Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 135, 136-37, 440 A.2d 882 (1981), and cases there cited. An examination of the memorandum of decision discloses that the trial court fully considered the father\u2019s claim that \u201cas the sole surviving parent . . . [his] right to custody cannot be challenged by the defendant . . . .\u201d There is no doubt that the trial court understood and employed the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard as the ultimate basis of its decision. As the court specifically said in its memorandum, it did \u201cweigh\u201d the evidence in favor of the grandmother\u2019s claim to custody as against the evidence which favored the father \u201casserting his rights.\u201d Recognizing the father\u2019s assertion of his rights, the trial court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>all the evidence applied the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard and decided to award custody to the defendant grandmother. In doing so, it did not act in derogation of any of the father\u2019s constitutional rights which, as we have already pointed out, are not absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Finally, the father claims that the trial court erred in its legal conclusion based on its finding of facts in its memorandum of decision. Here he argues that the factual determination of the court does not establish either that the best interests of the child required that custody be awarded to the grandmother or that she was a \u201cbetter custodial parent.\u201d Further, he asserts that in \u201capplying the correct legal standard to the factual determinations made by the court, even viewing all the evidence most favorable [sic] to the defendant, the conclusion is inescapable that the court must return the child to the biological father . . . .\u201d We cannot accept this claim because, as we have already stated, the trial court applied the proper legal standard. Moreover, the validity of any claim that the trial court\u2019s decision is not supported by the evidence may be tested only by reference to the record together with the transcripts and exhibits filed in the case; see <em>Morningside Assn. </em>v. <em>Morningside Development, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 60, 63, 372 A.2d 141 (1976). The father has not filed a transcript of all the evidence; see Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3060F, 3060V; and therefore we cannot properly review any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">\u201cOn appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 3060D. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). Measuring by this standard, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In this opinion Speziale, C. J., Shea and Grillo, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\"> The trial court admitted as full exhibits the hospital records of these two hospitalizations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\"> Both the father and his present wife testified concerning this \u201cbus incident.\u201d In pointing out certain inconsistencies in their testimony concerning the incident, the trial court\u2019s memorandum points out that the present Mrs. McGaffin was sequestered during the testimony of her husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> The trial court pointed out that since the custody action was pending in the New Haven judicial district and the father was not the custodial par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ent, the department of children and youth services went no further with their investigation and made no contact with the father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-10\"> Present in chambers were counsel for the father and the grandmother, the court reporter and the court clerk; neither the father nor the grandmother was present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\"> We have said that the trial court \u201cmay properly take into consideration the subjective characteristics of a person which are involved in the issues of a case like this . . . .\u201d <em>Claffey </em>v. <em>Claffey, </em>135 Conn. 374, 376, 64 A.2d 540 (1949); <em>Dadio </em>v. <em>Dadio, </em>123 Conn. 88, 192 A. 557 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\"> We are constrained to comment upon the potential for meaningful appellate review of a number of the father\u2019s claims. Certain of the claims require reference to a transcript of the relevant proceedings. These include claims going to the admissibility and the consideration of certain evidence when due to a lack of transcript, we do not know whether any or all of them were properly preserved for appellate review. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3060P, 3060V. Moreover, the father\u2019s brief does not contain a single citation to a transcript although his brief makes assertions that require such references under our practice. See Practice Book \u00a7 3060F. Further, he assigns as error the ruling of <em>Harrigan, J., </em>\u201crequiring\u201d the transfer of this case from the New Haven judicial district to the Middlesex judicial district. He does this despite the fact that his present counsel, who was also trial counsel, admitted before us that he stipulated to that transfer. Groundless assignments of error are not to be countenanced. See <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 389, 392 n.1, 363 A.2d 160 (1975). Moreover, there is no question that under the habeas corpus statute, venue was properly in the Middlesex judicial district because the child in question was alleged to be in the custody and control of her grandmother in the town of Clinton in that judicial district. See General Statutes \u00a7 45-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The father also claims error in the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel for the child and in not ordering a family relations report before entering a final order. The grandmother\u2019s brief maintains that she, not the father, did in fact file such motions, but that the father \u201cchose\u201d not to have those motions heard. While we are aware that the court may act on such motions sua sponte, the grandmother\u2019s claims in this connection that the father did not seek action by the court here have not been answered. The father also claims in his brief that the court erred in not granting him \u201cimmediate visitation privileges.\u201d The grandmother counters that this was not requested anywhere in the papers filed in this case and that the lack of a transcript prevents the father from claiming in this court that he did so orally below. No answer has been forthcoming to this argument of the grandmother. The father also claims that the court erred in failing \u201cto take notice of the felonious conduct and unclean hands of Cathy Roberts [the grandmother].\u201d This issue is really no more than mentioned in the father\u2019s brief; briefing to assure appellate review requires more than that. It is sufficient to note that we have examined all the father\u2019s claims. See <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn. 518, 538, 457 A.2d 656 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"><em> </em>The claims of error we consider implicate others which we do not specifically set out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45-43, entitled \u201cFather and mother joint guardians,\u201d provides: \u201cThe father and mother of every minor child are joint guardians of the person of the minor, and the powers, rights and duties of the father and the mother in regard to the minor shall be equal. If either father or mother dies or is removed as guardian, the other parent of the minor child shall become the sole guardian of the person of the minor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> The father filed a special defense alleging that the grandmother lacked standing \u201cto raise any claims for possession\u201d of the child in the Superior Court and that her \u201csole remedy concerning this matter is to petition the court of probate in Branford to litigate her allegations.\u201d As we point out, the Superior Court has jurisdiction in a habeas corpus matter to determine child custody. We do not question the jurisdiction of a court of probate to determine child custody in a proper case. In the case before us, however, the habeas corpus action in the Superior Court was instituted by the service of process upon the grandmother on December 14, 1982. \u201cIn Connecticut, an action is commenced on the date of service of the writ upon the defendant. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Jackman, </em>167 Conn. 96, 99, 855 A.2d 234 [1974]; <em>Seaboard Burner Corporation </em>v. <em>DeLong, </em>145 Conn. 300, 303, 141 A.2d 642 [1958]; <em>Consolidated Motor Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>M &amp; M Transportation Co., </em>128 Conn. 107, 109, 20 A.2d 621 [1941]; <em>Spalding </em>v. <em>Butts, </em>6 Conn. 28, 30 [1825]; <em>Jencks </em>v. <em>Phelps, 4 </em>Conn. 149 [1821]; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Helms, </em>1 Root 486 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>[1793].\u201d <em>Valley Cable Vision, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>175 Conn. 30, 33-34, 392 A.2d 485 (1978). The grandmother appears to have filed a petitition in the Clinton Probate Court sometime between December 15, 1982, and December 20, 1982, for the removal of the father as guardian of the person of the child under General Statutes \u00a7 45-43. That application sought the appointment of the grandmother as guardian of the person of the child. The Superior Court habeas corpus action was obviously instituted first. Because that court had jurisdiction to entertain and determine the question of custody, there is, under the circumstances, no merit to the father\u2019s claim that the relief sought by the grandmother is to be obtained solely in a court of probate.

Section 45-43 of the General Statutes provides for the joint guardianship in both parents of their minor child. It also provides that \u201c[i]f either father or mother dies or is removed as guardian, the other parent of the minor child shall become the sole guardian of the person of the minor.\u201d The right to custody of a minor child is one of the principal attributes of guardianship of the person. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>158 Conn. 217, 220, 258 A.2d 89, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 940, 90 S.

The majority takes passing notice of the statute and then concludes that in some fashion it has been swallowed up in the \u201cbest interest of the minor child\u201d provisions of \u00a7 45-42b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although one may marvel at the dexterity with which this has been accomplished, the decisional gloss which has been placed on this statute will not countenance so convenient a disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>In all custody disputes, what is in the best interests of the child is the ultimate concern. General Statutes \u00a7 45-42b embodies that principle. In a dispute between a parent and a nonparent, however, this is the end of the analysis, not the beginning. The troublesome issue is, in the quest to determine what is in the best interests of the child, how do we honor the constitutional; <em>Quilloin </em>v. <em>Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S. Ct. 549, 54 L. Ed. 2d 511, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972); and statutory; General Statutes \u00a7 45-43; interests of the parent. The majority\u2019s response is to ignore them. In its view, the parent and the nonparent compete as equals, with the biological nexus treated as one of many factors to be considered in the determination of the best interests. In its rush to determine what is in the best interests of the child the majority unnecessarily sacrifices the rights of the parents. In my view we only need to resort to \u00a7 45-43 and the cases that have construed it to arrive at a result which harmonizes these competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">It has long been the law in this state that prima facie the legal right to the custody of a minor child is in the surviving parent. <em>Kelsey </em>v. <em>Green, </em>69 Conn. 291, 298, 37 A. 679 ( 1897). Although the welfare of the child must be the controlling consideration \u201cwhere the controversy is not between the father and the mother, as it was not in this case, the [father] has a prior right to custody unless the circumstances are such that to give it to [him] would not be for the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Claffey </em>v. <em>Claffey, </em>146 Conn. 104, 109-10, 148 A.2d 140 (1959). General Statutes \u00a7 45-43 rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>forces that priority by declaring that the surviving parent is the sole guardian of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Therefore, to give the parent\u2019s priority its just due the burden must clearly fall on the nonparent to disprove this priority. This burden is a heavy one. The non-parent must do more than assert that it would be in the best interests of the child to live with the nonparent; she must prove that it would be detrimental to the best interests of the child to live with the parent. As we warned in <em>Antedomenico </em>v. <em>Antedomenico, </em>142 Conn. 558, 563, 115 A.2d 659 (1955), it will not be enough for the nonparent to prove that she can provide a better standard of living for the child. Nor will it be enough for the nonparent to assert that it is in the best interests of the child to keep her in the present nurturing environment of the nonparent. The non-parent must prove that it would be detrimental to the child to take her out of that environment and place her with the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Since, as the majority recognizes, this case implicates the parent\u2019s liberty interest, it requires a due process analysis. Due process is a flexible concept and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). Whether a particular procedure comports with due process requires an analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected. Identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors. \u201cFirst, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>would entail.\u201d <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The private interest affected, that of a surviving parent who is accorded a priority to custody by law, is compelling. See <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra. The risk of error from not giving that priority presumptive effect is substantial. For example, if the only issue before the court in a custody dispute between a parent and a stranger is the best interests of the child, how is one to know whether, in a given case, custody may not be awarded on the basis of who would be the better provider, the very basis we said could not be used in Antedomenico? The countervailing governmental interest, favoring considering the parent\u2019s interest as one factor among many, is comparatively slight, but even more important, would be more adequately served by a procedure which harmonized the best interests of the child standard with the policy declaration according the surviving parent sole guardianship of the person.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">This case should be viewed not as an isolated occurrence but rather as a paradigm of problems faced by the children of divorce. Divorce is a traumatic event which shatters the relationship between husband and wife. It is not intended nor should it be encouraged to shatter the relationship between a noncustodial parent (in most cases the father) and child. Our society is based on the premise of a nuclear family unit. When that unit is destroyed a custodial choice must be made between the competing interests of the two parents. The noncustodial parent usually is relegated to the role of financial supporter and occasional visitor. Nevertheless, it is hoped that the relationship between noncustodial parent and child, though diminished, will be maintained. If the custodial parent dies and the noncustodial parent is a suitable custodian then there is no reason why he should not become such custodian. The purpose of \u00a7 45-43 is to give the noncustodial par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ent one leg up in any custody dispute. In my view he should be awarded custody unless the nonparent can show that to award him custody would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The trial court did not determine that the plaintiff father was an unfit parent. Nor did it determine that returning the child to her father would be detrimental to her best interests. What it did determine was that the father failed to demonstrate that he could be a responsible, reliable caretaker and that removing the child from the nurturing environment of her grandmother would cause the child to suffer a grievous loss. In so finding the trial court misapplied the law. If the test in a custody suit between a parent and a stranger or relative for whom the child has developed an attachment is to be solely determined by the effect on the child of her removal from her nurturing environment, then I am afraid that the award of custody in a dissolution proceeding to all intents and purposes will become a severance of the parental relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent. Because I believe that in awarding custody to the defendant the trial court misapplied the law, I would vacate the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> The fact that under \u00a7 45-42b \u201c[t]he provisions of sections 45-42 to 45-45g, inclusive [are to] be liberally construed in the best interests of any minor child affected by them\u201d does not mean that the language contained in these sections is to be ignored. For example, \u00a7 45-43a provides that any adult relative may apply to the probate court for the removal of a parent as guardian and \u00a7 45-44c authorizes the probate court to remove a parent as guardian where it is shown, inter alia, that he is unfit or that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship and that to allow further time to establish such relationship would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest. Does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>majority suggest that under the liberally construed best interests standard contained in \u00a7 45-42b a probate court would be authorized to remove a parent as guardian whenever the court found that such removal was in the best interests of the child without specifically finding the specified statutory predicate for such removal? I think not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
