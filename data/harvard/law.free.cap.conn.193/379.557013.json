The plaintiff, by letter, requested that the division of special revenue (hereinafter the division) reinstate him as a fronton patron and that a reinstatement hearing, if required, be held at the division\u2019s earliest convenience. The division acknowledged the request on March 10,1980, stating, \u201c[tjhere is no statutory and/or regulatory requirement that the Division conduct a hearing regarding patron reinstatement. However, in an attempt to be fair . . . it is the Division\u2019s intention to grant your request.\u201d The division conducted a hearing on March 21,1980, at which time evidence was taken, and the plaintiff appeared and testified on his own behalf. On April 10, 1980, the division denied the request stating that reinstatement was not in the best interest of the state or jai alai and that circumstances relative to the ejection had not materially changed since June 22, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The plaintiff appealed this decision to the Superior Court. The division then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the gratuitous hearing was not required by statute or regulation and therefore that its decision was not appealable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>motion was denied by the court, <em>Wright, J., </em>on July 9, 1980. The division raised the same issue at trial by way of a special defense. At trial, the court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>without addressing the issue of jurisdiction, dismissed the appeal \u201cbecause the defendant\u2019s order denying plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement is a nullity and the court cannot order the defendant to grant reinstatement, for that too would be a nullity.\u201d The determinative issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff had a statutory right to a hearing which subsequently provided access to the court through the appeal provisions of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (hereinafter the UAPA). General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. This issue, being dispositive of the case, will be addressed first.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The UAPA \u201capplies to all agencies and agency proceedings not expressly exempted.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-185. The right to judicial review of an administrative decision under the UAPA is governed by \u00a7 4-183 (a) which provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person who has exhausted all administrative remedies . . . and who is aggrieved by a final decision in a <em>contested ease </em>is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal under this chapter . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">An \u201cagency\u201d is defined for the purposes of the UAPA as \u201ceach state board, commission, department or officer . . . authorized by law to make regulations or to determine contested cases.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (1). The division of special revenue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as established by \u00a7 12-557c of the General Statutes, is within the department of revenue services for administrative purposes only<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is responsible for implementing and adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tering the provisions of chapters 226 and 226b of the General Statutes. The division is empowered to adopt regulations governing the operation of jai alai frontons and to insure the integrity and security of fronton operations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We assume for the purposes of this decision that the division of special revenue is an \u201cagency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">A \u201ccontested case\u201d is defined as \u201ca proceeding, including but not restricted to rate-making, price fixing and licensing, in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2); <em>see Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 378 A.2d 547 (1977); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 372 A.2d 102 (1976). The test for determining contested case status has been well established and requires an inquiry into three criteria, to wit: (1) whether a legal right, duty or privilege is at issue, (2) and is statutorily required to be determined by the agency, (3) through an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The plaintiff urges this court to interpret \u00a7 4-166 (2) as defining as a \u201ccontested case\u201d any proceeding in which \u201ca hearing is in fact held.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A \u201chearing\u201d is gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>erally defined as a \u201c[proceeding of relative formality . . . generally public, with definite issues of fact and of law to be tried, in which . . . <em>parties proceeded against have [a] right to be heard . . </em>. .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.). In order for a proceeding to qualify as a \u201chearing\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4-166 (2), the party must have a statutory or regulatory right to be heard by the agency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469-71, 378 A.2d 547 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s request for reinstatement the division had promulgated \u00a7 12-574-D25 (c) (2) which stated: \u201cAn association conducting jai alai games under license from the commission shall eject from its grounds all unauthorized persons, known undesirables, touts, persons believed to be bookmakers, persons under suspension or ruled off, persons of lewd or immoral character, and persons guilty of boisterous or disorderly-conduct or other conduct detrimental to jai alai or the public welfare.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u00a7 12-574-D25 (c) (2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Except for the quoted section, there existed no additional statutory or regulatory enactments which provided for patron ejectment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>reinstatement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 12-574-D25 (c) (2) was directed solely to those licensed associations under the division\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, an examination of the regulations in force at the time; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-574-D1 et seq.; indicates that the rules and regulations were directed to \u201cassociations,\u201d or \u201clicensees\u201d together with their employees and the players. Although the division had authority to order the association to comply with its regulations, the trial court was correct in concluding that \u201c[tjhere exists no procedure for the commissioner to either eject or reinstate a patron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Although the \u201creinstatement hearing\u201d exhibited the characteristic elements of a hearing in that evidence was presented, witnesses were heard, and testimony was taken in an adversarial setting,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that the division was statutorily required to determine the eligibility for reinstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>of an ejected patron. Therefore, the proceeding, lacking the essential element of a \u201cright to be heard,\u201d remained gratuitous and did not qualify as a \u201chearing in fact held.\u201d Consequently, there was no contested case to which the provisions of the UAPA might apply.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees \u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 378 A.2d 547 (1977); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>171 Conn. 691, 372 A.2d 102 (1976). As such the trial court had no jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiffs appeal and the dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u201cWhere the trial court reaches a correct decision but on mistaken grounds, this court has repeatedly sustained the trial court\u2019s action if proper grounds exist to support it.\u201d <em>Favorite </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>176 Conn. 310, 317, 407 A.2d 974 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-557c (e) provides: \u201cWhenever the term commission on special revenue occurs or is referred to ... it shall be deemed to refer to the division of special revenue . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 4-38f. \u2018administrative purposes only,\u2019 DEFINED.

The plaintiffs view clearly misconstrues the holding of <em>Rybinski. </em>A close reading indicates that the court concluded that there existed no <em>statutory requirement </em>that the legal right be determined by the agency. The court in <em>Rybinski </em>noted that, in contrast to <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Berlin Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 373, 355 A.2d 265 (1974), and <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Children &amp; Youth Services, </em>168 Conn. 435, 439, 363 A.2d 103 (1975), there was no statutory requirement that a hearing be held, but even if such a hearing was required, the proceeding in question did not constitute a hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-10\"> The dictum in <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 469-71, 378 A.2d 547 (1977), should not be interpreted as altering the definition of \u201ccontested case.\u201d A \u201ccontested case\u201d is \u201ca proceeding ... in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of a party are required by statute to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing or in which a hearing is in fact held . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (2).
