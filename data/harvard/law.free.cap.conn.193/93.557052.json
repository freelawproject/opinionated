In a class action brought by the named plaintiff, John A. Campbell, for himself and others similarly situated, the plaintiff class sought injunctive and declaratory relief, mandamus, and compensatory damages from the named defendant, the New Milford board of education, and others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that the defendants\u2019 policy was ultra vires in light of governing state statutes, and unconstitutional in light of operative provisions of the Connecticut constitution and the United States constitution. The trial court rendered judgment for the defendants and the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The underlying facts are undisputed. The New Milford attendance policy, set out in an annually distributed student handbook, provides two sets of academic sanctions for students who are absent from school. Course credit is withheld from any student who, without receiving an administrative waiver, is absent from any year-long course for more than twenty-four class periods.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the calculation of the twenty-four maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>mum absences, all class absences are included except absences on school-sponsored activities or essential administrative business. In addition to the twenty-four absence limit, the course grade of any student whose absence from school is unapproved is subject to a five-point reduction for each unapproved absence after the first. In any one marking period, the grade may not, however, be reduced to a grade lower than 50, which is a failing grade. The grade reduction for unexcused absences is, like the twenty-four maximum absence policy, subject to administrative waiver. The policy of the school board entails extensive opportunities for counseling after a student\u2019s first confirmed unapproved absence from a class and thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The stated purpose of the attendance policy is educational rather than disciplinary. A student\u2019s disciplinary suspension from school, for reasons unrelated to attendance, is considered an approved rather than an unapproved absence. Such an absence cannot result in the diminution of a class grade although it may be counted, unless waived, as part of the twenty-four maximum absences for class credit. A student\u2019s absence from school, whether approved or unapproved, is not a ground for suspension or expulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">A student\u2019s report card lists, for each course, grades for each marking period, a final examination grade, a final grade, the amount of credit awarded, and the number of approved and unapproved absences. The report card conspicuously bears the following legend: \u201cA circled grade indicates that the grade was reduced due to unapproved absences.\u201d In the case of the named plaintiff, his report card indicated grade reductions by the circling of grades in each of his academic courses, with the result that in three of the courses his final grade was lowered from passing to failing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>course, Architectual Drafting II, where the plaintiffs final grade was passing despite an indicated reduction for unapproved absences, the report card assigned him no credit because of a total of thirty-eight absences, thirty-one of which were approved and seven of which were unapproved. Any report card thus discloses, on its face, those grades which are affected by the enforcement of the attendance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The plaintiffs appeal argues that the trial court erred in ruling that the defendants\u2019 attendance policy: (1) was not ultra vires or preempted by governing state statutes; (2) did not violate the rights of the plaintiff class to substantive due process under the Connecticut and the United States constitutions; (3) did not deprive the plaintiff class of procedural due process under the Connecticut and the United States constitutions; (4) did not deny the rights of the plaintiff class to equal protection of .the law under the Connecticut and the United States constitutions. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the defendant school board\u2019s policy is invalid because it conflicts with a number of state statutes. This argument is twofold, that the attendance policy is ultra vires because it exceeds the authority conferred upon local school boards by state law and that the policy is preempted by state statutes with which it is inconsistent. We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The authority of local boards of education derives from their role as agents of the state. \u201c[T]he furnishing of education for the general public, required by article eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution, is by its very nature a state function and duty.\u201d (Footnote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>omitted.) <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 368, 372, 355 A.2d 265 (1974). This responsibility has been delegated to local boards which, as \u201cagencies of the state in charge of education in the town . . . possess only such powers as are granted to them by the General Statutes expressly or by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>152 Conn. 144, 150, 204 A.2d 827 (1964); <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 248, 429 A.2d 481 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The trial court found authority for the defendant school board\u2019s attendance policy in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-220 and 10-221.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The first of these statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00a7 10-220, requires a local school board to \u201cimplement the educational interests of the state\u201d and to \u201cprovide such other educational activities as in its judgment will best serve the interests of the school district.\u201d The second statute, \u00a7 10-221, instructs local boards of education to \u201cprescribe rules for the management, studies, classification and discipline of the public schools.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>addition, the trial court noted that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-184 and 10-199<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> permit local school boards to investigate and to regulate \u201cthe irregular attendance of pupils at school.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The plaintiff contends that these statutes do not furnish support for the defendant school board\u2019s policy because its policy is properly to be characterized not as an academic regulation assigning a uniform grading value to classroom presence but rather as unauthorized punishment for nonattendance. The plaintiff concedes that school boards may properly require classroom teachers to take classroom participation into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>account in assigning numerical grades. Boards of education, however, according to the plaintiff, may not prescribe school-wide rules for nonattendance except by way of imposition of disciplinary sanctions of suspension and expulsion in accordance with the narrow and specifically defined procedures permitted by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-233a through 10-233f.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We do not read the school board\u2019s authority in so limited a fashion. The authority to adopt uniform rules concerning irregularity of attendance is necessarily implied in the conjunction of statutory provisions authorizing local implementation of the educational mission of the state. Significantly, \u00a7 10-220 expressly charges local boards with responsibility for the oversight of the school attendance of children from the ages of seven to sixteen made mandatory by \u00a7 10-184. Furthermore, the plaintiff\u2019s concession that school teachers, upon the instruction of local school boards, may properly consider class participation in the assignment of grades, logically implies the existence of an educational nexus between classroom presence and grading. If local school boards can delegate to others the authority to impose academic sanctions for nonattendance, the decision to adopt uniform school-wide rules for such sanctions can hardly be deemed ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">None of the out-of-state cases upon which the plaintiff relies compels the conclusion that school-wide academic sanctions for nonattendance should generally be adjudged to be ultra vires. It may well be improper to reduce a student\u2019s grade for nonattendance as an additional punishment for unrelated conduct leading to a suspension from class; <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>School District R-1, </em>41 Colo. App. 411, 413, 585 P.2d 935 (1978); <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>Bale, </em>521 S.W.2d 76, 78 (Ky. 1975); but this school board\u2019s program does not permit such double punishment. It would indubitably be unlawful to apply a nonattendance program in an unreasonable, capri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>cious, arbitrary or inequitable manner; <em>State ex rel. Miller </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>605 S.W.2d 160, 162 (Mo. App. 1980); <em>State ex rel. Sageser </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>559 S.W.2d 230, 234 (Mo. App. 1977); but no such allegation has been factually demonstrated. It would finally be troublesome to bar a truant student from further class attendance and from taking a final examination; <em>Matter of Blackman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>100 Misc. 2d 566, 568, 419 N.Y.S.2d 796 (S. Ct. 1978); but the defendant board\u2019s program neither removes such a student from class nor excuses further compliance with the state\u2019s compulsory education law. In short, the plaintiff has cited no authority for his claim that attendance rules promulgated by local school boards, if carefully drafted and fairly applied, are to be deemed per se ultra vires. Our own research has likewise revealed no such caselaw. We agree that such regulations fall within the authority granted to local school boards by the statutes of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">In the alternative, the plaintiff maintains that the defendant school board\u2019s attendance policy is preempted by state statutes governing school attendance. The trial court recognized that the state has enacted legislation dealing with truancy but held that the New Milford attendance policy \u201cdoes not impinge or encroach upon that area of attendance covered by state statute.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s argument to the contrary is that the state statutes which require daily attendance at school under threat of a court-imposed fine; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-184, 10-185 and 10-199;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are thwarted by a local school board policy which creates incentives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>for a student with a poor attendance record to give up on the term\u2019s work and to leave school. Furthermore, since the state statutes impose criminal sanctions for nonattendance, the plaintiff contends that a local school board is precluded from imposing alternative or additional sanctions by way of academic penalties. Finally, the plaintiff urges that the state statutes governing academic discipline, which require that a suspended or expelled student be afforded alternate educational opportunities; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-233c and 10-233d; be read as a mandate that any student be given full academic credit for completion of academic work, and as a prohibition of locally-imposed academic sanctions for nonattendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The defendant school board\u2019s reply to these arguments calls upon us to recognize a distinction between sanctions which are disciplinary in nature and sanctions which relate to academic requirements. The question is not whether we concur in the judgment of the defendant board of education that \u201clearning experiences that occur in the classroom are . . . essential components of the learning process\u201d or that \u201c[tjime lost from class tends to be irretrievable in terms of opportunity for instructional interaction.\u201d The policy decision that academic credentials should reflect more than the product of quizzes, examinations, papers and classroom participation nonetheless constitutes an academic judgment about academic requirements. We agree with the defendants\u2019 characterization of their policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Although the plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses opined that the defendants\u2019 policy is punitive in effect and operates to deter rather than to encourage school attend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>anee, the plaintiff adduced insufficient evidence to support these hypotheses. Indeed, the named plaintiff, after a junior year marred by repeated absences, many unexcused, had no difficulty meeting attendance requirements in the senior year, and graduated with his class in timely fashion. The record reveals only one student\u2019s failure to complete high school, allegedly because of the defendants\u2019 attendance policy. Without further probative evidence that the defendants\u2019 policy is disciplinary in intent or in effect, we cannot conclude that it operates in a manner that conflicts with state statutes governing compulsory school attendance or student discipline. See <em>Connecticut Theatrical Corporation </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>147 Conn. 546, 552, 163 A.2d 548 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Even if the defendant school board\u2019s attendance policy is authorized by the relevant state statutes, the plaintiff class asserts that the policy cannot pass constitutional muster. The plaintiff relies on provisions of our state and federal constitutions to raise three different constitutional claims: a right to substantive due process, a right to procedural due process, and a right to equal protection of the laws. The trial court, upon consideration of these claims, found no infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the New Milford attendance policy as violative of the requirements of substantive due process claims infringement of students\u2019 fundamental rights to public education, of students\u2019 liberty interests in their academic reputation and of students\u2019 property interests in grades reflecting academic achievement. The first of these claims is based on article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>eighth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the others rely on article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Of these substantive due process claims, the most serious is the charge of impairment of a fundamental right, because, if such an impairment were properly before us, the validity of the questioned governmental regulation would require strict scrutiny to determine whether the regulation was compellingly justified and narrowly drafted. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 285, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). We must therefore decide the applicability of the fundamental rights guaranteed by article eighth, \u00a7 1, to a school board\u2019s policy of imposing uniform school-wide academic sanctions for nonattendance. In <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 648-49, 376 A.2d 359 (1977), we held, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the context of state-wide disparities in the financing of public school education, that \u201celementary and secondary education is a fundamental right, [and] that pupils in the public schools are entitled to the equal enjoyment of that right.\u201d The plaintiff argues that <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill </em>implies that strict scrutiny must be the test for any and all governmental regulations affecting public school education. We disagree. The underlying issue in <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill </em>was the provision of \u201ca substantially equal educational opportunity\u201d for Connecticut students in the state\u2019s \u201cfree public elementary and secondary schools.\u201d Id., 649. This school board policy, which is neither disciplinary, see <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 144-45, 363 A.2d 68 (1975), and compare <em>Board of Curators of the University of Missouri </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 86-87, 98 S. Ct. 948, 55 L. Ed. 2d 124 (1978); nor an infringement of equal educational opportunity, does not jeopardize any fundamental rights under our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The standard by which the plaintiff\u2019s remaining substantive due process claims must be measured is therefore the more usual rational basis test. <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 314-15,417 A.2d 343 (1979). In order to succeed on these claims, the plaintiff bears the heavy burden of proving that the challenged policy has no reasonable relationship to any legitimate state purpose; <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>supra, 314-15; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Albanese, </em>144 Conn. 241, 249, 129 A.2d 606, appeal dismissed, 355 U.S. 15, 78 S. Ct. 36, 2 L. Ed. 2d 21 (1957); and that the plaintiff class has suffered a specific injury as a result of the policy\u2019s enforcement. <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 307, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>465, 471, 217 A.2d 698 (1966). The plaintiff has established neither the legal nor the factual predicate for meeting this burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The plaintiff argues that it is unconstitutionally arbitrary and capricious for the defendant school board to require student grades to reflect more than academic achievement. With respect to the plaintiffs liberty interest, we can find no factual impairment of whatever rights the plaintiff might possibly assert. Inspection of the report card of the named plaintiff discloses the relationship between his academic performance and the reduction in his grades and class credit that resulted from application of the attendance policy. The plaintiff has failed to show how a student\u2019s reputation could be injured by a report card in this form. With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s property interest, we find it difficult to understand how a uniform school-wide policy that links class grades with attendance can be on its face more arbitrary, as a constitutional matter, than are similar judgments by individual teachers who may justifiably, according to the plaintiff, adjust classroom grades to reflect classroom participation. Furthermore, the trial court made no findings of fact that application of the attendance policy was arbitrary or capricious in the only two specific cases about which evidence was adduced at trial. On this record, the plaintiff class has not proven infringement of its liberty or property interest in a fair grading system.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The plaintiff argues finally that impermissible vagueness in the waiver provisions that ameliorate the potential rigor of the defendant board\u2019s attendance policy requires the conclusion that the policy is substantively unconstitutional. The policy of grade reduction is subject to waiver for \u201coutstanding performance,\u201d and denial of class credit may be waived in extenuating circumstances calling for \u201cspecial consideration.\u201d These provisions for waiver are unconstitutional, according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>to the plaintiff, because they permit school administrators to exercise unbridled discretion and hence invite arbitrary action. It is, however, by no means clear that provisions for waiver, which necessarily depend upon the equities of particular circumstances, require the same degree of precision as must accompany the imposition of sanctions in the first instance. See <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Dumschat, </em>452 U.S. 458, 466-67, 101 S. Ct. 2460, 69 L. Ed. 2d 158 (1981). Significantly, the plaintiffs challenge for vagueness does not contest any part of the attendance policy other than its provisions of waiver. In any case, the plaintiff class has again failed to make the factual showing necessary to prove that it has suffered a constitutional injury. See <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973). The record contains no findings that any member of the class in fact misunderstood the waiver policy or was deprived of a waiver because of ambiguity in its statement. The plaintiffs claim of unconstitutional vagueness therefore cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The plaintiff also claims a deprivation of procedural due process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff maintains that the New Milford attendance policy fails to provide constitutionally mandated basic procedural safeguards because students are not given notice of the dates of their alleged absences and are not afforded the opportunity to contest the imposition of an academic penalty, either at an internal hearing or before the board of education. These omissions, according to the plaintiff, jeopardize accurate and fair application of the defendants\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Before we can consider this claim on its merits, we must clarify the standards that govern procedural fairness in a school setting. We have already held that the defendants\u2019 policy is academic rather than disciplinary in intent and effect, and that the policy impairs no fundamental rights. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently determined that flexible standards of procedural due process call for \u201cfar less stringent procedural requirements in the case of an academic dismissal\u201d than for a dismissal based on disciplinary reasons. <em>Board of Curators of the University of Missouri </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>435 U.S. 78, 86-87, 98 S. Ct. 948, 55 L. Ed. 2d 124 (1978). Compare <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 581, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1975). That court found it compelling that academic evaluations of a student necessarily depend upon professional judgments that are \u201cmore subjective and evaluative than the typical factual questions presented in the average disciplinary decision.\u201d <em>Board of Curators of the University of Missouri </em>v. <em>Horowitz, </em>supra, 90. For similar reasons, it is appropriate for this court to defer to the policy judgments of the academic administrators who formulated the defendant school board\u2019s attendance program.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such deferral does not of course obviate the fundamental requirements of procedural due process that a student must be given adequate notice of the program, and a meaningful timely opportunity to be heard. It does, however, mean that notice and hearings need not take any one particular form in order to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In this case, the plaintiff does not argue that students at New Milford High School were not provided with sufficient notice of the existent attendance policy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>of the academic sanctions that would ensue from recurrent class absences. The plaintiff asserts only that students had inadequate opportunities to contest whether absences had occurred, whether they were excused or unexcused, or whether they should be waived. The defendants introduced evidence to the contrary. In the absence of express findings by the trial court, we must conclude that the plaintiff class has not met the requirement that the challenged attendance program must be shown to have adversely affected a constitutionally protected right under the facts of this particular case rather than of some possible or hypothetical facts not proven to exist. <em>General Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>185 Conn. 583, 593, 441 A.2d 581 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuvelier, </em>175 Conn. 100, 111-12, 394 A.2d 185 (1978); <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The plaintiffs final constitutional claim invokes the equal protection provisions of article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. The plaintiff urges us to hold that because the defendant board\u2019s attendance policy permits waiver of grade reductions for unexcused absences, the policy creates two unequal classes of students: students who are denied a waiver and students who are granted a waiver. In part the plaintiff\u2019s argument depends upon the assertion that the defendants\u2019 classification, because it allegedly affects a fundamental right to education, must meet the test of strict scrutiny. That assertion we have rejected, supra. Even if the applicable test is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the waiver provision bears a reasonable relationship to legitimate governmental ends, the plaintiff argues that the waiver provision is constitutionally flawed because it ties eligibility for waiver to a student\u2019s \u201coutstanding performance for the latter portion of the marking period.\u201d It is irrational, and a violation of equal protection, according to the plaintiff, to waive grade reduction for students who do \u201coutstanding\u201d work and to impose such sanctions on students whose work is, because of academic difficulties unrelated to class absence, only average.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The defendants offer several answers to this argument. Factually, they deny the premise that the waiver provision favors students on account of their ability rather than on account of their effort, since work may be considered \u201coutstanding\u201d in light of a particular student\u2019s past performance. Legally, they note that the waiver provision imports a reasonable element of flexibility into the assessment of a student\u2019s total classroom performance.
