Kinsella, the elected Judge of Probate for the District of Hartford. Proceedings before the council were initiated by a complaint from Probate Judge Ralph D. Lukens to Probate Judge Glenn E. Knierim, the probate court administrator, relating to Judge Kinsella\u2019s management of the estate of Ethel Frances Donaghue, incapable (hereinafter the estate). In response to Judge Knierim\u2019s referral of Judge Lukens\u2019 complaint, the council undertook an investigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45-11e,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and then notified Judge Kinsella <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that it would, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 45-11f,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> conduct a hearing to determine whether his management of the estate had violated designated canons of the Code of Probate Judicial Conduct. A hearing was held at which Judge Kinsella, represented by his attorney, participated. The council subsequently recommended that Judge Kinsella, because of his violation of the canons of ethics, should be publicly censured in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 45-11g (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Kinsella thereupon took a timely appeal to this court as authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 45-11g (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Much of the underlying history of this case is essentially undisputed. The estate in question is that of Ethel Frances Donaghue, who was, in 1978, an elderly woman who owned a very large amount of property. Herself an attorney, she was accustomed to managing her own life and to designating her own caretakers. She had, for a number of years, relied upon the domestic services of Mr. and Mrs. Salvatore Lucca. She had selected Attorney William W. Graulty to supervise her financial affairs and to draft her estate plans. Although she had broken her elbow in the spring of 1978, she was then legally competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">In the fall of 1978, Judge Kinsella called Graulty to inquire about Donaghue\u2019s well-being. At a conference held on September 14, 1978, Graulty assured Judge Kinsella about Donaghue\u2019s competence to manage her affairs. At Judge Kinsella\u2019s request, Graulty submitted to Judge Kinsella a letter from Donaghue\u2019s private physician attesting to her satisfactory health. In December of that year, Donaghue\u2019s health deteriorated and Graulty then advised Judge Kinsella that a conservator-ship might be needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In early January, 1979, Judge Kinsella appointed Attorney Alexander A. Goldfarb, a friend of long stand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ing, to act as guardian ad litem to inquire into the desirability of a conservatorship. On January 15, the estate of Ethel F. Donaghue, incapable, was opened in the Hartford Probate Court by Judge Kinsella. Graulty and Goldfarb were designated to be co-conservators of the estate and of the person. Attorney Paul J. Aparo, a former law clerk in the Hartford Probate Court, was appointed as the new guardian ad litem. Thereafter Graulty and Goldfarb undertook to report to the court about the assets of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Without prior notice that his conduct of the estate was being questioned, Graulty was informed at a conference with Judge Kinsella on May 4, 1979, that the court had received an application from Aparo that Graulty be removed as co-conservator of the estate. Aparo alleged that Mr. and Mrs. Lucca were mismanaging the Donaghue household and that Graulty had sanctioned their misconduct. Despite Graulty\u2019s denial of these allegations, Judge Kinsella ordered that Mr. and Mrs. Lucca be discharged immediately and that the locks on the Donaghue premises be changed on that very day. The May 4 conference was attended by Graulty, Aparo and Judge Kinsella; Goldfarb did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Judge Kinsella held a hearing on May 18, 1979, to act on the application for Graulty\u2019s removal as co-conservator of the estate. Prior to the date of the hearing, Graulty had filed an application seeking the removal of Goldfarb and Aparo. At the hearing, Aparo was permitted to amend his application to request Graulty\u2019s removal not only as co-conservator of the estate but also as co-conservator of the person. Judge Kinsella refused, however, to consider a motion for his own disqualification presented at the hearing by counsel for Graulty, and took no action on Graulty\u2019s earlier-filed motion for the removal of Goldfarb and Aparo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Goldfarb did not attend the May 18 hearing, although he had received notice of Aparo\u2019s application and of the hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The evidence presented at the hearing was not sufficient to make out a prima facie case that Graulty should be removed. Nonetheless, after a conference of Judge Kinsella with all of those present and their attorneys, Graulty determined on May 21, 1979, that he would resign as co-conservator of the person, although he remained as co-conservator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">After these events, Judge Kinsella continued, until March, 1981, to play an active role in the Donaghue estate. He himself hired Professor Lester Snyder, then at the University of Connecticut School of Law, to review the estate plan that Graulty had drafted for Donaghue. He met privately with Donaghue in his chambers. After a contested hearing concerning the disposition of certain documents, at which the papers were publicly ordered to be returned to Donaghue, he then, without further hearing, privately ordered their delivery to Goldfarb.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">On March 9, 1981, after increasing public criticism of the management of the Donaghue estate, Judge Kinsella requested his removal as a judge in the estate. The Honorable Ralph D. Lukens was appointed in his stead and, at Judge Kinsella\u2019s official request, held hearings concerning the estate in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 45-262.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Lukens, after receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>extensive testimony, filed a memorandum of decision on September 24, 1981, in which he removed Graulty and Goldfarb from further responsibility for the estate. Aparo subsequently resigned. A few days later, on October 5, 1981, Judge Lukens filed with the Honorable Glenn E. Knierim, the probate court administrator, a complaint critical of the actions of Judge Kinsella. Thereupon, Judge Knierim transmitted the Lukens complaint to the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct, which issued its own complaint against Judge Kinsella in the proceedings currently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In the proceedings before the council, the council took judicial notice of the Lukens file. It was furthermore agreed that the entire file of the estate was to be an exhibit. The council heard testimony from various witnesses, including Judge Kinsella, who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Council on Probate Judicial Conduct was critical of Judge Kinsella\u2019s role in regard to many of these events. It is useful to relate these criticisms, as did the council, to various time periods: (1) the period before the establishment of the estate in the fall of 1978; (2) the period when the estate was first managed under the aegis of the Hartford Probate Court, in the early part of 1979; and (3) the period of controversy surrounding Graulty\u2019s conservatorship in May, 1979. In addition, the council criticized ex parte actions by Judge Kinsella throughout his superintendance of the Donaghue estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The council concluded that Judge Kinsella had wrongfully intervened in the affairs of Donaghue in the fall of 1978. The council determined that there was, in the early fall, no need for judicial intervention, and that Judge Kinsella had misrepresented to Graulty, in December, 1978, that Graulty would be appointed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>sole conservator, when the need for a conservatorship arose. This conduct, according to the council, violated Canon 1 of the Code of Probate Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The council concluded that Judge Kinsella had acted wrongfully in the appointments of Goldfarb and Aparo when the estate of Ethel Donaghue, incapable, was opened in the Probate Court on January 15, 1979. The council found that these appointments were motivated by favoritism and not by merit, and that they represented the exercise of bias and prejudice against Graulty. This conduct, according to the council, violated Canons 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1.01, 3.2.04 and 3.3.01. a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The council concluded that Judge Kinsella had acted wrongfully in his response to Aparo\u2019s May, 1979 application for the removal of Graulty from the estate. The council found that Judge Kinsella should have disqualified himself, as he had otherwise regularly done in contested matters involving Goldfarb. Furthermore, in the meeting of May 4, 1979, Judge Kinsella\u2019s conduct was criticized for failing to give Graulty adequate notice of the misdeeds of which Graulty was accused, for threatening Graulty, and for discharging the Luccas in disregard of the interests of Donaghue. The subsequent hearing, on May 18, 1979, was found to have been conducted in an impatient, undignified and discourteous manner which exhibited a lack of integrity and impartiality. These various acts of misconduct, according to the council, violated Canons 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1.01, 3.1.03, 3.1.04, 3.3.01. a, 3.3.01. d, and 3.1.05.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The council concluded that Judge Kinsella had acted wrongfully throughout the time that the estate was under his supervision, by engaging in ex parte communications concerning the estate. These communications, the council found, included conversations with his ward and with other persons including Goldfarb, Aparo and Snyder. These ex parte communications, the council found, influenced Judge Kinsella\u2019s judicial conduct in repeated rulings in favor of Goldfarb and Aparo and against Graulty. As a result, the council concluded that Judge Kinsella had violated Canons 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1.01, 3.1.04 and 3.3.01. a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Throughout its detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, the council emphasized its central determination that the relationship between Judge Kinsella and Goldfarb had a deleterious impact upon the decision-making by the judge with respect to the Donaghue estate. Specifically, in its final three conclusions, the council reiterated that \u201cKinsella, J. acted in concert with Goldfarb, and to a considerably lesser extent with Aparo, to help them to gain financial control over the Estate. . . . Kinsella,' J.\u2019s failure to disqualify himself, his ex parte actions and his handling of some parts and not others . . . were caused by his bias and prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>in favor of Goldfarb and Aparo and against Graulty. . . . Kinsella, J. [acted and ruled] in favor of and to the financial benefit of his friends Goldfarb and Aparo to the detriment of Graulty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Because of the wrongful handling of the estate of Ethel Donaghue in all of these particulars, the council recommended that a sanction of public censure should be imposed upon Judge Kinsella for his violation of the Canons of Ethics of the Code of Probate Judicial Conduct. In his appeal, Judge Kinsella urges us to reject the council\u2019s decision because: (1) the council\u2019s disputed findings of fact and conclusions of law were not supported by clear and convincing evidence; (2) the council\u2019s action resulted from erroneous procedural rulings; (3) the council\u2019s action resulted from erroneous evidentiary rulings; (4) the council violated the appellant\u2019s statutory right to confidentiality; and (5) the council\u2019s proceedings were unconstitutional. We conclude that these claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Before we can determine whether the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct erred in its findings of fact or its conclusions of law, we must first determine the procedural framework within which we operate. This is a case of first impression. We have not previously considered either the standard of proof that governs judicial conduct proceedings, or the standard of review that governs appeals from recommendations of public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">In its appraisal of the evidence against Judge Kinsella, the council expressly concluded that \u201c[t]he facts were found by clear and convincing proof.\u201d Although the statutes concerning probate judicial conduct fail to prescribe a standard of proof, we agree with the council\u2019s determination that judicial disciplinary proceedings require more than proof by a preponderance of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>dence. The vast majority of courts in other jurisdictions have similarly concluded that the proper standard is clear and convincing proof. <em>In re Hanson, </em>532 P.2d 303, 307-308 (Alaska 1975); <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Performance, </em>19 Cal. 3d Spec.

J. 425, 429, 371 A.2d 41 (1977) (beyond a reasonable doubt); see also ABA Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline \u00a7 7.10 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The more difficult procedural question concerns the scope of our review. In many jurisdictions, the commission that investigates judicial misconduct is authorized only to make recommendations to the state supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>court. Consequently, the reviewing court is entitled, indeed obligated, to reach its own conclusions as to the facts found by the commission and as to the recommendation that discipline be imposed upon a judge. E.g., <em>In re Hanson, </em>supra, 308-309; <em>Geiler </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, </em>10 Cal. 3d 270, 276, 515 P.2d 1, 110 Cal. Rptr. 201 (1973); <em>In re Terry, </em>supra, 670-71 n.2; <em>In re Rome, </em>supra, 198-99; <em>In re Diener &amp; Broccolino, </em>supra, 670, 689; <em>In re Nowell, </em>supra, 246-47; <em>Matter of Heuermann, </em>supra, 317-18; see ABA Standards Relating to Judicial Discipline \u00a7 7.8 (1978). Our statute reads differently. Under General Statutes \u00a7 45-llg, while the decision of the council to reprimand or to censure a probate judge is denominated a recommendation, the recommended reprimand or censure is final, and will become public,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in the absence of a timely appeal by the judge to this court. In these circumstances, our review is not de novo. We cannot assess the credibility of witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 610, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 647, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980). Nonetheless, our review must take into account the risk that unfounded charges of judicial misconduct will impair society\u2019s interest in an independent judiciary. We must therefore depart from our normal rule of deference to factfinding by trial courts and administrative agencies. We have a nondelegable responsibility, upon an appeal, to undertake a scrupulous and searching examination of the record to ascertain whether there was substantial evidence to support the council\u2019s factual findings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>188 Conn. 574, 580, 452 A.2d 634 (1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1089, 103 S. Ct. 1785, 76 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 219, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The findings of the probate council are attacked by Judge Kinsella on the grounds that the council erroneously: (1) shifted the burden of proof to Judge Kinsella; (2) made findings without proper evidence; (3) characterized the evidence in its findings and conclusions; and (4) relied on minutiae and irrelevancies in its findings and conclusions. We conclude that these claims have not been substantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The claim that the council erroneously placed upon Judge Kinsella the burden of disproving his misconduct arises out of various findings by the council in which the council took note of lacunae or imprecision in the testimony of the judge and those who testified in his behalf. It is not necessary to detail the challenged findings because they are clearly not vulnerable on this ground. In evaluating the evidence presented by the various witnesses, the council necessarily was free to draw inferences from what they said, how they said it, and what they did not say. As long as there was positive evidence in support of the council\u2019s findings, corroboration by way of the weakness of the opposing case was not inadmissible. Judge Kinsella\u2019s reliance on <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>191 Conn. 46, 56, 463 A.2d 578 (1983), and <em>Ruscito </em>v. <em>F-Dyne Electronics Co., </em>177 Conn. 149, 166, 411 A.2d 1371 (1979), is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The claim that the council\u2019s findings were unsupported by proper evidence suffers from an effort to tar these findings with too broad a brush. We cannot agree with the proposition that the sufficiency of evidentiary support for findings of fact is a matter that is arithmetically quantifiable. We reject the proposition that a finding supported by only one piece of evidence, no matter how probative, necessarily fails the test of clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The main thrust of the attack on the findings of the council is the claim that there was insufficient evidence to support findings about the relationship between Judge Kinsella and Goldfarb and about the propriety of Judge Kinsella\u2019s determinations with respect to the Donaghue estate. Careful review of the entire record persuades us that this claim cannot succeed. The council had before it not only the evidence of the witnesses that appeared in the present proceedings, but also the record of the proceedings before Judge Lukens, of which the council took judicial notice. There was sufficient evidence to find, by clear and convincing proof, that Goldfarb had private communications with Judge Kinsella about the Donaghue estate, and that his tenure as co-conservator resulted from favoritism by J\u00fadge Kinsella rather than from an objective appraisal of the needs of the Donaghue estate. Similarly, there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that Donaghue\u2019s condition did not warrant the remedial measures that the judge unilaterally implemented. It was not error, as is claimed, for the council, in making its determinations, to adopt the testimony of one witness and to reject the conflicting testimony of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Finally, the findings are attacked because they make determinations not only about what transpired but about the manner in which Judge Kinsella confronted the various parties and their attorneys. We view these adjectival characterizations as of secondary importance in light of the ample evidence of substantive misconduct. Of necessity, findings about motivation and prejudgment are difficult to substantiate. The evidence on the record does, however, provide support for these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The claim that the council\u2019s factual findings, if otherwise supported, must be deemed erroneous because of their excessive detail is similarly unpersuasive. As a general proposition, findings are more vulnerable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>criticism if they are so imprecise as to evade review upon appeal than if they are so detailed that they dwell on the marginally relevant. We are not persuaded that the detailed findings of the council in this case detract from the central factual findings which have been clearly and convincingly proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">We conclude therefore, on the basis of our own review of the voluminous record before us, that the central facts concerning Judge Kinsella\u2019s stewardship of the Donaghue estate have been established by clear and convincing proof. Judge Kinsella was shown to have damaged the integrity and the independence of the judiciary, in violation of Canon 1 of the Code of Probate Judicial Conduct, by placing his friend Goldfarb and his former associate Aparo in a position to benefit financially from the Donaghue estate and by failing to disqualify himself when his bias on their behalf was reasonably called into question. Canon 1 was further violated by Judge Kinsella\u2019s ex parte communications and actions concerning the estate, and his disregard of Donaghue\u2019s interest in her relationship with her chosen caretakers. Judge Kinsella\u2019s conduct in these respects also violated the obligation of a judge, under Canon 2, to avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety, and, under Canon 3, to perform the duties of his office impartially and diligently. Judge Kinsella\u2019s conduct certainly gave at least the appearance of favoritism toward Goldfarb and Aparo and bias against Graulty. Judge Kinsella\u2019s failure to disqualify himself and his ex parte actions concerning the Donaghue estate were inconsistent with the obligations of his office. Because these well-established findings are sufficient to support a recommendation of censure, we need not determine whether each of the council\u2019s other findings would independently warrant an adverse recommendation. In the totality of circumstances manifested by the entire record before us, we agree that a public censure was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Judge Kinsella urges us to find that the council made numerous procedural errors which require us to set aside its recommendation of censure. He complains of the council\u2019s adverse rulings on: (1) his request for a more particular statement of the charges against him; (2) his requests for discovery; (3) his motion for dismissal of the charges on grounds of estoppel or res judicata; (4) his motion for disqualification of the council for bias or prejudice; and (5) his requests for a continuance. We conclude that these complaints have not been substantiated on the record of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We agree with Judge Kinsella that his procedural rights are not circumscribed by the provisions of \u00a7 45-11f that specify only a judge\u2019s right to counsel and cross-examination. Fundamental fairness requires notice of the charges to be answered and a reasonable opportunity to respond thereto. <em>Fermont Division </em>v.

The council\u2019s conduct of its proceedings in this case afforded to Judge Kinsella the procedural rights to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The motion for a more specific statement claims that Judge Kinsella received inadequate notice of the charges against him. Judge Kinsella knew, from the outset, that the investigation concerned his manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ment of the Donaghue estate, because he himself had initiated the investigation by his letter of March 5, 1981.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Before the council hearing began on October 4, 1982, Judge Kinsella had received a copy of Judge Lukens\u2019 letter to Judge Knierim specifying six items of questionable conduct warranting complaint to the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> a letter from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the council listing the violations of the Canons of Probate Judicial Conduct with which he was charged, and a further detailed letter from the council\u2019s attorney linking Judge Lukens\u2019 complaints with the canons. The attorney\u2019s letter further apprised Judge Kinsella of the names of the witnesses that would be called and the documentary evidence which would be relied upon. In their totality, these letters adequately apprised the judge of the charges against him. See <em>In re Gillard, </em>271 N.W.2d 785, 807-808 (Minn. 1978); <em>Matter of Storie, </em>supra, 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The council refused to act on Judge Kinsella\u2019s motion for discovery of inculpatory or exculpatory evidence in its investigative files. Concededly, there is no statutory basis for this motion. It may well be that, in some circumstances, crucial information would be so unavailable to a judge whose conduct was under scrutiny that fundamental fairness would require timely disclosure. The present case does not call for such unusual measures. The charges against Judge Kinsella concerned his conduct, often in his own courtroom, in proceedings to which he had access as of record. The transcripts and the exhibits in the proceedings before Judge Lukens were available to him and his attorneys. Denial of this motion was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>McCartney </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, </em>supra, 520; <em>In re Dupont, </em>322 So. 2d 180, 183 (La. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Judge Kinsella\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds of estoppel or res judicata was based on prior investigations by the council into appointments of Attorney Goldfarb, where the council, he claimed, had concluded that there had been no impropriety or appearance of impropriety. If in fact such a prior determination had encompassed the management of the Donaghue estate, we would have to reach the question of finality of decision-making in the context of a commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>inquiry into judicial misconduct. See <em>Cannon </em>v. <em>Commission on Judicial Qualifications, </em>14 Cal. 3d 678, 704, 537 P.2d 898, 122 Cal. Rptr. 778 (1975); <em>In re Inquiry Concerning a Judge (Lee), </em>336 So. 2d 1175, 1177 (Fla. 1976); <em>In re Kelly, </em>238 So. 2d 565, 570 (Fla. 1970). The record before us, however, reveals neither the issues previously adjudicated nor the claims that might then have been raised. In these circumstances, the denial of the motion to dismiss was justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Judge Kinsella sought to have the council disqualify itself for bias and prejudice because of the adverse media publicity which the Donaghue estate had engendered. The only argument offered to the council when this motion was presented was an expression of concern about how the panel might feel about the case. Without further evidentiary allegations, the council was not obligated to grant the motion to disqualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Finally, Judge Kinsella maintains that the council should have granted his requests for continuance of the proceedings against him. Two reasons were advanced, the unavailability of his chosen attorney and the trial responsibilities of his substitute attorney. The denial of these requests must be evaluated in the context of a hearing which was scheduled on July 9,1982, to take place on October 4, 5 and 6, 1982. In the light of this significant advance notice, the denial of a continuance cannot be considered an abuse of the council\u2019s discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>181 Conn. 237, 240, 435 A.2d 20 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeustiniano, </em>172 Conn. 275, 284-85, 374 A.2d 209 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>162 Conn. 112, 121, 291 A.2d 750 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In sum, we find no error in the council\u2019s disposition of the various procedural motions that we have been asked to review. The council\u2019s conduct was consistent with the requirements of procedural due process, which, in the absence of more stringent statutory mandates, must govern its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Judge Kinsella claims that the council made numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings. He complains about (1) the admission of hearsay opinions from Judge Knierim; (2) the admission of the Lukens report; (3) the refusal to permit relevant testimony from Judge Kinsella; and (4) the allowance of improper cross-examination of Judge Kinsella. We disagree with these evidentiary complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Judge Knierim was permitted, over objection, to testify about his receipt of unfavorable comments about the Donaghue estate. In his capacity as probate court administrator, Judge Knierim had an interest in the existence of such derogatory comments, regardless of their truth. It was for this limited purpose that his testimony was offered and received. Viewed either as testimony admissible as a verbal act; <em>Gyro Brass Mfg. Corporation </em>v. <em>United Automobile Workers, </em>147 Conn. 76, 80, 157 A.2d 241 (1959); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tolisano, </em>136 Conn. 210, 214-15, 70 A.2d 118 (1949); or as testimony admissible for its effect as a communication upon its hearer; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 192 n.1, 377 A.2d 275 (1977); the testimony did not constitute hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The Lukens report was received by the council when, with the consent of Judge Kinsella\u2019s attorney, it took judicial notice of the Lukens file and received as an exhibit the entire file covering the Donaghue estate. Objections about the admissibility of any of these documents cannot survive these evidentiary concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The council did not abuse its discretion in its rulings concerning the examination and cross-examination of Judge Kinsella. The council excluded some exculpatory evidence about the May 4 hearing because it purported to provide detail concerning that event which Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Kinsella had previously indicated that he could not recollect. The council refused to allow Judge Kinsella to testify about the discharge of the Luccas partly because of the form of the question and partly because of prior exclusion, at Judge Kinsella\u2019s behest, of a similar line of inquiry with other witnesses. The council permitted Judge Kinsella to be asked, with obvious relevance to a charge of an appearance of impropriety, whether the public would be able to know why he had sought Graulty\u2019s removal. Over objection, Judge Kinsella admitted that there was no way to know \u201cif you wanted to do a favor for Mr. Goldfarb or in fact Mr. Graulty should have been removed, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d That question, the only instance of allegedly partisan cross-examination which has been brought before us, does not exceed the bounds of propriety. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 506-507, 418 A.2d 870, vacated and remanded on other grounds, 444 U.S. 893, 100 S. Ct. 199, 62 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1979); <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Singer, </em>158 Conn. 29, 36, 255 A.2d 858 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The issue, in our review of these evidentiary questions, is not whether, in each instance, this court would have made the same rulings as did the council. Like a court of law or an administrative tribunal, the council had considerable latitude to determine, in its discretion, what evidence to permit or to exclude. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 621, 469 A.2d 767 (1983). We conclude, upon examination of the record, that Judge Kinsella has established no abuse of discretion in the council\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Judge Kinsella charges the council with impairment of his statutory right of confidentiality. Under \u00a7 45-1 If, hearings of the council \u201cshall not be public unless requested by the judge of probate under investigation.\u201d Further, \u00a7 45-1 lg provides that the pendency of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>appeal from a recommendation of public censure \u201cshall stay the publication of notice of the censure appealed from and all facts relating to it.\u201d Judge Kinsella has, at all times, in accordance with these statutory provisions, sought to protect his right to have these proceedings remain confidential. He claims that the council violated these rights in that: (1) complaints and hearing dates were repeatedly publicized and sensationalized; (2) John McNerney, an investigator for the council\u2019s attorney, was present at the hearings; and (3) there was an unauthorized disclosure of the recommendation of censure to a local newspaper. Although we agree that Judge Kinsella had a statutorily protected right of confidentiality at the time of these proceedings, we conclude that he has not demonstrated that the council violated that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It is undeniable that the management of the Donaghue estate was the subject of extensive media coverage, much of it unfavorable. That fact was an acknowledged reason for Judge Kinsella\u2019s decision to remove himself from the estate on March 9,1981, and his virtually simultaneous request for an impartial inquiry into his stewardship. Judge Kinsella, by letter of October 21, 1981, urged the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct to investigate how proceedings before Judge Lukens had come to be publicly reported. The council properly denied this request, on November 12, 1981, since its power of investigation is limited, by statute, to the conduct of a judge of probate. We know of no authority, and none has been cited to us, which would entirely preclude an orderly investigation of judicial misconduct on the ground of prior adverse public comment. If fairly conducted to avoid prejudice in the hearing itself, the adjudicatory process may go forward. <em>Dobbert </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>432 U.S. 282, 303, 97 S. Ct. 2290, 53 L. Ed. 2d 344, reh. denied, 434 U.S. 882, 98 S. Ct. 246, 54 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1977); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>U.S. 794, 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 688-89, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">On the record before us, Judge Kinsella has failed to substantiate his claim that the council itself acted in a manner that was prejudiced or contributed to adverse comment against him. There is no evidence that the council improperly \u201cpublicized and sensationalized\u201d the complaint that had been received or the hearing dates that had been set. Judge Kinsella has not alleged, nor does the record show, that he was actually prejudiced by the presence of the investigator who was assisting the council\u2019s attorney. The council, under \u00a7 45-11e, had direct statutory authority to engage an attorney to \u201cconduct the examination of witnesses . . . present any evidence deemed relevant, cross-examine witnesses . . . and perform such other duties as the council deems necessary for the conduct of its business.\u201d It is implicit in this grant of statutory authority that the attorney designated by the council may, with the permission of the council, utilize the services of an associate or an investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Finally, the council did not improperly release information about its decision to the media. At the conclusion of the hearing, the council discussed the likely media interest in the outcome of the proceedings with Judge Kinsella\u2019s attorney. At that time, the attorney indicated: \u201cI trust your discretion and I understand, I understand . . . your desire to have some response [to media inquiries].\u201d In the following spring, a local newspaper carried a story in which a reporter inferred that the council had decided to discipline Judge Kinsella, \u201cbecause the decision has not been made public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>yet.\u201d The bare announcement that the council had reached a decision does not constitute an unauthorized disclosure of the recommendation of censure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In his final claim of error, Judge Kinsella argues that the council\u2019s proceedings were unconstitutional. This claim is twofold. First, Judge Kinsella argues that the legislature had no constitutional authority to create the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct. Second, he argues that the council\u2019s proceedings violated his right to procedural due process of law. We find no merit in either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Judge Kinsella\u2019s first constitutional claim is that because the Connecticut constitution does not specifically authorize the legislature to provide for the discipline of probate judges, the sole remedy for misconduct by an elected probate judge is for the electorate to deny the judge another term in office.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The principal case upon which this argument turns is <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). There we held (pp. 164-66, 169-70) that the legislature could not constitutionally authorize the chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>court administrator to suspend a probate judge for misconduct. We explained that a legislature powerless to alter the constitutionally designated four year term of office of probate judges; Conn. Const., art. Y, \u00a7 4; was equally powerless to prescribe a disciplinary suspension process that \u201cin effect may actually amount to a removal.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 166. At the same time, in upholding the rule-making and the administrative provisions of the statutes regulating the probate courts, we held that these statutes did not unconstitutionally intrude on the inherent judicial authority of the probate courts so as to violate the constitutional separation of powers. Id., 156-57. In that regard, we recognized that there is fundamentally greater legislative authority over legislative courts, created pursuant to article V, \u00a7 1 of the Connecticut constitution, than over constitutional courts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Judge Kinsella relies on <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow </em>to raise two constitutional challenges to \u00a7 \u00a7 45-lld through 45-1 li, the statutes that empower the Council on Probate Judicial Conduct to impose disciplinary sanctions upon probate judges. He maintains, first, that because the legislature lacks the power to suspend a probate judge, it also lacks the power to censure him. Second, he maintains that disciplinary proceedings involving probate judges require the same specific constitutional underpinning<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that exists for the Judicial Review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Council in its disciplinary supervision of the judges of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow </em>rebuts both of these arguments. Nothing in our constitution forbids the imposition of sanctions that do not operate to shorten the elected term of office of a judge of a legislative court. Courts of other jurisdictions have similarly held that a constitutional prescription of legislative impeachment as the sole method of removing a judge from office does not bar the imposition of lesser sanctions, such as suspension or censure, by other bodies, pursuant to other procedures. S <em>ee In the Matter of Bonin, </em>375 Mass. 680, 711-12, 378 N.E.2d 669 (1978); <em>Matter of Storie, </em>574 S.W.2d 369, 373 (Mo. 1978); <em>In re Mussman, </em>112 N.H. 99, 101-102, 289 A.2d 403 (1972); <em>In re Hon. Charles E. Kading, </em>70 Wis. 2d 508, 522-23, 235 N.W.2d 409 (1975); cf. <em>Dostert </em>v. <em>Neeley, </em>498 F. Sup. 1144, 1153 (S.D. W. Va. 1980) (constitutional provision permitting temporary suspension of judge by supreme court of appeals not in conflict with constitutional provision for impeachment by legislature). For legislative courts such as the probate courts, \u201cthe General Assembly has the power to make reasonable rules of administration, practice and procedure provided that they do not significantly interfere with the orderly operation of the court while it remains in existence as a court.\u201d <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 156-57. Judge Kinsella has neither claimed nor shown that the legislative prescription of an administrative mechanism for the investigation, reprimand and censure of probate judges undermines the ability of the probate courts to function as courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>so as to violate the constitutional principles of separation of powers found in article second of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These constitutional challenges must, therefore, be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Judge Kinsella\u2019s final claim is that the council\u2019s proceedings violated his right to procedural due process of law. This claim is composed primarily of attacks on the same procedural and evidentiary rulings that we have previously considered and determined to be without error. We likewise find no merit in the composite due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">At their core, the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions require that one subject to a significant deprivation of liberty or property must be accorded adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 333-34, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976); <em>Hart Twin Volvo Corporation </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 42, 44-46, 327 A.2d 588 (1973). These requirements undoubtedly apply in the context of judicial disciplinary proceedings. <em>In the Matter of Del Rio, </em>400 Mich. 665, 683-84, 256 N.W.2d 727 (1977); <em>In re Nowell, </em>293 N.C. 235, 241-42, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">As noted above, both Judge Kinsella and his attorney were adequately advised, by letter, of the nature of the charges against the judge. At the hearing, Judge Kinsella was represented by his attorney, who cross-examined witnesses and offered evidence on the judge\u2019s behalf. Judge Kinsella failed to substantiate his claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>that any of the council\u2019s rulings exceeded the bounds of its discretion or that any of the council\u2019s members was prejudiced against him. There is nothing in the totality of the council\u2019s conduct in these proceedings to cause us to conclude that the individual claims of error, which we have rejected, combined to deprive Judge Kinsella of a meaningful opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, a careful review of all of the evidence before the council demonstrates that the council\u2019s central findings of fact were supported by clear and convincing evidence, that its conclusions about multiple violations of the Canons of the Code of Probate Judicial Conduct were warranted, and that its recommendation of public censure of Judge Kinsella was appropriate. Accordingly, Judge Kinsella\u2019s final claim of error must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 45-lle provided, at the time of these proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8p\">\u201c(a) The council on probate judicial conduct shall investigate any complaint involving a judge of probate, on the written request of the chief justice, chief court administrator, probate court administrator or president-judge of the Connecticut probate assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201c(b) The council may, on its own motion, investigate conduct of judges of probate which may violate any law or canon of ethics applicable to judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>of probate, or failure to perform properly the duties of the office, or the wilful failure to file a financial statement or the filing of a fraudulent financial statement required under section 45-11j.
