We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The plaintiff, Eastern Elevator Company, Inc., and the defendant executed a contract on July 2, 1980, for the sale and installation of an elevator. The plaintiff agreed to sell, deliver and install the elevator for which the defendant agreed to pay. The plaintiff performed the contract and made demand for $27,428.12 for so doing. After the defendant paid $10,000 on this debt nothing further was paid although a demand was made for the balance due. This action was instituted to seek the principal balance of $17,428.12 plus interest and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel filed his appearance on September 17, 1982, two days after the action was returned to court. On October 25, 1982, the plaintiff filed a motion for default for failure to plead, which appeared on the short calendar on November 12, 1982, and was granted by the court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>on November 15, 1982. On November 24, 1982, the plaintiff filed its motion for judgment which appeared on the short calendar on December 13, 1982, but was marked off by agreement of counsel. This motion next appeared on the short calendar on January 3, 1983. It was granted on January 6, 1983, by the court, <em>Celotto, J., </em>in the amount of $20,826.60. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>February 7,1983, the Superior Court, upon the plaintiffs application, issued a property execution. Thereafter, on March 1,1983, the defendant filed his motion to open default and judgment after default.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On that date, after hearing argument by both counsel, the trial court, <em>Fracasse, J., </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the defense presented in his motion was sufficient as a matter of law to support his motion, and (2) an affidavit filed under General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 is assumed to be well pleaded and the test the trial court should have applied is whether the affidavit on its face states a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The power of a court to open a default judgment is controlled by \u00a7 52-212 of the General Statutes. <em>A.D.C. Contracting &amp; Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Thomas J. Riordan, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 579, 580, 409 A.2d 1027 (1979); <em>Munch </em>v. <em>Willametz, </em>156 Conn. 6, 9, 238 A.2d 424 (1968); see Practice Book \u00a7 377. That statute provides in relevant part that any judgment rendered upon a default \u201c(a) . . . may be set aside . . . upon the complaint or written motion of any party or person prejudiced thereby, showing reasonable cause, or that a good . . . defense . . . existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment . . . <em>and </em>that the . . . defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from . . . making the defense.\u201d It further provides that \u201c(b) [t]he complaint or written motion . . . shall state in general terms the nature of the . . . defense . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 377 contains substantially similar language. It is thus clear that there is a two-pronged test to set aside a judgment rendered after a default. <em>A.D.C. Contracting &amp; Supply Corporation </em>v. <em>Thomas J. Riordan, Inc., </em>supra, 580-81. There must be a showing that (1) a good defense, the nature of which must be set forth, existed at the time judgment was rendered, and (2) the party seeking to set aside the judgment was prevented from making that defense because of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212; Practice Book \u00a7 377; <em>Kaplan &amp; Jellinghaus </em>v. <em>Newfield Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 290, 292, 426 A.2d 278 (1979); <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>172 Conn. 520, 523, 375 A.2d 1009 (1977). The plaintiff argues that the defendant\u2019s motion and accompanying affidavit do not satisfy either prong of the test and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. \u201c \u2018Whether proceeding under the common law or a statute, the action of a trial court in granting or refusing an application to open a judgment is, generally, within the judicial discretion of such court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>and its action will not be disturbed on appeal unless it clearly appears that the trial court has abused its discretion. See <em>Freccia </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>163 Conn. 160, 165, 302 A.2d 280 [1972]; <em>Stocking </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>156 Conn. 70, 72, 238 A.2d 421 [1968]; 46 Am. Jur. 2d, Judgments, \u00a7 682.\u2019 <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>172 Conn. 520, 523-24, 375 A.2d 1009 [1977]; <em>Sebastiano </em>v. <em>Corde, </em>171 Conn. 324, 325, 370 A.2d 946 [1976]. General Statutes \u00a7 49-15. \u2018The denial of such relief to a party who has suffered a default judgment by his failure to defend properly should not be held an abuse of discretion where the failure to assert a defense was the result of the moving party\u2019s own negligence.\u2019 <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 524; <em>Jaquith </em>v. <em>Revson, </em>159 Conn. 427, 431, 270 A.2d 559 [1970]; <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Robington, </em>139 Conn. 532, 95 A.2d 66 [1953].\u201d <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Stage Harbor Corporation, </em>181 Conn. 141, 143-44, 434 A.2d 341 (1980); see <em>Kaplan &amp; Jellinghaus </em>v. <em>Newfield Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the defense presented was sufficient as a matter'of law to support his motion. This claim lacks merit. While admitting that the defense presented in his motion was \u201csketchy and brief,\u201d he argues it is sufficient, claiming that \u00a7 52-212 requires only that the moving party state \u201cin general terms the nature of the . . . defense\u201d and that \u201c[a] great deal is not required of the Defendant, only that a defense existed at the time of the rendition of the Judgment.\u201d There is no \u201cshowing\u201d; <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 523; that the defense asserted existed at the time of the judgment as the first prong of the test requires. While the nature of the defense may be stated in \u201cgeneral terms,\u201d this \u201cshowing\u201d is critical. Significantly, at the hearing on the motion, the court inquired whether the plaintiff \u201chad any correspondence with the defendant regarding either the liability or the payment?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>cated that she had had \u201ctelephone conversation with the defendant\u2019s attorney.\u201d Not once during that hearing did the defendant\u2019s counsel indicate the time when, with reference to the time the judgment was rendered, the defense now asserted had arisen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, mere lack of knowledge that a particular defense was available is insufficient cause for opening a judgment. Id. The claim that the defense presented was sufficient as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d is, therefore, rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The defendant next claims that General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 \u201crequires\u201d the court to \u201cassume\u201d the defense set out in the affidavit accompanying the motion to open to be \u201cwell pleaded\u201d and that the test is whether the affidavit states a defense. He suggests, in advancing this argument, that a proper analogy may be made to a motion to strike, where the factual accuracy of the pleadings is assumed and the legal sufficiency of the allegations is tested. See Practice Book \u00a7 152. We must reject this \u201cpresumption\u201d approach to a motion under \u00a7 52-212. It misconceives our case law construing \u00a7 52-212 and the suggested analogue to motions to strike is wide of the mark. We do not know of and have not been referred to any tenets of statutory construction that \u201crequire\u201d any such \u201cpresumption.\u201d The moving party on a motion to open must not only \u201callege,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>but also make a \u201cshowing\u201d sufficient to satisfy the two-pronged test of \u00a7 52-212; <em>Kaplan &amp; Jellinghaus </em>v. <em>Newfield Yacht Sales, Inc., </em>supra, 292; <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 524; <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Carrolls Hamburger System, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 294, 300, 224 A.2d 739 (1966); unaided by the suggested \u201cpresumption.\u201d Where it appears, as it does here, that the defendant did not present a defense that existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment, a denial of the motion is proper. The defendant has not satisfied the first prong of \u00a7 52-212 and this alone provides a proper basis for the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We further point out that under the second prong of the statute the defendant has not sustained his burden of showing that he was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from making the claimed defense. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212; <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>supra, 525. The affidavit accompanying the motion to open does not aid him here. Moreover, the transcript of the hearing of March 1, 1983, discloses nothing to satisfy the second prong. At that time, the court, by its inquiry, did establish that the defendant had notice both of the motion for default for failure to plead and of the motion for judgment on default.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The statute is remedial, but it is intended to confine the opening of default judgments to meritorious cases. See <em>Testa </em>v. <em>Carrolls Hamburger System, Inc., </em>supra, 297. This has not been demonstrated to be such a case. The defendant has satisfied neither prong of \u00a7 52-212. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to open.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\"> The defendant was represented in the trial court by the same attorney who represents him on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The motion and accompanying affidavit were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cMOTION TO REOPEN DEFAULT AND JUDGMENT AFTER DEFAULT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">The Defendant in the above captioned matter respectfully moves that the Default and Judgment After Default be reopened in accordance with the affidavit annexed hereto and that pursuant to Section 52-212, that the Plaintiff be enjoined from enforcing such judgment until a hearing on this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">THE DEFENDANT By <em>Isl </em>David M.
