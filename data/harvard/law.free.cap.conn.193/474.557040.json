J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8V\">The defendant was convicted by a jury of the crimes of murder, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), and assault in the first degree, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1). He has appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of guilty, entered pursuant to the conviction. We find error both in the trial court\u2019s instructions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>the jury and in the state\u2019s failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: At or about 7:45 p.m. on March 22,1975, Steven Lawry and a female companion, both eighteen years of age, were in Lawry\u2019s car, parked on a dirt road near Baldwin Drive in Hamden. Baldwin Drive is a secluded road in the West Rock area of Hamden. It is known as a lovers\u2019 lane. The couple were in the front seat of the car when another person approached the car on foot from the driver\u2019s side and fired several shots from a .22 caliber rifle at them. The assailant then moved to the passenger\u2019s side of the car, smashed out the passenger\u2019s window, and fired several more shots inside. The female victim was struck by eight bullets and died almost instantly. Lawry was shot six times but was able to drive the car to a relative\u2019s home, where he summoned aid. Lawry survived the attack and was able to give investigating officers a vague description of the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">At some point during the ensuing investigation the Hamden police identified the defendant as a suspect. Within three weeks of the shooting three different Hamden police officers questioned the defendant concerning his activities on March 22, 1975. On April 16, 1975, Hamden police officers, acting pursuant to a search warrant signed by a judge of the Superior Court, searched the defendant\u2019s home and automobile. They seized, among other things, a bill of sale for a .22 caliber rifle, a .22 caliber casing, and a .22 caliber bullet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The police then took the defendant to Hamden police headquarters where he was charged with murder and with assault in the first degree in connection with the shooting of Lawry and his companion. A grand jury subsequently indicted the defendant on the murder charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">On April 30, 1975, the defendant filed a motion for a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial. The trial court, <em>Naruk, J., </em>ordered such a hearing pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-40,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and appointed two psychiatrists to examine the defendant and report their findings to the court. After a hearing on the matter the trial court, <em>Levine, J., </em>found the defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">On June 16, 1976, the defendant moved for a reexamination of his competency to stand trial. After another hearing, the trial court, <em>O\u2019Brien, J., </em>found the defendant competent to stand trial so long as he continued to receive medication prescribed to control symptoms of psychosis. Shortly before trial, the defendant again moved for a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial. He claimed that continued ingestion of anti-psychotic drugs altered his deportment and demeanor to such an extent that he could not be considered competent to stand trial. After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Hadden, J., </em>found that the defendant was \u201cable to understand the proceedings against him and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>assist counsel in his own defense\u201d and held that he was competent to stand trial. General Statutes \u00a7 54-40 (c). The case then went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Because the only known witness to the shooting, Lawry, was unable to identify the assailant, the state\u2019s case-in-chief relied primarily on several inculpatory statements made by the defendant after his arrest and on circumstantial evidence provided by the testimony of witnesses tending to link the defendant to the shooting. A ballistics expert testified that a bullet taken from the female victim\u2019s body and a bullet found lodged in a door at the defendant\u2019s home had been fired from the same .22 caliber rifle. Three other witnesses who had been parked on Baldwin Drive on the night of the shooting identified the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s car and testified that it had been parked near the Lawry vehicle on Baldwin Drive that evening. Elizabeth Cohane, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that the defendant had driven her car from the family home early that evening and returned shortly after 9 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Although the defendant did not admit that he was involved in any way with the shooting, he did not offer any evidence directly contradicting the state\u2019s allegation that he shot the victims. Instead, he put the state to its proof on the issue of identity and relied on a defense of insanity. At the time, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided, in relevant part, that insanity constituted a defense to a criminal charge if the defendant \u201cas a result of mental disease or defect lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d The defendant claimed, in essence, that at the time of the shooting he was in an uncontrollable psychotic rage caused by his observations of sexual activity in Lawry\u2019s car and that he therefore lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to act in conformity with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The defendant introduced the testimony of a number of lay witnesses who described the defendant as a troubled person, given to bizarre behavior and having a disturbed outlook on life in general, and sexuality in particular. The defense relied most heavily on the expert testimony of four psychiatrists, each of whom had examined the defendant before trial. Each of the four psychiatrists testified that the defendant was suffering from a mental disease or defect at the time of the shooting and that he lacked a substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. The defendant did not testify at trial; however, his account of the shooting was rendered by each of the psychiatrists as each described the basis for his conclusion as to the defendant\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The state offered the expert testimony of one psychiatrist in rebutting the defendant\u2019s claim of insanity. The state\u2019s witness agreed that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect but concluded that at the time of the crime the defendant had the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">On May 27,1977, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both charges. The trial court imposed consecutive sentences of twenty years to life on the murder charge and five to ten years on the assault in the first degree charge, for a total effective sentence of twenty-five years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The defendant has appealed from the judgment of conviction claiming error on several issues. We hold that (1) the trial court\u2019s error in failing to instruct the jury that it could not draw any inference from the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, and (2) state\u2019s attorney Arnold Markle\u2019s failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused compel a new trial. Therefore, we do not fully address the other claims of error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">On May 25, 1977, at the conclusion of all testimony in the case, the defendant submitted certain requests to charge the jury. One such request concerned the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution not to give evidence against himself. The defendant\u2019s request asked the court to instruct the jury about that right and to add that \u201c[absolutely no inference of guilt can be drawn from the exercise by the accused of his constitutional right not to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">After hearing argument by defense counsel and the state\u2019s attorney concerning proposed jury instructions the trial court ruled that it would not give the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d charge as requested by the defendant. In keeping with that ruling, on May 26,1977, the trial court instructed the jury on this issue as follows: \u201cAn accused person is under no obligation to become a witness in his own behalf. Under our law, an accused person may either testify or not as he sees fit. It is for the State to prove him guilty and no burden rests upon him to prove his innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The defendant excepted to the charge for its failure to include the instruction that the jury could not draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>any inference of guilt from the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify. On appeal the defendant claims that the trial court erred in its instruction and that reversal is required. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d That provision acts as a restraint upon the individual states as well as the federal government under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1963). Article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution affords criminal defendants a similar protection in language at least as broad as its federal counterpart. That section, which sets forth the rights of accused persons in criminal prosecutions, provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), the United States Supreme Court addressed the question whether, as part of the fifth amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination, a trial court must instruct the jury that they may not draw inferences of guilt from a criminal defendant\u2019s exercise of that right when the defendant properly requests such an instruction. The court held that such a \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction is essential to the full and free exercise of the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and to the system of justice that it is designed to uphold. \u201cThe principles enunciated in our cases construing this privilege, against both statutory and constitutional backdrops, lead unmistakably to the conclusion that the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a \u2018no-adverse-inference\u2019 jury instruction when requested by a defendant to do so.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Because the right to such an instruction is part of the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, it is imported through the fourteenth amendment to criminal defendants in state court proceedings. Id., 297; <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>supra. Because the Connecticut constitution\u2019s protection against self-incrimination is at least as broad as the federal provision, we now hold that a criminal defendant has an independent right under article first, \u00a7 8 of our constitution to the same \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction upon proper and timely request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S. Ct. 3469, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1201 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 45 n.12, 463 A.2d 573 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In the present case the trial court instructed the jury on May 26, 1977. At that time neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court had yet recognized the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction as a component of self-incrimination protections. The United States Supreme Court did not announce the rule until March 9, 1981. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra. Nevertheless, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dudla, </em>190 Conn. 1, 5, 458 A.2d 682 (1983), we held that \u201cthe rule of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, is to be applied to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered.\u201d In a footnote to that holding we noted that \u201c[a] judgment is considered final for these purposes when all avenues of direct appeal have been exhausted or when the time for filing a direct appeal has passed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dudla, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>5 n.4, citing <em>Tehan </em>v. <em>Shott, </em>382 U.S. 406, 409 n.3, 86 S. Ct. 459, 15 L. Ed. 2d 453 (1966). Thus, because this case was not final when the <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>rule was announced, the trial court erred in failing to give the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction as the defendant had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On appeal, the state does not contend that the trial court did not err. Rather, the state argues that the defendant\u2019s cause was not harmed by the error and that the conviction therefore should not be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Initially, we note that there is some question as to whether an error of this sort can ever be considered harmless. In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 304, the United States Supreme Court specifically declined to decide whether a violation of the rule it announced there could ever be considered harmless error: \u201cWhile it is arguable that a refusal to give an instruction similar to the one that was requested here can never be harmless ... we decline to reach the issue, because it was not presented to or considered [below] by the Supreme Court of Kentucky.\u201d Although the question is one of significant legal import, we need not decide it in this case. Even if harmless error might be appropriate in such cases, our review of the record in this case leads to the conclusion that the state has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s error in failing to give the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that certain constitutional protections are so central to the requirement of a fair trial that their violation absolutely requires that the conviction from which they arose be set aside. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705, reh. denied, 386 U.S. 987, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1967). In some circumstances, however, violations of other, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>less basic constitutional rights may be considered harmless and therefore do not compel reversal. Id., 23-24. \u201cIf error touches a less basic constitutional right, we sometimes apply the \u2018harmless error\u2019 exception, but only sparingly, in a few, discrete circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeko, </em>177 Conn. 545, 558, 418 A.2d 917 (1979). In such circumstances we require the state to prove the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sorbo, </em>174 Conn. 253, 257, 386 A.2d 221 (1978); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Conn. 541, 547-48, 363 A.2d 49 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>182 Conn. 449, 465-66, 438 A.2d 712 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 941, 101 S. Ct. 2024, 68 L. Ed. 2d 329 (1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Here, the error may be held harmless only if the evidence against the accused is so overwhelming that we can conclude as a matter of law that the jury\u2019s verdict was not influenced by the absence of a \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hasting, </em>461 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>U.S. 499, 103 S. Ct. 1974, 76 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983); <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 23 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1969). <em>Chapmans. California, </em>supra; <em>Fahy </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S. Ct. 229, 11 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1963); <em>State </em>v. <em>Truppi, </em>supra. As noted above, the defendant did not testify at trial. His account of the incident was introduced, however, through the testimony of the five psychiatrists who evaluated his emotional state and testified as to their conclusions. Four of them testified that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the shooting; only one, the state\u2019s witness, concluded that the defendant was legally sane. Although the five psychiatrists have similar and equally impressive credentials,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it appears that the jury chose to believe the conclusion of the state\u2019s witness. We cannot conclude that the jury found all four of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses to be without credibility. The more logical conclusion is that the jury did not believe the representations made by the defendant to those psychiatrists about his mental state on the night of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Because the defendant\u2019s credibility was a central concern of the jury it was particularly important that the jury assess his claim without prejudice. The very reason for the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction established in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>is to counteract what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>perceived as a juror\u2019s tendency to prejudge a defendant because he failed to take the stand and protest his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The defendant admitted to some of the psychiatrists that he went to the Baldwin Drive area with a general intent to kill. The state argues that the jury therefore found his claim that he was sent into an uncontrollable psychotic rage by observing the victims\u2019 sexual activity inherently unbelievable. It may well be that the jury did not accept the defendant\u2019s insanity claim for that reason. Given the circumstances of this case, however, the state has not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that a properly instructed jury would have done likewise. The failure to give a \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On November 2,1976, the defendant filed a pretrial motion for disclosure and production by the state of certain information. Included therein was a request for the disclosure of \u201c[a]ny and all exculpatory information and material\u201d known to the state\u2019s attorney. The state responded that it had no knowledge of any exculpatory information. The defendant claims on appeal that a police report of March 27, 1975, which state\u2019s attorney Markle did not disclose, did contain exculpatory information, and that reversal of his conviction is therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The defendant filed a pretrial notice of his intent to rely, inter alia, on a defense of lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. See Practice Book \u00a7 758. Thus, it was incumbent upon the defendant to introduce some evidence tending to show that he, \u201cat the time of the proscribed conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of law.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 53a-13.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under this version of the statute, once the defendant introduced sufficient evidence to put his sanity in doubt, it became the state\u2019s burden to prove that at the time of the crime the defendant had the capacity both to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ontra, </em>178 Conn. 480, 482-83, 423 A.2d 134 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rossier, </em>175 Conn. 204, 209, 397 A.2d 110 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmquist, </em>173 Conn. 140, 150, 376 A.2d 1111, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 306, 54 L. Ed. 2d 193 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 44, 376 A.2d 391 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>158 Conn. 341, 355, 260 A.2d 587 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">As mentioned earlier, the thrust of the defense was that the defendant suffered from a mental disease and that this disease caused his behavior on the night of the shooting. The defendant\u2019s claim, made through the testimony of defense psychiatrists, was that his observation of apparent sexual activity in Lawry\u2019s car caused his disease to manifest itself in an uncontrollable psychotic rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Each of the defendant\u2019s expert witnesses testified that his evaluation of the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting was based on the defendant\u2019s recollections of the incident, as revealed during individual psychiatric examinations. The defendant\u2019s account of the shooting was thereby placed before the jury, under proper instruction from the trial court that it could be considered \u201cas evidence bearing on the basis of [the witness\u2019] opinion and not on the issue of whether [the defendant] did commit the act or acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">It is clear from all the evidence that the defendant drove to the Baldwin Drive area armed with a .22 caliber rifle. While parked there he observed the Lawry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>vehicle for some time. According to the defendant, he then observed the Lawry car begin to shake. He contended that this stimulus set off a psychotic reaction causing him to approach the car with a rifle. Upon looking inside the car he observed the couple in an apparent act of intercourse and, either because he was further stimulated by this observation or because his existing psychotic state was thereby perpetuated, he began shooting at them.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Dr. Ernst Prelinger testified that at the time of the shooting the defendant was \u201cin a quite agitated state\u201d brought about by \u201chis need to eradicate anything sexual.\u201d On cross-examination by the state\u2019s attorney, Dr. Prelinger testified that the defendant had told him that he saw the Lawry car shaking on the night in question and that the couple\u2019s apparent sexual activities \u201cset him off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Dr. Meyer Shimelman testified to his evaluation of the defendant as a chronic paranoid schizophrenic. On cross-examination, Dr. Shimelman testified that the defendant had told him that on the night of the shooting he had observed \u201csome rocking motion back and forth\u201d in the Lawry car. When the defendant approached the car he saw the couple engaged in intercourse at which point, according to the witness, he \u201cbecame totally psychotic\u201d and began shooting at the couple.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Dr. Ellis A. Perlswig testified that based upon his examinations he diagnosed the defendant as having \u201cschizophrenic reaction, paranoid type.\u201d In response to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination, Dr. Perl-swig related that the defendant was \u201cset off\u201d by hav-, ing seen the Lawry car shaking, that he then approached the car and shot the boy \u201cto get the boy off\u201d the girl; he did this so that he could shoot the girl, the intended target of his rage.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In rebuttal, the state did not seriously contest the defendant\u2019s claim that he suffered from some form of mental disease or defect. Instead, the state introduced testimony designed to show that the shooting was a deliberate and willful act, rather than the result of an uncontrollable psychotic rage. It did this both by expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s mental state, and by challenging the defendant\u2019s rendition of;the circumstances surrounding the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The state\u2019s expert psychiatric witness, Dr. Howard Zonana, testified that the defendant\u2019s personality is primarily antisocial \u201cwith schizoid features which may be progressing towards . . . simple schizophrenia.\u201d Dr. Zonana concluded, however, that the shooting was \u201cconscious and planned\u201d and that the defendant did not lack the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Dr. Zonana also testified that the defendant had admitted to him that he went to the Baldwin Drive area on the night in question intending to kill someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The state also used the testimony of Steven Lawry to prove that the shooting was a premeditated and deliberate act and to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that it was his observation of apparent sexual activity in Lawry\u2019s car that caused him to lose control of his actions. The critical evidence in this respect was Lawry\u2019s testimony about the events leading up to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On direct examination for the state Lawry testified that he and his companion had arrived at Baldwin Drive about 7:45 p.m. on March 22,1975. Lawry parked the car in a wooded area on a dirt road off Baldwin Drive. Lawry testified that shortly after parking the car he and his companion engaged in sexual intercourse. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>stated that the shooting occurred approximately a half-hour to forty-five minutes after they first parked the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In response to cross-examination Lawry delineated the events more specifically. He testified that the couple had completed intercourse approximately fifteen minutes before the first shot was fired and that both he and his companion were seated upright in the front seat when the first shot rang out.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Thus, there was an obvious important discrepancy between Lawry\u2019s account of the incident and the defendant\u2019s. The substance of the defendant\u2019s claim was that he observed apparent sexual activity in the Lawry vehicle, and that this \u201cset off\u201d his rage. Although none of the defense psychiatrists could state the amount of time that elapsed between the defendant\u2019s observation of sexual activity and his approach to the Lawry car, the defendant\u2019s claim would appear inconsistent with Lawry\u2019s testimony that he and his companion had completed intercourse fifteen minutes before the first shot was fired. More importantly, Lawry\u2019s testimony that he and his companion were seated upright in the car when the shooting began was totally incompatible with the defendant\u2019s statement that the couple were lying prone and apparently embracing when he arrived at the side of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">This crucial factual discrepancy cannot be overlooked. If the jury believed Lawry\u2019s trial testimony about the events leading up to the shooting they would necessarily disbelieve the defendant\u2019s version of those events. His defense thus would be substantially weakened.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>If, on the other hand, the jury found the defendant\u2019s representations to be accurate, they might reasonably have found, based on testimony as to his instability in general, that this stimulus caused him to lose the capacity to appreciate the consequences of his behavior or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">It is important to note that Lawry\u2019s testimony about the events on Baldwin Drive went largely unrebutted. His responses to questions of both counsel did not suggest any uncertainty about his recollection nor did he indicate that he had ever remembered or recounted the events differently. In fact, Lawry responded in the negative when asked by the defense at trial if he had \u201cgiven the police anv other statements\u201d after March 24, 1975.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">It was not until long after the trial ended, when the defendant appealed, that a police report of an interview with Lawry was disclosed which contained crucial inconsistencies with his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Sergeant Lawrence Peryer of the Hamden police department was a member of the police investigating team and testified for the state at trial. The bulk of Peryer\u2019s testimony concerned his interviews of the defendant. Although Peryer had interviewed Lawry at Yale-New Haven Hospital on at least four occasions, for reasons that later became obvious Peryer was never questioned about that aspect of the investigation by the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>At the conclusion of the direct examinations of both Lawry and Peryer the state turned over to the defense statements that each witness had made that were in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s possession and that related to the subject matter about which each had testified. Practice Book \u00a7 752.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After being given certain statements made by Peryer the defendant\u2019s attorney informed the court of his belief that certain other statements made by Peryer had not been turned over. The state\u2019s attorney did not dispute that claim. Rather, he argued that Practice Book \u00a7 752 requires that only those statements relating to the subject matter about which the witness has testified must be produced. He stated that any other statements of Peryer did not relate to his testimony on direct examination. Defense counsel took the position that all statements made by the witness must be surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">After receiving briefs and hearing argument on that question the trial court ruled in agreement with the state\u2019s position that only those statements relating to the subject matter about which the witness had testified must be produced. The trial court reviewed in camera all of Peryer\u2019s statements that the state possessed and ordered that under Practice Book \u00a7 752 none need be surrendered other than those that the state originally offered. The remainder of Peryer\u2019s statements were sealed by order of the trial court and marked as exhibit UU for identification. Practice Book \u00a7 753.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On November 15, 1982, after the defendant had filed his appeal from the conviction he made a motion to the trial court to disclose exhibit UU as clearly allowed by Practice Book \u00a7 753. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion over <em>objection by the state\u2019s attorney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Exhibit UU contained several statements by Peryer concerning interviews with Lawry that occurred shortly after the shooting. One such statement, dated March 27, 1975, forms the basis for the defendant\u2019s claim that the state improperly withheld exculpatory evidence. That police report states that during an interview conducted at 10 a.m. that day <em>Lawry told Peryer that he and his companion were kissing in a prone position on the front seat of his car when the shooting began. </em>The defendant claims on appeal that because that statement supports the defendant\u2019s account of the incident and bears on the credibility of a key prosecution witness who disputed the defendant\u2019s recollections, it is material evidence favorable to the defendant and the state\u2019s failure to surrender the statement constitutes reversible error.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 86-87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose a codefendant\u2019s statement that exculpated the defendant after the defendant had specifically requested that statement constituted a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process right under the fourteenth amendment.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Id., 87; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 177, 448 A.2d 837 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 593, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>The United States Supreme Court further explained and refined the rule set forth in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976). There the court identified three distinct situations to which the <em>Brady </em>rule might apply: (1) those cases in which \u201cthe undisclosed evidence demonstrates that the prosecution\u2019s case includes perjured testimony and that the prosecution knew, or should have known, of the perjury\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 103; (2) those cases, like <em>Brady </em>itself, in which the defendant has made a pretrial request for specific evidence; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 104; and (3) those cases in which the defendant has made no request for disclosure or has made only a general request for all exculpatory information. Id., 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Both <em>Brady </em>and <em>Agurs </em>unequivocally command that evidence that is favorable to the accused and that is material to the issue of guilt or punishment must be disclosed by the prosecution. The principal distinction among the paradigms set out in <em>Agurs </em>is the standard that is used to determine whether the undisclosed evidence is material in each instance. Where the prosecution employs perjured testimony (the first paradigm) the conviction \u201cmust be set aside if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 103. Under the second paradigm, (where a specific request is made) the undisclosed evidence is considered material if its disclosure \u201cmight have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d Id., 104. In those cases where the defendant has not specifically requested disclosure of the evidence in question, (the third paradigm) the standard is even higher. There, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>compel reversal of his conviction, the defendant must show that \u201cthe omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d Id., 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Given that the undisclosed police report is, as the state concedes, favorable to the defendant, the only question before us is one of materiality. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>supra. On review of the record we find that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s conduct in this case falls within the first <em>Agurs </em>paradigm of prosecutorial misconduct. In applying the corresponding materiality test we find that the evidence which the state\u2019s attorney did not disclose \u201ccould have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We first note that although Lawry\u2019s trial testimony about the couple\u2019s posture differed significantly from that which appeared in Peryer\u2019s report, we cannot say from the record before us that his testimony constituted perjury, as that term is defined by statute.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> During other police interviews Lawry recounted the event in a manner consistent with his trial testimony. None of the other evidence introduced at trial necessarily refutes his testimony. Furthermore, although Lawry\u2019s response on cross-examination that he had made no other statements to the police is likely to have misled both the defendant and the jury, his testimony was literally accurate. His recollections of the shooting contained in Peryer\u2019s report of March 27, 1975, were not his own \u201cstatement\u201d as that term is defined in Practice Book \u00a7 749.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot say that Lawry committed peijury through intentional false testimony. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-156 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>The responsibility of the state\u2019s attorney to conduct the prosecution in accordance with constitutional fair trial standards, however, cannot be defined or limited by the precise contours of the perjury statute. When Lawry testified on cross-examination the state\u2019s attorney knew or should have known that Lawry\u2019s prior statement to Peryer varied significantly on certain crucial issues. Although a state\u2019s attorney has no absolute duty under the constitution to disclose every prior inconsistent statement of a state\u2019s witness; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 795, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed. 2d 706, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 897, 93 S. Ct. 87, 34 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1972); when Lawry testified that he had made no prior statements to the police the state\u2019s attorney surely knew that the jury would then infer that Lawry\u2019s recollection of the incident had remained constant. In failing to disclose Peryer\u2019s report at that point the state\u2019s attorney knowingly allowed the jury to be presented with a false and misleading picture that Lawry was consistent on this critical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In explaining the first paradigm in <em>Agurs </em>the United States Supreme Court noted that its \u201cstrict standard of materiality\u201d should be applied where prosecutorial misconduct creates \u201ca corruption of the truth-seeking function of the trial process.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 104. The references in <em>Agurs </em>to \u201cperjured\u201d testimony must be taken to include testimony known to the state\u2019s attorney to be false or misleading even if the witness may not have such an awareness. Here, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s actions in failing to disclose Peryer\u2019s report corrupted the trial process and denied the defendant his constitutional right to a fair trial<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>just as surely as if the state\u2019s case included perjured testimony. \u201cAs long ago as <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 112 [55 S. Ct. 340, 79 L. Ed. 791] (1935), this Court made clear that deliberate deception of a court and jurors by the presentation of known false evidence is incompatible with \u2018rudimentary demands of justice.\u2019 This was reaffirmed in <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>317 U.S. 213 [63 S. Ct. 177, 87 L. Ed. 214] (1942). In <em>Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264 [79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217] (1959), we said, \u2018[t]he same result obtains when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 269.\u201d <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153, 92 S.

Ed. 2d 104 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Our decision that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s misconduct in prosecuting this case compels a new trial is not only based on constitutional principles. Under our inherent supervisory authority we may set aside a conviction and order a new trial where the original trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u201cAn appellate court has a \u2018certain inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice\u2019; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>567 F.2d 885, 893 (9th Cir. 1978); in the trial courts below that permits action to deter prosecutorial misconduct which is \u2018unduly \u201coffensive to the maintenance of a sound judicial process.\u201d \u2019 (Citation omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>56 Mich.

This court . . . has long been of the view that it is ultimately responsible for the enforcement of court rules in prosecutorial misconduct cases. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>97 Conn. 258, 270, 116 A. 336 (1922). Upsetting a criminal conviction is a drastic step, but it is the only feasible deterrent to flagrant prosecutorial misconduct in defiance of a trial court ruling.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>190 Conn. 559, 570-71, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1001, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L. Ed. 2d 259 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The trial court had ordered disclosure of all exculpatory material in the state\u2019s possession. The state responded that it had none. Yet, one of the first investigative reports filed was Peryer\u2019s report of March 27, 1975, which contained Lawry\u2019s recollection that he and his companion were in a prone position when the first shot was fired. Because the exact nature of the defendant\u2019s claim was not yet known, this statement was not obviously exculpatory at the time the trial court ordered disclosure of exculpatory material, and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s decision not to disclose it <em>at that time </em>plays no part in our decision. The state, however, has a continuing duty to disclose exculpatory information. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 734 and 741. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s subsequent trial tactics made manifest the exculpatory nature of Peryer\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">On the critical issue of whether the defendant was legally sane at the time of the shooting, the state squarely cast the issue in terms of a credibility contest. The state used Lawry\u2019s recollection of the incident to rebut the defendant\u2019s insanity claim. At closing argument the state\u2019s attorney argued that the evidence showed that the defendant went to Baldwin Drive on March 22,1975, knowing that Lawry and his compan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ion would be there and specifically intending to kill both. He emphasized the discrepancy between Lawry\u2019s in-court account of the events leading up to the shooting and the defendant\u2019s account as support for the state\u2019s claim. Three times during his closing argument the state\u2019s attorney called the jury\u2019s attention to Lawry\u2019s trial testimony that the couple had completed intercourse fifteen minutes before the shooting and that they were seated upright smoking cigarettes when the shots began. In response to the defendant\u2019s claim that the couple were lying prone on the front seat when he approached the car, state\u2019s attorney Markle argued: \u201cNow, we know from Lawry that\u2019s a lie because they were just sitting there having a cigarette. To believe him you would have to disbelieve Lawry, and I submit that he [the defendant] isn\u2019t worthy of belief.\u201d This was the same state\u2019s attorney who withheld the police report that substantiated the defendant\u2019s version.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Viewed together with his later actions, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to disclose Lawry\u2019s prior inconsistent statement, which clearly supported the defendant\u2019s version of the incident and which was not otherwise discoverable, cannot be attributed to mere overzealousness. His exploitation at final argument of the very crucial discrepancy that his intransigence exacerbated cannot be condoned or tolerated. By imploring the jury to believe Lawry\u2019s testimony on this issue over the conflicting testimony of the defendant, while at the same time withholding from both the defendant and the jury evidence that was crucial to that issue, the state\u2019s attorney deliberately impeded the truth seeking process of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u201c[The state\u2019s attorney] is not only an officer of the court, like every attorney, but is also a high public officer, representing the people of the State, who seek impartial justice for the guilty as much as for the innocent. In discharging his most important duties, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>deserves and receives in peculiar degree the support of the court and the respect of the citizens of the county. By reason of his office, he usually exercises great influence upon jurors. His conduct and language in the trial of cases in which human life or liberty are at stake should be forceful, but fair, because he represents the public interest, which demands no victim and asks no conviction through the aid of passion, prejudice, or resentment. If the accused be guilty, he should none the less be convicted only after a fair trial, conducted strictly according to the sound and well-established rules which the laws prescribe.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>96 Conn. 160, 168-69, 113 A. 452 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The state\u2019s attorney owes a duty to <em>all </em>the people. While our system of adversarial justice demands vigorous advocacy from both the prosecution and defense counsel, the state\u2019s attorney must never become the \u201carchitect of a proceeding that does not comport with standards of justice.\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 88. \u201cSociety wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers when any accused is treated unfairly.\u201d Id., 87. The principle of fairness on which our justice system depends must be guarded vigilantly.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The misconduct of the state\u2019s attorney in failing to disclose evidence favorable to the accused constitutes reversible error independent of and in addition to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">There is error, the judgment is set aside, and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">In this opinion Parskey, Shea and Grillo, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> The bill of sale and the .22 caliber casing were seized from the defendant\u2019s automobile. The .22 caliber bullet was removed from a basement door in the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress all evidence seized under authority of the search and seizure warrant. Although the trial court did suppress certain evidence seized under the warrant, these three items were admitted into evidence. The defendant has not challenged their admission on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> At the time, article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution and General Statutes \u00a7 54-45 required a grand jury indictment as a precondition to trial for all charges punishable by death or life imprisonment.

XVII; Public Acts 1983, No. 83-210; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 686-99, 474 A.2d 760 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> Statutory provisions concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and the procedures attending a determination of competency are now set out in General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1975)] Sec. 53a-13. insanity as defense.

As used in this section, the terms mental disease or defect do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise anti-social conduct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\"> The defendant also claimed error in (1) the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that they might not discuss the case among themselves before the trial judge submitted the case to them, (2) the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the defense of insanity, and (3) certain post trial orders of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The trial court in cautioning the jury about pre-deliberation discussions did not instruct the jurors that they might not discuss the case among themselves before the court submitted the case to them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>182 Conn. 419, 438 A.2d 1144 (1980). Because the defendant failed to object to the instruction at the time it was made, however, we will not consider the issue on appeal. This court will consider claims of error raised for the first time on appeal only \u201cwhere a new constitutional right not readily foreseeable has arisen between the time of trial and appeal\u201d or \u201cwhere the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Neither situation is present here. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>188 Conn. 515, 518A, 450 A.2d 361 (1982), we recognized that <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington </em>did not establish a new constitutional right and therefore did not fit within the first <em>Evans </em>exception. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra. And, as was the case in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>the record on this appeal does not \u201cclearly disclose that the litigant has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial\u201d; id., 519; and therefore does not fit within the second <em>Evans </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The defendant also claims error because the trial court, after properly instructing the jury about the insanity defense using the words of the relevant statute, General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 53a-13, then responded to the jury\u2019s request for further instructions by delivering the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>rule, the irresistible impulse test, and other instructions reflecting the common law rather than the statutory rule. The state argues that this claim of error should not be reviewed because the defendant failed to object properly to the erroneous instruction. Our holding as to the other issues in this case makes it unnecessary for us to decide whether the defendant preserved his claim sufficient to warrant reversal. We emphasize, however, that the statutory standard for determining a defendant\u2019s sanity constitutes the only appropriate referent for the jury. \u201c[T]he only standard by which to determine insanity as a defense to a crime is that found in General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00a7 53a-13.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 633, 424 A.2d 293 (1979); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 85, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984). In some circumstances the trial court may be able to cure such an erroneous instruction by repeating the correct statutory definition. <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 86-87, 444, A.2d 896 (1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra. Where the trial court does not give a sufficiently curative instruction, however, it is reversible error for the trial court to instruct a jury by reference to any superseded tests for insanity such as the <em>M\u2019Naghten </em>rule, the <em>Durham </em>rule, or the irresistible impulse test, provided the defendant properly excepts to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Our holding as to the other claims of error also makes it unnecessary for us to address the defendant\u2019s claims concerning the trial court\u2019s post trial orders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> In explaining the basis for the court\u2019s holding that the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction is a component of the fifth amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination, Justice Stewart, writing for the majority in <em>Carter, </em>observed: \u2018 \u2018No judge can prevent jurors from speculating about why a defendant stands mute in the face of a criminal accusation, but a judge can, and must, if requested to do so, use the unique power of the jury instruction to reduce that speculation to a minimum.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 303, 101 S.

The \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction, however, is designed to protect against a broader sort of juror prejudice than the dissent would recognize. Absent instructions to the contrary, jurors are left free to speculate about the reasons behind a defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and protest his innocence. That speculation may give rise to inferences not only about the defendant\u2019s account of the incident, but also about more general matters including character and veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In this instance, as the dissent recognizes, the defendant indirectly put his account of the incident to the jury through the experts\u2019 testimony. The jury might well have inferred from his failure to testify before them directly and to submit to cross-examination some absence of credibility. If so, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>entire defense was substantially prejudiced. The trial court should have alleviated the potential for such prejudice by giving the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction as the defendant requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> The four expert witnesses for the defense on this issue were: Dr. Ernst Prelinger, who holds a Ph.D in clinical psychology and is currently employed by Yale University, in the University Health Service; Dr. Meyer M.

The relevance and materiality of any evidence, however, depends on the circumstances of the particular case. Here, the defendant claimed that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>was in control of his behavior until observing apparent sexual activity. Although the jury might still believe his claim of insanity if it found that no sexual activity was apparent, his claim is made much more plausible if his version about the stimulus of his psychotic rage were found to be true. Thus we cannot agree that the discrepancies were necessarily immaterial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\"> Given that Lawry probably had never been instructed about the narrow definition of the term \u201cstatement\u201d found in Practice Book \u00a7 749; see footnote 14, infra; it is likely that the defendant and the jury interpreted his answer to mean that he had not given any other account of the incident beyond his formal statement of March 24, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\"> \u201c[Practice Book \u00a7 752]: production following testimony</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cAfter a witness called by the state has testified on direct examination at trial, the judicial authority shall, on motion of the defendant, order the state to produce any statement of the witness in the possession of the state or its agents, including state and local law enforcement officers, which statement relates to the subject matter about which the witness has testified.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\"> \u201c[Practice Book \u00a7 753]: delivery and excision of statements</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\u201cIf the entire contents of a statement requested under Sec. 752 relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the judicial authority shall order the statement to be delivered directly to the defendant or his counsel for his examination and use.

Section 752 requires disclosure of \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>statement of the witness . . . which . . . relates to the subject matter about which the witness has testified.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 749 defines a \u201cstatement\u201d as \u201c[a] written statement made by a person and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him\u201d or \u201c[a] stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording, or a transcription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by a person and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carrasco, </em>537 F.2d 372, 376 (9th Cir. 1976). Here, Lawry did not adopt Peryer\u2019s report as his own nor did the report purport to be a verbatim recital of Lawry\u2019s statement. The report therefore was not discoverable at the close of Lawry\u2019s testimony. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>425 U.S. 94, 110 n.19, 96 S. Ct. 1338, 47 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1976). Although the report clearly was a statement by Peryer, its contents did not relate to the subject matter of Peryer\u2019s testimony on direct examination because the state\u2019s attorney did not question him about that aspect of his investigation. A nexus between the subject matter of a witness\u2019 statement and his or her trial testimony is clearly required by \u00a7 752. See note, \u201cDefendant Access to Prosecution Witness Statements in Federal and State Criminal Cases,\u201d 61 Wash. Univ. L. Q. 471, 483 (1983).

Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), I find such error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">An inference is the product of a mental process whereby one derives through reasoning the existence of unknown facts as the logical consequence of other facts which are already proven or known.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A fundamental aspect of this mental process is the proposition that the facts being inferred are otherwise unknown. If facts are known through direct perception, there is no need to derive or deduce their existence through inferential reasoning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Within the context of a criminal prosecution the proposition or fact being inferred by a jury which has not been instructed to the contrary, is the unknown content of an accused\u2019s testimony. The jury infers by an accused\u2019s silence that his version of the facts, if expressed, would be similar to or corroborative of the version offered by the state and thereby supportive of his guilt. It is these negative implications of an accused\u2019s silence which run counter to the constitutional presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent which requires that guilt be proved by facts and not the absence of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>If, however, an accused\u2019s testimony is in fact known to the jury, his silence implies nothing. The jurors know what his version of the facts is and therefore there is no need for them to infer its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In the present case, the accused\u2019s version of the facts was placed before the jury by no less than five psychiatrists who testified concerning his sanity. It does not matter for what purpose it was introduced. The fact remains that the accused\u2019s account was fully known to the jury. Therefore, there was no need to derive anything through the use of the inferential process and the accused\u2019s silence could therefore mean nothing. This being the case, any instruction to the jury about inference drawing, although legally required, was simply inapplicable to the fact finding circumstance which confronted the jury. As there was no need to infer anything, I would find the omission of the \u201cno-adverse-inference\u201d instruction to be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Withheld Information</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">No matter which of <em>the Agurs</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>paradigms is adopted, a threshhold consideration must be the admissibility of the withheld information to impeach the testimony of Steven Lawry. If inadmissible, it is clearly not material in either an evidential or constitutional sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">I submit that the information was not admissible for the reason that it was not Lawry\u2019s statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lawry had never signed the Case/Incident Report, nor is there any evidence that he had otherwise \u201cadopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>or approved\u201d of it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is \u201cgrossly unfair to allow the defense to use statements to impeach a witness which could not fairly be said to be the witness\u2019 own rather than the product of the investigator\u2019s selections, interpretations and interpolations.\u201d <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U.S. 343, 350, 79 S.
