Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVx\">The plaintiff, the Simsbury conservation commission (commission), brought this action seeking to enjoin the defendants from continuing to conduct an activity on the defendants\u2019 property in violation of the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45; and other relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing concerning the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary injunction only, the court, in a memorandum of decision and judgment dated April 10, 1981, granted the temporary injunctive relief requested. Subsequently, after a trial relating to the plaintiff\u2019s remaining claims, the court \u201cpermanently enjoined [the defendants] from conducting any regulated activity in a wetland or watercourse on their residential property . . .\u201d and awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the sum of $2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On this appeal, the defendants claim: (1) that the plaintiff should not have prevailed in its request for injunctive relief because it acted in bad faith and \u201ccame into court with unclean hands\u201d; (2) that their activities on their property fall within the statutory exceptions to the act; (3) that the trial court's findings of fact concerning downstream siltation were not supported by the evidence and, therefore, the court should not have issued a permanent injunction in the absence of a showing of present harm; and (4) that the trial court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to file a counterclaim for alleged violations of their rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. We find no error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The following salient facts are without dispute. The defendants are owners of a residential property on the easterly side of Woodchuck Hill Road in Simsbury. On their property is a house which is built on a fairly steep slope. At the bottom of this slope is a small stream <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>beyond which the land rises sharply to Woodchuck Hill Road. In 1968, the defendants constructed a dam at the northerly part of their property to pond the stream. The dam consists of reinforced concrete in the center and dirt on its sides or wings. A small pipe protrudes from the northerly side of the dam which emits an odor of sewage. When operative, the dam creates a pond which is approximately thirty-five feet across and the dam is high enough to hold back water to a level of about four feet above the stream bed. The top of the dam on its northerly or downstream face is about ten feet above the bottom of the stream bed. The dam is equipped with a device which can be used to lower the water level of the pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">On July 12, 1977, the defendant Ruth Price filed an incomplete application for a permit from the commission to carry on a proposed regulated activity under the Simsbury inland wetlands and watercourses regulations. The application stated that the purpose of the proposed activity was to \u201crestore pond by refurbishing spillway and dam.\u201d As of this time there was a large V-shaped \u201cbreak\u201d in the dam in its westerly earthen part. In August, 1977, the commission wrote to the defendants requesting additional information regarding their application for a permit to restore the dam. In the early part of December, 1977, the commission again wrote to Ruth Price to confirm their agreement that she would provide it with certain information concerning the elevation of the dam spillway and their driveway culvert, as well as an engineer\u2019s certification of the concrete spillway and earth embankments. This information was never provided to the commission. In excess of one year later, in the latter part of December, 1978, the commission returned the ten dollar application fee which Ruth Price had paid with her applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tion and informed her that her application had been deemed incomplete. The parties have stipulated that no permit was ever issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The large V-shaped break in the dam\u2019s westerly-earthen part continued to exist through the summer of 1980. At that time, the defendant Edmund Price filled in the V-shaped break and later that same year he applied concrete by trowel on both dirt wings of the dam. The parties stipulated that \u201cthere was essentially no water in the pond area from at least July 12,1977, through the summer of 1980\u201d and that \u201c[b]y November 5,1980 the dam had been repaired and [held] back water altering the existing watercourse.\u201d About this time, the defendants\u2019 actions with respect to the dam again came to the attention of the commission. On November 7,1980, the commission, through the town conservation officer, prepared a cease and desist order dated November 8, 1980. This order stated that the defendants\u2019 activities concerning the dam on their premises were being conducted in a watercourse for which a permit was required under the Simsbury regulations. Therefore, the commission \u201cordered [them] to cease immediately any work on the project.\u201d The order informed the defendants that a hearing would be held on November 18,1980, to provide them with an opportunity to show cause as to why the order should not remain in effect. On November 7,1980, this order was delivered to the sheriff to be served upon the defendants on November 8,1980. The sheriff served the order on the evening of November 7,1980, without any attestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Subsequently, having found that he had mistakenly delivered the order one day early, the sheriff returned to the defendants\u2019 home on November 8, 1980, read the order to Edmund Price, attested the order, and \u201cdelivered\u201d it to Edmund Price. The hearing provided for in the order was scheduled to occur on November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>18, 1980, which was within ten days of the November 8, 1980 date of the order, but not within ten days of November 7, 1980. The defendants did not appear at that hearing although they actually knew it would be held on November 18, 1980, and, therefore, the commission referred the matter to legal counsel for further proceedings which resulted in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In initially granting the plaintiffs request for a temporary injunction, the court found that the defendants had \u201cconducted a regulated activity in a wetland and in a watercourse without a permit in violation of the \u2018Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations of the Town of Simsbury\u2019 \u00a7 4.\u201d After a trial concerning the plaintiff\u2019s claims for a permanent injunction and attorneys\u2019 fees, the court specifically concluded that the \u201c[defendants\u2019 actions in filling the V-shaped hole in the bank in the late summer of 1980 and applying concrete to the area in late 1980 were the conduct of regulated activities in a regulated area of the town. The defendants\u2019 activities altered the watercourse located on their property.\u201d The court further concluded that the \u201c[defendants\u2019 actions included removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a watercourse and the diversion of a watercourse\u201d and that their actions did not fall under any of the act\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The defendants\u2019 first claim concerns the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs issuance of a cease and desist order in November, 1980. The defendants maintain that the order was \u201cdefective\u201d since it did not meet the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the plaintiff acted in bad faith when it chose to go forward with a hearing on its motion for a temporary-injunction which, the defendants assert, the court granted in reliance upon the facts which the order purported to represent. We find no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The record does not in any way indicate any bad faith on the part of the plaintiff, and the trial court, after a hearing on the temporary injunction and a full trial on the permanent injunction, made no indication in its memoranda of any bad faith or improper conduct on the part of the plaintiff which would rise to the level of \u201cunclean hands.\u201d There is no dispute that the defendants had actual notice of the scheduled hearing relating to the cease and desist order, and the trial court so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The trial court noted in its memorandum of decision on the permanent injunction that the \u201c[f]ailure to issue the statutory order under [General Statutes] \u00a7 22a-44 (a), would be fatal to [the] plaintiffs cause of action under that section because the purpose of the order is notice.\u201d The trial court found that \u201c[t]he notice was \u2018issued\u2019 on November 7,1980,\u201d but that the hearing was not held within ten days of that date as required under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (a) since it was held on November 18,1980. The trial court, however, granted the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiff under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (b) which provides in part: \u201cThe superior court, in an action brought by the commissioner, municipality, district or any person, shall have jurisdiction to restrain a continuing violation of said sections, to issue orders directing that the violation be corrected or removed and to impose fines pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>suant to this section.\u201d This statute provided the plaintiff with an alternative statutory remedy to that contained in \u00a7 22a-44 (a) of the act and quite clearly the trial court\u2019s finding relating to the plaintiffs failure to comply with \u00a7 22a-44 (a) in no way affects the viability of the plaintiff\u2019s action which was instituted under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of the posture of this case on appeal, the validity of the reissuance of the cease and desist order is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">We next turn to the defendants\u2019 claim that their activities fall within the exceptions to the act, and therefore, that they are not required to have a permit to engage in such activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">The town of Simsbury, under the authority of \u00a7 22a-42 of the act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has promulgated regulations con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>cerning activities on inland wetland and watercourses within the town. Under \u00a7 4.1 of its regulations, the town requires that \u201c[n]o person shall henceforth conduct a regulated activity in a regulated area of the Town of Simsbury without first obtaining a permit from the Simsbury Conservation Commission.\u201d Under the town\u2019s regulations, a \u201cregulated activity\u201d is defined as \u201cany permanent or temporary operation within or use of a wetland or watercourse involving removal or deposition of material or any obstruction, construction in, alteration or pollution of such wetland or watercourse, but shall not include the uses in Section 3 of these Regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 3 of the town\u2019s regulations, which sets forth the uses \u201cpermitted in inland wetlands and watercourses as of right,\u201d tracks the language of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for all purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>relevant to this case, and it is under that statutory provision which the defendants claim their exemption from the requirement that they receive a permit. Specifically, they point to the exception to \u201cregulated activities\u201d found in the act at \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) and claim that their activities with respect to their dam as set forth above constituted a use that was \u201cincidental for the enjoyment and maintenance\u201d of their property and in the nature of maintenance of an existing structure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, they claim that between 1968 and 1977 they stocked their pond with fish and, therefore, their activities fall within the exception found in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In considering the exceptions claimed by the defendants, the trial court concluded that the \u201cerection of the dam is not a use \u2018incidental for the enjoyment and maintenance of residential property\u2019 \u201d and that the \u201c[defendants\u2019 actions included removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a watercourse and the diversion of a watercourse.\u201d The court further concluded that the \u201c[djefendants\u2019 actions also disturbed the watercourse and did nothing for conservation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">The general principle that statutory terms are to be given meanings according to their commonly approved usage of language is clearly applicable to the provisions upon which the defendants rely. See <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 548, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); see generally <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 423, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980); <em>International Business Machines Corporation </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236 (1974). Further, we point out that exemptions to statutes are to be strictly construed; <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 549, citing <em>Kulis </em>v. <em>Moll, </em>172 Conn. 104, 110, 374 A.2d 133 (1976); and that those who claim the benefit of an exception under a statute have the burden of proving that they come within the limited class for whose benefit it was established. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, citing <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Giovenelli, </em>117 Conn. 103, 107, 167 A. 87 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It is disputed that the defendants\u2019 conduct in what they claim is \u201crepair\u201d to their dam constituted \u201cmaintenance\u201d within the language and intent of \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4). Concerning the defendants\u2019 claim of exemption under \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4), we emphasize that this provision, while it exempts from \u201cregulated activities\u201d for which a permit is required under the town\u2019s regulations uses which are \u201cincidental for the enjoyment and maintenance of residential property . . . including] maintenance of existing structures ...\u201d contains the express limitation that such uses \u201cshall not include removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a wetland or watercourse <em>or diversion or alteration of a watercourse </em>. . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) We first point <em>out </em>that the trial court found that the defendants\u2019 activities \u201caltered the watercourse located on their property\u201d and its memorandum of decision on the permanent injunction states that the defendants stipulated to that finding which had been made in its earlier memorandum of decision on the temporary injunction. This finding has not been challenged on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Despite the lack of such a challenge to the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 activities \u201caltered\u201d the watercourse on their property, the defendants stress a certain statement made by the trial court in the context of what constitutes an alteration of a watercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>wherein the court postulated that if one had a small watercourse in his back yard and he threw a large rock into it, he would alter or divert it. Taking this statement, the defendants claim that such an alteration is not what the legislature intended when it created the exception found in \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) because it used the modifier \u201csignificant.\u201d Initially, we point out that the plain meaning which we must give to the statute provides no grist for the defendants\u2019 assertion that the modifier \u201csignificant\u201d found in the provision at issue refers to the terms \u201cdiversion or alteration.\u201d It is quite clear from the statute as written that the modifier \u201csignificant\u201d only refers to the word \u201camounts\u201d in that statutory language which in turn clearly refers to the \u201cremoval or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a wetland or watercourse. . . .\u201d While this does not mean that the diversion or alteration hypothetically stated by the trial court, which certainly contemplated a de minimis effect on a watercourse, is one which would come within the act, it is quite clear that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants\u2019 activities altered and diverted the watercourse within the meaning of the act was in no way predicated on the hypothetical it posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The trial court, as its memorandum noted, had viewed the property. A view of the subject matter in dispute may be taken by the court, in the exercise of a sound discretion, \u201cwhenever it is necessary or important to a clearer understanding of the issues.\u201d <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>117 Conn. 67, 73, 167 A. 83 (1933); see <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Mackin, </em>186 Conn. 185, 190, 439 A.2d 1086 (1982). The court\u2019s findings, stated succinctly, establish that the defendants had constructed a dam on their property which had created a pond approximately thirty-five feet across and which had a capacity to hold back water to a level of about four feet above the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>stream bed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For over three years, commencing in July, 1977, there was a large V-shaped break in the dam, during which time there was essentially no water in the pond area. The defendants\u2019 activities in filling in this break in the latter part of 1980 resulted in the pond area filling with water \u201cagain.\u201d The trial court referred to a prior failure of the defendants\u2019 dam in 1975 or 1976 and found that although the potential failure of the dam in the future was not a threat to human life, it \u201cwould [cause] downstream damage by forceful removal of solid material, polluting the stream . . . changing its character [and] . . . adversely affect the streams and ponds below it, at least as far as 1000 feet downstream <em>f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">As we stated in <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 538-39: \u201cA statute should be interpreted according to the policy which the legislation seeks to serve. See 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 56.01 to 56.02. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36, which is entitled \u2018Inland Wetlands and Water Courses. Legislative Finding,\u2019 sets out in great detail the purposes of our legislature in enacting this act. After declaring that\u2018[t]he inland wetlands and water courses . . . are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource,\u2019 and that their \u2018preservation and protection . . . from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state,\u2019 the section sets forth a number of the purposes behind the enactment of the act. The legislation, inter alia, seeks \u2018to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and water courses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; [and by] maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority . . . The act attempts to provide \u2018an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.\u2019 \u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Under all the circumstances, we conclude that in view of what we have already set out regarding the nature and character of the defendants\u2019 activities, the trial court could properly conclude that their activities altered or diverted the watercourse within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Additionally, a separate basis exists under \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) upon which to sustain the trial court\u2019s decision in this case. Here we point out that neither of the parties has specifically addressed the consequence on this appeal of the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendants\u2019 activities \u201cincluded removal or deposition of significant amounts of material from or onto a watercourse. ...\u201d This finding has gone unchallenged on this appeal and also provides a proper basis under \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) for the conclusion that the defendants had conducted a regulated activity for which a permit was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Likewise, the defendants\u2019 claim under \u00a7 22a-40 (b) (1) must fail. While that section also provides an exception from \u201cregulated activities\u201d for those operations and uses relating to the \u201c[conservation of soil, vegetation, water, fish, shellfish and wild life ...\u201d such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>operations and uses are limited to those which \u201cdo not disturb<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the natural and indigenous character of the wetland or watercourse by <em>removal or deposition of material, alteration or obstruction of water flow </em>or pollution of the wetland or watercourse . . . .\u201d From what has already been said above concerning the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning the defendants\u2019 alteration of the watercourse on their property, \u00a7 22a-40 (b) (1) avails the defendants nothing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We turn next to the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that the defendants\u2019 dam caused downstream siltation were not supported by the evidence and, therefore, the court should not have granted a permanent injunction in the absence of a showing of present harm. Although the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision contains a number of findings concerning the past harm and the potential for harm caused by the defendants\u2019 activities, in issuing its permanent injunction it expressly referred only to its determination that the defendants, in acting without a permit, had violated the Simsbury regulations promulgated under the act and that it had jurisdiction under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (b) to issue \u201corders directing that the violation be corrected or removed.\u201d Claiming that the requested injunctive relief may be granted only upon the recognized principles of equity,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendants contest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s argument that the finding of the violation of the regulations was a sufficient basis under the statutory scheme to permit the issuance of the permanent injunction pointing to the rationale of <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corporation, </em>170 Conn. 27, 364 A.2d 208 (1975). We agree with the plaintiff that the facts found by the trial court permitted the injunctive relief ordered for the violation of the town\u2019s regulations under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">This case is to be considered differently from a common law action for injunctive relief where allegations and proof of irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law are required. See, e.g., <em>Theurkauf v. Miller, </em>153 Conn. 159, 161, 214 A.2d 834 (1965). \u201cThe rationale underlying [the] rule that the complainant is relieved of his burden of proving irreparable harm and no adequate remedy at law is that the enactment of the statute by implication assumes that no adequate alternative remedy exists and that the injury was irreparable, that is, the legislation was needed or else it would not have been enacted.\u201d <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Van Hise, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 334, 338, 464 A.2d 865 (1983). Recently, the Connecticut Appellate Court adopted the Appellate Session\u2019s reasoning in <em>Crabtree </em>in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Murzyn, </em>1 Conn. App. 176, 469 A.2d 1227 (1984) (zoning enforcement officer seeking injunction under General Statutes \u00a7 8-12 for violation of town zoning regulation not required to allege and prove irreparable harm and the lack of an adequate legal remedy). We have already set forth the \u201cLegislative Finding\u201d contained in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 which declares the purposes and policies of the act. Significantly, the legislature expressly provided in the act that the \u201csuperior court, in an action brought by the commissioner, municipality, district or any person, shall have jurisdiction to restrain a continuing violation of said sections, to issue orders direct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ing that the violation be corrected or removed and to impose fines pursuant to this section.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">It is, the court\u2019s duty to carry out the intention of the legislature as expressed in the statute it has enacted and to make the remedy it has provided an effective and efficient means of dealing with violations of the act and regulations properly promulgated under its authority. See <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corporation, </em>supra, 34. We point out, however, that \u201c[t]he grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a [trial judge] . . . is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law. <em>TVA </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>437 U.S. [153, 193, 98 S. Ct. 2279, 57 L. Ed. 2d 117 (1978)]; <em>Hecht Co. </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>[321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S. Ct. 587, 88 L. Ed. 754 (1944)].\u201d <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Romero-Barcelo, </em>456 U.S. 305, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982). Put another way, we do not view the statutory grant of jurisdiction as destroying the discretion of a trial court in every case under this act. Given the purpose and language of the act and the factual basis for the violation, the injunctive relief was properly ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Finally, we turn to the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court erred in denying their motion to file a counterclaim. In this motion, which was first made at the trial in oral form on March 10, 1982,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the defendants alleged that certain Simsbury town officials and the town itself deprived the defendants \u201cunder color and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>pretense of statutes, ordinances, regulations, customs and usage of the Town of Simsbury and the State of Connecticut, of rights, privileges and immunities secured by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The counterclaim, as offered in written form, sets forth the claims of the defendants in six counts; it contains ninety-seven paragraphs and is twenty-one pages in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 116 provides in pertinent part: \u201cSupplemental pleadings showing matters arising since the original pleading may be filed in actions for equitable relief by either party. In any action for legal or equitable relief, any defendant may file counterclaims against any plaintiff . . . provided that each such counterclaim . . . arises out of the transaction or one of the transactions which is the subject of the plaintiffs complaint; and if necessary, additional parties may be summoned in to answer any such counterclaim or cross claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">It is apparent that the defendants\u2019 motion for permission to file their counterclaim was made as a direct result of the decision of the federal District Court to stay the action brought therein by the defendant Edmund W. Price pending the final resolution of the defendants\u2019 claims in our state courts. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>527 F. Sup. 569, 577 (D. Conn. 1981).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The District Court stayed those proceedings on the basis of its application of the doctrine of \u201cequitable restraint,\u201d analogiz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ing Edmund Price\u2019s suit in the federal court to those cases in which a party seeks to enjoin state court proceedings, and pointing out that he had an \u201copportunity\u201d to raise his constitutional claims in our state courts. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Rust, </em>supra, 573, 576-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In presenting this oral motion to the court for the first time on March 10, 1982, at the commencement of the trial on the permanent injunction, the defendants had not yet reduced their counterclaim to writing for formal presentation to the court. The counterclaim, which contained ninety-seven paragraphs of allegations and six counts, was not in fact filed until April 5, 1982. On March 10, 1982, the defendants\u2019 counsel, in arguing for permission to file the counterclaim, stated that he \u201cwould have to sweep into [this case] all of the [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1983 allegations which were raised in the federal court.\u201d He also argued that he did not want the defendants to be in the position of having \u201cwaived\u201d any of their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In denying the defendants\u2019 motion, the trial court pointed out that the present case had been filed with a return date of December 22,1980; that a temporary injunction had been granted and such cases should be expedited;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that the case at that point in time during the trial was factually a relatively simple case, that the counterclaim would distort the matter and that it would be an improper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to grant the defendants\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We note, however, that immediately thereafter the court granted a subsequent motion of the defendants to file a special defense, the essence of which was that the conduct com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>plained of by the plaintiffs amended complaint was \u201cpermitted as of right pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) and \u00a7 22a-40 (b) (1).\u201d The plaintiff stated that it had no objection to this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We have previously pointed out that the underlying purposes of Practice Book \u00a7 116 are \u201c \u2018judicial economy, avoidance of multiplicity of litigation, and avoidance of piecemeal disposition of what is essentially one action . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Glen Valley Associates, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 158, 161, 459 A.2d 525 (1983), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Conland, </em>171 Conn. 161, 167, 368 A.2d 3 (1976). Whether these policies are served by permitting a counterclaim is a matter for the trial court\u2019s discretion and its determination in that regard ought not be disturbed unless there is an abuse of discretion. <em>Wallingford </em>v. <em>Glen Valley Associates, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Conland, </em>supra, 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The trial court in this case was presented with a ninety-seven paragraph counterclaim in six counts,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which sought to cite in additional parties and which raised numerous constitutional issues not previously raised at all before the court in the temporary injunction and not until the day on which the trial on the permanent injunction was commenced. Moreover, the trial court noted the tardiness of the motion to amend by adding the counterclaim. We also note that the federal court\u2019s decision in Price v. <em>Rust, </em>supra, was handed down on October 27, 1981, and yet the defendants did not move to amend by adding the counterclaim until the first day of trial which was more than four months later and that the counterclaim itself was not in fact filed in court until over five months after the federal court\u2019s decision. Considering these factors, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the posture of the case at the time the motion was made, as one dealing with permanent injunctive relief, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 untimely motion for permission to file its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In this opinion Peters and Grillo, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> The plaintiff\u2019s prayer for relief also included requests for damages of $1000 per day, and attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44; an order requiring the defendants to comply with all applicable statutes and regulations; and any other relief which the court deemed proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> The plaintiff has filed a cross appeal, and a counterstatement of issues which raise essentially the same questions of law raised by the defendants\u2019 appeal.

This claim is without merit not only because the plaintiffs action was brought under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45, but also because this issue was never raised by the defendants at the trial.

I disagree with the portion of the majority opinion which concludes that the defendants\u2019 activities in repairing the break in the earthen part of the existing dam could reasonably have been found by the trial court to constitute the \u201calteration\u201d of a watercourse and thus a \u201cregulated activity\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-38 (13). The \u201cmaintenance of existing structures\u201d is expressly included as one of the incidental residential uses of property which \u201cshall be permitted in wetlands and watercourses, as of right . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4). Such an activity, therefore, does not fall within the definition of \u201cregulated activity\u201d in \u00a7 22a-38 (13), which excludes \u201cthe specified activities in section 22a-40.\u201d It is undisputed that the dam which the defendants sought to repair was an \u201cexisting\u201d structure and I fail to comprehend why their efforts to repair the break in the earthen portion did not constitute \u201cmaintenance\u201d within the intent of \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (4) as the majority opinion assumes. To find that simply by repairing the dam the defendants were engaged in the \u201calteration\u201d of a watercourse and thus a \u201cregulated activity\u201d renders wholly illusory the exemption which the legislature explicitly created for \u201cmaintenance of existing structures\u201d as an incidental use of residential property which is \u201cpermitted in wetlands and watercourses, <em>as of right. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)
