J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">Robert Linyard and two others, a man and a woman, were charged with illegal possession of heroin in violation of section 11500 of the Health and Safety Code. Linyard, prior to trial, admitted to three prior narcotic convictions. All three pleaded not guilty. Prior to trial the female defendant changed her plea to guilty. The two remaining accused were jointly tried before a jury. Linyard was found guilty and his codefendant not guilty. Linyard appeals from the judgment of conviction and from the order denying his motion for a new trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The evidence is amply sufficient to sustain the finding of guilt. The three defendants were arrested in room 11 of a rooming house on Sutter Street, in San Francisco, on April 25, 1956. The evidence as to whether defendant resided in the rooming house prior to the arrest was conflicting, but a police inspector testified that there was clothing of defendant in the room. The police were informed that an offense was occurring in room 11 by a person who lived in the building adjoining that in which defendants were arrested and whose bathroom was on the same level and about 8 feet distant from room. 11. He could see from his bathroom window into room 11. On several occasions he saw several people, including appellant but not including his codefendant, bind their arms with a bandana, withdraw something from a spoon with a needle, and inject the needle into their arms. About April 20, 1956, he reported the matter to the police. They called at his apartment several times, observed what was happening in room 11, and made the arrests on April 25,1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">One of the officers testified that he \u201csaw different people entering the place, female and male, sitting down on the chairs, one and two at a time, wrapping tourniquets around their arms, and injecting some type of fluid into their arms.\u201d On the night of April 25th he saw two men and a woman in room 11. One of the men was wearing a brown sport coat and a brown hat, and was seen heating a spoon over some matches. This officer and his associate left their observation spot and proceeded immediately next door to room 11. The officers forced their way into the room and arrested the three occupants. These were defendant, his codefendant and the woman who subsequently pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The other officer corroborated the first officer and also testified that he observed the man dressed in brown tie a rag around his left arm and insert a needle into his flesh.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">It took the officers about three minutes to go from the neighbor\u2019s apartment to room 11. When the officers broke in, appellant was the only person present dressed in brown and wearing a hat, and was observed kneeling on the floor and withdrawing a needle from his arm. This he threw under the bed when the officers broke in. His arm was bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The police found a bindle containing 3 grains of heroin and assorted narcotic paraphernalia in the room. Appellant admitted to the officers that in the past he had used heroin, and, upon arraignment, admitted several prior narcotic eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>victions. At the trial he denied any knowledge that narcotics or narcotic equipment were in room 11 prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">On the evidence the case is not a close one. The evidence is substantial and convincing to support the implied finding that appellant at the time and place involved was knowingly in the possession of heroin. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 679 [263 P.2d 853] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bock Leung Chew, </em>142 Cal.App.2d 400 [298 P.2d 118] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Denne, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 499 [297 P.2d 451].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The major contentions of appellant center around claimed misconduct on the part of the district attorney. It is first urged that the district attorney improperly attempted to impeach appellant in connection with his prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. In such event the prosecution may impeach by showing prior felony convictions, even where such priors are admitted on arraignment. When a defendant takes the stand he becomes subject to the same rules for testing his credibility as any other witness, including impeachment as provided in section 2051 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>45 Cal.2d 158 [287 P.2d 752]; <em>People </em>v. <em>David, </em>12 Cal.2d 639 [86 P.2d 811] <em>; People </em>v. <em>Romer, </em>218 Cal. 449 [23 P.2d 749]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>116 Cal. 682 [48 P. 803] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hickman, </em>113 Cal. 80 [45 P. 175].) Appellant concedes that this is the rule, but contends that prejudicial error was committed during the following portions of his cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been convicted of a felony, Mr. Linyard ? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">\u201cQ. Weren\u2019t you convicted of possession of heroin, a felony? A. Well, I did county time. It was [a] misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">\u201cQ. Weren\u2019t you given probation on condition of county time? A. I don\u2019t know how\u2014I couldn\u2019t recall what the deal was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">\u201cQ. Of course, you did time more than once, on possession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">\u201cMe. Perasso : Tour Honor, I am going to object to this line of questioning. If the district attorney disbelieves his statement that he was never convicted of a felony, there\u2019s other methods of proving it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-13\">\u201cThe Court: I will sustain an objection. That was for the purpose of proving knowledge. I think you have proven that-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-14\">\u201cMr. Campbell: All right, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-15\">\u201cThe Court:\u2014by his testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that, upon a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>denying having been convicted of a felony, for impeachment purposes the prosecution is limited by section 2051 of the Code of Civil Procedure to the introduction into evidence of the record of conviction. That section contains no such limitation. It permits the showing of a prior felony conviction \u201cby the examination of the witness, <em>or </em>the record of the judgment.\u201d While the most frequently used method of impeachment in case of a denial of the prior is by the introduction of the record of conviction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>32 Cal.2d 78 [195 P.2d 393]), the prosecution has as an alternative a limited right to cross-examine on the prior convictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chenault, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 487 [169 P.2d 29]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bauweraerts, </em>164 Cal. 696 [130 P. 717] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>22 Cal.App.2d 532 [71 P.2d 841] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kepford, </em>52 Cal.App. 508 [199 P. 64].) Such cross-examination is limited by the requirement that it must be conducted in good faith.  In the instant ease the appellant had admitted that he had been convicted in the superior court of two prior violations of section 11500 of the Health and Safety Code, and had been convicted in the municipal court of a prior violation of section 11721 of the same code. The prosecutor was entitled to believe that at least one of those convictions was a felony conviction because section 11712 of the Health and Safety Code provides that in the event \u201cany\u201d prior narcotic conviction is charged and found to be true, the defendant \u201cshall be imprisoned in the state prison,\u201d which, of course, makes the offense a felony. (Pen. Code, \u00a717.)  Moreover, the prosecution was required to show that defendant had knowledge of the narcotic nature of the drug he was charged with possessing. Even evidence of misdemeanor convictions is admissible to show such knowledge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 97 [294 P.2d 997].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">It will be noted that the questioning was not prolonged, the jury was admonished, and the evidence of guilt was clear and convincing. Even if it be held that the quoted cross-examination were erroneous, it could not possibly have been prejudicial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bauweraerts, </em>164 Cal. 696 [130 P. 717] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 380 [231 P.2d 881] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>104 Cal.App. 107 [285 P. 401].)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The appellant next contends that the prosecutor improperly and prejudicially attempted to impeach him on collateral matters. Immediately after the cross-examination above quoted the prosecuting attorney continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201cQ. On this evening of April 25th, 1956, you were not at 1772 Sutter Street for the purpose of visiting your wife and children, were you ? A. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u20181Q. Did you see them that evening ? A. I saw them. I saw them every time I was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cQ. You have been separated from your wife and children some time, haven\u2019t you? A. My daughter has just moved over to Frisco with her mother. She\u2019s been with me all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201cQ. Didn\u2019t your wife just have you put in jail for not paying her support? A. She didn\u2019t have me put in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201cMr. Perasso: Your Honor, I am objecting to this line of questioning. I think it is time\u2014the second time around on this type of questioning. I am going to have to make a motion</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">for a mistrial, at this time, upon the conduct of-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">1 \u2018 The Court : I deny the motion for mistrial; I will sustain an objection to the question and I will instruct the Jury to draw no inference of any kind, whatsoever, from the questions of the district attorney as to the support of his family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">It is asserted that these questions about nonsupport were asked in bad faith for the sole purpose of degrading appellant on a collateral matter. The attorney general argues that the questions were proper for the reason that appellant had testified on direct examination that his presence in the rooming house was for the purpose of seeing his wife and two children who lived in the building. It is argued that the questioning objected to was proper in an attempt to discredit this explanation given by appellant for his presence. The case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Dole, 122 </em>Cal. 486, is relied on, where, at page 491 [55 P. 581, 68 Am.St.Rep. 50], it is stated: \u201cAny fact may be called out in cross-examination which a jury might deem inconsistent with the direct testimony of a witness, and a defendant testifying in his own behalf is in this respect put upon the same plane with other witnesses.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Zerillo, </em>36 Cal.2d 222 [223 P.2d 223].) This reasoning seems correct. Moreover, even if the questions should not have been asked, in view of the clear and convincing evidence of guilt, their asking could not have been prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Appellant next complains of alleged prejudicial remarks of the prosecuting attorney in his arguments to the jury. These remarks are three in number:</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">1. The prosecutor observed that where male and female defendants are involved in narcotic, prostitution or pimping charges, the woman always comes forward and attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>take the \u201crap\u201d for her male codefendants. He continued: \u201c. . . But, rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that just because Arlene Laecetti says that that heroin was hers, it does not mean that it wasn\u2019t also jointly in the possession of the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">2. The prosecutor also stated that narcotics were a great evil, that it was the number one crime problem, that there was nothing more vicious than the narcotic traffic; that all the things the jury may have heard about narcotics were not exaggerated; that once a person acquires a narcotic habit it costs him from $5.00 to $50 a day to supply the habit and \u201cthey have to turn to crime to afford it\u201d; and that no doctor or hospital in the United States will prescribe heroin because it is so habit-forming.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">3. In his concluding remarks the prosecutor stated that if \u201cbecause of some feeling, that you think your verdict should be swayed by some pity or sympathy for these defendants or some feeling that [the] prosecution has not proved these two defendants guilty beyond every single doubt, instead of just beyond a reasonable doubt, if you have such a feeling as that, ladies and gentlemen, we might just as well wipe every law off the books, because, in the final analysis, all our laws are in your hands as jurors and, I ask you again, only to use your common sense in this ease and you will come to the correct conclusion that these two defendants are guilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Appellant argues that these remarks were in no way connected with the evidence introduced and were calculated to inflame the jury. He cites, in this connection, <em>People </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 189 [300 P.2d 898]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 554 [300 P.2d 106], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ortez, </em>120 Cal.App.2d 469 [261 P.2d 325], In the Ramirez case, even though the prosecutor \u201cwent far beyond the limits of proper argument\u201d (p. 557), the error was held not to be prejudicial and the judgment of conviction was affirmed. The Ortez case did not involve improper argument to the jury but involved claimed improper cross-examination of the defendant. The court found that the questions were asked in good faith, held the error to be nonprejudicial, and affirmed the conviction. The Simms case did involve \u201cflagrant misconduct of the prosecuting attorney in his argument to the jury\u201d (p. 198) in which he gave his personal opinion of the guilt of defendant. In addition, the trial court gave conflicting and misleading instructions. The judgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>was reversed, the appellate court holding that, on the facts, the case was \u201ca close one.\u201d (P. 200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The prosecuting attorney undoubtedly went too far in stating that female codefendants always take the \u201crap\u201d in narcotics and other eases. The other two matters discussed were within the realm of permissible argument.  The reference to narcotics as a social evil simply called attention to a fact well within the common knowledge of all. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Head, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 734 [239 P.2d 506].)  The statements of the prosecutor contained in the last mentioned statement above was within the proper sphere of argument. It went no further than to tell the jury that, based on the evidence introduced, the prosecutor believed appellant was guilty. This was permissible argument. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Head, </em>108 Cal.App.2d 734 [239 P.2d 506] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkes, </em>39 Cal.2d 719 [249 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The error committed here could not possibly have been prejudicial. This is not a case like <em>People </em>v. <em>Kirkes, </em>39 Cal.2d 719 [249 P.2d 1], which involved \u201cflagrant misconduct\u201d on the part of the prosecuting attorney and where, on the evidence, \u201cthe scales of justice [were] somewhat evenly balanced.\u201d (P. 727.) Here the error was not flagrant and the evidence of guilt is clear and convincing. Here there was eyewitness testimony of two police officers and a neighbor, plus the uncontradieted fact that there were narcotics and narcotic equipment in the room where appellant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Bray, J., and Wood (Fred B.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
