Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19-13-B100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment for the defendant and the plaintiffs appeal, asserting that the trial court improperly (1) required the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant\u2019s septic system violated the public health code even though the defendant failed to heed the plaintiffs\u2019 notice of the health code violation and failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to that notice, (2) found that \u00a7 19-13-B100 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies was unconstitutionally vague, and (3) found that \u201cthe [plaintiff town] is using the health code to enforce its determination that it wishes to limit winterization of seasonal homes without promulgating regulations and standards.\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 first claim and reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. The defendant is the fee owner of property located at 78 West Shore Drive in the town of Haddam. She purchased the property on December 18, 1990, by warranty deed. On March 24,1992, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>director of health sent the defendant a notice of violation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> stating that she was in violation of \u00a7 19-13-B100 of the public health code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The notice clearly stated that a person aggrieved by the director of health may appeal the order by telephoning the office of the commissioner of health services (now the commissioner of public health and addiction services) within forty-eight hours, but the telephone call must be followed by a letter of appeal within seven days pursuant to \u00a7 19-2a-34 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant indicated her intent to appeal the order by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>telephoning the commissioner within the forty-eight hour period, but failed to file a letter of appeal within seven days. Consequently, her administrative appeal was dismissed on April 14, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The plaintiffs thereafter commenced an action in Superior Court seeking, inter alia, temporary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the defendant to cease and desist from using the subsurface sewage disposal system on a year-round basis. After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a permanent injunction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The plaintiffs first contend that the trial court improperly required the plaintiffs to prove a violation of the public health code even though the defendant had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">A director of health has the authority to examine and cause to be abated nuisances and sources of filth injurious to the public health pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-206.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a party chooses to challenge an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>issued by the director of health, the party must appeal to the commissioner of public health and addiction services pursuant to \u00a7 19a-2a-34 of the state regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A party aggrieved by the agency\u2019s decision may then appeal to the Superior Court. The judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s actions is governed by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Uniform Administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Procedures Act. Where a party appeals an agency\u2019s decision, a reviewing court may grant relief only where the decision is \u201carbitrary, illegal or not reasonably supported by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 718, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989). A showing that another decision maker might have reached a different conclusion is not sufficient to satisfy this burden. <em>Newtown </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>234 Conn. 312, 319, 661 A.2d 589 (1995). If an order to remove or abate is not complied with, \u00a7 19a-206 (b) provides that the director of health \u201cmay institute and maintain a civil action for injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction . . . and such court shall have the power to grant such relief upon notice and hearing . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">It is well established that a party must exhaust all administrative remedies before that party may ask a court to rule on the very issues that the administrative process was meant to test. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351-52, 542 A.2d 672 (1988); see also <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit Districts. Local Union 1336, </em>211 Conn. 436, 438, 559 A.2d 1113 (1989). The exhaustion doctrine \u201creflects the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Kristoff </em>180 Conn. 575, 578, 430 A.2d 1294 (1980). It also \u201crelieves courts of the burden of prematurely deciding questions that, entrusted to an agency, may receive a satisfactory administrative disposition and avoid the need for judicial review.\u201d <em>Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Assn. of America </em>v. <em>State, </em>209 Conn. 679, 692, 553 A.2d 1104 (1989). \u201c \u2018[Fjrequent and deliberate flouting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>administrative processes could weaken the effectiveness of an agency by encouraging people to ignore its procedures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cannata v. Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 625, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990), quoting <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 194-95, 89 S. Ct. 1657, 23 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">It would violate the exhaustion doctrine and its policy underpinnings to allow a defendant who has failed to exhaust administrative remedies to defeat an agency\u2019s injunction action on issues that could have been contested in the administrative process. We conclude that the plaintiffs were not required to prove a violation of the public health code.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Proof of a regulatory violation is not required if \u201cthe defendant has chosen not to attack the reasonableness of the order . . . [and] factfinding has been entrusted by the legislature to the administrative agency and an injunction is sought to enforce an administrative order in furtherance of a vital public interest.\u201d <em>Carothers </em>v. <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co., </em>19 Conn. App. 216, 222, 561 A.2d 971 (1989), citing <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corp., </em>170 Conn. 27, 364 A.2d 208 (1975). In <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>the plaintiff water resources commission found that the defendant was polluting state waters and issued orders to abate. The defendant did not obey the orders and did not pursue an administrative appeal. The plaintiff then applied for a permanent injunction and the defendant, by way of special defense, pleaded that it was not polluting state waters. At trial, the court precluded the defendant from introducing evidence in support of its special defense. Our Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that \u201c[t]o allow the defendant to present at the hearing on the application for an injunction evidence in support of its special defenses would be contrary to the obvious intent of the General Assembly as expressed in the statute providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>for judicial review after administrative fact finding and would render the administrative process meaningless.\u201d <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corp., </em>supra, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Although this case was not brought pursuant to the environmental protection statutes, the <em>Water Resources Commission </em>rationale is applicable to this case. A defendant who circumvents the administrative appeal process should not be permitted to force the agency to prove in Superior Court those matters that the administrative process is designed to handle. To allow the defendant to do so would mean that a person who ignores the available administrative remedies could have the Superior Court act as an administrative fact finder in the first instance, whereas a person who exhausts the administrative remedies, to no avail, would be entitled in the Superior Court to only a deferential record review of the agency\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">We are not persuaded that the trial court was required to issue an injunction on a showing that the defendant failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. The issuance of a mandatory injunction on a showing of an unheeded and unappealed order is reserved for \u201c \u2018the exceptional case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Water Resources Commission </em>v. <em>Connecticut Sand &amp; Stone Corp., </em>supra, 170 Conn. 33. Because the record before us does not present such exceptional circumstances, the trial court remains vested with broad discretion. Such retention of discretion is supported by the reasoning of similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">For example, where a party seeks an injunction to enjoin the violation of a zoning law, a trial court is not required to issue an injunction even where the plaintiff successfully proves a violation. Rather, our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[t]he grant of jurisdiction to ensure compliance with a statute hardly suggests an absolute duty to do so under any and all circumstances, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>[trial judge] ... is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law.\u201d(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 430, 479 A.2d 187 (1984); see also <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn 575, 626 A.2d 259 (1993). \u201c[T]he granting of injunctive relief . . . must be compatible with the equities of the case [and] rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Murzyn, </em>1 Conn. App. 176, 183, 469 A.2d 1227, cert. denied, 192 Conn. 802, 471 A.2d 244 (1984). \u201cThose equities should take into account the gravity and willfulness of the violation, as well as the potential harm . . . .\u2019\u2019Id. Failure to exhaust administrative remedies is one factor the trial court may consider in balancing the equities. Id. On remand, the trial court should balance the equities in determining whether to grant the requested injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The defendant asserts that the circumstances of this case fall within an exception to the exhaustion doctrine because she challenged \u00a7 19-13-B100 of the public health code as being unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">While there are recognized exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine, \u201cwe have recognized such exceptions only infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes.\u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 79, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986). One such exception \u201cinvolves a challenge to the constitutionality of the statute or regulation under which an agency operates, rather than to the actions of the board or agency.\u201d <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Fairfield Hills Hospital, </em>215 Conn. 675, 680, 578 A.2d 1025 (1990). \u201c[T]he mere allegation of a constitutional violation will not necessarily excuse a [party\u2019s] failure to exhaust available administrative remedies . . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Section 4-176 (a) of the General Statutes provides that \u201c[a]ny person may petition an agency . . . for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation . . . The exhaustion doctrine requires that \u201c[a] challenge to a regulation . . . should begin with a petition to the agency itself.\u201d <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>208 Conn. 663, 672, 546 A.2d 257 (1988). In this case, the defendant could have filed a petition for a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 with the department of public health and addiction services, claiming that \u00a7 19-13-B100 was unconstitutionally vague. Because the defendant could have appealed any adverse declaratory ruling to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183, she was required to seek such a ruling before seeking redress in court. <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>227 Conn. 545, 558, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> The town of Haddam and John Korab, the town\u2019s director of health, are the plaintiffs in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\"> Regs., Conn.
