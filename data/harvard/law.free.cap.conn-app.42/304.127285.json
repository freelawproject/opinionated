Swaine, </em>for the appellant (petitioner).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-4\"><em>James M. Ralls, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, with whom, on the brief, were <em>Michael Dearinglon, </em>state\u2019s attorney, and <em>Christopher Alexy, </em>assistant state\u2019s attorney, for the appellee (respondent).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A_H\">After a review of the record and briefs, and after hearing from the parties at oral argument, we conclude that the petitioner in this habeas corpus appeal has failed to make a substantial showing that he has been denied a state or federal constitutional right and, further, has failed to sustain his burden of persuasion that the denial of certification to appeal was a clear abuse of discretion or that an injustice has been done. See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 659 A.2d 195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s writ was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim and a determination that the petitioner had failed to establish prejudice as required by <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 424, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991). In order to show prejudice, the petitioner must establish that there exists a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different but for counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance. <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>195 Conn. 636, 640, 490 A.2d 82 (1985). A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 454, 610 A.2d 598 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The habeas court reviewed the petitioner\u2019s claims in the context of his testimony before that court and in light of the testimony of the other witnesses before it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>including trial counsel. The habeas court also had before it the petitioner\u2019s statements to the police explaining how it came to pass that the victim shot herself in his presence. The habeas court had before it more than sufficient evidence to find that the petitioner was not prejudiced by any assumed ineffective assistance on the part of trial counsel. Moreover, after hearing the testimony of the petitioner, the habeas court made a factual determination that his testimony lacked credibility and found that his testimony at the criminal trial would not have caused a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The petitioner\u2019s attack on the performance of appellate counsel in his direct appeal is equally unavailing. \u201cWe conclude that, in order for the petitioner to establish prejudice resulting from his appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he must establish that, as a result of that performance, there remains a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict that resulted in his appeal. Put another way, he must establish that, because of the failure of his appellate counsel to raise a [secondary lesser included offense] claim, there is a reasonable probability that he remains burdened by an unreliable determination of his guilt.\u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 454. Thus, his claim with respect to the alleged ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is subject to the same infirmity as is his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a lack of proof of the requisite prejudice. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>220 Conn. 112, 132, 595 A.2d 1356 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
