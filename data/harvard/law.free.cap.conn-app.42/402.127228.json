The FOIC claims that the trial court improperly (1) substituted its judgment for that of the FOIC and (2) concluded that the predisciplinary conference at issue was not a \u201cmeeting\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fairchild asserts that the trial court improperly (1) concluded that the predisciplinary conference at issue was not a meeting pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) and (2) relied on a provision in the collective bargaining agreement between the town and the police union local. We agree with the FOIC\u2019s first claim and, on that basis, reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. In July, 1993, and for a period of time prior thereto, Fairchild was a Wallingford police sergeant and the plaintiff was the Wallingford chief of police. On July 30, 1993, the plaintiff, by a written memorandum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ordered Fairchild to appear at a \u201cpredisciplinaiy conference\u201d to take place before the plaintiff on August 24, 1993, in the plaintiffs conference room. The memorandum indicated that Fairchild\u2019s work performance was to be the subject of the conference. After he received the memorandum, Fairchild requested that the conference be open to the public and that he be allowed to tape-record the proceedings. The plaintiff denied Fair-child\u2019s requests, and the conference was held in private. Only the plaintiff was allowed to tape-record the conference. Fairchild attended the conference accompanied by union representatives. Subsequent to the conference, the plaintiff disciplined Fairchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On September 2, 1993, Fairchild filed a complaint with the FOIC, claiming that the plaintiff violated the Freedom of Information Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when he denied Fairchild\u2019s requests to open the conference to the public and to tape-record the conference. A hearing was held before an FOIC commissioner on November 18, 1993. At the hearing, Fairchild claimed that the conference was a meeting pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) and that, consequently, he should have been permitted to tape-record the conference and to have it open to the public pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-21 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and l-21a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fairchild asserted that, pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b), the conference met the definition of a meeting because it was a \u201chearing or other proceeding of a public agency ... to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>or act upon a matter over which the public agency has supervision, control, jurisdiction or advisory power. . . .\u201d Fairchild indicated that the conference may have been an \u201cexecutive session,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a type of meeting from which the public may be excluded, however, he argued that the executive session exception did not apply. Fair-child requested that the August 24, 1993 conference be declared \u201cnull and void\u201d and that future predisciplinary conferences before the plaintiff be considered meetings under \u00a7 l-18a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In response to Fairchild\u2019s contentions, the plaintiff claimed that the predisciplinary conference was not a meeting under \u00a7 l-18a (b). The plaintiff asserted that under \u00a7 l-18a (b), the conference was excepted from being a meeting because it was \u201can administrative or staff meeting of a single-member public agency.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff raised no other reason why the conference should not be considered a meeting under \u00a7 l-18a (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The commissioner issued a final decision that was adopted by the FOIC. The FOIC determined that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7\u00a7 1-21 (a) and l-21a (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The FOIC rejected the plaintiffs claim that the predisciplinary conference was an administrative or staff meeting of a single-member public agency under \u00a7 l-18a (b). The FOIC agreed with Fairchild and found that the conference was a meeting pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) because it was a \u201cproceeding\u201d of a public agency, namely, the Wallingford police department.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The FOIC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>did not declare the August 24, 1993 conference to be null and void, but rather, it ordered the plaintiff to comply with \u00a7\u00a7 1-21 (a) and l-21a (a) in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The plaintiff appealed from the FOIC\u2019s decision to the trial court. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal, finding that the FOIC improperly determined that the predisciplinary conference should have been open to the public. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated: \u201cThe court has reviewed the whole record and the arguments of counsel and concludes that the conference was part of the grievance procedure established by the collective bargaining agreement between the town and the police union. That being so, the conference was not a \u2018meeting\u2019 as that term is defined in \u00a7 1-18a (b) and was not subject to the requirement of \u00a7 1-21 that \u2018meetings\u2019 be held in public.\u201d It is clear from the memorandum of decision that the trial court was persuaded by the plaintiffs argument that the conference was not a meeting pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) because it was \u201cstrategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This argument, however, was never raised before the FOIC and was raised for the first time on appeal to the trial court.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>We address the FOIC\u2019s first claim, namely, that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the FOIC. The gravamen of the FOIC\u2019s claim is that the trial court, in determining that the predisciplinary conference was not a meeting pursuant to \u00a7 l-18a (b) because it fell under the exception of being \u201cstrategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining,\u201d failed to confine its review of the FOIC\u2019s decision to the issues raised and the findings in the administrative record. We agree. Because our resolution of this claim is dispositive of the defendants\u2019 appeal, we do not reach the remaining issues raised by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cJudicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (General Statutes, c. 54, \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189), and the scope of that review is very restricted. . . . Neither this court nor the trial court may retry the case or substitute its own judgment for that of the defendant. . . . <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 773, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). Even as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . [Id., 774.] Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 773-74; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980). . . . <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>[228 Conn. 158, 164-65, 635 A.2d 783 (1993)]. . . . <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>233 Conn. 28, 39, 657 A.2d 630 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>41 Conn. App. 67, 72-73, 674 A.2d 462 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The administrative record reveals that the FOIC determined, on the basis of the evidence before it, that there was no support for the plaintiffs refusal to allow the predisciplinary conference to be open to the public or to be tape-recorded by Fairchild. See id., 73. The FOIC\u2019s decision \u201cmet the factual situation as presented\u201d; id.; namely, whether the predisciplinary conference was a meeting subject to public exposure <em>or </em>an administrative or staff meeting of a single-member public agency that would be exempt from public exposure. This was the sole issue presented to the FOIC for analysis under \u00a7 l-18a (b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The trial court \u201cneedlessly enlarged the issue on appeal\u201d; id.; by examining the question of whether the predisciplinary conference consisted of \u201cstrategy or negotiations with respect to collective bargaining\u201d under \u00a7 l-18a (b), an argument not found in the administrative record. See id. Such an argument was neither raised before nor addressed by the FOIC. \u201cAlthough the trial court might well have reached a conclusion different from that reached by the [FOIC], the limited scope of review set forth in \u00a7 4-183 (j), and expressed by our appellate courts, does not allow that result. Here, the trial court improperly traveled a different path rather than determining whether the [FOIC] properly trod on the stepping stones of the path it took.\u201d Id., 74. We therefore conclude that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the FOIC. On remand, the trial court must apply the proper scope of review in examining the FOIC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> The defendants appealed separately from the judgment of the trial court.

Subsequently, the plaintiff filed in this court a motion for review of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for articulation. See Practice Book \u00a7 4054. In his motion for review, the plaintiff requested that we order the trial court to elaborate on its decision in the manner requested by the plaintiff in his motion for articulation. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>granted the motion for review but denied the relief requested. \u201cAn articulation is not an opportunity for a trial court to substitute a new decision nor to change the reasoning or basis of a prior decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sawmill Brook Racing Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Realty Advisors, Inc., </em>39 Conn.
