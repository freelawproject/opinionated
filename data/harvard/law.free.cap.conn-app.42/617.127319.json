J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss this appeal and for the sanction of attorney\u2019s fees because the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel abused the appellate pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>cess. After granting the motion to dismiss the appeal, we held a hearing on June 5,1996, to address the defendant\u2019s motion for sanctions. We grant the defendant\u2019s motion for sanctions and, further, sua sponte, prohibit the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel from filing any papers in this court and from making an appearance in this court for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The facts that are relevant to an understanding of the defendant\u2019s motion for sanctions follow. This action involves a contract for the sale of the defendant\u2019s real property. The plaintiffs, Leslie Srager and Joan Srager, brought a prior action against the defendant and others, and the plaintiffs filed two notices of lis pendens on the defendant\u2019s property in connection with that action. The suit was subsequently dismissed as to the defendant for insufficient service of process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then brought another action against the defendant and filed athirdnotice oflis pendens on the defendant\u2019s property. Before the trial court had an opportunity to consider the defendant\u2019s motions to discharge the three notices of lis pendens, the plaintiffs filed a fourth notice of lis pendens on the defendant\u2019s property. The court, <em>Vertefeuille, J., </em>after a hearing, discharged the first three notices of lis pendens declaring them invalid. Subsequently, the fourth notice of lis pendens was also discharged by the court, <em>Vertefeuille, J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Upon discharge of the fourth notice of lis pendens, the plaintiffs filed an untimely appeal in this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-325c. Because the statutory appeal period implicated this court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the appeal was dismissed. <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>36 Conn. App. 469, 651 A.2d 752 (1994). The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tiffs subsequently filed this appeal from the discharge by the court, <em>Levin, J., </em>of a fifth notice of lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Attorney John Timbers, who has represented the plaintiffs in all of the proceedings before the trial court, continues to represent the plaintiffs on appeal. The plaintiffs commenced the original action on May 1,1992, for, inter alia, an order compelling the defendant to convey to them his property located at 1662 and 1664 Fairfield Beach Road in Fairfield. The fifth notice of lis pendens filed on the defendant\u2019s property was discharged more than three years later, by order dated May 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">After the filing of the plaintiffs\u2019 second appeal, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to prosecute with proper diligence because Timbers failed, after receiving five extensions, to file a timely appellants\u2019 brief. We granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and now consider his request for sanctions against Timbers for abuse of the appellate process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">\u201cIt is an inherent power of the court to discipline members of the bar, and to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions to compel the observance of its rules. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 33-34, 474 A.2d 787 (1984). \u201cThe practice of law is ... a profession the main purpose of which is to aid in the doing of justice . . . . <em>In re Application of Griffiths, </em>162 Conn. 249, 254-55, 294 A.2d 281 (1972), rev\u2019d and remanded, 413 U.S. 717, 93 S. Ct. 2851, 37 L. Ed. 2d 910 (1973), quoting <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>State Bar Examining Committee, </em>116 Conn. 409, 414, 165 A. 211 (1933). An attorney as an officer of the court in the administration of justice, is continually accountable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>it for the manner in which he exercises the privilege that has been accorded him. <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 450, 91 A. 274 (1914). This unique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary and subjects them to its discipline.

These are inherent power, statutory power, and the power conferred by published rules of the court. The power of a court to manage its dockets and cases by the imposition of sanctions to prevent undue delays in the disposition of pending cases is of ancient origin, having its roots in judgments . . . entered at common law . . . and dismissals .... That power may be expressly recognized by rule or statute but it exists independently of either and arises because of the control that must necessarily be vested in courts in order for them to be able to manage their own affairs so as to achieve an orderly and expeditious disposition of cases. . . . Simply stated, [t]he inherent powers of . . . courts are those which are necessary to the exercise of all others. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Feuerman </em>v. <em>Feuerman, </em>39 Conn. App. 775, 777, 667 A.2d 802 (1995), quoting <em>In the Matter of Presnick, </em>19 Conn. App. 340, 347, 563 A.2d 299, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 801, 567 A.2d 833 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4184, the following actions, among others, may result in the imposition of sanctions: failure to comply with rules and orders of the court; filing of any papers that unduly delay the progress of an appeal; presentation to the court of unnecessary or unwarranted motions; repeated failures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>to meet deadlines; and presentation to the court of a frivolous appeal or frivolous issues on appeal. \u201cOffenders will be subject, at the discretion of the court, after hearing, to appropriate discipline, including the prohibition against appearing in the court or filing any papers in the court for a reasonable and definite period of time, the imposition of a fine pursuant to Gen. Stat., \u00a7 51-84, and costs and payment of expenses, together with attorney\u2019s fees to the opposing party. ...\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4184.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The appellate record in this case is replete with instances of Timbers\u2019 failing to comply with the rules of this court, filing unnecessary and unwarranted motions that have unduly delayed the progress of this appeal and repeatedly failing to meet deadlines. When considered together, they evidence an overall course of conduct that is a blatant and continuous abuse of the judicial process, and of the rules of this court. We conclude that the sum of Timbers\u2019 actions that are hereinafter described constitutes an egregious abuse of the appellate process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">He filed three motions for articulation in the trial court. One of the motions for articulation concerned Judge Vertefeuille\u2019s order discharging the fourth notice of lis pendens. Because the appeal did not concern that order, but instead concerned Judge Levin\u2019s order discharging the fifth notice of lis pendens, the motion for articulation directed to Judge Vertefeuille was improper pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">He sought untimely appellate review under Practice Book \u00a7 4054, resulting in the filing of a motion for per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>mission to file a late motion for review. He failed to file a timely memorandum in opposition to the defendant\u2019s previous motion for sanctions in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 4041 (a), resulting in a motion for permission to file an untimely memorandum in opposition. He failed to file a timely memorandum in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and for sanctions in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 4041 (a), resulting in a motion for permission to file an untimely memorandum in opposition and a motion for permission to file a substitute memorandum in opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">He failed to file a timely appellants\u2019 brief, resulting in six requests for extensions; he failed to file the requisite number of copies of the appellants\u2019 brief in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 4070; he filed a motion for permission to file a substitute appellants\u2019 brief, after having finally filed a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">These actions reveal that the majority of motions and filings submitted in this court by Timbers on behalf of the plaintiffs became necessary only as a result of Timbers\u2019 delinquent behavior. During the sanctions hearing, Timbers explained that because he is a sole practitioner, it is difficult for him to comply with the rules of practice with respect to deadlines and copy requirements. While the demands of appellate practice may be more onerous for a sole practitioner, this court bears the responsibility of processing cases in an orderly and expeditious manner. See <em>In the Matter of </em>Presnick, supra, 19 Conn. App. 351. \u201cDisciplinary proceedings not only concern the rights of the lawyer and the client, but also the rights of the public and the rights of the judiciary to ensure that lawyers uphold their unique position as officers and commissioners of the court. ... An attorney must conduct himself or herself in a manner that comports with the proper functioning of the judicial system.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>There is a recurring pattern of abuse of the judicial process exhibited by Timbers. In <em>CFM of Connecticut </em>v. Chowdhury, 38 Conn. App. 745, 745 n.1, 662 A.2d 1340, cert. granted on cross appeal, 235 Conn. 933, 667 A.2d 1270 (1995), this court dismissed a portion of Timbers\u2019 client\u2019s appeal as untimely under Practice Book \u00a7 4009. We dismissed the remaining portion of the appeal because of Timbers\u2019 failure to file a timely appellant\u2019s brief that complied with the rules of practice. The <em>Chowdhury </em>case concerns sanctions ordered by the trial court against Timbers and his client for bad faith pleading. Id., 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We conclude that Timbers\u2019 actions in this appeal, when viewed against the backdrop of the untimely prior appeal, and five notices of lis pendens all involving the same alleged cause of action and the same real estate, warrant the imposition of sanctions. Because the defendant\u2019s counsel has continuously faced the burden of responding to Timbers\u2019 numerous filings and violations of the rules of practice, thus increasing the cost to the defendant of defending this appeal, we order Timbers to pay to the defendant\u2019s counsel, Green and Gross, attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $1000 and reimbursement of costs in the amount of $324.69, for a total of $1324.69, within thirty days of the issuance of this order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to protect this court, and the litigants who appear in this court; see <em>In the Matter of Presnick, </em>supra, 19 Conn. App. 350; we sua sponte order that Timbers be prohibited henceforth from filing any papers in this court and from making an appearance in this court for a period of six months. After that period, and upon proof provided to the office of the chief clerk that payment of the $1324.69 was made within thirty days, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Timbers may resume practice before this court if he is otherwise qualified to practice law in the courts of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> In the context of that first action, the plaintiffs appealed from the discharge of their notice of lis pendens filed on the property of another defendant in that case. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Srager </em>v. <em>Koenig, </em>41 Conn. App. 905, 673 A.2d 1185, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 929, 677 A.2d 947 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b641-9\"> The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration en banc of the order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. We denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion on June 19, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\"> We do not consider, but note, that after the June 5, 1996 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for sanctions, Timbers filed an improper motion, requesting that this court consider a substitute memorandum in opposition to the motion for sanctions that included thirteen appendices equaling approximately thirty-eight pages of additional arguments, even though he already had filed a memorandum in opposition before oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> The defendant\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit representing that the defendant had incurred $13,910 in legal fees and $324.69 in costs in defending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
