The plaintiffs\u2019 complaints were in two counts. The first counts made claims alleging conversion, while the second counts sought damages for violations of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a through 42-1 lOq. The trial court awarded each plaintiff $50, which amount was trebled, on the first count and $1018 on the second count. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>filed a counterclaim in two counts seeking its fees and costs under General Statutes \u00a7 14-150 and the reasonable value of fees, interest and costs allegedly owed to it by the plaintiffs. The trial court awarded the defendant $1168 to be paid by each plaintiff on the second count. On the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, they claim that (1) the trial court awarded insufficient compensatory and CUTPA damages because the awards are against the weight of the evidence and contrary to law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) the trial court did not allow them sufficient latitude as pro se litigants. On the defendant\u2019s cross appeal, it claims that the trial court improperly determined that it had violated CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The following facts are relevant on these appeals. The plaintiffs each incurred over $3000 in fines arising from unpaid parking tickets issued by the city of Hartford. The plaintiffs did not contest the tickets when they were issued. On April 5,1990, the defendant, acting at the direction of the Hartford police department, towed the plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles to its lot. At a hearing pursuant to a city ordinance before the Hartford tax department on April 6, 1990, a hearing officer reduced the amount of the fines the plaintiffs owed by eliminating the additional interest and penalties due. Each plaintiff still owed over $1000, the total of the face amounts of the tickets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Some time later, the plaintiffs contacted the defendant and informed it that they were still contesting the validity of the tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Pursuant to both a city ordinance<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the contract between the defendant and the city of Hartford, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>defendant was prohibited from releasing automobiles to their owners until all outstanding parking fines were satisfied. The contract specified that when the automobile owner came to retrieve his or her automobile with proper proof of payment of the fines, the defendant was to collect its towing, storage and administrative fees from the automobile owner. The contract also stated that any automobiles not claimed by their legal owners should be stored and disposed of pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-150.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The plaintiffs did not pay the parking fines and thus could not retrieve their automobiles from the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ant. On April 24,1990, allegedly acting pursuant to \u00a7 14-150 (g), the defendant sent notice to the department of motor vehicles of its intent to sell both automobiles. On May 4, 1990, the defendant, also allegedly acting pursuant to \u00a7 14-150 (g), sent notice to the plaintiffs that their automobiles would be sold. On July 16, 1990, the defendant sold the automobiles for their salvage value of $50 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The trial court determined that because the plaintiffs demanded the return of their automobiles while they contested the tickets in a variety of fora, the automobiles were not \u201cabandoned\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 14-150. Because the automobiles were not abandoned, the court reasoned, the defendant did not have the authority to dispose of them. Therefore, the trial court awarded to each plaintiff the $50 salvage value the defendant received for each automobile.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6This amount was trebled under General Statutes \u00a7 52-564.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court also awarded to each plaintiff CUTPA damages of $1018 because it concluded that the defendant\u2019s improper disposal of the automobiles could cause substantial injury to consumers. These awards were offset by the trial court\u2019s determination that each plaintiff owed the defendant $1168 in towing and storage fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The plaintiffs first claim that the amounts of the trial court\u2019s compensatoiy and CUTPA awards were against the weight of the evidence and contrary to law. Even though the trial court awarded compensatory and CUTPA damages, the plaintiffs incongruously assert that the trial court improperly \u201cfail[ed] to award compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees . . . .\u201d In addition, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly awarded damages to the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">First, the plaintiffs contend that they had proved greater compensatory damages than those awarded by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They argue that the trial court required them to prove their damages with too high a degree of specificity. To be precise, the plaintiffs assert that they should have also received damages to compensate them for the book value of the automobiles and wages they allege they lost as a result of being deprived of the use of their automobiles. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a claimant seeking damages bears the burden of proving, with reasonable certainty, those damages sustained as a result of his injury. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>189 Conn. 484, 488, 456 A.2d 1196 (1983); <em>Pacelli Bros. Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pacelli, </em>189 Conn. 401, 410, 456 A.2d 325 (1983); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flammia, </em>169 Conn. 491, 500, 363 A.2d 1048 (1975).\u201d <em>Conaway </em>v. <em>Prestia, </em>191 Conn. 484, 493-94, 464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>A.2d 847 (1983). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in determining damages. . . . The determination of damages involves a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 27-28, 664 A.2d 719 (1995). \u201cThe assessment of damages is peculiarly within the province of the trier and the award will be sustained so long as it does not shock the sense of justice. The test is whether the amount of damages awarded falls within the necessarily uncertain limits of fair and just damages.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Buckman </em>v. <em>People Express, Inc., </em>205 Conn. 166, 174-75, 530 A.2d 596 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A review of the transcript reveals no evidence to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for greater compensatory damages. First, Charest testified that not only did she initially have another vehicle to use in her weekend job as a produce vendor, but that in previous years she had never shown a profit in this endeavor. Second, Charest testified that Lawson was not able to work from 1990 to 1992 as a result of losing the use of his automobile. The plaintiffs, however, offered no other evidence to substantiate the claim for Lawson\u2019s lost wages. Finally, the plaintiffs did not offer any evidence regarding the book value of either automobile. In light of the paucity of evidence relating to actual damages, therefore, the trial court clearly did not abuse its discretion in awarding compensatory damages of $50 for each car.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">As noted previously, the trial court trebled its compensatory damage award to the plaintiffs pursuant to \u00a7 52-564. In discussing the award, however, the trial court stated that \u201c[s]ection 52-564 may ... be inapplicable because the defendant was acting under a claim of right . . . .\u201d We conclude that \u00a7 52-564 is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Statutory theft under \u00a7 52-564 \u201cis synonymous with larceny under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119.\u201d <em>Discover </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>Leasing, Inc </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>33 Conn. App. 303, 309, 635 A.2d 843 (1993), citing <em>Lauder </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>11 Conn. App. 161, 165, 526 A.2d 539 (1987). Pursuant to \u00a7 53a-119, \u201c[a] person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or witholds such property from an owner. \u201d By comparison, \u201c [conversion is an unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over goods belonging to another, to the exclusion of the owner\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Discover Leasing, Inc </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>supra, 309, citing <em>Devitt </em>v. <em>Manulik, </em>176 Conn. 657, 660, 410 A.2d 465 (1979). In addition, conversion requires that the owner be harmed as a result of the unauthorized act. <em>Devitt </em>v. <em>Manulik, </em>supra, 660. Conversion may arise subsequent to an initial rightful possession. <em>Maroun </em>v. <em>Tarro, </em>35 Conn. App. 391, 396, 646 A.2d 251, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 926, 648 A.2d 164 (1994). Conversion can be distinguished from statutory theft as established by \u00a7 53a-119 in two ways. First, statutory theft requires an intent to deprive another of his property; second, conversion requires the owner to be harmed by a defendant\u2019s conduct. Therefore, statutory theft requires a plaintiff to prove the additional element of intent over and above what he or she must demonstrate to prove conversion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the present case, the trial court did not find that the defendant intended to deprive the plaintiffs of their automobiles. In fact, the trial court stated that \u201cthe defendant was acting under an honestly held claim of right. \u201d Therefore, the plaintiffs\u2019 proof that the defendant converted their property cannot, on its own, support a finding of statutory theft under \u00a7 52-564. The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>therefore, improperly applied \u00a7 52-564 to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Although the defendant in its cross appeal has not specifically raised this issue of whether the trial court properly awarded treble damages, Connecticut courts have concluded that the misapplication of a statute constitutes plain error and therefore we \u201cmay in the interests of justice notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 4185. For instance, our Supreme Court held that a trial court\u2019s failure to apply a pertinent statute is plain error even though neither party raised the issue either at trial or before the Supreme Court. <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 377, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Preyer, </em>198 Conn. 190, 199, 502 A.2d 858 (1985), the court determined that a jury charge that \u201cdemonstrates that the trial court has overlooked the applicable statute justifies consideration as plain error.\u201d See <em>also Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 607, 609, 436 A.2d 1259 (1980) (\u201coversight of a clearly applicable statute can be considered plain error\u201d). Here, the trial court awarded treble damages pursuant to \u00a7 52-564 even though the plaintiff had not proven one of the essential elements of the statute. The trial court, therefore, improperly applied a statute that was not pertinent to facts it had found. This constitutes plain error and we vacate the trial court\u2019s award of treble damages but leave undisturbed its award of compensatory damages of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The plaintiffs next assert that the trial court should have awarded punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees even though they acknowledge that the trial court did award CUTPA damages and they assert no other bases on which to claim punitive damages or attorney\u2019s fees. They also state that the trial court, in determining their CUTPA damages, improperly concluded that they \u201cdid not merit a large damage award.\u201d The trial court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>not specifically identify whether the plaintiffs CUTPA award was for attorney\u2019s fees or punitive damages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, we will discuss both.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (d) provides that a trial court \u201cmay award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney . . . .\u201d \u201cThe trial court has discretion whether to award attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be interfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Steiger </em>v. <em>J. S. Builders, Inc., </em>39 Conn. App. 32, 36, 663 A.2d 432 (1995), quoting <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>203 Conn. 616, 622, 525 A.2d 1343 (1987). Assuming, arguendo, that the trial court did not award attorney\u2019s fees, we conclude that, because the plaintiffs were pro se at the time of trial and because they did not present any evidence regarding any other attorney\u2019s fees, the trial court did not commit either a manifest abuse of discretion or an injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) provides that \u201c[t]he court <em>may, in its discretion, </em>award punitive damages ... as it deems necessary or proper.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 622. \u201c[Pjunitive damages are available when there is evidence of a reckless indifference to the rights of others or an intentional and wanton violation of those rights. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Staehle </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 455, 462-63, 646 A.2d 888 (1994), quoting <em>Gargano </em>v. <em>Heyman, </em>supra, 622; <em>Tessmann </em>v. <em>Tiger Lee Construction Co., </em>228 Conn. 42, 54, 634 A.2d 870 (1993). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>noted, the trial court did not specify whether the CUTPA damages were for attorney\u2019s fees or punitive damages. The trial court did state, however, that the defendant\u2019s practice of disposing of unclaimed scofflaw vehicles could cause substantial injury to consumers. Therefore, for the purposes of our discussion here, we will treat the $1018 in CUTPA damages as punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Section 42-1 lOg (a) does not provide a method for determining punitive damages. Courts have awarded punitive damages in amounts equal to actual damages or multiples of the actual damages. <em>Staehle </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Garage, Inc., </em>supra, 35 Conn. App. 463. Our Supreme Court has upheld a punitive damage award where there was extensive evidence as to issues relevant to punitive damages, including a reckless indifference to the rights of others. <em>Tessmann </em>v. <em>Tiger Lee Construction Co., </em>supra, 228 Conn. 55. Here, the trial court awarded punitive damages that are over twenty times the amount of actual damages and it determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct was not egregious.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Next, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly determined that they owed the defendant for towing and storage fees pursuant to the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. They assert that under the contract between the defendant and the city of Hartford, the defendant could have recovered the storage charges from the city. The plaintiffs point to language in the contract defining \u201ccity storage\u201d pursuant to which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>city will pay the defendant one dollar a day in storage fees. This same definition, however, states that city storage occurs where \u201cthe City has <em>elected to </em>encumber such charges.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs did not present any evidence that would indicate that the city had or would have elected to be responsible for such charges. The contract also states that where an automobile has been towed for failure to pay parking fines, \u201c[t]he City shall not be liable for any storage fees.\u201d Further, \u201cstorage fee\u201d is defined as \u201cthat sum chargeable to the owner of a motor vehicle, towed under the direction of the Hartford Police Department . . . [and] chargeable to the owner of the vehicle.\u201d The plaintiffs concede that the defendant towed the automobiles at the direction of the Hartford police department. Therefore, the storage and towing charges are chargeable to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs do not dispute that the trial court properly calculated the amount of damages they owe the defendant. Thus, the award of damages to the defendant was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 next claim that the trial court did not afford them sufficient latitude as pro se litigants. They argue that the trial court could have concluded that there was sufficient evidence of their lost employment opportunities to have awarded greater compensatory damages and that the trial court did not allow them to present all of their evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\u201cAlthough we will not entirely disregard our rules of procedure, we do give great latitude to pro se litigants in order that justice may be done.\u201d <em>Lundborg </em>v. <em>Lundborg, </em>15 Conn. App. 156, 160, 543 A.2d 783, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 818, 515 A.2d 756 (1988). \u201c \u2018[T]he right of self-representation [however] provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Krijger, </em>33 Conn. App. 49, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>55, 633 A.2d 310 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 917, 636 A.2d 849 (1994), quoting <em>Galland, </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>204 Conn. 330, 334-35, 527 A.2d 1192 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">As discussed previously, the plaintiffs presented no evidence to substantiate their claims for lost wages. While the trial court should allow pro se litigants latitude, such latitude does not extend to inferring damages in an evidentiary vacuum. In addition, a careful review of the transcript reveals numerous examples of the trial court\u2019s assisting the plaintiffs in the organization and presentation of their cases as well as allowing them time to find and review documents. Therefore, the trial court did grant the plaintiffs sufficient latitude in the presentation and evaluation of their evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We also conclude that the trial court afforded the plaintiffs sufficient time to present all of their evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if we were to construe the plaintiffs dia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>logue with the court to be a request for a continuance that the court denied, \u201csuch denial is within the discretion of the trial judge and will be set aside only if a clear abuse of discretion is shown. . . . We are especially hesitant to find an abuse of discretion where the court has denied a motion for continuance made on the day of the trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Krijger, </em>supra, 33 Conn. App. 55. We cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to extend the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Finally, we note that the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, stated that \u201c[although the [CUTPA] claim was not specifically pressed at trial by these pro se plaintiffs, the court regards this claim as still being in the case.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did grant the plaintiffs sufficient latitude as pro se litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The defendant cross appeals claiming that the trial court improperly determined that it had violated CUTPA by disposing of the plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles. The defendant asserts that the city had the right, pursuant either to its police powers or the Home Rule Act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to direct the defendant, by means of their contract, to dispose of the cars pursuant to \u00a7 14-150.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, the defendant reasons, it relied in good faith on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>authority and direction of the city to dispose of the automobiles. Alternatively, the defendant argues that under \u00a7 42-110c,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> its actions constitute an exception to CUTPA rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">As an initial matter, we agree with the defendant, as the plaintiffs concede, that the city properly enacted its parking violation ordinances under the Home Rule Act. See <em>New Haven Commission on Equal Opportunities </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>183 Conn. 495, 499, 439 A.2d 404 (1981) (\u201ca municipality [has] such powers as are necessary to enable it to discharge its duties and carry into effect the objects and purposes of its creation\u201d). The proper promulgation of those ordinances does not, however, immunize those parties with whom the city has contracted to effectuate those ordinances against all civil liability. While the city obviously had the power to enact such ordinances, the city and its agents must nevertheless still adhere to all other laws, including the limitations of \u00a7 14-150, in executing those ordinances. Under the circumstances here, therefore, the defendant\u2019s claim that the city could direct it, pursuant to the Home Rule Act, to dispose of the plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles is unavailing. The contract between the city and the defendant is the sole method by which the city could transfer its authority to the defendant. The contract, therefore, necessarily defines the scope of that authority conferred by the city on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The contract between the defendant and the city sets forth the reasons the city may have for directing the defendant to tow and store a vehicle. These include clearing vehicles during emergencies such as snow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>storms and removing vehicles involved in accidents, vehicles to be held for evidence, scofflaw vehicles and vehicles in other situations that the police may designate. The defendant asserts that it properly relied on the portion of its contract with the city that specifies that \u201c[f]or vehicles not claimed by their legal owners, the contractor shall store and dispose of said vehicles as provided by section 14-150 of the Connecticut Statutes.\u201d The trial court concluded, however, that, since the plaintiffs\u2019 cars were not abandoned<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as defined in \u00a7 14-150 (a), the statute did not apply in this case. The defendant responds by asserting that the language of the contract that states that the defendant \u201cshall store and dispose of said vehicles\u201d directs the court only to 14-150 (g) and that the rest of the statute does not apply. Further, they argue, if \u00a7 14-150 applies in its entirety, then the automobiles may be deemed to have been abandoned. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Levine </em>v. <em>Massey, </em>232 Conn. 272, 277-78, 654 A.2d 737 (1995). \u201c \u2018In such a situation our scope of review is plenary\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>De Leonardis </em>v. <em>Subway Sandwich Shops, Inc., </em>35 Conn. App. 353, 357, 646 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 925, 648 A.2d 162 (1994). When only one inteipretation of a contract is possible, \u201cthe court need not look outside the four comers of the contract . . . .\u201d <em>Hedberg </em>v. <em>Pantepec International, Inc., </em>35 Conn. 19, 28, 645 A.2d 543, cert. granted on other grounds, 231 Conn. 927, 648 A.2d 879 (1994) (appeal withdrawn February 21, 1995). We conclude that the language of the contract between the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>and the city is not ambiguous. Therefore, its proper interpretation is a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The contract states that the defendant shall store and dispose of unclaimed vehicles as provided by \u00a7 14-150. The contract does not specify that the defendant is to dispose of vehicles only as provided by subsection (g) of the statute. Therefore, given the clear and unambiguous language of the contract, \u00a7 14-150 applies in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . It is a well established rule of statutory construction that when the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. . . . Courts should not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 830-31, 614 A.2d 414 (1992). Section 14-150 (a) applies to motor vehicles abandoned by a person \u201cwithin the limits of any highway or upon property other than his own\u201d; a motor vehicle that is \u201ca menace to traffic\u201d; \u00a7 14-150 (b); \u201ca motor vehicle without proper registration\u201d; \u00a7 14-150 (c); or certain motor vehicles with \u201cno registration marker plates or invalid marker plates.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-150 (d). As the trial court found, there is no provision in the statute that applies exclusively to scofflaw vehicles. The defendant, therefore, pursuant to its contract with the city, could properly dispose of only those types of vehicles specifically enumerated by \u00a7 14-150 and not those vehicles towed because of outstanding parking violations. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles were towed due to outstanding parking violations, we conclude that the defendant acted outside the scope of its contract with the city as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>defined by \u00a7 14-150. In short, because \u00a7 14-150 does not contemplate the disposal of scofflaw vehicles, the contract between the city and the defendant by necessity could not have provided for the disposal of such vehicles.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We also note that the city ordinances do not specify in any way that automobiles towed for excessive parking violations may be disposed of pursuant to \u00a7 14-150. While we decline to state that such a reference in the ordinances would have made the defendant\u2019s conduct proper, at least it would have put the owners of vehicles towed pursuant to those ordinances on notice that their vehicles may be sold in order to compensate a towing contractor\u2019s towing and storage fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The defendant next argues that its actions at the direction of the city are exempt from CUTPA. The defendant reasons that, because municipalities are generally immune from CUTPA liability under \u00a7 42-110c,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> it is immune as well. We decline to address this claim because, as we have determined, the defendant\u2019s actions were outside the scope of its contract with the city. The disposal of the plaintiffs\u2019 automobiles, therefore, could not have been at the direction of the city. Thus, the defendant is not exempt from CUTPA liability under \u00a7 42-110c.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The judgments are reversed only as to the award of treble damages on the plaintiffs\u2019 first counts and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cases are remanded with direction to render judgments as on file except as modified to award only compensatory damages of $50 on the first count in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-7\"> The plaintiffs present six different overlapping claims regarding damages. Because the six all address the amount or type of damages or both, in the interest of economy, we will treat them as one claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"><em> </em>On April 23,1991, the city issued parking ticket releases to each plaintiff because the fines were deemed to be uncollectable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b623-9\"> Section 22-44 (b) of the Hartford city ordinances provides: \u201cThe chief of police shall not authorize or direct the release of any vehicle placed within a vehicle pound pursuant to [the scofflaw ordinance] until such time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>as the owner or person in charge of such vehicle shall have: (1) Supplied the chief of police with evidence of his identity and ownership; (2) Satisfied all outstanding municipal parking citations against the subject vehicle to the satisfaction of the chief of police; (3) Paid the cost of removal, impoundment, and administration; and (4) Signed areceiptfor such vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-150 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAbandoned or unregistered motor vehicles and motor vehicles which are a menace to traffic.
