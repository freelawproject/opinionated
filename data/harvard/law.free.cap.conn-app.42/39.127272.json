The trial court held that the plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had not sustained their burden of proving the applicability of the statutory exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Stamford\u2019s central claim on appeal to this court is that the report is exempt from disclosure as a record pertaining to strategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4) and as a record affecting the rights of litigants under the state discovery laws pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-19b (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We have fully reviewed the records and briefs and considered the oral arguments of the parties. Having applied the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that Stamford did not present sufficient evidence to support either exemption. We also conclude that the record does not support Stamford\u2019s claims that the freedom of information commission improperly conducted the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-10\"> The appeal was brought in the name of both the city of Stamford and the board of finance of the city of Stamford. For convenience, we refer to both appellants as Stamford.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
