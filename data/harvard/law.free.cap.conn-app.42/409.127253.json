Neiditz and Janice L. Neiditz, appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment denying their motion for supplemental judgment seeking appellate attorney\u2019s fees. The trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for supplemental judgment because the motion was filed more than four months after the original trial court judgment was rendered, and thus was untimely under General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 326.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs assert that because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the motion for supplemental judgment sought appellate attorney\u2019s fees, it was not a motion to open or set aside the judgment, and thus the motion was not time barred by \u00a7 52-212a and \u00a7 326. Consequently, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court did have jurisdiction to consider the motion. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The facts of the underlying action for breach of a written lease are fully set out in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision. <em>See Neiditz </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>43 Conn. Sup. 283, 654 A.2d 812 (1994). The trial court found that the defendant had unjustifiably terminated the lease and awarded the plaintiffs $187,664 in damages and $28,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant appealed, and on January 10, 1995, the Supreme Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Neiditz </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>231 Conn. 598, 651 A.2d 1295 (1995). On January 23,1995, the plaintiffs filed a motion for supplemental judgment, seeking an award of attorney\u2019s fees for successfully defending the appeal. The trial court dismissed the motion for supplemental judgment. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The plaintiffs claim that their motion for supplemental judgment was timely because their request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees was not a motion to open or set aside the judgment, and thus was not governed by the four month filing rule. Moreover, the plaintiffs posit that they would not have been entitled to seek attorney\u2019s fees for the successful defense of the appeal until they had prevailed in the Supreme Court. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">It is well established by both the United States Supreme Court and Connecticut precedents that a request for attorney\u2019s fees is not a motion to open, set aside, alter, or modify a judgment, but rather \u201craises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>legal issues collateral to the main cause of action . . . .\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Employment </em>Security, 455 U.S. 445, 451, 102 S. Ct. 1162, 71 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1982). The United States Supreme Court held in <em>White </em>that, \u201c[r]egardless of when attorney\u2019s fees are requested, the court\u2019s decision of entitlement to fees . . . require [s] an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits\u2014an inquiry that cannot even commence until one party has \u2018prevailed.\u2019 \u201d Id., 451-52. In <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>38 Conn. App. 506, 662 A.2d 137 (1995), aff'd, 237 Conn. 28, 675 A.2d 851 (1996), we followed <em>White </em>and characterized a request for attorney\u2019s fees as an inquiry separate from the decision on the merits, which \u201cdoes not open, modify, or in any way affect the judgment.\u201d Id., 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees did not constitute a motion to open or set aside the judgment, and thus was not subject to the four month filing rale of \u00a7 52-212a and \u00a7 326. <em>White </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 451-52; <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 506. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 motion was not governed by \u00a7 52-212a or \u00a7 326, and because the defendant did not claim that the motion was otherwise time barred, the trial court incorrectly concluded that it was without jurisdiction to determine the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for appellate attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The trial court based its dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for supplemental judgment on two cases, <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Varley, </em>181 Conn. 58, 434 A.2d 312 (1980), and <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 560 A.2d 968 (1989). The trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Varley </em>and <em>O\u2019Leary </em>was misplaced. <em>Varley </em>involved a request for a new trial, rather than a motion for supplemental judgment. <em>Varley </em>v. <em>Varley, </em>supra, 58. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>a claim for punitive damages that, as a matter of law, cannot include a right to recover for defending an appeal. <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Industrial Park Corp., </em>supra, 651-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Here, the trial court did have authority to award appellate attorney\u2019s fees. In Connecticut, a prevailing party may recover attorney\u2019s fees if such an award is authorized by either statute or contract. <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 297, 472 A.2d 306 (1984). The underlying lease agreement provides that \u201c[i]n the event of any action or proceeding brought by either party against the other under this Lease the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including the fees of its attorneys in such action or proceeding in such amounts as the court may adjudge reasonable.\u201d The language \u201cthe prevailing party in any action or proceeding\u201d includes a prevailing party on appeal. <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>32 Conn. App. 704, 723A-23B, 630 A.2d 1361 (1993), aff'd, 230 Conn. 735, 646 A.2d 152 (1994); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>30 Conn. App. 620, 626, 621 A.2d 764 (1993). The decision to award appellate attorney\u2019s fees, however, \u201cis discretionary and a matter appropriately determined by the trial court.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a determination of whether an award of appellate attorney\u2019s fees is appropriate and, if so, the amount of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides in relevant part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the superior court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 326 provides in relevantpart: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, any civil judgment or decree rendered in the superior court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed.
