The plaintiffs claim that the trial court (1) improperly determined that the plaintiffs are public agencies within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) improperly determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 records should be subject to public disclosure, and (3) applied an incorrect standard of review. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Cindy Ouellette and the Taxpayers Association of Norwich requested that the plaintiffs provide them with copies of the their charters, bylaws, policies, procedures, and the names and addresses of their active members. After the plaintiffs denied or ignored these requests, Ouellette and the Taxpayers Association complained to the FOIC. The FOIC heard the matter as a contested case and concluded that the plaintiffs were the functional equivalents of public agencies within the meaning of \u00a7 l-18a (a) and therefore subject to the disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, General Statutes \u00a7 1-7 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The plaintiffs appealed to the trial court pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. Following a hearing on the record, the trial court dismissed the appeal, whereupon the plaintiffs appealed to this court in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-184.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first two claims are subsumed under the central question of whether, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court correctly concluded that the FOIC\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs are the functional equivalents of public agencies is reasonably based on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>We recognize that volunteer fire companies in this state are individually organized and that the FOIC and the trial court decided this case on the facts pertaining particularly to these plaintiffs. The FOIC made specific findings relative to the financial relationship between the plaintiffs and the city of Norwich.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>We are persuaded by our examination of the record and briefs of the parties that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. In a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the trial court analyzed the law in a manner consistent with our statutes and case precedents. <em>Yantic Volunteer Fire Co. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>44 Conn. Sup. 230, 682 A.2d 156 (1996). Because that memorandum addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the applicable law on these issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. <em>See Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Bardinelli, </em>39 Conn. App. 786, 788, 667 A.2d 806 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>33 Conn. App. 103, 105, 633 A.2d 726 (1993) , cert. denied, 228 Conn. 917, 636 A.2d 849 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining issue was not properly briefed. \u201c \u2018Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fromer </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>36 Conn.
