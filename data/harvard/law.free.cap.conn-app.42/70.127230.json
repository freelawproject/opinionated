The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly (1) allowed the administrator d.b.n.c.t.a. to withdraw from the case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>(2) concluded that the plaintiffs could not maintain a trespass action against the defendant, (3) failed to hold the defendant liable for trespass after August 7, 1989, and (4) failed to determine who owned the property at issue between August 7 and September 25, 1989. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The following facts are necessary to resolve this appeal. On February 1, 1989, the Probate Court for the district of Newington appointed the defendant to be the conservator of the estate of Helen Benny who at that time was residing in a nursing home in Massachusetts. Benny\u2019s daughter Rosalie and her husband, Paul Zanoni, are the plaintiffs in this action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Benny\u2019s conservator-ship estate consisted of real property in Wethersfield and Old Lyme. The Old Lyme property, a summer residence, which has been used by various members of the Benny family over the years, is the subject of this action. The plaintiffs had visited the Old Lyme property on weekends and performed numerous maintenance tasks on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">As conservator, the defendant determined that it was necessary to sell the Old Lyme property to generate income for Benny\u2019s care and outstanding debts. As part of his duties, the defendant changed the locks on the property to secure it for sale. The plaintiffs were thus excluded from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Benny died on August 7, 1989. In her will, Benny devised the Old Lyme property to Rosalie and also nominated her to be the executrix. In early September, 1989, the defendant delivered the keys to the Probate Court. Rosalie was formally approved as executrix on September 25, 1989, at which time the Probate Court gave her the keys to the Old Lyme property.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The plaintiffs brought this action for trespass quare clausum fregit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against the defendant individually for alleged dispossession of their property rights in the Old Lyme property. Additional facts are included in the discussion of individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The plaintiffs brought this action in their own names and also in the name of Richard Pikor, who had been appointed administrator, d.b.n.c.t.a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 152, Pikor moved that he be stricken as a coplaintiff because he had been so named without his consent and had no desire to initiate this action or to be a party, either individually or in his fiduciary capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The plaintiffs cite no authority, and we are unaware of any, that permits a person to be compelled to be a plaintiff in a lawsuit. The plaintiffs have alleged that the defendant\u2019s trespass infringed on their property rights, but this alleged trespass occurred long before Pikor was appointed as administrator d.b.n.c.t.a. Accordingly, Pikor has been improperly joined as a party plaintiff. Naming an improper person as a party in a legal action constitutes misjoinder. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Local 308, </em>171 Conn. 420, 429, 370 A.2d 996 (1976). The exclusive remedy for misjoinder of parties is by motion to strike. Practice Book \u00a7 198. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>therefore properly granted Pikor\u2019s motion to strike him as a plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The plaintiffs next complain that the trial court improperly concluded that they had no basis to bring this trespass action. To maintain an action for trespass, a plaintiff must show either title to the property or actual exclusive possession. <em>Bernardo </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>109 Conn. 158, 161, 145 A. 884 (1929). It is undisputed that Benny was the sole titleholder to the property until her death. In a thorough and detailed memorandum of decision, the trial court expressly found that although the plaintiffs made weekend visits to the property and performed numerous maintenance tasks, these actions did not rise to the level of exclusive possession. \u201cThe factual findings of a trial court on any issue are reversible only if they are clearly erroneous. . . . This court cannot retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rosick </em>v. <em>Equipment Maintenance &amp; Service, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 25, 40, 632 A.2d 1134 (1993). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs could not demonstrate either title to or exclusive possession of the Old Lyme property is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The plaintiffs allege that Rosalie\u2019s \u201cvested future interest in the premises .... [b]y virtue of the will\u201d and the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ccontingent interest in the premises acquired through providing maintenance and improvements to the property\u201d allow them to maintain this trespass action. These pro se plaintiffs have handled this case in its entirety without benefit of counsel. In so doing, they have misused established legal terminology to describe their perceived interests in the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Rather than engage in discussion of the law of future and contingent interests, we simply note that an expectancy of an inheritance is not a future interest and one does not acquire a contingent interest in real property by providing maintenance and improvements on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The plaintiffs also contend that Rosalie acquired a present interest in the Old Lyme property because Benny\u2019s will nominated her to be the executrix. \u201cEssentially, a will is a declaration of the testator\u2019s intention as to what shall take place after his death in reference to property left by him. One distinguishing feature of such an instrument is that it has no binding effect during the life of the testator, and is intended to operate only upon and by reason of his death. A will <em>does not confer any present right at the time of its execution. . . . Nothing vests by reason of such a,n instrument during the life of the testator. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 79 Am. Jur. 2d, Wills \u00a7 7 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Rosalie did not acquire a present interest in the Old Lyme property through an expectancy of inheritance or through a nomination to be the executrix. Accordingly, Rosalie had neither title nor possession upon which to base an action for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The plaintiff Paul Zanoni lacks even an illusory claim to bring a trespass action. He is not a relative, beneficiary, devisee or creditor of the Benny estate. See <em>Zanoni </em>v. <em>Pikor, </em>36 Conn. App. 143, 144, 648 A.2d 892 (1994). He is, in legal parlance, a stranger to the proceeding. As such, he has no standing to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Additionally, the defendant was a duly appointed conservator pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-650.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A conservator\u2019s duties require him to inventory and to manage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the real estate of his ward. General Statutes \u00a7 45a-655.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to carry out his duties, it was necessary that he enter the Old Lyme property. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>29 Conn. 564, 569 (1861). If a person has a right to enter upon the property, there can be no trespass. See <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>32 Conn. 335, 342 (1865).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Because the plaintiffs were not the titleholders nor were they in exclusive possession of the property and because the defendant, as a conservator, had a right to enter upon the property, the trial court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs had no basis to bring the action for any acts prior to the death of Benny.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The plaintiffs next argue that the trial court improperly failed to hold the defendant hable for trespass during the period after Benny\u2019s death on August 7,1989, and before approval of her will on September 25, 1989. Because Rosalie had been named as executrix in Benny\u2019s will, she argues that the defendant\u2019s failure to give her the keys immediately upon her mother\u2019s death constituted a trespass. See part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Although title to real estate passes upon death, real property remains under the control of the Probate Court until all charges and debts of the decedent and the estate have been paid. <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Rago, </em>186 Conn. 360, 365, 441 A.2d 615 (1982); <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Chiascione, </em>130 Conn. 304, 306, 33 A.2d 336 (1943). Rosalie, as a devisee, had no right of possession until the estate was settled. As executrix, Rosalie had no right of possession until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the will was admitted to probate and she was approved by the court. <em>Murdoch </em>v. <em>Murdoch, </em>81 Conn. 681, 686, 72 A. 290 (1909)</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">A conservatorship automatically terminates with the death of the ward. <em>Kleinman </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>192 Conn. 479, 483, 472 A.2d 772 (1984). In this case, the defendant\u2019s conservatorship ended before Rosalie was approved as executrix. Because Rosalie did not have a right to possess the Old Lyme property at the time of Benny\u2019s death, the defendant took the only reasonable course open to him and turned over the keys to the Probate Court. We conclude that his refusal to release the keys to Rosalie directly was proper, and that no action in trespass can be maintained against him for the period between Benny\u2019s death and the approval of her will by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The plaintiffs finally complain that the trial court failed to determine the ownership of the property between August 7 and September 25, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">These pro se plaintiffs have had extensive exposure to trial and appellate procedure through other cases in which they have participated. See <em>Hudon </em>v. <em>Zanoni, </em>220 Conn. 930, 599 A.2d 382 (1991); <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Hudon, </em>42 Conn. App. 59, 677 A.2d 1385 (1996); <em>Zanoni </em>v. <em>Pikor, </em>36 Conn. App. 143, 648 A.2d 892 (1994); <em>Zanoni </em>v. <em>Saint Patrick\u2019s Manor, </em>27 Conn. App. 919, 608 A.2d 106 (1992); <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Hudon, </em>27 Conn. App. 729, 609 A.2d 1021 (1992).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough we allow pro se litigants some latitude, the right of self-representation provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lemoine </em>v. <em>McCann, </em>40 Conn. App. 460, 465, 673 A.2d 115 (1996). The plaintiffs failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>comply with the rules of practice by failing to seek an articulation from the trial court on its failure to determine the ownership of the property between August 7 and September 25, 1989, and we will not consider the claim. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4051, 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-9\"> Other parties originally named as defendants have been dropped and are not involved in this appeal.
