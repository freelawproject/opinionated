We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In June, 1991, the defendant, a music instructor at Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU), made plans with W, a student at SCSU, and Sharon Huie, a resident advisor at an SCSU dormitory, to go out for dinner. The defendant stated that he would arrive at Huie\u2019s dormitory to pick up Huie and W between 8:30 and 8:45 p.m. He also offered to drive W to her home in Bridgeport after dinner. The defendant arrived at the dormitory at approximately 10:30 p.m. Because Huie had to go to work at 11 p.m., she could not join the others as planned. W and the defendant left and went to a local restaurant for dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">At approximately midnight, before driving her to Bridgeport, the defendant informed W that he wanted to stop at his house to pick up a tape to take to a friend who also lived in Bridgeport. Because W knew that the defendant was married and had a child, she willingly accompanied the defendant into his house to wait for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>him. Once inside, the defendant did not turn on any lights, and W remained in the living room while the defendant went into a back room. After a short while, the defendant returned to the living room and W noticed that he was now wearing cologne that he did not have on earlier that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The defendant sat on the sofa next to W and began touching her hair. Although W suspected that the defendant was making advances toward her, she rejected the notion because she believed that the defendant\u2019s wife and child were asleep in the house. W then stood up, asked the defendant to take her home and began walking toward the door. The defendant grabbed her from behind by her shirt and pulled her back onto the sofa. W resisted the defendant and a struggle ensued. The defendant overpowered W and sexually assaulted her. W, who is asthmatic, had difficulty breathing and pleaded with the defendant to stop. When the defendant eventually stopped, the victim was bleeding. She went into the defendant\u2019s bathroom where she washed blood from her legs and underwear. The defendant then drove the victim to Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">W did not report the incident immediately. After a subsequent confrontation with the defendant the following November, however, W told friends what had happened in June and they convinced her to contact the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The jury convicted the defendant on December 2, 1993, and no direct appeal was taken. On April 27,1994, the defendant, pro se, filed a petition for a writ of habeas, corpus alleging that his lawyers\u2019 errors resulted in the loss of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">On October 12, 1994, the habeas court accepted a stipulation in which the state and the defendant agreed that the defendant\u2019s right to appeal should be restored and rendered judgment in accordance with the stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>tion, and this direct appeal was filed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Phidd, </em>42 Conn. App. 17, 597 A.2d 846, cert. denied, 238 Conn. 907, 679 A.2d 2 (1996) (defendant sought certification to challenge decision on merits of appeal), we held that where a habeas petitioner raises a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel arising out of a failure of counsel to file an appeal and the facts, either by evidence or stipulation, support a finding that the petitioner\u2019s appellate rights were unconstitutionally compromised by counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance, the habeas court may order the restoration of petitioner\u2019s appellate rights as relief in the habeas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Because we adhere to the strong judicial policy embodied in the doctrine of stare decisis, we do not address the issue decided in <em>Phidd. </em>Rather, we follow our previous holding. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4135, however, we find that the following issues decided in <em>Phidd </em>involve substantial questions of law that should be reviewed by the Supreme Court: (1) whether a habeas court has authority to restore appellate rights, and (2) whether, if such authority exists, a habeas court may restore appellate rights based on its acceptance of a conclusory stipulation by the parties. We, therefore, request certification of these questions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing W to testify about two past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>incidents in which she was sexually assaulted by other men. The defendant asserts that the evidence was not relevant to the issue of whether the defendant sexually assaulted W, nor was it probative as to why she delayed in reporting this incident to the police. He also argues that the evidence was precluded by Connecticut\u2019s rape shield statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">During W\u2019s direct testimony, the state inquired as to why she did not tell anyone about the alleged sexual assault earlier than she did. In response, W testified that she felt that no one would believe her because she had willingly entered the defendant\u2019s house late at night and, because the defendant had told her that he was a state trooper, she believed that other police officers would support him. She also testified that she had twice been the victim of a sexual assault in the past and that, when she reported those incidents, nothing was done.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u201cIt is well established that [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a clear showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>sion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. . . . [T]he fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 549, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">W\u2019s testimony that she was twice sexually assaulted in the past and that on both occasions nothing was done after she reported those incidents could reasonably support an inference that she was reluctant to report the incident involving the defendant. Although W had already testified that she feared that no one would believe her because she had voluntarily entered the defendant\u2019s house late at night and because she believed that the defendant was a state trooper, the proffered testimony clearly had a tendency to aid the jury in its determination as to why she delayed before reporting the incident to the police. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s request to allow it to exercise a peremptory challenge to dismiss a venireperson after she was accepted by both parties. He argues that, although the jury was not yet sworn, the venireperson could be dismissed only for cause, which did not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">It is well settled that \u201c[o]nce ajuror has been accepted by both parties, the absolute right to exercise a peremptory challenge is lost. <em>Walczak </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>148 Conn. 592, 596-97, 172 A.2d 915 (1961); <em>DeCarlo </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>134 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Conn. 530, 535, 58 A.2d 846 (1948); <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>18 Conn. 166, 176 (1846). The trial court may, however, \u2018in its discretion permit such a challenge to be made at any time before the jury is sworn. \u2019 <em>Walczak </em>v. <em>Daniel, </em>supra, 597, quoting <em>DeCario </em>v. <em>Frame, </em>supra. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra, 176, in which our Supreme Court stated that \u2018[o]ur practice gives one advantage to the prisoner, that if anything new has occurred since the juror was directed to take his seat as juror, the party will not be absolutely precluded from taking the benefit of it, as he is in England after he is sworn, unless by consent.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>38 Conn. App. 247, 252-53, 661 A.2d 612 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">After the jury was selected but not yet sworn, one venireperson contacted the trial court\u2019s clerk to inform the court that she was employed by a law firm that had, in the past, represented another SCSU professor who had also been accused of sexual misconduct. Following this disclosure, the court allowed the parties to voir dire the prospective juror further. During the supplemental voir dire, the venireperson testified that her exposure to the previous matter left her dissatisfied with SCSU security police. She testified that she felt that the police \u201cwere too quick to make a judgment against the [other] professor without doing a further investigation\u201d and that the professor had been wrongly accused. Although the venireperson also indicated to the court that she would view this case with an open mind, upon completion of the voir dire, the court allowed the state to exercise a peremptory challenge to dismiss her.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Under these circumstances, there is no question that ample grounds existed to allow the trial court to conclude that, if this information had come to light during jury selection, the state would have exercised a peremptory challenge to dismiss this prospective juror. For this reason, and because the jury had not yet been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>sworn, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the state to exercise a peremptory challenge. See <em>Walcazk </em>v. Daniel, supra, 148 Conn. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The defendant finally claims that comments made by the prosecutor during the cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s wife and the closing argument constituted a pattern of \u201cblatant misconduct\u201d that was so severe and egregious that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because some of the defendant\u2019s claims of misconduct were not preserved at trial, we will consider them apart from his claims that were preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The Preserved Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The defendant complains that certain questions asked of Brenda Daniels, the sole defense witness, during cross-examination were improper because the state asked her to characterize the veracity of another witness\u2019 testimony. During the cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Brenda Daniels whether she heard Huie testify that, because the defendant was late in arriving at the dormitory on the night of the incident, Huie had called the defendant\u2019s home and received no answer. In reply, Brenda Daniels said that she had an answering machine that \u201cI constantly leave on,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>implying that if there had been a call that she would have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Upon objection by the defendant that this was an improper characterization of the evidence, the court overruled the objection because the question had been answered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In two succeeding questions, however, the prosecutor again asked whether the witness felt Huie was trying \u201cto fudge the facts\u201d and whether the witness felt that any other prosecution witnesses were \u201cfudging the facts.\u201d Although objections to both follow-up questions were sustained, the defendant contends on appeal that the questions themselves constituted prosecutorial misconduct because they improperly misled the jury into believing that if the testimony is conflicting, someone must be lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>we focus on several factors: (1) the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) the frequency of the conduct; (4) the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues of the case; (5) the strength of the curative instructions adopted; and (6) the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Williams, 41 Conn. App. 180, 190, 674 A.2d 1372 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u201cProsecutorial misconduct may occur in the course of cross-examination of witnesses . . . and may be so clearly inflammatory as to be incapable of correction by action of the court. ... In such instances there is a reasonable possibility that the improprieties in the cross-examination either contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty or, negatively, foreclosed the jury from ever considering the possibility of acquittal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 538-39, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The state began the challenged questioning by noting that Brenda Daniels\u2019 testimony differed from Huie\u2019s because Huie did not mention an answering machine. To this, Brenda Daniels replied that Huie \u201ccan\u2019t prove it.\u201d It was the witness herself who first invited further inquiry by characterizing Huie\u2019s testimony as false. The state merely followed-up by again asking whether the witness believed that Huie\u2019s testimony was false, and then discontinued this line of questioning when two subsequent questions drew objections from the defendant that were sustained by the trial court. Thus, the questions as to whether Brenda Daniels believed that the state\u2019s witnesses were \u201cfudging the facts\u201d were few and infrequent. Moreover, because the state\u2019s questions were designed solely to elicit a reiteration of Brenda Daniels\u2019 opinion as to the veracity of the testimony of other witnesses, they did not concern an issue that was central to the case. For these reasons, and when viewed in the context of the entire trial, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>state\u2019s questions on cross-examination were neither inflammatory nor likely to have contributed to the guilty verdict. The state\u2019s questions during the cross-examination of Brenda Daniels, therefore, did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Next, the defendant complains that certain comments made by the prosecutor during the state\u2019s rebuttal closing argument improperly shifted the burden to the defendant to prove his innocence. Specifically, the defendant takes issue with the following remarks: \u201cThe defense just doesn\u2019t even propose anything, they just say that it is a doubt. It is not enough to argue doubt.\u201d We note, however, that when the challenged remarks are read in context with the rest of the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor was responding to and attempting to discredit the defendant\u2019s closing statement in which the defendant argued that a reasonable doubt existed by virtue of W\u2019s delay in reporting the incident. In effect, the state was suggesting to the jury that, although the defendant has the right to argue reasonable doubt, the defendant\u2019s assertion that a reasonable doubt existed under the facts of this case was absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u201c[I]n addressing the jury, [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Richardson, 214 Conn. 752, 760, 574 A.2d 182 (1990). We conclude that, because the challenged remark was well within the scope of zealous and legitimate argument, it did not constitute prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Unpreserved Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The defendant complains that, during the state\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor improperly-commented on the defendant\u2019s right not to testify,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> invoked sympathy for the victim,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and misstated the evidence and expressed his personal opinions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He claims that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cconstituted a pattern of repeated and blatant misconduct\u201d that deprived him of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Conceding that he failed to preserve these claims of misconduct properly, the defendant seeks review on appeal pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 527 A.2d 823 (1989). Because the record is adequate for review and the defendant has alleged a claim of constitutional magnitude; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 539 n.5; the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied. Hence, \u201c[w]e will examine the defendant\u2019s claim to determine whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 435, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>36 Conn. App. 516, 524, 651 A.2d 1313, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 912, 654 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 828, 116 S. Ct. 98, 133 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct can occur in the course of closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>[supra, 204 Conn. 539], In order to deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . .Id., 539-40.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 768-69, 670 A.2d 276 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that, when the allegedly improper remarks made by the prosecutor on rebuttal are considered in light of the entire trial, further review of the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct is unwarranted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 508, 590 A.2d 901 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>39 Conn.

App. 546, 554, 653 A.2d 197, cert. denied, 232 Conn. 916, 655 A.2d 260 (1995). Assuming, arguendo, that the challenged comments were improper, they were not representative of a blatant and egregious pattern of misconduct that either \u201cdeprive[d] the defendant of a fair trial; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40; or otherwise implicate[d] the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.

Is that relevant?</p>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">\u201cThe Court Do you claim it, Mr. Gold?</p>\n<p id=\"A4fq\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Well, I do, Your Honor, because I think it\u2019s offered to explain one of the reasons that [W] did not report this.</p>\n<p id=\"Axeu\">\u201cThe Court: Overrule the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"AAe\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"AVr\">\u201cQ. Did you report what [your uncle] was doing?</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">\u201cA. I told my grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"AvcL\">\u201cQ. What did she say?</p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">\u201cA. She said it was not true, she didn\u2019t believe me, she said I was fresh.</p>\n<p id=\"A429\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"AXX-\">\u201cQ. In addition to the incident with your uncle, was there an incident when you were in California in a church\u2014at a church function?</p>\n<p id=\"AjB9\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"AFEN\">\u201cQ. And what happened in California?</p>\n<p id=\"AmQ\">\u201cA. I went to the soda machine outside my room to get a soda.</p>\n<p id=\"AtqH\">\u201cQ. This was in a hotel?</p>\n<p id=\"Ahh\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"A3yg\">\u201cQ. Did someone come on to the scene, though?</p>\n<p id=\"AIM\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"AX6\">\u201cQ. So, that didn\u2019t get very far?</p>\n<p id=\"ARY\">\u201cA. No, just my clothes were ripped and he was on me, but he didn\u2019t get far.</p>\n<p id=\"A_R\">\u201cQ. Did you report that to your\u2014who did you first report it to?</p>\n<p id=\"AQ8\">\u201cA. My godmother.</p>\n<p id=\"ASY\">\u201cQ. Okay. And what did she do with that information?</p>\n<p id=\"A-cq\">\u201cA. She reported it to the front desk.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\"> Although the defendant makes his claim under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, he has failed to support his appellate claim with an independent analysis under the Connecticut constitution. We, therefore, deem that claim to be abandoned. <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>228 Conn. 118, 122 n.3, 635 A.2d 762 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carolina, </em>40 Conn.

She didn\u2019t say anything about an answering machine, she said nobody was home?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">\u201cA. She could say that, but she can\u2019t prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">\u201cQ. She can\u2019t prove it?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">\u201cQ. Okay. I see. So, you think she is maybe trying to fudge it to help her friend out?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">\u201cA. I\u2019m sure she is.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">\u201cQ. Are you sure she is?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Judge, excuse me. I object to that; it\u2019s improper characterization.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">\u201cThe Court: The witness has answered the question. It may stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-20\">\u201cQ. So, this is not only\u2014so Sharon Huie is also going to try to fudge the facts in this case to help her buddy out?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-21\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I object to that also.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">\u201cThe Court: Sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-23\">\u201cQ. Were there any other witnesses, in your opinion, that were fudging the facts here?</p>\n<p id=\"b477-24\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Objection, that is improper and there is no foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-25\">\u201cThe Court: Sustain the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\"> The defendant asserts that the following comments violated his right not to testify: \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of ironic that he doesn\u2019t show up at 8:30, he shows up late enough so that he knows he is going to get to take her home. Sometime after ten ... I think [W] said it was 10:30, but late enough so that he had to take her home. No explanation why he is late. Did he explain it? No. The guy just shows up two hours late, there is no explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\u201cRapes aren\u2019t committed in front of witnesses. You see, that\u2019s the way the system works. He raped her when he could rape her without witnesses. If you listen to what the defense says, who else can testify about the rape? . . . The defendant would put in any evidence they want as to this motive for her to come forward, but they haven\u2019t introduced any evidence to show you a motive . . . and does it seem odd that the defense calls one witness, Mrs. Daniels? That\u2019s the defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\"> The defendant claims that the following comments improperly invoked sympathy for the victim: \u201cI\u2019m sorry she wasn\u2019t able to fight harder. You know, she tried her level best. And I think her grabbing where she knew it was hurting was as smart and I would only hope that my loved ones would have the same courage.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">* ** *</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">\u201cThe fact she couldn\u2019t use her karate skills, I hope that is offensive to you that this woman, who is really struggling for her life as far as she knows, doesn\u2019t fight hard enough and that\u2019s a defense to rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">\u201cAnd the defense said, well, she should have gone to the hospital. Well, she is tough, she had to make a decision, she made it. And I urge you don\u2019t hold that against her because I think you see what somebody has to go through two and a half years later.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b480-15\"> The defendant does not direct our attention to any specific language or portion of the transcript that would be illustrative of this alleged misconduct. Rather, he couches his claim in general terms stating that the prosecutor \u201cargued that Ms. Daniels testified that the state\u2019s witnesses were fudging their testimony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
