We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On April 14, 1994, the Bridgeport police department conducted a surveillance of the courtyard at the Marina Apartments and observed the defendant in the company of Phillip Rorie. Detective Thomas Russell observed several persons enter the courtyard and hand money to the defendant. Each time, after receiving the money, the defendant would point to Rorie. On the defendant\u2019s signal, Rorie would retrieve a plastic bag containing cocaine from an electrical box and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>would distribute the cocaine to the buyer. The defendant and Rorie repeated this course of conduct throughout the morning. On the basis of their observations of this conduct, the police arrested the defendant and Rorie and recovered forty-four glassine envelopes of cocaine. The defendant was charged and later released on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">On June 15, 1994, the Bridgeport police department again conducted a surveillance at the Marina Apartments and observed the defendant and Andre Smith shooting dice in the courtyard. On this occasion, Officer William Bailey, Jr., observed several persons enter the courtyard and hand money to the defendant . After receiving the money, the defendant would point to Smith. On the defendant\u2019s signal, Smith would retrieve a brown paper bag containing cocaine and crack cocaine from a steel grate and would then distribute the cocaine to the buyer. On the basis of their observations of this conduct, the police arrested the defendant and Smith and recovered twenty packages of cocaine and one vial of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">By amended information, which included the offenses arising on April 14 and June 15, the state charged the defendant with seven counts of conspiracy to sell narcotics, two counts of conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to sell, and two counts of conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to sell within 1500 feet of a public housing project. At trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In his first claim, the defendant argues that the trial court improperly permitted Russell to testify that the defendant\u2019s witness, Rorie, lacked veracity. The defendant argues that Russell\u2019s testimony was inadmissible first, because his opinion was not based on personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>knowledge and, second, because it did not entail Rorie\u2019s reputation in the community. The defendant also asserts Rorie\u2019s reputation was not placed in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">At trial, the court allowed Russell to proffer his opinion of Rorie, which Russell based on hearing Rorie testify under oath at an asset forfeiture hearing. Defense counsel objected to Russell\u2019s opinion testimony, initially by making a general objection and later on hearsay grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, however, the defendant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>that the state failed to lay a proper foundation for the opinion testimony, in that the opinion was not based on Rorie\u2019s reputation within the community or from Russell\u2019s personal knowledge. The state contends that the defendant\u2019s claim was not preserved at trial and, even if the claim were properly preserved, the opinion testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the issue of lack of proper foundation was not raised by the defendant before the trial court. \u201cOrdinarily we will not review a claim that was not distinctly raised before the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 787, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995). The defendant has not requested that we review this claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). \u201cIn the absence of such a request, we have, in the past, declined to review a defendant\u2019s claim under similar circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>supra, 787; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Casado, </em>42 Conn. App. 371, 374-75, 680 A.2d 981 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>38 Conn. App. 56, 65, 658 A.2d 148, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 903, 665 A.2d 904 (1995). We decline, therefore, to review the defendant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court violated Canon 3 of the Judicial Code of Conduct by presiding over the trial after participating in plea negotiations and, thus, lacked impartiality. The defendant concedes that his claim is unpreserved, but seeks appellate review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The trial judge presided over a pretrial hearing at which the court questioned the defendant regarding his predicament. The court also impressed on the defendant the consequences of rejecting the state\u2019s plea bargain offer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant rejected the plea bargain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>elected a jury trial. The trial judge presided over the trial and the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Although the defendant relies on Canon 3 of the Judicial Code of Conduct, a claim of impartiality is more appropriately brought pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 997. Practice Book \u00a7 997 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA motion to disqualify a judicial authority shall be in writing and shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the facts relied upon to show the grounds for disqualification and a certificate of the counsel of record that the motion is made in good faith. ...\u201d \u201cIt is axiomatic that the burden of establishing a record that a judicial impropriety has occurred which demonstrates or gives the appearance of bias or partiality so as to require recusal rests with the party who claims the occurrence of such an impropriety.\u201d State v. San<em>tangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 584, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>6 Conn. App. 407, 413, 505 A.2d 1266, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 810, 508 A.2d 771 (1986), we stated that compliance with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 997 is mandatory and a condition precedent to a hearing on a judge\u2019s disqualification. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Safford, </em>22 Conn. App. 531, 537, 578 A.2d 152, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 823, 581 A.2d 1057 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Here, however, the defendant failed to make a motion for disqualification pursuant to \u00a7 997. At no time did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the defendant, either orally or in writing, move the court to disqualify itself. As a result of the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with \u00a7 997, the record is inadequate for appellate review. We conclude, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Evans-Golding </em>test. Additionally, the defendant does not request, nor do the facts warrant, plain error review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who . . . sells . . .

And how do you know him?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">\u201c[Russell]: I had another investigation pertaining\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object to this, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I will overrule the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: It\u2019s connected with this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: How do you know Phillip Rorie, Detective Russell?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">\u201c[Russell]: I had another investigation where I filed an asset forfeiture where we had seized his money and I had to testify in court on the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">* **</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: As a result of that hearing, did you have an opinion as to Mr. Rorie\u2019s truthfulness?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-19\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m not going to allow that. Objection, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-20\">\u201cThe Court: There\u2019s nothing wrong with that question. Did Rorie testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-21\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: I\u2019m sorry?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-22\">\u201cThe Court: You have to ask him does he have some basis to have formed an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Do you have a basis\u2014some basis to form an opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-24\">\u201c[Russell]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-25\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: And did Mr. Rorie testify at that hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-26\">\u201c[Russell]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-27\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: And based upon that testimony, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Mr. Rorie is a truthful person?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-28\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m going to object to that, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-29\">\u201cThe Court: It\u2019s a proper question under our rules. It\u2019s his opinion. It\u2019s based on either general reputation or in Connecticut, which is an exception to the general rule, a person may give testimony as to a person\u2019s\u2014his opinion of a person\u2019s reputation for truthfulness. It\u2019s a matter for a jury to accept or reject. It\u2019s permissible testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-30\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: You do have an opinion?</p>\n<p id=\"b525-31\">\u201c[Russell]: Yes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201c[Prosecutor]: What is your opinion based on?</p>\n<p id=\"AXy\">\u201c[Russell]: He lied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIAi\">At the conclusion of Russell\u2019s testimony, defense counsel renewed his objection as follows: \u201cYour Honor, if I may, I just want to put on the record, I wanted to renew my objection. I know you already ruled. It seems to me that the opinion of\u2014the officer\u2019s opinion of what\u2014what was his name\u2014Detective Russell\u2019s opinion that he lied, seems to me that\u2014a further objection, I believe, on the basis that it would be hearsay as well in that he\u2019s relying on hearsay to formulate that opinion. I can\u2019t cross-examine that hearing that he had. In other words, he\u2019s basing it on some other hearing. That was an asset forfeiture. I don\u2019t have the transcript. It\u2019s impossible for me to find out and delve into it. Even if I could, it would probably be collateral. It seems to me, in addition to the fact that he\u2019s giving an opinion on the veracity of the individual, he\u2019s doing it on almost exclusively hearsay. I just wanted to put that on the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b526-14\"> Even if we were to consider the reviewability of this claim under <em>Golding, </em>it would fail to satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding. </em>See footnote 6. It is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>established that \u201c[r]obing garden variety claims [of an evidentiary nature] in the majestic garb of constitutional claims does not make such claims constitutional in nature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>33 Conn. App. 311, 331-32, 635 A.2d 848 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 924, 638 A.2d 38 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ulen, </em>31 Conn. App. 20, 37, 623 A.2d 70, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 905, 625 A.2d 1378 (1993). Evidentiary claims are not of constitutional magnitude and are thus not entitled to <em>Golding </em>review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 741 n.22, 631 A.2d 288 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-13\"> Under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, the defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u201conly if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b527-14\"> The following colloquy took place at the pretrial hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"AN4c\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Your Honor, I offered two and a half years flat on one of the cases and I have been informed that Mr. Teel is not inclined to enter a plea at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"AMMY\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"AZf\">\u201c[The Court]: Alright, Mr. Teel. You are going to go on the jury list. I want you to fully understand the situation. You are charged with two crimes. Your exposure in this case, if you are convicted, is twenty-two years. You have been offered two and one-half. You have a perfect right to a trial. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>you lose in that trial, you the stand the risk whatever the judge is going to feel is an appropriate sentence based on the circumstances of your prior history. You have until today. If the plea does not go down today, that offer will never ever reappear. You will go on trial. If the judge wants to give you fifteen years when it is all over, that\u2019s what you face. I just want to make sure you understand the offer has been made. I think your attorney thinks it is fair. You have a right to reject it. I just want you to understand the consequences of that rejection. I will put your case down for the twentieth, next Monday. You are not going to come back on that day and say, I will take the two and a half. The two and a half is gone today. You will go on trial on Monday and whatever the consequences are, those will be the consequences.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b529-16\"> In its reply brief, the defendant for the first time requests plain error review. \u201cIt is a well established principle that arguments cannot be raised for the first time in a reply brief.\u201d <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 593 n.26, 657 A.2d 212 (1995). The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>39 Conn. App. 175, 664 A.2d 1153 (1995), as support for his claim that the trial court acted improperly by presiding over the pretrial hearing and the trial. <em>Washington, </em>however, is inapposite. In <em>Washington, </em>this court sua sponte raised the issue of whether the trial court improperly presided over the defendant\u2019s revocation of probation hearing after the defendant rejected the plea bargains that <em>the court offered from the bench. </em>Id., 176. In <em>Washington, </em>the trial court actively engaged in plea negotiations with the defendant. See id., 177-78 n.5. Here, however, no such plea negotiations took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
