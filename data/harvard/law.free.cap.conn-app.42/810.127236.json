The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) instructed the jury that an adverse inference could be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to produce his sister, Mina Dawkins, and her boyfriend, Norman Ramsey, as witnesses, (2) admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior larceny convictions for impeachment purposes, and (3) instructed the jury regarding the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>dard of reasonable doubt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On January 23, 1993, the victim, Cheryl Michaud, arrived at BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club in Hartford at approximately 8:15 p.m. After completing her shopping at approximately 8:48 p.m., she left the store and loaded her purchases into her car. While she was returning her shopping cart, it became stuck in a sewer grate. The defendant approached the victim from the direction of the cart storage area as she attempted to free the cart. The defendant asked the victim if he could use her cart, and she agreed. The defendant asked the victim if she wanted twenty-five cents for the cart deposit, and she declined. The defendant withdrew a small black handgun from his coat pocket, pushed it into the victim\u2019s back and told her not to scream or he would shoot her. With the gun pressed against the victim\u2019s back, the defendant pushed the victim toward her car and attempted to force her into the car. When the victim refused, the defendant struck her in the back. He then took the victim\u2019s wedding band, her engagement ring and $5.75. The defendant walked away into a wooded area next to the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly delivered an adverse missing witness instruction to the jury and improperly allowed the state to present an adverse inference argument. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">At trial, the defendant attempted to establish an alibi defense. The defendant and Mildred Dawkins, his mother, testified to the following. The defendant lived with his mother, and he had been at home with his mother at the time of the robbery. On the night in question, Mina Dawkins and Ramsey picked up the defendant and his mother between 5 and 6 p.m. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>drove them to visit Mildred Dawkins\u2019 aunt. They remained at the aunt\u2019s house for approximately ninety minutes and returned home with Mina Dawkins and Ramsey sometime between 6:30 and 7:45 p.m. The defendant remained inside the house the rest of the night. Mina Dawkins and Ramsey lived in nearby communities and were \u201cavailable\u201d at the time of trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The defendant did not call either Mina Dawkins or Ramsey as witnesses. The state requested that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>court give the jury an adverse inference instruction pursuant to <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 165 A.2d 598 (1960), because the defendant had failed to produce these two witnesses in support of his defense. The court gave an adverse inference instruction, as requested by the state, in its charge to the jury. The court, over the defendant\u2019s objection, also allowed the state to argue to the jury that the defendant\u2019s failure to produce the two witnesses permitted an adverse inference. We conclude that the trial court properly gave the requested charge and that the state, therefore, could argue the inference to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">In <em>Secondino, </em>our Supreme Court stated the conditions under which an adverse inference instruction is appropriate. \u201c \u2018The failure of a party to produce a witness who is within his power to produce and who would naturally have been produced by him, permits the inference that the evidence of the witness would be unfavorable to the party\u2019s cause.\u2019 . . . There are two requirements for the operation of the rule: The witness must be available, and he must be a witness whom the party would naturally produce. ... A witness who would naturally be produced by a party is one who is known to that party and who, by reason of his relationship to that party or to the issues, or both, could reasonably be expected to have peculiar or superior information material to the case which, if favorable, the party would produce.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 675; <em>Hines </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center, </em>232 Conn. 632, 637, 657 A.2d 578 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 105-106, 602 A.2d 581 (1992). The <em>Secondino </em>rule applies to criminal prosecutions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 105; <em>State </em>v. <em>Watley, </em>195 Conn. 485, 488, 488 A.2d 1245 (1985). A trial court\u2019s adverse inference instruction will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>The defendant argues that Mina Dawkins and Ramsey were not alibi witnesses who would naturally be produced because they could not testify that the defendant was in his mother\u2019s house at the time of the robbery. Mina Dawkins and Ramsey brought the defendant and his mother home from the aunt\u2019s house on the night of the robbery. The defendant\u2019s alibi defense relies heavily on his and his mother\u2019s testimony and that testimony would have become more credible if other witnesses had corroborated a substantial part of it. The testimony did not relate to an isolated incident, but, instead, involved a series of events related to the facts of the alibi defense. This was an identification case, and the defendant\u2019s alibi was crucial. Only Mina Dawkins and Ramsey could corroborate the testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">\u201cThe testimony of several witnesses in support of an alibi defense can hardly be characterized as unimportant or cumulative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 106. The credibility of the defendant\u2019s mother was cast into doubt by her relationship to the defendant. See id. The defendant\u2019s failure to call either Mina Dawkins or Ramsey to corroborate, at least in part, both his testimony and that of his mother as to events occurring on the evening of the robbery, especially given the strong and contradictory evidence presented by the state through the testimony of the victim, was a significant circumstance to call to the attention of the jury. See id. The trial court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in giving the <em>Seeondino </em>charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">If the instruction were deemed improper, the burden of demonstrating its harmfulness would still rest with the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 215, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). The defendant must prove that the trial court improperly instructed the jury and that the instruction probably affected the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the trial. <em>State </em>v. Buster, 224 Conn. 546, 561, 620 A.2d 110 (1993). The harmfulness of a nonconstitutional error is evaluated on the record as a whole. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>supra, 215. \u201cAn improper instruction is not automatically harmful merely because it adversely affects a defense.\u201d Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 212-14, 438 A.2d 418 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Even if the defendant had demonstrated that the <em>Secondino </em>instruction was improper, he has not demonstrated that it affected the outcome of the trial. First, the defendant\u2019s testimony is suspect as self-serving, and the testimony of his mother is suspect due to her familial bias. Second, the victim positively identified the defendant as the robber on three separate occasions, over a one year time period, as the man who had robbed her. Third, the trial court clearly instructed the jury that it was permitted, but not required, to draw an adverse inference.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if the jury determined that the testimony of the missing witnesses was not reasonably and logically connected to the question of whether the defendant was present at the scene of the robbery, it could find the defendant guilty by believing the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>mony of the victim over that of the defendant and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendant also claims that the giving of a <em>Secondino </em>instruction in a criminal case where the defendant advances an alibi defense violates his constitutional right to due process. The defendant did not raise this claim at trial, but seeks review on appeal pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We find no merit in this claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant cannot satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding, </em>that the claim is of constitutional magnitude involving the violation of a fundamental constitutional right. \u201cThe giving of a <em>Secondino </em>charge is purely an evidentiary issue and is not a matter of constitutional dimensions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 41-42, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). \u201c[0]nce identified, unpreserved evidentiary claims masquerading as constitutional claims will be summarily dismissed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 241. A long line of cases addressing the identical argument concerning the violation of a constitutional right by the giving of a <em>Secondino </em>instruction rejects the defendant\u2019s argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 43-44, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027, 108 S. Ct. 753, 98 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Peary, </em>176 Conn. 170, 182, 405 A.2d 626 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 966, 99 S. Ct. 2417, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1979); <em>State v.Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 536-39, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lucci, 25 </em>Conn. App. 334, 344-45, 595 A.2d 361, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 913, 597 A.2d 336 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>14 Conn. App. 463, 471, 541 A.2d 534, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 803, 548 A.2d 439 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The defendant claims next that the trial court improperly permitted the introduction of three of his prior convictions for impeachment purposes and refused to require the state to refer to the defendant\u2019s third degree larceny conviction as an unnamed felony. The defendant also claims that the court thereby adversely affected the presumption of innocence and, thus, deprived him of the right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Our review of the record reveals that the trial court permitted the state to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility by introducing a prior conviction for larceny in the third degree and two prior convictions for larceny in the sixth degree. The trial court stated that the prior convictions were admissible because they were particularly probative of the defendant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Generally, evidence that a defendant has been convicted of crimes on prior occasions is not admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 434-35, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 5, 480 A.2d 489 (1984). This rule, however, has several well established exceptions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 5-6. One of these exceptions permits the state, \u201cin certain circumstances, to introduce evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s prior convictions after the defendant has testified for the purpose of impugning the credibility of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>testimony.\u201d Id., 6; General Statutes \u00a7 52-145 (b);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 434-35; <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>38 Conn. App. 815, 821, 663 A.2d 423, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 922, 666 A.2d 1188 (1995). This evidence is properly admissible when its prejudicial effect does not \u201cfar outweigh\u201d its probative value. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The probative value of the proffered evidence is assessed in light of the fact or issue that it was intended to prove. Id. \u201cThree factors have usually been identified as of primary importance in considering whether a former criminal conviction is to be admitted: (1) the extent of the prejudice likely to arise; (2) the significance of the commission of the particular crime in indicating untruthfulness; and (3) its remoteness in time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 513, 522, 447 A.2d 396 (1982); <em>State v. Sauris, </em>227 Conn. 389, 409, 631 A.2d 238 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 11; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prutting, </em>40 Conn. App. 151, 158-59, 669 A.2d 1228 (1996). \u201cAtrial court\u2019s decision to allow the use of a prior conviction for impeachment purposes will not be disturbed unless the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sauris, </em>supra, 409; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braswell, </em>194 Conn. 297, 307, 481 A.2d 413 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1112, 105 S. Ct. 793, 83 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Two general categories of prior convictions are admissible for impeachment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 12. \u201cFirst are those crimes that by their very nature indicate dishonesty or tendency to make false statement. . . . The second category involves convictions for crimes that do not reflect directly on the credibility of one who has been convicted of them.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 822. It is recognized in Connecticut courts \u201cthat crimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>involving larcenous intent imply a general disposition toward dishonesty such that they also fall within this [first] category. . . . Convictions of this sort obviously bear heavily on the credibility of one who has been convicted of them. The probative value of such convictions, therefore, may often outweigh any prejudice engendered by their admission.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>supra, 12. The prior convictions at issue here fall within the first category. Each involved a prior conviction for larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\u201cThe trial court, because of its intimate familiarity with the case, is in the best position to weigh the relative merits and dangers of any proffered evidence.\u201d Id., 13. The record reveals that the trial court considered the remoteness of the convictions, their similarities to the present charges and the significance of the prior convictions in indicating truthfulness. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the defendant\u2019s three prior larceny convictions for the purpose of impeaching the defendant or by refusing to require the state to refer to the defendant\u2019s prior conviction of larceny in the third degree as an unnamed felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">The defendant argues that his claim also raises constitutional issues. Because no constitutional argument was made at trial, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. The defendant\u2019s claim, however, fails to satisfy the second prong of <em>Golding, </em>that the claim is of constitutional magnitude involving the violation of a fundamental constitutional right. \u201cIt is concerned solely with an evidentiary ruling on the admissibility of a prior conviction into evidence for puiposes of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility. Calling it a constitutional issue will not make it one.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Varszegi, </em>36 Conn. App. 680, 686, 653 A.2d 201 (1995), aff'd, 236 Conn. 266, 673 A.2d 90 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The defendant claims finally that the trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding reasonable doubt lowered the burden of proof required for conviction in violation of his due process rights. Because this claim was not preserved at trial, the defendant seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Specifically, the defendant challenges the following parts of the court\u2019s instruction: \u201cA reasonable doubt, in other words, is a real doubt, an honest doubt, a doubt which has its foundation in the evidence or lack of evidence. It\u2019s the kind of doubt which, in the serious affairs which concern you in everyday life, you would pay heed and attention to. It\u2019s the kind of doubt which would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. . . . If you can, in reason, reconcile all of the facts proved with any reasonable theory consistent with the innocence of the accused, then you cannot find him guilty.\u201d Jury instructions similar or identical to these have consistently been upheld by the Connecticut courts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 705-706, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 254 n.22, 645 A.2d 999 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 572-73, 638 A.2d 578 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>226 Conn. 618, 651-52, 629 A.2d 1067 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170-71, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>39 Conn. App. 96, 105-106, 664 A.2d 306, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 921, 665 A.2d 908 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>37 Conn. App. 635, 641-43, 657 A.2d 247, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 917, 660 A.2d 354 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>37 Conn. App. 464, 467-73, 657 A.2d 659, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 660 A.2d 859 (1995). In light of these cases, and after reviewing the trial court\u2019s entire charge to the jury, we conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of the <em>Golding </em>test, that the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\"> On cross-examination, the defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: What is your sister\u2019s name?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">\u201c[The Defendant,]: Mina.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And where does she live?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Burnside Avenue, East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Does she still live there?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, Sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: She\u2019s around?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-16\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: And please tell us who else you claim went with you on January twenty-third to visit your aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Her boyfriend, Norman Ramsey.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-18\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Where does he live?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-19\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Windsor, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-20\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Is he around?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-21\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes, Sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">On cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s mother, Mildred Dawkins, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">\u201c[State\u2019s Attorney]: Your daughter\u2019s name, Mrs. Dawkins, I understand is\u2014is it Mina or Minah?</p>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">\u201c[Mrs. Dawkins]: Mina.

It\u2019s sufficient if, as you consider all the evidence, there arises in your mind a reasonable doubt as to Mr. Dawkins\u2019 presence at the scene of the crime when it was committed. If you do conclude that there is a doubt, the accused is entitled to a verdict of not guilty. You will recall that, in final argument, the state asked you to infer, from the fact that Mina Dawkins and Norman Ramsey, who, if memory serves, and it\u2019s your recollection, not mine, that controls . . . Mina Dawkins was the sister of the defendant and Norman Ramsey was referred to as her fiance or her boyfriend. The state has asked you to infer, from the fact that those people were not called as witnesses, that their testimony would have been unfavorable to the defendant. . . . Now, I emphasize to you, first, that this adverse inference, this inference that the person, if called as a witness, would have given unfavorable evidence, is a permissive inference. That is, you may draw the inference, but you are not required to, depending on whether you think it\u2019s a reasonable and logical inference.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\"> \u201c [A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. \u201cWe have stated previously that \u2018[w]e are free, however, to dispose of the claim by focusing on the condition that appears most relevant under the circumstances of the case.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>29 Conn. App. 533, 537, 616 A.2d 1148 (1992), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 924, 618 A.2d 531 (1993).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Krzywicki, </em>39 Conn.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in giving a <em>Secondino </em>instruction. In my opinion, the instruction was not warranted because Mina Dawkins and Norman Ramsey were not witnesses whom the defendant would naturally produce.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The defendant raised an alibi defense at trial. An alibi \u201cplaces the defendant at the <em>relevant time of the crime </em>in a different place than the scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). A defendant asserting an alibi defense is therefore naturally expected to produce those witnesses with \u201cpeculiar or superior information\u201d which is favorable to his whereabouts at the time of the crime. See <em>Hines </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Medical Center, </em>232 Conn. 632, 637, 657 A.2d 578 (1995). A defendant is not, however, naturally expected to produce witnesses whose testimony will be \u201ccomparatively unimportant\u201d to his defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>20 Conn. App. 263, 266, 565 A.2d 1365 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">In this case, the defendant and his mother testified in support of the defendant\u2019s alibi defense. See part I of the majority opinion. Mina Dawkins and Ramsey could not testify to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts at the time the crime was committed. Instead, they would have testified that they dropped off the defendant and his mother at her house earlier that evening. As the state argued at trial and during its closing, this testimony was irrelevant to the defendant\u2019s alibi defense because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>even if Mina Dawkins and Ramsey had testified truthfully as to the time they dropped off the defendant and his mother, the defendant would still have had ample time to reach the crime scene after being returned home. The state, however, was permitted to argue <em>both </em>that the testimony of Mina Dawkins and Ramsey was irrelevant to the alibi defense <em>and </em>that the jury could simultaneously draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to produce these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The crime was committed long after Mina Dawkins and Ramsey returned the defendant and his mother to her house. Although \u201c[t]he testimony of several witnesses in support of an alibi defense can hardly be characterized as unimportant or cumulative\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>221 Conn. 93, 106, 602 A.2d 581 (1992); Mina Dawkins and Ramsey are not witnesses who could have testified to the defendant\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the crime. They would have been able only to bolster Mildred Dawkins\u2019 credibility by corroborating her version of events two hours before the crime. Unlike the majority, I cannot conclude that this testimony was part of \u201ca series of events related to the facts of the alibi defense\u201d so as to make it material.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The state contends that the testimony was material because it would have bolstered the credibility of Mildred Dawkins, thereby \u201cinferentially\u201d enhancing the credibility of the defendant\u2019s alibi defense. Once Mildred Dawkins testified in support of the defendant\u2019s alibi defense, the jury, as the finder of fact, was free to believe or disbelieve her.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Under the majority\u2019s analysis, a defendant will be required to bolster the general credibility of his alibi witness or suffer the consequences of a <em>Secondino </em>instruction. In my opinion, this is contrary to Connecticut law, which \u201cfollows the federal rules of evidence in that the credibility of a witness cannot be supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>until after it has been attacked. . . . \u2018Where a witness has not been impeached, it is not in general permissible to support his testimony by other evidence, corroborative in its nature, which bears on the credibility of the witness rather than on the issues in the cause ....\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Suckley, </em>26 Conn. App. 65, 72, 597 A.2d 1285, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 901, 600 A.2d 1028 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Although I would have concluded that the giving of a <em>Secondino </em>instruction was an abuse of discretion, the defendant has not sustained his burden of proving that the instruction affected the outcome of the trial. I therefore concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
