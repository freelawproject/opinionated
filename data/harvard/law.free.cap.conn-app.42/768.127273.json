The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) found him to be in violation of probation because there was insufficient evidence, (2) failed to disqualify itself, (3) denied him the right personally to address the court, (4) deprived him of his right to counsel, and (5) refused to order an updated presentence investigation report. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">The following facts adduced at the probation hearing are relevant to this appeal. On November 17, 1988, the defendant pleaded guilty to kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) and reckless endangerment in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-63 (a). The trial court sentenced the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for an effective sentence of eleven years, suspended after four and one-half years, and placed him on probation for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">On November 1, 1992, the defendant was released from the custody of the commissioner of correction. On November 2, 1992, the defendant reported to his probation officer, Iris Santiago, who reviewed with the defendant the conditions of probation to which the defendant had agreed. The conditions included, inter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>alia, complying with criminal laws and reporting as directed by a probation officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The defendant failed to report to Santiago as directed on November 18 and December 16, 1992, January 13, February 3, March 17, June 9, July 17, August 25, October 6 and November 17,1993, and January 11, February 16 and March 9,1994. The defendant did report to Santiago as directed on April 21, May 12, July 21, September 8, October 20 and December 14, 1993, and January 19, 1994. The defendant also reported on December 18, 1992, February 5 and June 6, 1993, and March 16, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">On March 10,1994, the defendant was involved in an incident at the two bedroom apartment of Theodosia Provite. At 2 a.m., the defendant, who had known Provite for two years, stopped at her apartment. Provite was with Maurice Bacote in her upstairs bedroom. Provite\u2019s daughter was sleeping in the other upstairs bedroom. When Provite opened the front door for the defendant, he walked past her and went upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">When the defendant reached the top of the stairs, he was met by Bacote. The defendant told Bacote: \u201cGet your stuff and get out.\u201d Bacote replied: \u201cNo, get your stuff and get out.\u201d The defendant then said: \u201cI know you don\u2019t have a gun. Shoot me.\u201d Several gunshots were then fired. After the shooting stopped, Provite, who had escaped to her kitchen, heard someone run down the stairs and out of the apartment. She then heard the defendant calling for help. She called 911 and went upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Provite found the defendant lying on the floor in the doorway to her daughter\u2019s bedroom. The defendant gave her a .38 caliber gun and told her \u201cto put it up.\u201d Provite wrapped the gun in a towel and put it in her closet. Emergency medical technicians took the defendant to Yale-New Haven Hospital. The defendant had been shot in the thigh and the abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Police later discovered six bullet holes in the door to Provite\u2019s daughter\u2019s bedroom. The wall across the hall from the daughter\u2019s bedroom contained two bullet holes. Detective Robert Benson found five .38 caliber shell casings, a 9 millimeter shell casing, and two 9 millimeter bullets in the daughter\u2019s bedroom. He also found a 9 millimeter shell casing and three .38 caliber bullets in the hallway. Benson removed a 9 millimeter bullet from the bullet proof vest that the defendant was wearing and two .38 caliber bullets from the hallway wall opposite the daughter\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Benson also found a .38 caliber gun wrapped in a towel in the closet of Provite\u2019s bedroom. The gun contained a cartridge housing two bullets. An empty 9 millimeter cartridge was found wrapped in the towel. The serial number on the .38 caliber gun had been drilled out and obliterated. The defendant did not possess a permit to carry a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Santiago prepared an arrest warrant application predicated on the defendant\u2019s failure to report as directed on February 16 and March 9, 1994, and for the commission of criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree, altering or removing an identification mark on a pistol or revolver, risk of injury to a child, and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit. By an information dated December 8, 1994, the defendant was charged with a violation of probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. By amended information dated January 25, 1995, the defendant was further alleged to be in violation of probation for criminal possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">On February 6, 1995, the trial court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant failed to report as directed to his probation officer on February 16, March 9 and March 10, 1994. The trial court further found that the defendant had been carrying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had obliterated the identification number on a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-36<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and had been in criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court concluded that the beneficial purposes of probation were not being served and imposed the remainder of the defendant\u2019s sentence, six and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly found that he had violated probation because there was insufficient evidence of the violations. To support a finding of probation violation, the evidence must induce a reasonable belief that it is more probable than not that the defendant has violated a condition of his probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 302, 641 A.2d 370 (1994). Where the legal conclusions of the trial court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 222, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). Where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>determine whether the facts are supported by the evidence or whether they are clearly erroneous. Id., 222-23. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ...\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>40 Conn. App. 395, 401, 671 A.2d 379 (1996). We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The defendant first claims that his failure to report to the probation officer on February 16 and March 9, 1994, cannot properly be held to be violations of his conditions of probation. The defendant argues that the conditions of probation are analogous to the terms of a contract between the defendant and the state, and that the meaning of terms in a contract can be modified by the actions of the parties during the course of the contract. The defendant asserts, therefore, that because the probation department had accepted the defendant\u2019s erratic manner of reporting to the probation officer, it cannot now arbitrarily and retroactively choose two dates on which the defendant failed to report as violations of the condition that he report to a probation officer as directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The defendant claims that our Supreme Court analogized the conditions of probation to the terms of a contract in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 285. We do not read <em>Davis </em>as supporting the defendant\u2019s claim. In <em>Davis, </em>the court held that under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 the state has the burden of establishing a violation of probation by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Id., 295. In arriving at this conclusion, the court cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>798 P.2d 270, 278 (Utah App. 1990), for the proposition that \u201cthe probation revocation procedure established by \u00a7 53a-32 is akin to a civil proceeding\u201d and that \u201c \u2018[a]s in a contract dispute, proof of breach by the probationer is properly subject to a preponderance of the evidence standard\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 295-96, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>supra, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (c) \u201cthe court may modify or enlarge\u201d a defendant\u2019s conditions of probation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 169, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). This power is not given to the office of adult probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the comparison used by the Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>was limited to demonstrating that the preponderance of the evidence standard should be used under \u00a7 53a-32. Because the defendant concedes that he failed to report to Santiago as directed on February 16 and March 9, 1994, the trial court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The defendant next claims that there was insufficient evidence for the court to find that the defendant possessed the gun found in Provite\u2019s apartment. The defendant argues that, absent evidence of possession, the trial court could not find that he violated any criminal laws. At trial, Provite testified that the defendant handed her a gun and told her to \u201cput it up.\u201d Moreover, Benson testified that he found bullet holes from two different guns on opposite sides of the upstairs hallway. Bullet holes from the .38 caliber gun were found in the wall on the opposite side of the hallway from where the defendant was found. These facts support the inference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>that the defendant possessed the .38 caliber gun. We cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed a firearm was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly found that the defendant had obliterated the identification mark on the gun. General Statutes \u00a7 29-36 provides: \u201cThe possession of any pistol or revolver upon which any identifying mark, number or name has been altered, removed or obliterated shall be prima facie evidence that the person ... in possession of such pistol or revolver has altered, removed or obliterated the same.\u201d The defendant argues that this presumption is unconstitutional and that because the state presented no evidence that he obliterated the identifying mark on the gun, other than his possession of the gun, the evidence is insufficient. We find no merit in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">\u201c \u2018The phrase \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d means evidence which, if credited, is sufficient to establish the fact or facts which it is adduced to prove.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>165 Conn. 577, 595-96, 345 A.2d 532 (1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 960, 94 S. Ct. 1977, 40 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1974). \u201c[A] criminal statutory presumption must be regarded as \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary,\u2019 and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 6, 36, 89 S. Ct. 1532, 23 L. Ed. 2d 57 (1969). We conclude that the presumption in \u00a7 29-36 is not unconstitutional. We conclude further, with substantial assurance, that the defendant\u2019s possession of the gun with obliterated markings demonstrates that it is more likely than not that he obliterated the markings.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly demonstrated bias against the defendant and improperly failed to disqualify himself. The defendant argues that by expressing disbelief of the defendant\u2019s testimony and defense counsel's argument, the trial court deprived him of his due process right to a probation revocation hearing before a \u201cneutral hearing body.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because this claim was not preserved at trial, the defendant seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and the plain error doctrine. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Initially, we note that our review of this claim is limited to the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. A claim of judicial bias in a probation revocation proceeding, which is akin to a civil proceeding, is not subject to <em>Golding </em>review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burnhannan, </em>34 Conn. App. 537, 541, 642 A.2d 59 (1994). \u201cPlain error exists only in truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Because the court, rather than a jury, sits as the trier of fact in a probation revocation hearing, \u201cwe presume, absent an affirmative showing to the contrary, that the . . . court can put aside whatever impressions [it] may have about the [defendant] and grant him a fair hearing.\u201d <em>Fair v. Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 414, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 108 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989). The defendant points to several statements by the court that he claims demonstrate that the court lacked impartiality. Only one of the statements was made by the court, however, prior to the conclusion of the presentation of evidence. When the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>refused to answer a question posed by the state, the court stated: \u201cYou want me to believe this story my friend, you better answer his questions.\u201d The court may take reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial. <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 169, 444 A.2d 915 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The remaining statements that the defendant claims demonstrate bias were made after the defense rested its case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It cannot be said, therefore, that these statements demonstrate \u201ca preconceived view of the credibility of a witness who had not yet testified before the trier.\u201d Id. Rather, they demonstrate that the court had listened to the evidence and found, albeit hastily, that the defendant was not particularly credible. The record in this case does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court appeared to lack impartiality such that the court should have disqualified itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied him the right personally to address the court during the revocation portion of the probation revocation hearing. The defendant argues that this right is expressly guaranteed by Practice Book \u00a7 919 (3), which provides that, at a sentencing hearing, \u201c[t]he judicial authority shall allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to make a personal statement in his or her own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>the sentence.\u201d After finding that the defendant had violated his probation, the trial court revoked the defendant\u2019s sentence of probation and ordered the defendant to serve the remainder of his original sentence. The defendant then asked to address the court, but the court refused to hear the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We begin our analysis by examining the relevant sections of the rules of practice. Section 919 sets forth the procedures for conducting a sentencing hearing, including the mandate that a trial court shall allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to address the court. Practice Book \u00a7 943 sets forth the procedures to be followed for the revocation of probation. After establishing how probation revocation proceedings may be initiated, \u00a7 943 provides: \u201cAll proceedings thereafter shall be in accordance with the provisions of Secs. 634 through 685. At the revocation hearing, the prosecuting authority and the defendant may offer evidence and cross-examine witnesses. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Section 943 does not explicitly afford the defendant the right personally to address the court. Moreover, while specifically referring to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 634 and 685, which deal with arraignment and release decision-making procedures, \u00a7 943 does not specifically require the procedures of \u00a7 919 to be followed. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>contends, nevertheless, that because the trial court \u201cimposes\u201d sentence in a probation revocation hearing, the defendant is entitled to the procedures outlined in \u00a7 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">It is well established that \u201ca probation revocation hearing has two distinct components. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>29 Conn. App. 801, 805, 618 A.2d 557 (1993).] The trial court must first conduct an adversarial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has in fact violated a condition of probation. ... If the trial court determines that the evidence has established a violation of a condition of probation, then it proceeds to the second component of probation revocation, the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 289-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The defendant argues: the second component of a probation revocation hearing is a sentencing procedure. Section 943 further provides: \u201cIf the defendant admits the violation or the judicial authority finds from the evidence that the defendant committed the violation, the judicial authority may make any disposition authorized by law. ...\u201d Section 53a-32 (b) provides: \u201cIf [a] violation is established, the court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">We have stated that: \u201cA probation revocation hearing is not a stage of a criminal prosecution . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>30 Conn. App. 346, 350, 620 A.2d 201 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 228 Conn. 487, 636 A.2d 840 (1994), citing <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973). Section 919, governing the procedures for the sentencing of a defendant, clearly concerns a stage of the criminal prosecution and, therefore, does not apply to a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Moreover, \u00a7 943 provides that a defendant may offer evidence and cross-examine witnesses at a probation revocation hearing. These rights are among those provided for in a sentencing hearing. See Practice Book \u00a7 919 (1). To hold that the procedures of \u00a7 919 must be followed in a probation revocation hearing would render the procedures outlined in \u00a7 943 superfluous. We will not read our rules of practice in such a way as to render their words superfluous. <em>State </em>v. Smith, supra, 207 Conn. 168.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The defendant contends further that, even if our rules of practice do not mandate the defendant\u2019s right personally to address the court, the defendant must be afforded that right in order to meet the requirements of due process.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We recognize that \u201c[t]he loss of liberty resulting from the revocation of probation is a serious deprivation requiring that the probationer be accorded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>due process of law . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMasi, </em>34 Conn. App. 46, 51, 640 A.2d 138, cert. denied, 230 Conn. 906, 644 A.2d 920 (1994). In <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972), the United States Supreme Court held that the minimum requirements of due process include \u201c(a) written notice of the claimed violations of [probation]; (b) disclosure to the [probationer] of evidence against him; (c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 hearing body . . . and (f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking [probation].\u201d See also <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>supra, 411 U.S. 781-82 (holding that probationer is entitled to preliminary and final revocation hearings).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">We have stated, however, that \u201c[a] strict interpretation of the <em>Morrissey </em>standards runs contrary to the spirit of flexibility with which the Supreme Court promulgated the <em>Morrissey </em>and <em>Gagnon </em>due process requirements. . . . [D]ue process is flexible and calls for those procedural protections that the particular situation demands. ... A revocation proceeding does not require all of the procedural components associated with an adversarial criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>19 Conn. App. 304, 312, 563 A.2d 721 (1989) (holding that there are instances in which preliminary hearing of <em>Gagnon </em>is superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>948 F.2d 325 (7th Cir. 1991), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the precise issue now before us. The court distinguished the situation in which a sentence had been imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>but its execution suspended from the situation in which a defendant had been convicted but the imposition of sentence postponed. Id., 329. On the one hand, the court held that a defendant\u2019s right personally to address the court is not implicated at a hearing to revoke probation and to reinstate a previously imposed sentence. Id., citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coffey, </em>871 F.2d 39 (6th Cir. 1989). On the other hand, if the sentencing decision had been postponed, then the right to address the court was also postponed. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We find <em>Barnes </em>persuasive. In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>221 Conn. 498, 513-14, 605 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 895, 113 S. Ct. 216, 121 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1992), our Supreme Court noted that \u201cwhere summary judgment for contempt is imposed during trial, the contemnor has normally been given an opportunity to speak in his own behalf in the nature of a right of allocution. . . . However, [t]he United States Supreme Court . . . has often recognized that the requirements of due process cannot be ascertained through mechanistic application of a formula. <em>Groppie </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>[404 U.S. 496, 500, 92 S. Ct. 582, 30 L. Ed. 2d 632 (1972)]. The essence of due process is fundamental fairness. . . . Due process is an element that, when absent, produces the reaction given to that which is shocking to the universal sense of justice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>411 U.S. 423, 432, 93 S. Ct. 1637, 36 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1973).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court held in <em>Jackson </em>that the defendant was not denied due process when he was not given the opportunity personally to address the court with regard to each of three findings of summary contempt despite such a requirement in Practice Book \u00a7 988. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>supra, 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defendant to speak prior to the revocation of his parole and the lifting of the suspension of his original sentence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>shock our sense of justice.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant had the right to speak when he was sentenced in 1988. See Practice Book \u00a7 919 (3). \u201c \u2018Revocation [of probation] is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Deptula, </em>34 Conn. App. 1, 7, 639 A.2d 1049 (1994), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 178. Moreover, the record reveals that the defendant testified at length and that his counsel was given the opportunity to speak with regard to the revocation and lifting of the suspended sentence. \u201c \u2018[0]ur precedents have sought to preserve the flexible informal nature of the revocation hearing, which does not require the full panoply of procedural safeguards associated with a criminal trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>supra, 19 Conn.

We decline to burden the revocation of probation proceedings in this state by holding that the defendant had a right personally to address the court in this case as he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We conclude that neither our rules of practice nor due process requires that the defendant be given the opportunity personally to address the court in a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court deprived him of his right to counsel<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by preventing his attorney from addressing the court with regard to the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. The defendant seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. Golding, supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The record reveals that after the court found that the defendant had violated his probation, the following colloquy took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Because of the substantial exposure here, Your Honor, and because of the nature of this incident, I would like to take a deep breath and suggest to the court that a presentence report or some update of [the defendant\u2019s] status ought to be in order by the probation department. And I would ask Your Honor to consider that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">\u201cThe Court: No. Have you got anything else to say?</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: A lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">\u201cThe Court: The beneficial purposes of his probation to wit, his rehabilitation and the protection of society are no longer being served by this man being on probation</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">From this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court precluded counsel from addressing whether the defendant\u2019s probation \u00a1should be revoked. There is no indication that the court prevented counsel from saying more than he did on the defendant\u2019s behalf. Counsel neither tried to offer more than his statement that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>had a lot to say nor objected when the court went ahead and revoked the defendant\u2019s probation. We will not review a claim of prejudice based on conjecture and speculation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>34 Conn. App. 96, 102, 640 A.2d 630 (1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 232 Conn. 537, 656 A.2d 657 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The defendant claims finally that the trial court improperly refused to order an updated presentence investigation report (PSI) before revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant argues that a PSI was required under General Statutes \u00a7 54-9 la (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 910 (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to order a PSI. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">As we stated earlier, \u201c[a] probation revocation hearing is not a stage of a criminal prosecution . . . but is a discrete statutory procedure to which many of the substantive and procedural rules of criminal law do not apply.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>supra, 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Conn. App. 350.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s reliance on the sentencing procedures of \u00a7 54-91a (a) and \u00a7 910 (a), therefore, is misplaced. A trial court revokes probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b), which provides: \u201cIf [a] violation is established, the court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. No such revocation shall be ordered, <em>except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation is established by reliable and probative evidence.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) See also Practice Book \u00a7 943. Because neither \u00a7 53a-32 (b) nor \u00a7 943 mandates that a PSI be provided prior to the revocation of probation or authorizes a trial court to exercise its discretion in ordering a PSI, we conclude that the court properly refused to order a PSI in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In this opinion FOTI, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b794-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall carry any pistol or revolver upon his person, except when such person is within his dwelling house or place of business, without a permit to carry the same issued as provided in section 29-28. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 29-36 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall alter, remove or obliterate the name of any maker or model or any maker\u2019s number or other mark of identification on any pistol or revolver. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a firearm or electronic defense weapon when he possesses a firearm or electronic defense weapon and has been convicted of a capital felony, a class A felony, except a conviction under section 53a-196a, a class B felony, except a conviction under section 53a-86, 53a-122 or 53a-196b, a class C felony, except a conviction under section 53a-87, 53a-152 or 53a-153, or a class D felony under sections 53a-60 to 53a-60c, inclusive, 53a-72a, 53a-72b, 53a-95, 53a-103, 53a-103a, 53a-114, 53a-136 or 53a-216. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-30 (b) \u201cthe Office of Adult Probation may require that the defendant comply with any or all conditions which the court may have imposed under subsection (a) which are not inconsistent with any condition actually imposed by the court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>19 Conn.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>948 F.2d 325 (7th Cir. 1991), in determining, in part III, that a defendant has no right of allocution in a probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">The right of allocution affords a criminal defendant the opportunity to address the court on his own behalf prior to sentencing. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Behrens, </em>375 U.S. 162, 165, 84 S. Ct. 295, 11 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1963). \u201cIt is designed to temper punishment with mercy in appropriate cases, and to ensure that sentencing reflects individualized circumstances.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>De Alba Pagan, </em>33 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 1994). \u201cAs early as 1689, it was recognized that the court\u2019s failure to ask the defendant if he had anything to say before sentence was imposed required reversal.\u201d <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U.S. 301, 304, 81 S. Ct. 653, 5 L. Ed. 2d 670 (1961), citing <em>Anonymous, </em>3 Mod. 265, 266, 87 Eng. Rep. 175 (KB. 1689).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The broad language in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>172 Conn. 458, 474, 374 A.2d 1107 (1977), that the right of allocution in some jurisdictions is a \u201ctechnical formality\u201d and is of \u201clittle importance in modem criminal procedure\u201d is misleading. In fact, the right of allocution \u201cremains deeply embedded in our criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>De Alba Pagan, </em>supra, 33 F.3d 129; see Practice Book \u00a7 919 (3);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> F .R.

Ed. 2d 221 (1992) (holding that allocution is right guaranteed by due process clause of constitution). In <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 365 U.S. 304, for example, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he most persuasive counsel may not be able to speak for a defendant as the defendant might, with halting eloquence, speak for himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The majority is correct that Practice Book \u00a7 943 does not expressly provide a defendant the right of allocution at a probation revocation hearing. The majority also relies on <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 948 F.2d 325. Barnes was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and distribution of cocaine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The District Court sentenced Barnes to three years imprisonment, to be followed by a five year term of special parole for distributing cocaine, but suspended imposition of sentencing for his conspiracy conviction, and placed Barnes on a five year period of probation. After Barnes violated the terms of his release, the District Court conducted a probation revocation hearing at which the court sentenced Barnes to five years imprisonment on the conspiracy count. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing because the District Court denied Barnes his right of allocution.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The Court of Appeals distinguished cases in which sentence has been imposed, but its execution suspended, from cases where the defendant is convicted but imposition of the sentence is postponed. The important distinction is that in the latter cases the scope of punishment is not preordained.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">I write separately to highlight a different approach adopted by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and offer the First Circuit\u2019s approach for consideration in lieu of that of <em>Barnes. </em>In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>847 F.2d 991 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1015, 109 S. Ct. 808, 102 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1989), the defendant, Buckley, pleaded guilty to one of two drug charges against him. The court accepted Buckley\u2019s plea and continued the case so that a presentence investigation report could be prepared. At the initial sentencing hearing, after giving Buckley an opportunity to address the court, the court imposed a provisional five year sentence and committed him for observation pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205 (c) and (d). At the hearing on the final imposition of sentence, the court denied Buckley an opportunity to address the court. The court reasoned that Buckley had his right of allocution at the provisional sentencing hearing, and, thus, no such right existed at the final sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The First Circuit Court of Appeals acknowledged that the District Court had denied Buckley his right of allocution. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the right of allocution arises when a defendant <em>is,finally </em>sentenced. Thus, the denial of Buckley\u2019s right of allocution at the final sentencing could not be cured by what transpired at the prior provisional sentencing. The Court of Appeals remanded for resentencing in accordance with rule 32 (a) (1) (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, stating that \u201c[t]he rule mandates precisely what it appears to mandate: a personal inquiry directed to the defendant himself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>supra, 847 F.2d 1002, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>712 F.2d 952, 956 (5th Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Ultimately, both cases turn on the fact that the scope of punishment is not preordained at the time allocution is requested. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>supra, 948 F.2d 329; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>supra, 847 F.2d 1002. In Connecticut, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf [a] violation [of probation or conditional discharge] is established, the court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. . . .\u201d Section 53a-32 (b) bestows on the trial court broad discretion in deciding whether to revoke probation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>March, </em>39 Conn. App. 267, 278, 664 A.2d 1157, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 930, 667 A.2d 801 (1995). As a result, the sentence imposed following a violation of probation or conditional discharge is not preordained.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Although <em>Buckley </em>is a federal provisional sentencing case, I would adopt the First Circuit\u2019s analysis. Even though the defendant was afforded his right of allocution when he was provisionally sentenced, that right should be extended at his final sentencing. The burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>on the trial court, in allowing a defendant a right of allocution at a probation revocation hearing, is outweighed by concerns of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b809-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 919 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(3) The judicial authority shall allow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to make a personal statement in his or her own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of the sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\"> Rule 32 (a) (1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part that \u201c[b]efore imposing sentence, the court shall also . . . address the defendant personally and [determine if the defendant] wishes to malte a statement . . . and to present any information in mitigation [of the sentence].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
