F. Construction, Inc., to open a default entered on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and a judgment of nonsuit rendered on the complaint. The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by opening the default and nonsuit and that it lacked authority to open the default and the nonsuit because the plaintiff failed to file affidavits in support of its motion to open within the four month period set forth by General Statutes \u00a7 52-212<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 377.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The underlying action from which this appeal arises is based on the plaintiffs allegation that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>breached a contract to perform excavation work on the plaintiffs property. The defendant denied the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint and, in a counterclaim, alleged that it performed the work required under the contract but has not been paid. On May 10, 1994, the trial court rendered a judgment of nonsuit against the plaintiff for failure to enter an appearance after its original counsel had withdrawn his appearance. On June 28, 1994, the trial court rendered a default against the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim for failure to appear for a pretrial conference. The court did not render judgment on the default. On September 1, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the default and the judgment of nonsuit. The plaintiff did not file the necessary affidavits until October 13, 1994, more than four months after the trial court rendered judgment. On November 22, 1994, the trial court granted the motion to open. The defendant appeals from the granting of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Before we address the questions presented by the plaintiff, we must address three jurisdictional issues. The first question is whether the fact that a judgment was not rendered on the counterclaim affects this court\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). \u201cThe first alternative, termination of a separate and distinct proceeding, requires the order being appealed to be severable from the central cause to which it is related so that the main action can \u2018proceed independent of the ancillary proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 307, 488 A.2d 778 (1985). \u201cThis means that the \u2018separate and distinct proceeding,\u2019 though related to the central cause, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>severable therefrom. The question to be asked is whether the main action could proceed independent of the ancillary proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>194 Conn. 650, 654, 485 A.2d 139 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u201cUnder our rules of practice, a counterclaim, if proper, is an independent action. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 116, 168, 169; <em>Hanson Development Co. </em>v. <em>East Great Plains Shopping Center, Inc., </em>195 Conn. 60, 63, 485 A.2d 1296 (1985); see also <em>Schurman </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>188 Conn. 268, 270, 449 A.2d 169 (1982). <em>Home Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>195 Conn. 333, 341, 487 A.2d 1095 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Union Carbide Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>212 Conn. 311, 318, 562 A.2d 15 (1989); <em>see Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Plymouth Commons Realty Corp., </em>229 Conn. 634, 641, 642 A.2d 1194 (1994). In this case, the complaint and the counterclaim are entirely independent and severable, and, as such, the first prong of <em>Curdo </em>is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The next jurisdictional question is whether the lack of a judgment on the counterclaim deprives us of jurisdiction to determine whether the motion to open the default on the counterclaim was properly granted. Ornease law clearly states that a default standing alone without a judgment concludes no one\u2019s rights and is not a final judgment. <em>Automotive Twins, Inc. </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>138 Conn. 28, 33, 82 A.2d 146 (1951); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Oxenhandler, </em>30 Conn. App. 541, 549, 621 A.2d 300 (1993); <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Willametz, </em>9 Conn. App. 565, 574, 520 A.2d 621 (1987). Therefore, we dismiss that part of the defendant\u2019s appeal that concerns whether the trial court properly granted the motion to open the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Finally, we address the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to open a judgment of nonsuit is an appealable final judgment. \u201c[I]t is well established that an order opening a judgment ordinarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>is not a final judgment within [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-263. . . . [Our Supreme Court], however, has recognized an exception to this rule where the appeal \u2018challenges the power of the court to act to set aside the judgment.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>179 Conn. 415, 418, 426 A.2d 1324 (1980); 4 Am. Jur. 2d, Appeal and Error \u00a7 126.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>212 Conn. 741, 746-47, 562 A.2d 524 (1989). In this case, the defendant argues that the trial court lacked the authority to open the judgment of nonsuit. In keeping with the holdings of <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Keiser, </em>supra, 746-47, and <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costle, </em>supra, 418, we address the defendant\u2019s appeal to the extent that it questions the authority of the trial court to open the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The defendant claims that the trial court lacked the authority to open the judgment because the plaintiff failed to file affidavits in support of its motion to open within the four month period required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 and Practice Book \u00a7 377.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff argues that it filed the motion to open judgment in a timely manner, even though the affidavits required by the statute and rules of practice were filed more than four months after the judgment of nonsuit. The plaintiff contends that the affidavits served the puipose of the provisions of the statute and rules of practice and, therefore, are sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201c \u2018Unless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, any civil judgment . . . rendered in the superior court may not be opened . . . unless a motion to open ... is filed within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a; Practice Book \u00a7 326. Unless the parties waive this time limitation, the trial court lacks jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>entertain a motion to open filed more than four months after a decision is rendered.\u201d <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 518, 494 A.2d 549 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The plaintiff did not file the necessary affidavits with the motion to open the nonsuit in a timely manner. Therefore, the motion was not proper, and the trial court was without jurisdiction to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The appeal is dismissed as to the challenge to the trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to open the default on the counterclaim; the order granting the motion to open the judgment of nonsuit is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to deny the motion to open the judgment of nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any judgment rendered or decree passed upon a default or nonsuit in the superior court may be set aside, within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed, and the case reinstated on the docket, on such terms in respect to costs as the court deems reasonable, upon the complaint or written motion of any party or person prejudiced thereby, showing reasonable cause, or that a good cause of action or defense in whole or in part existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment or passage of the decree, and that the plaintiff or defendant was prevented by mistake, accident or other reasonable cause from prosecuting the action or making the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">\u201c(b) The complaint or written motion shall be verified by the oath of the complainant or his attorney, <em>shall state </em>in general terms the nature of the claim or defense and shall particularly set forth the reason why the plaintiff or defendant failed to appear. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\"> Practice Book \u00a7 377 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny judgment rendered or decree passed upon a default or nonsuit may be set aside within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed ....
