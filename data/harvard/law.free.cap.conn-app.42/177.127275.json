J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXW\">At the joint request of the parties, the trial court granted a motion for reservation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to have this court resolve questions concerning the construction and application of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175\u00cd.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The parties stipulated to the facts that follow. The defendant issued Leroy Jordan a personal automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>insurance policy with a policy period running from 12:01 a.m., August 25, 1989, through 12:01 a.m., November 25, 1989. On or about October 23, 1989, a renewal offer was mailed to Jordan. Jordan renewed his policy for an additional three month period, extending coverage from 12:01 a.m., November 25,1989, through 12:01 a.m., February 25, 1990. On January 22, 1990, the defendant mailed a renewal offer to Jordan. Jordan did not renew his policy, and on February 26, 1990, the defendant mailed a notice of expiration by regular mail to Jordan. The reason given for the termination was the failure of Jordan to tender the premium for another three month policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On February 27, 1990, the plaintiff, while a passenger in an automobile driven by Jordan, was injured in an accident and sustained a cervical fracture. As of that date, the plaintiff did not own an automobile and had neither automobile insurance nor health insurance of her own. By letter dated March 19, 1991, the plaintiff advised the defendant of her injuries. By letter dated March 26,1991, the defendant advised the plaintiff that it would not honor her claims for damages because Jordan\u2019s policy had not been renewed. The plaintiff brought a civil action against Jordan in the Superior Court. On October 1, 1991, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $325,000. The judgment against Jordan remains entirely unsatisfied. In the present action, the plaintiff seeks damages from the defendant pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She claims that Jordan\u2019s policy was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>effect on the date of the accident because the defendant failed to send, via certified or registered mail, notice of cancellation at least ten days prior to termination and that, therefore, she is entitled to recover under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The questions reserved to this court are (1) did the provisions of \u00a7 38-175\u00cd require the defendant to send Jordan a cancellation notice in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175h,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) was Jordan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>policy in force on February 27, 1990? We answer both of the questions reserved in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The resolution of these questions requires an analysis of the various statutes that govern cancellation, renewal and nonrenewal of insurance policies and that provide the methods by which insurers must notify their insureds in case of such an event, as well as an analysis of which of these statutes apply to the circumstances of this case. The first subsidiary question to be resolved is whether we are involved with a renewal or a cancellation of an insurance policy. If the defendant cancelled the policy, notice should have been given in accordance with \u00a7 38-175h, but if the defendant gave notice to renew the policy, then such notice should have been given in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-185w.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Cancellation of an automobile liability insurance policy is carefully regulated by General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7\u00a7 38-175\u00cd through 38-175/. Pursuant to \u00a7 38-175f, \u201cany policy with a policy period or term of less than six months shall, for the purpose of sections 38-175\u00cd to 38- 175/, inclusive, be considered as if written for a policy period or term of six months . . . .\u201d Cancellation of a policy during the policy period due to nonpayment of the premium requires specific notice sent by registered or certified mail or by mail evidenced by a certificate of mailing at least ten days before the effective date of cancellation. General Statutes \u00a7 38-175K Subsection (b) of \u00a7 38-175h provides: \u201cThis section shall not apply to nonrenewal.\u201d The procedures for renewal and nonrenewal are set forth in General Statutes (Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to 1989) \u00a7 38-185w<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and require insurers that refuse to renew a policy to send notice of their intention not to renew, via certified or registered mail or mail evidenced by a certificate of mailing, at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the policy period. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 38-185w requires an insurer to mail or deliver a premium billing notice to its insured not less than thirty days in advance of the policy\u2019s renewal date when an insurer offers to renew a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The determinative issue in this reservation is whether an automobile liability insurance policy issued for a policy period of less than six months is, by virtue of the statutory provision set forth in \u00a7 38-175f, to be \u201cconsidered as if written for a policy period or term of six months,\u201d and, therefore, is not subject to cancellation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>during the six month policy period except for the reasons and by the mandated procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 38-175f through 38-175Z. The defendant claims that at no time was it required to mail a cancellation notice in accordance with \u00a7 38-175h because it never cancelled or attempted to cancel Jordan\u2019s insurance policy. Instead, the defendant claims that it attempted to renew Jordan\u2019s insurance policy pursuant to \u00a7 38-185w (b) by mailing a renewal offer more than thirty days in advance of the policy\u2019s renewal date and that Jordan failed to renew the policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The provision set forth in \u00a7 38-175f is clear and unambiguous. It simply provides that if a policy is issued for a policy period or term of less than six months, the policy period is nonetheless deemed, as a matter of law, to be a six month policy. It is well established that \u201c[t]he meaning to be given a statute is determined by legislative intent and that legislative intent must be determined by language actually used in the legislation.\u201d <em>Eason </em>v. <em>Welfare Commissioner, </em>171 Conn. 630, 634, 370 A.2d 1082 (1976), cert. denied, 432 U.S. 907, 97 S. Ct. 2953, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1079 (1977). When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The definition of renewal in \u00a7 38-175f precludes renewal prior to the expiration of a six month policy period and, by that definition, makes cancellation the only means of terminating an auto insurance policy prior to the expiration of six months of coverage. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>MFA Mutual Ins. Co., </em>334 So. 2d 402 (La. 1976); <em>Conover v.Dairyland Ins. Co., </em>200 Neb. 715, 265 N.W.2d 222 (1978); contra <em>Kates </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Auto Ins. Co., </em>45 Cal. App. 4th 494, 52 Cal. Rptr. 852 (1996). The defendant asks this court to ignore the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>definition of a renewal of a motor vehicle liability policy provided in \u00a7 38-175f, and to rely instead on the provisions of \u00a7 38-185w governing the renewal of all types of property and casualty insurance. However, \u201c[i]t is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 417, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Section 38-175\u00cd specifically deals with motor vehicle insurance policies issued for less than six months and that statute must control. On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that \u00a7 38-175\u00cd required the defendant to tender notice of cancellation to Jordan in accordance with \u00a7 38-175h if it wanted to terminate coverage prior to the expiration of the statutory six month policy period as a result of Jordan\u2019s failure to pay a renewal or continuation premium. Moreover, the defendant\u2019s failure to tender the requisite notice prevented the subject insurance policy from expiring on February 25, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The defendant argues, in the alternative, that even if \u00a7 38-175\u00cd converts the defendant\u2019s three month automobile liability policy to a six month policy for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 38-175\u00cd through 38-175Z, it still was not required to send Jordan notice of cancellation because the original three month policy plus the three month renewal policy, created a policy of six months duration which expired on February 25,1990, due to Jordan\u2019s failure to pay the required renewal or continuation premium. We disagree and conclude that the defendant issued Jordan two separate and distinct three month policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The declarations page of Jordan\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy reveals that the defendant designated the policy period or term as a three month period from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>August 25,1989, through November 25,1989. The declarations page also reveals that Jordan paid a \u201ctotal full term premium\u201d of $157. Moreover, the original policy expressly provided that \u201c[t]his policy will automatically terminate at the end of the current policy period.\u201d We therefore conclude that Jordan\u2019s renewal of his original policy was a separate and distinct contract providing coverage for a policy period or term of three months. See <em>Back </em>v. <em>Peoples National Fire Ins. Co., </em>97 Conn. 336, 344, 116 A. 603 (1922); <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Everlith, </em>22 Conn. Sup. 377, 379, 173 A.2d 601 (1961); <em>Small Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dugay, </em>4 Conn. Cir. Ct. 710, 712, 239 A.2d 553 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The legislature has decided that insurance policies issued for less than six months are to be treated as six month policies and that if an insurer wants to terminate coverage under the policy prior to the expiration of six months, then it must comply with the cancellation procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 38-175\u00cd through 38-175/. This legislative framework, which protects those to whom short term policies are issued, means that unless a policy is cancelled in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 38-175f to 38-175/,, the lapse date of such a policy is the end of the statutory term, here six months, rather than the actual policy term, here three months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislature\u2019s will is simply that short term policies are to be governed by the more arduous notice provisions requiring specific notice sent by registered or certified mail or evidenced by a certificate of mailing at least ten days before the effective date of cancellation and that termination of policies of six months or more duration, upon the natural expiration of the term, are subject to the simpler procedural requirements of nonrenewal set forth in \u00a7 38-185w. Because the defendant sought to terminate coverage under the policy prior to the expiration of the policy\u2019s statutorily imposed six month term, compli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>anee with the cancellation procedures set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 38-175f through 38-175\u00cd is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">To the reserved question\u2014Did the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175\u00cd require Northland Insurance Company to send its insured Leroy Jordan a cancellation notice, in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175h, regarding policy number PA0025821, which was effective from August 25, 1989, through November 25,1989, and renewed from November 25, 1989, through February 25, 1990, when Jordan failed to renew said policy prior to February 25, 1990, in response to a timely premium billing notice mailed by Northland Insurance Company on January 22, 1990, in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-185w (b)\u2014our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">To the reserved question\u2014Was policy number PA0025821 issued by Northland Insurance Company to Leroy Jordan on August 25, 1989, and renewed by Jordan for renewal period of November 25, 1989, through February 25, 1990, in force on February 27, 1990\u2014our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4147 provides in relevant part: \u201cA reservation shall be taken ... to the appellate court from those cases in which an appeal could have been taken directly ... to the appellate court . . . had judgment been rendered. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u201cAll questions presented for advice shall be specific and shall be phrased so as to require a Yes or No answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u201cThe court will not entertain a reservation for its advice upon questions of law arising in any action unless the question or questions presented are . . . reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case, and it appears that their present determination would be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-11\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 38-175\u00cd, now \u00a7 38a-341, provides in relevant part: \u201cCancellation of motor vehicle liability policy: Definitions.
