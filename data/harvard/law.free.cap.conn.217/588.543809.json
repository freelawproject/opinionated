Their goal was frustrated, however, when the Clinton board of selectmen (board), acting pursuant to a town ordinance regulating building lines in Clinton waterways, denied permission for the expansion. Port Clinton sought relief in the Superior Court. In its final form, their challenge to the board\u2019s decision alleged, inter alia, an illegal \u201ctaking\u201d under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and violations of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (predicated upon the unconstitutional taking). The trial court dismissed these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it concluded that the board\u2019s action would not be \u201cfinal\u201d enough to give rise to a taking unless Port Clinton first pursued and lost an administrative appeal. In this appeal, we must decide whether the administrative decision at issue was sufficiently \u201cfinal\u201d to allow the trial court to consider the merits of Port Clinton\u2019s claims. We do not agree with the trial court that Port Clinton was required to pursue a statutory appeal before bringing its \u00a7 1983 claim, but conclude that in this case Port Clinton did not allege sufficient \u201cfinality\u201d to support either its taking or its \u00a7 1983 claim. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Since this case is about procedure, a review of its procedural history is appropriate. The following facts are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>not in dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to 1985, Port Clinton owned and operated a seventy-two slip marina. The marina was composed of three piers, each extending approximately two hundred feet into the Hammonassett River near the elbow where the Hammonassett and Indian Rivers flow into Clinton Harbor. In early 1985, Port Clinton applied to the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps), which is responsible for regulating navigable waters of the United States; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, </em>480 U.S. 700,107 S. Ct. 1487, 94 L. Ed. 2d 704 (1987); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 (\u00a7 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899); 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.1 et seq.; for permission to extend two of the marina's piers by approximately two hundred fifty feet, thereby adding fifty-seven boat slips to the marina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Port Clinton sought a similar permit from the Connecticut department of environmental protection (DEP), which has concurrent jurisdiction with the Army Corps over waters within Connecticut boundaries. 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 322.1; <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>188 U.S. 410, 430, 23 S. Ct. 472, 47 L. Ed. 525 (1903). The DEP granted the permit, which by its terms was subject to the possible existence of local ordinances or regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Army Corps denied the permit application because Port Clinton had not obtained local approval.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>After the Army Corps denied its permit application, Port Clinton applied to the board of selectmen for local permission, pursuant to \u201cAn Ordinance Establishing Building Lines in Certain Clinton Waterways.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>town had enacted the ordinance \u201c[pjursuant to Section 7-147 of the Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ordinance required anyone planning construction that would extend beyond the established building lines (approximately one hundred feet off shore) to seek permission from the board. Pursuant to the ordinance, the board referred the application to the Clinton harbor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>commission, which held a public hearing and then recommended denial of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The board issued a memorandum of decision denying Port Clinton\u2019s application. In its decision, the board first noted the purposes and standards set forth in the ordinance, \u201c \u2018conserving and preserving\u2019 the water resources of Clinton Harbor and other waterways.\u201d It then refused permission on the basis of \u201cevidence indicat[ing] that the proposed expansion would have a negative impact on safety, both in the harbor and on shore and that it could cause harm to the environmental quality of the harbor and its water resources. Both the expansion of the docking facilities further out into the harbor and the resulting increase in the intensity of onshore activities could lead to further crowding, congestion, and pollution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Port Clinton did not resubmit a revised application. Instead, pursuant to \u00a7 7-147, it filed an administrative appeal in the manner prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 8-8,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that the ordinance itself con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>stituted an unconstitutional taking and was preempted by state regulation. In the course of the ensuing procedural skirmishes, Port Clinton added counts charging, inter alia, that: (1) both \u00a7 7-147 and the ordinance were unconstitutionally vague; (2) the ordinance was invalid because it was improperly adopted, exceeded the town\u2019s geographical jurisdiction, and was preempted by and conflicted with various statutes; and (3) the board\u2019s decision constituted an unconstitutional taking and therefore violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In its final version, Port Clinton\u2019s revised amended complaint contained these counts and eliminated the administrative appeal.* *******<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In the interim between the filing of the original complaint and rendition of the judgment of dismissal, a trial court in an unrelated case, <em>Bottone </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV87-0085097 (January 12, 1988), found \u00a7 7-147 to be unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The legislature then amended the statute, effective June 3,1988, thereby repealing the statutory authority for the ordinance. See Public Acts 1988, No. 88-327. The town therefore repealed its ordinance effective November 14, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Port Clinton filed a motion for summary judgment on September 9,1988, which the trial court denied on April 27, 1989. In its decision, the court appeared to reject the taking and \u00a7 1983 claims as a matter of law, but it left for trial the question of the ordinance\u2019s validity in light of the factual dispute over the town\u2019s geographical jurisdiction. Thereafter, on August 2,1989, the board filed its own motion for summary judgment. Instead of ruling on that motion, the court, in a decision dated January 31, 1990, dismissed the case suo motu for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because (1) the challenges to the ordinance and statute were moot, and (2) the other claims were predicated upon a \u201ctaking\u201d by an agency decision that would not be \u201cfinal\u201d until the statutory appeal process, which Port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Clinton had originally commenced but later abandoned, was complete. On appeal, Port Clinton appears to challenge only the trial court\u2019s second conclusion by stating the issue to be: \u201cWhether the plaintiff\u2019s abandonment of an administrative appeal in favor of a direct challenge to the validity of a harbor building lines ordinance and its enabling statutory authority, together with claims for a \u2018taking\u2019 in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or inverse condemnation, deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear or determine the \u2018taking\u2019 claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The cornerstone of Port Clinton\u2019s complaint is its taking claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result of the board\u2019s refusal to grant Port Clinton permission to build, it was unable, in 1986, to add the planned fifty-seven boat slips to its dock. That claimed injury would seem to have terminated on November 23,1989, when the ordinance was repealed. Port Clinton claims, nevertheless, that, because the Army Corps of Engineers changed its own permit requirements in the intervening four years, Port Clinton may no longer build the number of boat slips originally planned. If it had received permission from the town or not been required to seek it in 1986, the boat slips would have been built before the federal rule change and the marina expansion would not have been affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">To evaluate these claims, we must first understand what \u201cproperty\u201d Port Clinton claims has been taken.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Port Clinton owns land abutting navigable waters, specifically, the Hammonassett River. According to Connecticut common law, ownership of such land, termed \u201cupland,\u201d extends to the high water mark on the shore. <em>Lam </em>v. <em>Harbor Commissioners, </em>70 Conn. 685, 694, 40 A. 1058 (1898). In addition, the owner of upland has certain rights to use the land between high and low water mark and the waters extending therefrom to the point where they become navigable. See <em>Shorehaven Golf Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>146 Conn. 619, 624,153 A.2d 444 (1959). These rights are termed \u201criparian rights.\u201d Riparian rights derive from ownership of the upland from which the waters extend; <em>Shorefront Park Improvement Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>King, </em>157 Conn. 249, 257-58, 253 A.2d 29 (1968); but maybe separately alienated. <em>Shorehaven Golf Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Knowles-Lombard Co., </em>122 Conn. 263, 265, 188 A. 275 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Although riparian rights are in fact \u201cproperty\u201d; <em>Shorehaven Golf Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra; <em>Simons </em>v. <em>French, </em>25 Conn. 346, 353 (1856); rather than simply \u201crights\u201d that constitute elements of ownership; see <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, </em>480 U.S. 470, 497, 107 S. Ct. 1232, 94 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1987); they are so limited by superior public rights that they are often referred to as a mere \u201cfranchise.\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Hemingway, </em>7 Conn. 186, 202 (1828). Thus, \u201c[a] riparian proprietor whose land is bounded by a navigable stream has certain rights, as such, among which, in the language of Mr. Justice Miller, are \u2018access to the navigable part of the river from the front of his lot, the right to make a landing, wharf or pier for his own use or for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>of the public, subject to such general rules and regulations as the legislature may see proper to impose for the protection of the rights of the public, whatever those rights may be.\u2019 <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Milwaukee, </em>[77 U.S. (10 Wall.) 497, 504 [1870].\u201d <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co. </em>v. <em>Long, </em>72 Conn. 10, 21, 43 A. 559 (1899); accord <em>Walz </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>95 Conn. 537, 542, 111 A. 834 (1920); <em>Orange </em>v. <em>Resnick, </em>94 Conn. 573, 578, 109 A. 864 (1920); <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Harbor Commissioners, </em>supra, 694; <em>Farist Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>60 Conn. 278, 283, 22 A. 561 (1891); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>45 Conn. 358, 373 (1877). The owner of riparian rights, like Port Clinton, has the right to build a pier or wharf past the low water mark \u201c \u2018subject to the qualification that he thereby does no injury to the free navigation of the water by the public.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prior </em>v. <em>Swartz, </em>62 Conn. 132, 138, 25 A. 398 (1892), quoting <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>40 Conn. 382, 395 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">It is undisputed that Port Clinton has already built docks into the water off its upland. Port Clinton therefore has already made some use of its riparian property or rights but not to its outer limit, namely, the navigable channel. See <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Harbor Commissioners, </em>supra.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the property allegedly \u201ctaken\u201d can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>no more than the right to extend an existing dock as far as the federal channel if public regulations protecting free navigation so permit and if the public\u2019s right to free navigation will not be impeded thereby. See <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>179 U.S. 141, 163, 21 S. Ct. 48, 45 L. Ed. 126 (1900); cf. <em>United, States </em>v. <em>Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co., </em>229 U.S. 53, 70, 33 S. Ct. 667, 57 L. Ed. 1063 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The trial court, presented with Port Clinton\u2019s claim that a portion of its limited riparian rights had been taken by an unconstitutional and invalid ordinance in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, dismissed the complaint suo motu for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Port Clinton contends that the trial court improperly relied upon the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies in dismissing the taking and \u00a7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">While we agree with Port Clinton that federal law prevents us from applying the exhaustion doctrine to a \u00a7 1983 claim; <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982); we do not agree that the trial court ultimately reached its decision on the basis of that doctrine. Rather, we read the memorandum of decision as later amplified<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> to rely on the well established principle that there can be no regulatory \u201ctaking,\u201d and thus no deprivation of \u201cprivate property without just compensation,\u201d until there has been a final administrative decision. See <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 192, 105 S. Ct. 3108, 87 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The reason for the \u201cfinality\u201d principle is set forth in <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>Yolo County, 477 </em>U.S. 340,106 S. Ct. 2561, 91 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1986). \u201cThe regulatory taking claim advanced by appellant has two components. First, appellant must establish that the regulation has in substance \u2018taken\u2019 his property\u2014that is, that the regulation \u2018goes too far.\u2019 . . . Second, appellant must demonstrate that any proffered compensation is not\u2018just.\u2019 . . . It follows from the nature of a regulatory taking claim that an essential prerequisite to its assertion is a final and authoritative determination of the type and intensity of development legally permitted on the subject property. A court cannot determine whether a regulation has gone \u2018too far\u2019 unless it knows how far the regulation goes. . . . Until a property owner has \u2018obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property,\u2019 \u2018it is impossible to tell whether the land retain[s] any reasonable beneficial use or whether [existing] expectation interests ha[ve] been destroyed.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Finality is required when the claim is made that a valid regulation has gone \u201ctoo far.\u201d In this case, however, Port Clinton has charged that the regulation <em>itself </em>was invalid and therefore that its \u201cadoption and application\u201d to Port Clinton caused a temporary taking without regard to the extent of loss caused. When the regulation itself is not a \u201cvalid\u201d exercise of the police power, United States Supreme Court precedents imply that no matter how \u201cfar\u201d it goes, the regulation may constitute a taking. See <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104,127, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 2d 631, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 883, 99 S. Ct. 226, 58 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1978); <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 592-93, 82 S. Ct. 987, 8 L. Ed. 2d 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>(1962); <em>Nectow </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>277 U.S. 183, 188, 48 S. Ct. 447, 72 L. Ed. 842 (1928); cf. <em>Corthouts </em>v. <em>Newington, 140 </em>Conn. 284, 99 A.2d 112 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We conclude, however, that Port Clinton was nevertheless required to satisfy the \u201cfinality\u201d requirement in the sense of showing that \u201cthe initial decision-maker [had] arrived at a definitive position on the issue that infliet[ed] an actual, concrete injury . . . .\u201d <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, 193.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">We reach this conclusion for two reasons. First, Port Clinton sought not only invalidation of the regulation,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but compensation for its injury. Until a trial court knows \u201chow far the regulation goes\u201d it cannot determine the extent of the injury, or, indeed, be certain that there is any injury not de minimis in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">More importantly, in contending that the ordinance itself constituted a \u201cper se\u201d taking, Port Clinton did not charge that the ordinance furthered an improper purpose, but rather attacked its lack of specificity, its jurisdictional basis and the method by which it was enacted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We do not believe that the constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>requires compensation for any temporary infringement of an owner\u2019s property rights, no matter how slight, every time a town makes a mistake in construing an enabling statute or in measuring its geographical boundaries. \u201cTemporary harms in [this category] are an unfortunate but necessary by-product of disputes over the extent of the government\u2019s power to inflict permanent harms without paying for them. Every time a property owner is successful, in whole or in part, in a challenge to a governmental regulation\u2014whether it be a zoning ordinance, a health regulation or a traffic law\u2014he is almost certain to suffer some temporary harm in the process. At the least, he will usually incur significant litigation expenses and frequently he will incur substantial revenue losses because the use of his property has been temporarily curtailed while the dispute is being resolved.\u201d <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, 204 (Stevens, J., concurring). The suggestion in <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>and <em>Goldhlatt </em>that when a regulation is invalid as exceeding the police power, any restriction it imposes on the exercise of property rights may constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d should not apply to a case where the only invalidity claimed is procedural and the confiscation claimed is less than total.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Similarly, finality is required even when the claimant does not allege that the challenged regulation deprives him of all reasonable use of the property and constitutes a \u201cpractical confiscation\u201d; <em>see MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>Yolo County, </em>supra, 349; <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 43 S. Ct. 158, 67 L. Ed. 322 (1922); but rather alleges that the \u201cinterference with appellants\u2019 property is of such a magnitude that \u2018there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain [it].\u2019 \u201d <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>supra, 136; see <em>also Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. </em>v. <em>DeBenedictis, </em>supra. The latter test, often applied to regulatory takings; see, e.g., <em>Chevron Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>170 Conn. 146, 151, 365 A.2d 387 (1976); <em>Brecciaroli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>168 Conn. 349, 355-56, 362 A.2d 948 (1975); see generally C. Rose, <em>\u201cMahon </em>Reconstructed: Why the Takings Issue is Still a Muddle,\u201d 57 S. Cal. L. Rev. 561 (1984); permits a property owner to claim a partial taking if the public\u2019s gain does not outweigh his loss.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Finality is a prerequisite to such a \u201cpartial taking\u201d claim just as it is a prerequisite to a \u201ctemporary taking\u201d claim. In each case, without a final administrative decision, the reviewing court cannot measure the extent of the injury to the property owner\u2019s interests and can neither decide whether a taking has occurred nor calculate the measure of damages. A secondary consideration, of course, is the possibility that pursuit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>a final administrative resolution will produce a mutually acceptable solution \u201cthereby obviating any need to address the constitutional questions.\u201d <em>Hodel </em>v. <em>Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Assn., </em>452 U.S. 264, 297, 101 S. Ct. 2352, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1981); cf. <em>Tenoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Affairs, </em>876 F.2d 1013, 1026-27 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">If a property owner has not obtained a final decision from the administrative agency applying the regulation, the reviewing court lacks jurisdiction to rule on a taking claim. The jurisdictional nature of finality derives from its similarity to \u201cripeness.\u201d See <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, 185. Thus, the remaining question before us is whether the trial court correctly decided that the board of selectmen\u2019s decision was not a \u201cfinal\u201d decision and thus that the court lacked jurisdiction over the taking claim and the claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In its memorandum of decision on Port Clinton\u2019s motion to vacate or set aside the judgment, the trial court explained its conclusion that lack of finality deprived it of jurisdiction as follows. \u201cThe statutory appeal procedure provided a plain and adequate legal remedy, whereby the plaintiffs could have sought to establish the issues of finality and confiscation, as precedents to seeking just compensation. When the plaintiffs withdrew such appeal, they deprived the court of jurisdiction to consider these issues, and rendered the court without power to address the issue of just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">In finding a lack of finality, the trial court reached the right conclusion, but for the wrong reason. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Williamson County </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, explained what kind of \u201cfinality\u201d is a prerequisite to a \u00a7 1983 claim predicated upon a taking. \u201cThe difference [between the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, and the finality requirement] is best illustrated by comparing the procedure for seeking a variance with the procedures that, under <em>Patsy </em>[v. <em>Board of Regents], </em>respondent would not be required to exhaust. While it appears that the State provides procedures by which an aggrieved property owner may seek a declaratory judgment regarding the validity of zoning and planning actions taken by county authorities . . . respondent would not be required to resort to those procedures before bringing its \u00a7 1983 action, <em>because those procedures clearly are remedial. </em>Similarly, respondent would not be required to appeal the Commission\u2019s rejection of the preliminary plat to the Board of Zoning Appeals, because the Board was empowered, at most, to review that rejection, not to participate in the Commission\u2019s decisionmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">\u201cResort to those procedures would result in a judgment whether the Commission\u2019s actions violated any of respondent\u2019s rights. In contrast, resort to the procedure for obtaining variances would result in a conclusive determination by the Commission whether it would allow respondent to develop the subdivision in the manner respondent proposed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 193. The court added: \u201cIf the government has provided an adequate process for obtaining compensation, and if resort to that process \u2018yield[s] just compensation,\u2019 then the property owner \u2018has no claim against the Government\u2019 for a taking. . . . [I]f a State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just compensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedure and been denied compensation.\u201d Id., 194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Thus, a property owner need not pursue <em>remedial </em>procedures that merely review the propriety of the initial decisionmaker\u2019s action. A property owner must, however, pursue all available procedures that could result in a decision favorable to some reasonable use of the property. In addition, a property owner must pursue any procedure whereby it can obtain <em>compensation </em>for the impact of the regulation upon his use of his property. Precisely what procedures a given property owner must pursue depends upon the specific regulation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, the property owner submitted a subdivision proposal to the local zoning commission. The commission thereafter changed its density requirements so that the original proposal, which had not yet been acted upon, was no longer in conformity with the regulations. The commission denied several revised plans submitted by the developer. The developer then pursued appeals to the county board of zoning appeals, but did not seek variances from the zoning commission. It also did not avail itself of applicable inverse condemnation procedures and did not argue that these procedures were unavailable or inadequate. The United States Supreme Court concluded that in order to show finality, the developer should have (a) sought variances from the zoning commission, and (b) utilized the inverse condemnation procedures available. Id., 193-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The regulation at issue in the present case, by contrast, is not a zoning regulation. In Connecticut, if a property owner\u2019s plans do not comply with zoning regulations, the owner can seek to bypass certain requirements by obtaining a variance, or, when applicable, by obtaining an exception to permit it to use the property in a manner generally prohibited by the regulations but permitted upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Variances and exceptions in Connecticut are generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>granted not by the zoning commission, but by the zoning board of appeals. General Statutes \u00a7 8-6. Thus, in many instances, a final decision by the \u201cinitial decision-maker,\u201d really means a decision by the zoning board of appeals, when that body is not acting in a reviewing capacity but is exercising its power to grant variances and exceptions. See <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 115 A.2d 328 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">By contrast, Port Clinton had no \u201cdecisionmaker\u201d other than the board of selectmen itself from which it could have obtained a more favorable result. In 1985, General Statutes \u00a7 7-147 provided only that a property owner aggrieved by a decision based on a town harbor line ordinance could pursue an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8. That statute, however, provides for an administrative appeal to the <em>Superior Court, </em>which may review the propriety of the initial decisionmaker\u2019s action within the usual limits on judicial review of an agency action. The statutory appeals process under \u00a7 8-8 is, thus, precisely the type of procedure that a claimant under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 need <em>not </em>pursue as a prerequisite to filing his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Nevertheless, the trial court was correct in holding that Port Clinton failed to demonstrate the finality required. Port Clinton indisputably submitted only <em>one </em>proposal to the board of selectmen. We cannot know whether the board would also have rejected a more modest plan. Although we do not believe \u201cthat repeated applications and denials are necessary to pinpoint\u201d the board\u2019s position; <em>MacDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>Yolo County, </em>supra, 359 (White, J., dissenting); nor that a property owner must \u201ctake patently fruitless measures\u201d; id.; in most cases, a property owner must do more than submit one plan to an agency in order to establish that the agency\u2019s decision is \u201cfinal\u201d for the purposes of the taking clause. See, e.g., id. (owner filed one application to subdivide property into 159 lots); <em>Wil</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>liamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra (developer submitted two plats for subdivision); <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego, </em>450 U.S. 621,101 S. Ct. 1287, 67 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1981) (company abandoned original plan for nuclear power plant and never submitted for approval new plan for industrial park after city adopted \u201copen space\u201d plan); <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>supra (company submitted only two proposed plans for building skyscraper atop Grand Central railway terminal); <em>Luf v. Southbury, </em>188 Conn. 336, 351, 449 A.2d 1001 (1982) (owner seeking damages to his property value due to lawful discontinuance of an unimproved public highway could not show a taking because \u201cwe cannot predict what response the plaintiffs would encounter if they were to present subdivision proposals of their own to the appropriate Southbury authorities\u201d); <em>Brecciaroli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>168 Conn. 349, 357, 362 A.2d 948 (1975) (plaintiff submitted only one application for a permit to conduct an activity on wetlands); <em>Shorehaven Golf Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>supra, 625 (owner submitted only one application for the designation of a specific channel from which to excavate gravel).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Port Clinton made no attempt whatever to seek a favorable result on another proposal. \u201cAppellant is thus in the same position Mr. and Mrs. Agins would have occupied if they had requested and been denied the opportunity to build five Victorian mansions for their single-family residences, or if San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. had asked and been denied the option of building a nuclear power plant. Rejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans does not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive similarly unfavorable reviews.\u201d <em>McDonald, Sommer &amp; Frates </em>v. <em>Yolo County, </em>supra, 353 n.9 (referring to <em>Agins </em>v. <em>Tiburon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>447 U.S. 255,100 S. Ct. 2138, 65 L.

One of the reasons the board gave for denying the proposal was to protect the safety of the harbor from crowding and congestion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is not implausible to conclude that the board might have approved a somewhat less \u201cgran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>diose\u201d proposal\u2014the sort of proposal that, unlike the original proposal, would meet revised Army Corps regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\"><em>In Hamilton Bank, </em>the United States Supreme Court implicitly approved the respondent\u2019s contention that \u201cthere is no requirement that a plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Florida Board of Regents, </em>[supra].\u201d <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission </em>v. <em>Hamilton Bank, </em>supra, 192. <em>Hamilton Bank </em>applied that proposition only to a \u00a7 1983 claim that was based on an alleged taking, not to a pure taking claim, i.e., one brought without reference to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">While we have used similar reasoning in addressing a pure taking claim; see <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>supra; we need not decide whether one making such a claim is never required to pursue procedures that provide review of the legality of an initial decision but cannot themselves result in a decision allowing an owner some reasonable use of his property or award just compensation for deprivation of reasonable use of the property. For the same reasons given above, whether or not Port Clinton would be required to exhaust the statutory appeals process before presenting its pure taking claim outside the \u00a7 1983 context, we conclude that the trial court had no jurisdiction to consider the taking claim until Port Clinton obtained a final decision from the board of selectmen as to the amount of expansion it would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">\n<em>(See Appendix on following page.)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"pABO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-7\"> Port Clinton Associates owns the land and the marina built onto the land that are the subject of this appeal.

Given that Port Clinton\u2019s riparian rights are by definition subject to regulation protecting the public\u2019s superior right to navigation, the ordinance, whether or not it was preempted by state regulation, could not take from Port Clinton something it did not already have: an absolute right to build a dock as far as the navigable channel. See <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>179 U.S. 141, 163, 21 S. Ct. 48, 45 L. Ed. 126 (1900) (total deprivation of a riparian owner\u2019s right of access to navigable water was not a taking where the deprivation occurred when the federal government built a pier to improve public navigability); see also <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Harbor Commissioners, </em>70 Conn. 685, 694, 40 A. 1058 (1898) (revocation of a harbor commission permit to extend a wharf was not a taking when a new channel brought navigable water to the edge of the existing wharf). Certainly Port Clinton could not demonstrate that it was deprived of all reasonable use of its \u201cproperty,\u201d that is, its riparian rights; it was already exercising those rights, presumably at a profit. \u201c[T]he submission that appellants may establish a \u2018taking\u2019 simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest they heretofore had believed was available for development is quite simply untenable.\u201d <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 130, 98 S. Ct. 2646, 57 L. Ed. 631, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 883, 99 S. Ct. 226, 58 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1978); see <em>Manor Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 692, 433 A.2d 999 (1980) (commission\u2019s denial of proposal for thirty-three lot subdivision and acceptance of twenty-six lot subdivision did not constitute a taking); see also <em>Samp Mortar Lake Co. </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 310, 314-15, 231 A.2d 649 (1967) (zone change preventing developer from expanding existing nonconforming industrial uses did not constitute a taking).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
