J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN\">These two appeals arise out of ongoing litigation between two brothers, Roger S. Dunham (Roger) and Carl M. Dunham, Jr. (Carl), concerning their conflicting claims to real property originally acquired by their father. In <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 312-15, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987) <em>(Dunham I), </em>we concluded that Roger, the plaintiff in that lawsuit, had failed to establish any contractual right to certain property known as Candlelight Farms Airport, which his father had acquired and had willed to his mother, and his mother had subsequently deeded to Carl by inter vivos transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>After the publication of our decision in <em>Dunham I, </em>the trial court, at Carl\u2019s behest, issued a permanent injunction to preclude Roger from any further trespasses on the airport property. The first appeal, Docket No. 13997, challenges the validity of the trial court\u2019s order imposing sanctions on Roger because of his willful contempt of this permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Carl also filed an independent supplemental action seeking to recover, inter alia, damages attributable to Roger\u2019s wrongful use of the airport property. In response to that action, Roger filed a counterclaim alleging that Carl had acquired the Candlelight Farms Airport property in breach of his fiduciary duty to Roger. To secure his counterclaim, Roger filed a notice of lis pendens on the airport property. The second appeal, Docket No. 14108, challenges the validity of the trial court\u2019s order discharging Roger\u2019s notice of lis pen-dens as invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Although both appeals were originally filed in the Appellate Court, we transferred them to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4024. We affirm the judgment in the first appeal and dismiss the second appeal for lack of a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Docket No. 13997</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">On April 29,1986, pending this court\u2019s resolution of <em>Dunham I, </em>the trial court, <em>Kline, J., </em>had issued an order temporarily enjoining Roger from entering upon Candlelight Farms Airport and temporarily enjoining Carl from leasing or permitting anyone else to use the airport property. Subsequent to the publication of <em>Dun-ham I </em>affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling that Roger had no contractual claim to the airport property, the trial court, <em>Pickett, J., </em>on December 14,1987, ordered the temporary injunction against Carl to be dissolved and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the temporary injunction against Roger to be made permanent, \u201csubject to the condition that he shall remove any and all personal property, but make no other use of the realty, on or before December 30, 1987, upon penalty of $500.00 per day.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Carl filed a motion for contempt on August 18,1989, alleging that, on numerous dates subsequent to the issuance of the permanent injunction on December 14, 1987, Roger had trespassed upon the airport in numerous ways, including dumping of garbage, conducting an airport business, and making recreational use of a pond on the property. The contempt motion asked the court to fine Roger and to award Carl attorney\u2019s fees and compensatory damages. After a two day hearing concluding on October 30, 1989, the trial court, <em>Pick</em>ett, /., found Roger in contempt and committed him to the custody of the commissioner of correction for thirty days, and ordered him to produce subpoenaed material for Carl\u2019s counsel by December 6, 1989. At a subsequent hearing, Roger stipulated that, in violation of the December 14, 1987 injunction, he had entered the airport property for 165 days. On the basis of this stipulation, the court, on February 26, 1990, ordered Roger to pay Carl a \u201c$49,500.00 fine, plus $10,000 attorney\u2019s fee and $485.70 costs.\u201d Apart from an appeal for clemency, Roger voiced no contemporaneous objection to the substance of this order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>In his appeal to this court, Roger now claims that the trial court\u2019s judgment must be set aside because the court lacked the authority: (1) to order him to pay a fine of $49,500 to Carl without making an express evidentiary finding that Carl suffered damages in that amount; or (2) to order his incarceration and the production of allegedly incriminatory documents. In response, Carl maintains that these issues are not properly before us because they were not distinctly raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The record bears out Carl\u2019s contention that Roger did not contest the validity of either of the civil contempt orders* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at the time that they were issued by the trial court on any of the grounds on which he now seeks review. After the judgment, the only motion filed by Roger was a motion to stay the contempt order pending resolution of the present appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He never otherwise challenged any of the trial court\u2019s rulings, by filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>a motion either in arrest of judgment or to set the order aside. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 320, 326. In these circumstances, as in <em>Dunham I, </em>supra, 310-12, since the trial court was never afforded the opportunity to correct any possible errors in its rulings, we review Roger\u2019s claims only insofar as they may constitute plain error. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In determining the appropriate scope of plain error review after an uncontested finding of civil contempt, we must take into account the limited scope of review that attends even a plenary appeal from a judgment of civil contempt. In any appeal from a civil contempt order, \u201cour review is technically limited to \u2018questions of jurisdiction such as whether the court had authority to impose the punishment inflicted and whether the act or acts for which the penalty was imposed could constitute a contempt.\u2019 . . . This limitation originates because by its very nature the court\u2019s contempt power, \u2018to be effectual, must be immediate and peremptory, and not subject to suspension at the mere will of the offender.\u2019 ... On the other hand, the trial court\u2019s need for immediate and effective contempt power must be balanced against the contemnor\u2019s fundamental rights and, for this reason, there exists the present mechanism for the eventual review of errors which allegedly infringe on these rights. , . .We have found a civil contempt to be improper or erroneous because: the injunction on which it was based was vague and indefinite . . . the findings on which it was based were ambiguous and irreconcilable . . . the contemnor\u2019s constitutional rights were not properly safeguarded . . . the penalties imposed were criminal rather than civil in nature . . . and the contemnor, through no fault of his own, was unable to obey the court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Papa </em>v. <em>New Haven Federation of Teachers, </em>186 Conn. 725, 731-32, 444 A.2d 196 (1982). Although <em>Papa </em>recognizes that plenary review of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>contempt orders extends to some issues that are not truly jurisdictional, its emphasis on fundamental rights underscores the proposition that the grounds for any appeal from a contempt order are more restricted than would be the case in an ordinary plenary appeal from a civil judgment. See <em>Friedlander </em>v. <em>Friedlander, </em>191 Conn. 81, 84, 463 A.2d 587 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The rights that Roger claims have been infringed by the fine stipulated in the contempt order cannot fairly be characterized as fundamental rights. It bears emphasis that Roger does not challenge: the validity of the permanent injunction; his willful contempt of the injunction; his ability to obey the injunction; or the authority of the court to order the payment of a fine to Carl in some appropriate amount. He challenges only the amount of the monetary sanction imposed, which, he asserts, was wrongful because: as a matter of law, the court fixed the amount of the fine without considering the damages sustained by Carl; and as a matter of fact, the court lacked an evidentiary foundation to link the amount of the fine with the damages sustained by Carl. On the present record, we are unpersuaded that the trial court\u2019s order so impaired a fundamental right as to constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">With respect to Roger\u2019s claim of law, the record of the trial court\u2019s appraisal of Roger\u2019s conduct at the end of the evidentiary hearing held on October 30, 1989, undermines the proposition that the court misconceived the role of a coercive fine. On that occasion, the court stated: \u201cThere is no question in the Court\u2019s mind but that Mr. [Roger] Dunham has been guilty of willful violation of the Court\u2019s injunction and done so open and notoriously without claim of right. Accordingly, you are placed in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections . . . for a period of thirty days. The Court will continue the matter until December 11,1989, for further hearing on the monetary penalties which must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>more documented based upon the evidence that I have heard, fifty thousand dollars or more based on five hundred dollars a day. . . . [T]he evidence is not such that the Court can determine as to whether or not some of these lessons were not given more than once on the same day which would reduce the amount. Therefore, I cannot total them all up at this point. But, [Roger] is ordered to produce those documents on or before December 6, 1989, to [Carl\u2019s] counsel for his use and examination for further hearing, at which time the Court will determine the monetary penalties to be imposed.\u201d The \u201clessons\u201d to which the court referred were flying lessons that Roger had given from the airport, in violation of the injunction. On a theory of unjust enrichment, the income thus generated to Roger would be a cognizable element of Carl\u2019s damages. Having focused on the need for an evidentiary foundation for an assessment of monetary penalties in October, the court was not likely to have imposed such penalties on an entirely different basis in February. Thus, it was not plain error for the court to fix the amount of the fine as it did without further articulating its recognition of the need for an evidentiary basis therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The only remaining issue, therefore, with regard to the monetary fine imposed on Roger, is whether the trial court plainly erred in assessing the amount of the fine at a level that was so lacking in evidentiary foundation as to impair a fundamental right. As the stipulation that Roger violated the permanent injunction on 165 days demonstrates, this is not a case in which the party injured by the contemnor has failed to prove that he suffered any damages whatsoever. Carl\u2019s efforts to quantify the damages attributable to Roger\u2019s willful and continued misconduct were, as the trial court recognized, impaired by the inadequacy of Roger\u2019s records and the lacunae in Roger\u2019s recollection of the extent of his trespasses. It is not unreasonable to assume, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ever, that if Roger had challenged the calculation of his fine at the time of its assessment, Carl would have persisted in further questioning to establish his damages more precisely. Given the extent of Roger\u2019s contumacious conduct, and the fact that the injunction itself warned him of the substantial economic risk that such conduct entailed, the trial court\u2019s fixing of a fine approximating damages was not plain error. \u201cThat damages may be difficult to assess is, in itself, insufficient reason for refusing them once the right to damages has been established.\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Nationwide Moving &amp; Storage Co., </em>187 Conn. 405, 420, 446 A.2d 799 (1982); <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Pardy Construction Co., </em>108 Conn. 549, 551, 143 A. 855 (1928); <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, </em>2 Conn. App. 715, 727, 484 A.2d 239 (1984), appeal after remand, 9 Conn. App. 299, 518 A.2d 667 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 806, 520 A.2d 1286 (1987); see also <em>Tufano </em>v. <em>Tufano, </em>18 Conn. App. 119, 123-25, 556 A.2d 1036 (1989) (contempt order awarded $500 payments to grandparents as compensation for missed opportunities for visitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">There is even less merit in Roger\u2019s belated effort to invoke a constitutional justification for his refusal to respond to a subpoena that was valid on its face.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Just as the privilege against self-incrimination does not provide an automatic defense to a grand jury summons; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 518, 498 A.2d 76 (1985); so it does not provide an automatic defense to a subpoena. In civil actions, the privilege against self-incrimination is not self-executing but must be expressly invoked at the time that allegedly incriminatory evidence is sought to be compelled or introduced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Garner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>424 U.S. 648, 655, 96 S. Ct. 1178, 47 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1976); <em>Communist Party </em>v. <em>Subversive Activities Control Board, </em>367 U.S. 1, 107, 81 S. Ct. 1357, 6 L. Ed. 2d 625 (1961); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Handbook of Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 12.2.4, p. 424; C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In summary, in appeal Docket No. 13997, Roger has failed to demonstrate plain error in any aspect of the sanctions imposed by the trial court for his repeated and willful violations of the permanent injunction forbidding his trespassing on the airport property owned by Carl. Even in criminal appeals invoking the common law doctrine of plain error codified in Practice Book \u00a7 4185, \u201c[bjelated appellate scrutiny is warranted only for egregious errors that undermine the fairness of a trial and cast doubt on the integrity of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 485, 556 A.2d 154 (1989). In the circumstances of this case, we are unpersuaded that the sanctions imposed on Roger manifest the deprivation of such a fundamental right or of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The judgment in Docket No. 13997 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Docket No. 14108</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The substantive issue in the second appeal is the interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 52-325 with respect to the time constraints it imposes on a defendant\u2019s recordation of a notice of lis pendens. In response to Carl\u2019s supplemental action for damages, for an accounting, and for equitable relief, seeking further remedies to secure his rights to the Candlelight Farms Airport and other property, Roger, as defendant, timely filed an answer, a special defense, and a counterclaim alleging an equitable interest in the real property. Almost nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>months later, Roger filed and recorded a notice of lis pendens to secure his counterclaim. As \u00a7 52-325 (a) provides, the purpose of such a notice is to bind any subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer \u201cas if he were made a party to the action\u201d described in the lis pen-dens. \u201c[A] notice of lis pendens ensures that the [litigant\u2019s] claim cannot be defeated by a prejudgment transfer of the property. . . . [T]he lis pendens procedure provides security for payment of the claim pending final resolution of the case.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 479-80, 457 A.2d 290, appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The trial court granted Carl\u2019s motion to discharge Roger\u2019s lis pendens. The motion alleged that the lis pen-dens had never become effective because, in violation of \u00a7 52-325 (a), the notice had not been filed \u201cat the time the answer is filed.\u201d Granting the motion to discharge on March 22, 1990, the court ordered: \u201cThe notice of Lis Pendens filed by Roger Dunham, the Defendant herein, through his attorney, Timothy Brignole, on or about March 12, 1990, is invalid and discharged, and the same does not constitute constructive notice.\u201d At trial, Roger contested Carl\u2019s construction of the time constraints contained in \u00a7 52-325 (a), and on appeal he renews his claim that the trial court should not have discharged his lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Before proceeding to the merits of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we must decide whether the discharge of a lis pendens on the ground of an alleged procedural default is a final judgment. \u201c[T]he right to appeal is purely statutory and is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute are met. <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Local 1566, </em>200 Conn. 91, 95, 510 A.2d 177 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 provides that in proceedings before the Superior Court, \u2018if either party is aggrieved by the decision of the court or judge upon any question or questions of law arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>in the trial ... he may appeal to the court having jurisdiction from the final judgment. . . .\u2019 See also Practice Book \u00a7 3000.\u201d <em>Durso </em>v. <em>Misiorek, </em>200 Conn. 656, 660, 512 A.2d 917 (1986). For a lis pendens, whose validity now depends entirely on statutory fiat, what constitutes a final judgment depends upon the text of the governing statutes. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-325 through 52-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The governing statutes contemplate that a property owner burdened by a notice of lis pendens may rightfully challenge its validity on two independent grounds: (1) the absence of probable cause to sustain the lis pen-dens claim; or (2) noncompliance with the procedural requirements of an effective lis pendens notice. The legislature provided a separate set of statutory provisions to deal differently with the issues raised by these disparate challenges to a lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">When a property owner challenges the existence of probable cause for the validity of the lis pendens claim, resolution of this application for discharge is governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-325a, 52-325b and 52-325c.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 52-325a prescribes the required content of an application for discharge grounded on an alleged lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>of probable cause. Section 52-325b describes the requisite hearing to be held on a \u00a7 52-325a application, if probable cause is contested, and assigns the burden of proof on this issue to the lis pendens claimant. Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>tion (b) of \u00a7 52-325b empowers the trial court, having resolved the probable cause issue, either to deny the application for discharge or to order the notice of lis pen-dens discharged. To complete the scenario, \u00a7 52-325c (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>then provides that \u201c[a]ny order entered as provided in subsection (b) of section 52-325b shall be deemed a final judgment for the purpose of appeal.\u201d Other subsections of \u00a7 52-325c: require an appeal to be taken within seven days; provide for a hearing upon an application for a stay, supported by a surety bond, once a timely appeal has been taken; and authorize recordation of an order discharging a notice of lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">When, however, a property owner files a motion for discharge alleging an invalid notice of lis pendens, resolution of this motion is governed in its entirety by General Statutes \u00a7 52-325d.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 52-325d provides relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>if the recorded notice of lis pendens: \u201c(1) . . . is not intended to affect real property, or (2) . . . does not contain the information required by subsection (a) of section 52-325 or section 46b-80 . . . or (3) . . . was not [served] in accordance with statutory requirements, or (4) . . . for any other reason . . . never became effective or has become of no effect . . . .\u201d Upon a judicial finding that the notice of lis pendens \u201cnever became effective or has become of no effect,\u201d the court is empowered to issue its order \u201cdeclaring that such notice of lis pendens is invalid and discharged.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-325d. A certified copy of the order of discharge \u201cmay be recorded in the land records . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-325d.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Although the provisions of \u00a7 52-325d parallel those of \u00a7\u00a7 52-325a, 52-325b and 52-325c in many salient respects, the statutory patterns differ conspicuously with respect to the immediate appealability of orders discharging or validating a notice of lis pendens. Section 52-325d is entirely silent on this matter, while \u00a7 52-325c expressly contemplates an immediate appeal for contested findings of probable cause, albeit an appeal permitted only within narrowly defined time constraints. The inference to be drawn is that \u00a7 52-325d orders, unlike \u00a7 52-325b orders, are not final judgments. The legislature\u2019s contrasting treatment of what constitutes a final judgment is particularly telling because all four sections were enacted contemporaneously as part of Public Acts 1981, No. 81-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The present proceedings for discharge of Roger\u2019s notice of lis pendens were unquestionably brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-325d. Carl alleged that the notice was ineffective because it was filed in violation of \u00a7 52-325 (a). Although the trial court\u2019s order of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>charge found only that Roger\u2019s notice was \u201cinvalid and discharged,\u201d probable cause was never an issue before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">In these circumstances, we conclude that Roger\u2019s appeal from an order discharging his notice of lis pen-dens under \u00a7 52-325d must be dismissed because this order, interlocutory on its face pending the resolution of the underlying litigation, is not a final judgment. To characterize the trial court\u2019s \u00a7 52-325d order as other than interlocutory would render the legislative enactment of \u00a7 52-325c superfluous, and indeed would arguably permit a common law appeal outside of the seven-day period limitation prescribed therein. As in <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 42, 45-46, 434 A.2d 310 (1980), involving the immediate appealability of disputes about statutory prejudgment remedies, we are bound to give effect to legislatively prescribed distinctions in the rights and remedies that accompany various, challenges to nonconsensual liens upon real property. <em>Rawlings. New Haven, </em>206 Conn. 100, 112, 537 A.2d 439 (1988); <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 763, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The appeal in Docket No. 14108 is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In this opinion Callahan and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"> At the same time that he moved for the issuance of this permanent injunction order, Carl also filed a motion for contempt against Roger, alleging that Roger had violated the temporary injunction by continuing to use the airport.

It is not unreasonable to assume, however, that if Roger had challenged the calculation of his fine at the time of its assessment, Carl would have persisted in fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ther questioning to establish his damages more precisely.
