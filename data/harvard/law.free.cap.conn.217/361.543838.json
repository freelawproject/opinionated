The defendant, Joseph E. Sakai, P.C., is a law firm that performed legal services related to a 100 acre parcel of land in Seymour owned by the plaintiff, Nickel Mine Brook Associates, a general partnership. These services, which were provided between February, 1986, and January, 1990, involved zoning, land planning and related matters.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s bill for the services rendered was $62,195. The defendant timely filed a mechanic\u2019s lien against the plaintiff\u2019s parcel of land to secure payment for the services that had been provided. The plaintiff filed an application to discharge or reduce the lien pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>granted the application, concluding that \u00a7 49-33 was not intended to protect claims by attorneys. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We now affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Section 49-33 (a) provides that \u201c[i]f any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for materials furnished or services rendered in the construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances or <em>in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land . . . </em>the building ... or the lot or . . . the plot of land, is subject to the payment of the claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The dispositive issue in this case is whether the legislature intended to include attorneys performing services for clients in connection with the rezoning of land and related real estate matters among the persons entitled to file mechanic\u2019s liens when it expanded the scope of \u00a7 49-33 in 1974 by adding the phrase \u201cor in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u201d See Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The defendant contends that the legal services it performed for the plaintiff constitute services rendered in the improvement, the site development, and the subdivision of the property, as these terms are used in \u00a7 49-33 (a). It claims that because the statute does not exclude attorneys from the class of persons entitled to file mechanic\u2019s liens, the services it provided fall within the purview of the statute when it is interpreted liberally. The plaintiff asserts that the trial court properly ruled that the defendant could not file a mechanic\u2019s lien because the 1974 amendment was not intended to expand the scope of \u00a7 49-33 (a) to include persons whose services do not enhance the property in some physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>manner or lay the groundwork for the physical enhancement of the property. We agree that the 1974 amendment to \u00a7 49-33 does not extend the benefits of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to the defendant, but our interpretation of the amended statute does not require us to address whether the services rendered must always be connected to some physical enhancement of the property in order to fall within the scope of \u00a7 49-33 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The starting point in any case involving a question of statutory construction must be the language used by the legislature. <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324,332, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987); <em>Verdona. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366,446 A.2d 3 (1982). \u201c \u2018Where the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court . . . .\u2019 <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 544, 550, 436 A.2d 266 (1980). Under our rules of statutory construction, this court is to be guided by the language, purpose and legislative history of the statute in question.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 405, 528 A.2d 805 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The guidelines for interpreting mechanic\u2019s lien legislation are well established. Although the mechanic\u2019s lien statute creates a statutory right in derogation of the common law; <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>180 Conn. 545, 550, 429 A.2d 796 (1980); <em>Gruss </em>v. <em>Miskinis, </em>130 Conn. 367, 370, 34 A.2d 600 (1943); its provisions should be liberally construed in order to implement its remedial purpose of furnishing security for one who provides services or materials. <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981); <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108,115, 438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>A.2d 834 (1981). Our interpretation, however, may not depart from reasonable compliance with the specific terms of the statute under the guise of a liberal construction. <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, 551; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>141 Conn. 188,191,104 A.2d 545 (1954). Finally, \u201cthe provisions of our statute differ sufficiently from the mechanic\u2019s lien legislation of other states so that precedents elsewhere are of limited utility in the interpretation of our act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra; <em>New Haven Orphan Asylum </em>v. <em>Haqqerty Co., </em>108 Conn. 232, 236, 142 A. 847 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">This court has previously examined the effect of the 1974 amendment to \u00a7 49-33 (a). In <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, we considered whether a contractor\u2019s work in road building and site preparation was lienable under \u00a7 49-33 prior to the 1974 amendment. We concluded that the contractor was not entitled to file a mechanic\u2019s lien because \u201ccases construing the language of [\u00a7 49-33 prior to the 1974 amendment] have required, as a condition of lienability, that the work done be incorporated in or utilized in the building (or the appurtenance) to be constructed, raised, removed or repaired.\u201d Id., 552. We concluded that one of the purposes of the 1974 amendment was to eliminate this requirement that the work be incorporated or utilized in a building or appurtenance. Id., 553-54. Finally, we noted that \u201c[although the legislative history of the amended \u00a7 49-33 is, as is often true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>somewhat murky, it is consistent with an intention to expand the coverage of the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">As a threshold matter, we note that the language of the 1974 amendment appears to have extended the coverage of \u00a7 49-33 to two <em>distinct </em>types of services: (1) services rendered in the improvement of any lot; and (2) services rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land. Although the defendant claims that the services it provided fall within both of these categories, it relies upon this apparent distinction in arguing that we must interpret these categories separately in determining what types of services fall within the purview of \u00a7 49-33 (a). Our review of the legislative history leads us to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The original version of Senate Bill No. 275, which became Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, extended the scope of \u00a7 49-33 (a) only to services rendered \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>site development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u201d The language referring to \u201cthe improvement of any lot\u201d was adopted as House Amendment A. Conn. House Journal, May 1, 1974, pp. 1086-87; 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10,1974 Sess., pp. 4970-73. The legislative history indicates that the purpose of this amendment to Senate Bill No. 275 was not to create a distinct category of services for which one could file a mechanic\u2019s lien, but rather to avoid potential problems for title searchers by restricting the ability of one who provides services for only a single lot to file a mechanic\u2019s lien against an entire subdivision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10,1974 Sess., pp. 4970-71. We conclude that the phrase \u201cimprovement of any lot\u201d was intended to include the same types of services embraced by the phrase \u201csite development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u201d The only distinction intended by the legislature was between services benefiting particular lots and those benefiting the subdivision as a whole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>In determining what types of services the legislature intended to include when it used the terms \u201cimprovement,\u201d \u201csite development\u201d and \u201csubdivision,\u201d \u201c \u2018[t]he title of legislation when it is acted upon by the legislature is significant and often a valuable aid to construction . . . .\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>166 Conn. 189,194, 348 A.2d 584 (1974).\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>supra. The title of Senate Bill No. 275 was \u201cAn Act Concerning <em>Mechanic\u2019s </em>Liens on Land Being Improved or Subdivided.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A \u201cmechanic\u201d is normally envisioned as a skilled worker who brings about a result by the use of tools, machines or equipment. See Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged Ed.). Moreover, there is a distinct difference between legal services and the types of services that we previously have indicated fall within the scope of \u00a7 49-33 (a). See, e.g., <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>supra, 553-54 (suggesting in dicta that road construction and grading of a building site are within the scope of \u00a7 49-33 after the 1974 amendment); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>supra, 192 (installation of permanent fixtures); <em>Marchetti </em>v. <em>Sleeper, </em>100 Conn. 339, 342-43,123 A. 845 (1924) (preparation of architectural plans actually used in the construction of a building); <em>Batch </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>73 Conn. 318, 320-21, 47 A. 327 (1900) (construction of a well). Although this distinction is not conclusive in this case, it provides some evidence of the types of services for which one may file a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Further, the legislative history provides no support for the defendant\u2019s claim that the legal services it provided were intended to be included within the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>\u201csite development or subdivision\u201d of the property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is no reference in the legislative history to attorneys, nor is there any evidence that the legislature intended to expand the scope of the mechanic\u2019s lien statute to include any type of legal services. Although the legislative history does not define clearly the scope of the 1974 amendment, references therein to surveyors and engineers who draft subdivision plans provide some evidence of the types of services that might be embraced by the amendment. 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., pp. 4970-71, 4977-79.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These references <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>comport more with what one could accept as an expanded definition of a \u201cmechanic.\u201d Given the distinct difference between the nature of services provided by lawyers, on the one hand, and surveyors and engineers on the other, we conclude that the 1974 amendment was not intended to allow the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens by attorneys providing assistance in zoning and other matters related to real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The defendant also claims that its services resulted in an \u201cimprovement\u201d of the land because the change in zoning enhanced the value of the land.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It contends that within the context of \u00a7 49-33, \u201cimprovement\u201d means anything that increases the value of the land. Once again, however, neither the language of the 1974 amendment nor its legislative history indicates that the legislature intended to create such an open-ended test for which services are lienable under \u00a7 49-33 (a). We also note that, to the best of our knowledge, no state has allowed an attorney to file a mechanic\u2019s lien for legal services. We therefore decline to adopt so broad an interpretation of our mechanic\u2019s lien statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Our conclusion is further supported by a practical construction of the statute. \u201c '[G]eneral words and phrases may be restricted in meaning to adapt their meaning to the subject-matter in reference to which they are used.\u2019 <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>89 Conn. 583, 588, 94 Atl. 984 [1915].\u201d <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>129 Conn. 211, 222, 27 A.2d 166 (1942). \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979). Interpreting the 1974 amendment as having expanded the scope of \u00a7 49-33 (a) to include legal services could lead to the filing of mechanic\u2019s liens by a wide range of parties who provide services to land developers, such as insurance agents, real estate agents who are instrumental in the purchase of land and advise as to its potential uses, and financial advisers such as bankers and accountants. Although as a general matter our mechanic\u2019s lien statute must be liberally construed; <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>supra, 553; we refuse to adopt an interpretation of \u00a7 49-33 (a) that could lead to such a fundamental change in our mechanic\u2019s lien statute absent clear evidence that the legislature intended such a far reaching result.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1973) \u00a7 49-33, as amended by Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, provides in pertinent part: \u201cmechanic\u2019s lien, precedence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>BIGHTS OF subcontractors, (a) If any person has a claim for more than ten dollars for materials furnished or services rendered in the construction, raising, removal or repairs of any building or any of its appurtenances <em>or in the improvement of any lot or in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, </em>and the claim is by virtue of an agreement with or by consent of the owner of the land upon which the building is being erected or has been erected or has been moved, <em>or by consent of the owner of the lot being improved or by consent of the owner of the plot of land being improved or subdivided, </em>or of some person having authority from or rightfully acting for the owner in procuring the labor or materials, the building, with the land on which it stands <em>or the lot or in the event that the materials were furnished or services were rendered in the site development or subdivision of any plot of land, then the plot of land, </em>is subject to the payment of the claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\"> The services provided by the defendant included the following: (1) preparing and presenting zoning applications to the town of Seymour zoning commission in order to change the zoning designation of portions of the land; (2) representing the plaintiff in discussions with the town engineer and the town planner; (3) obtaining and renewing a permit authorizing the plaintiff to operate a quarry on the site; and (4) appearing before inland wetlands and zoning agencies for subdivision of the portion of the land zoned residential. The plaintiff sought the zoning change in conjunction with its unsuccessful effort to sell or lease a portion of the land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a provides in pertinent part: \u201capplication for REDUCTION OR DISCHARGE.

In <em>Sooner Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Mobley, </em>645 P.2d 1000, 1003-1004 (Okla. 1981), an attorney who secured the marital home for the husband in a divorce proceeding was unsuccessful in claiming that he was entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien for his services. This case provides little guidance, however, because it involved a different type of legal service than that in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\"> After reviewing the legislative history, we stated that \u201cPublic Acts 1974, No. 74-310 expanded the scope of General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 to include the terms \u2018the improvement of any lot\u2019 and \u2018the site development or subdivision of any plot of land.\u2019 It is the first of these additions, \u2018the improvement of any lot,\u2019 that is at issue in the present case. In commenting on an amendment to the bill, which was subsequently enacted as Public Acts 1974, No. 74-310, the reporting committee chairman in the House of Representatives stated: \u2018We still have an extension of the mechanic\u2019s lien even though we don\u2019t have an extension of the time to file it. You can file it against the property or sub-division whereas heretofore you could only file it against the house that was being worked on, the building.\u2019 And again, in response to the question, \u2018Does he contend that it\u2019s the amendment that extends the applicability of the land or is it the bill itself . . .\u2019 the reporting committee chairman, Representative Newman responded: \u2018The bill, of course, sir.\u2019 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1974 Sess., pp. 4138, 4140. Compare the comments of the reporting committee chairman in the Senate, Senator Rome, who stated: \u2018The bill now as amended would provide that sub-dividers of land, persons who might also be doing site work on the land would have lien rights. The question is, under the existing court adjudications, whether or not that (sic) have or have not those rights. This clearly spells it out. They do . . . .\u2019 17 S.

Brown, Jr., the sponsor of House Amendment A to Senate Bill No. 275, stated that the amendment \u201crestricts the filing of the mechanic\u2019s lien by a contractor. A contractor, such as a surveyor, can file such a lien against the lot of the subdivision on which he has rendered services or furnished materials. Under the bill as it appears in the files the contractor could file his lien against any or all lots of the subdivision. This power of the contractor could cause problems for people doing title search. A title search could show no lien when in fact a lien does exist against the lot being sold. The amendment allows title searchers to request waivers of any lien from the contractors working on the lot being sold. Under the bill in the file the title searcher must receive waivers from any contractor working on any and all the lots of the subdivision.\u201d 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., pp. 4970-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Representative Carl R. Ajello, added that \u201c[s]ome of us were concerned that you could have an entire subdivision land [sic] and placed in default on its mortgage and otherwise interfere with its credit standing by virtue of the default of someone who was taking only a minuscule part in the building of one project within the subdivision.

Kablik asked the following question concerning the effect of the language in Senate Bill No. 275 referring to the \u201csubdivision\u201d of a plot of land: \u201c[A]t what point does this ability to lien commence. For instance, if the developer is in the process of preparing preliminary drawings on the subdivision . . . then he goes and makes his application but for one reason or another it\u2019s either turned down, or let\u2019s say it\u2019s turned down, his work, for instance, that was done from the time of application to the time of turn down . . . <em>for instance, an engineer who had designed the entire thing. </em>Would he then have a lien on the entire parcel even if the subdivision didn\u2019t occur?\u201d (Emphasis added.) 17 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1974 Sess., pp. 4977-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Representative Hoyte G. Brown, Jr., responded: \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion, yes. I want to double check that though.\u201d Id., p. 4978. There is no indication in the legislative history that Representative Brown later reached a different conclusion on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Although we note that the legislative history of Senate Bill No. 275 appears to indicate that, at least in certain circumstances, surveyors and engineers may file mechanic\u2019s liens, we do not address the nature of these circumstances. See <em>Sisk </em>v. <em>Zukowski, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 346699 (June 29,1988); see generally annot., 87 A.L.R.2d 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The plaintiff argues that General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 (a) should be interpreted as including only those services which physically enhance the property or which lay the groundwork for physical enhancement.

When the issue becomes ripe for deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sion in the framework of an actual controversy, we will have ample opportunity to determine the relationship between a physical enhancement test and the legislative history indicating that surveyors and engineers might have been intended to be eligible to file a mechanic\u2019s lien under the statute as amended in 1974.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> Although there is no evidence in the record concerning whether the zoning change actually did increase the value of the land, we will assume that it did for the purposes of our discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
