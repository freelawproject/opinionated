The plaintiff, Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover), filed suit against the named defendant, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s), and the Thomas Minogue Agency (Minogue),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeking reimbursement for moneys it had paid on a fire loss suffered by its insured, Anthony\u2019s Auto Body, Inc. (Anthony\u2019s). The complaint alleged that Fireman\u2019s had bound insurance coverage on Anthony\u2019s prior to the date of the fire loss, and that this insurance coverage obligated Fireman\u2019s to reimburse Hanover for part of the loss. Fireman\u2019s denied coverage and raised a special defense that Hanover\u2019s suit was time barred under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-97 and 38-98.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court rendered judgment, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>trial, in favor of Fireman\u2019s. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023, we transferred Hanover\u2019s appeal to this court and now affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision reveals the following facts. Hanover had issued a fire insurance policy covering Anthony\u2019s for the period from March 28,1982, to March 28,1983. On January 7,1983, Hanover notified Anthony\u2019s of the cancellation of this policy effective February 7, 1983. Later that month, Anthony\u2019s contacted a licensed insurance agent affiliated with Minogue in an effort to obtain replacement insurance. Through Minogue, Anthony\u2019s was able to obtain an oral binder from Fireman\u2019s, which Minogue confirmed with a written memorandum dated January 31, 1983. On February 2, 1983, however, the agent who had given the oral binder for Fireman\u2019s discovered that a binder on coverage for auto body shops required an inspection. Unsuccessful in reaching the Minogue agent by telephone, the Fireman\u2019s agent mailed him a written memo with this information on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>A fire occurred at Anthony\u2019s on February 3, 1983, that caused damage in the amount of $232,122, which Hanover paid in full. Although Hanover was aware of Fireman\u2019s oral binder by August 3, 1983, it made no formal demand for payment until July 3, 1984, more than one year after the fire loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The trial court ruled against Hanover\u2019s claim for subrogation on the ground that the oral binder between Fireman\u2019s and Anthony\u2019s included a one year suit provision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-98 and 38-100.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Hanover had not brought suit within twelve months following Anthony\u2019s loss, the court held that Hanover\u2019s suit was barred. The court further held that Fireman\u2019s had neither waived, nor was estopped from asserting, the one year suit provision as a defense to Hanover\u2019s suit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The trial court also ruled against Hanover on its alternate claim for contribution. The court concluded that Hanover had not been legally obligated to pay the entire fire loss at Anthony\u2019s and was barred from seeking contribution for its actions as a \u201cvolunteer.\u201d It also concluded that Hanover had failed to establish an equitable basis for its claim for contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Hanover\u2019s appeal does not challenge the underlying facts found by the trial court but asserts its right to recovery, as a matter of law, without regard to the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>year suit provision in \u00a7 38-98 under a theory either of subrogation or of contribution. We are unpersuaded that Hanover\u2019s claims are sustained by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As Anthony\u2019s subrogee, Hanover had no greater rights against Fireman\u2019s than Anthony\u2019s possessed and was equally subject to any defenses that Fireman\u2019s might have asserted against Anthony\u2019s. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Employer\u2019s Reinsurance Corporation, </em>206 Conn. 668, 673, 539 A.2d 138 (1988); <em>Arton </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>163 Conn. 127, 139-40, 302 A.2d 284 (1972). Hanover does not dispute these basic subrogation principles but contends, nonetheless, that its subrogation claim is not time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The trial court concluded that the oral binder that Fireman\u2019s had issued to Anthony\u2019s included the one year suit provision that is part of the standard form of fire insurance policy in this state. Section 38-98 requires such a standard policy to provide that \u201c[n]o suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity . . . unless commenced within twelve months next after inception of the loss.\u201d Further, \u00a7 38-100 includes the terms of the standard fire insurance policy in \u201c[bjinders or other contracts for temporary insurance.\u201d It is undisputed that Hanover did not bring suit within one year of the fire at Anthony\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Despite the clarity of this statutory language, Hanover maintains that the trial court should not have held it bound by the statutory one year suit provision. It claims that the controlling statutes do not govern this case because Fireman\u2019s (1) failed, in pleading its statutory defense, explicitly to refer to \u00a7 38-100, (2) failed, in the circumstances of this case, to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>applicability of the statutory provision, or (3) was estopped from invoking the statutory provision. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Fireman\u2019s special defense alleged that Hanover could not recover because it had \u201cfailed to file suit within twelve months after inception of the loss in violation of Connecticut General Statute Section 38-97 and Section 38-98.\u201d Hanover correctly observes that the special defense should also have mentioned \u00a7 38-100 in order to be in full compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 109A.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In accordance with the general objectives of our rules of pleading; see <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; </em>Opportunities, 177 Conn. 75, 77, 411 A.2d 40 (1979); the practice book section is designed to assure sufficient notice to the plaintiff of the statutory defense upon which a defendant intends to rely. Its provisions are therefore directory rather than mandatory. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Godou, </em>209 Conn. 273, 275, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988). In the absence of any showing that either Hanover or the trial court was misled by the failure to cite \u00a7 38-100 in addition to \u00a7\u00a7 38-97 and 38-98, we conclude that the issue raised by Fireman\u2019s special defense was properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Hanover claims that Fireman\u2019s denial of the existence of any insurance policy or a valid binder disabled Fireman\u2019s from proving and prevailing on its statutory defense. This claim comes to us in a number of versions: (1) that Fireman\u2019s could not pursue such inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>pleadings; (2) that Fireman\u2019s was improperly relieved of its burden of proof by the trial court\u2019s mischaracterization of the statutory limitation of suit clause as a statute of limitation; (3) that Fireman\u2019s did not meet its burden of proof for inclusion of the statutory limitation in its oral binder; and (4) that Fireman\u2019s denial was a repudiation of its contractual obligation that excused Hanover from further compliance with conditions incorporated into the binder. We conclude to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Hanover\u2019s claim with regard to inconsistency in Fireman\u2019s pleadings does not warrant extended discussion. Unlike the facts presented by <em>Montanaro Bros. Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>190 Conn. 481, 489, 460 A.2d 1297 (1983), the record in this case discloses nothing to suggest that Hanover was in any way injured by Fireman\u2019s inconsistent defenses. Absent such a showing of prejudice, there is no general prohibition of inconsistent pleadings. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 94,137; <em>Dreier </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co., </em>196 Conn. 242, 245, 492 A.2d 164 (1985). The case of <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>13 Conn. App. 101,107, 535 A.2d 364 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 807, 540 A.2d 375 (1988), on which Hanover relies, does not compel a contrary result because, in this case, it was entirely consistent for the trial court to render a judgment declaring the oral binder issued to Anthony\u2019s to be effective while at the same time construing the binder to include the terms mandated by statutory requirements for a standard fire insurance binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The record equally fails to establish that Hanover was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s inadvertent mischaracterization of the statutory one year suit provision as a statute of limitation. Hanover is correct that <em>Monteiro </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., </em>177 Conn. 281, 283, 416 A.2d 1189 (1979), holds that the provision is not a statute of limitation. The trial court\u2019s memoran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>dum of decision as a whole makes it plain that the court\u2019s linguistic lapse was immaterial. The court expressly determined that the one year suit provision was included as a statutorily mandated term in the oral binder. This determination would have been unnecessary if the court had understood the provision to operate as a statute of limitation, rather than a contractual condition of the oral binder.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In making its determination about the effect of the governing statutes, the court correctly held that Fireman\u2019s had proven its defense. Although Fireman\u2019s was required to prove the terms and conditions of its oral binder, we are unpersuaded, in light of \u00a7 38-100, which expressly regulates the content of oral binders, that Fireman\u2019s was obligated to introduce evidence of the terms of a written policy of insurance that it never issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Finally, Hanover contends that Fireman\u2019s denial of the existence of a binder was a breach of contract that excused its subsequent noncompliance with the one year suit provision. The single authority upon which Hanover relies; <em>Batter Building Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Kirschner, </em>142 Conn. 1,110 A.2d 464 (1954); however, supports the contrary proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">In <em>Batter Building Materials Co., </em>the issue was whether a repudiation or total breach of a contract containing an arbitration clause excused the nonbreaching party from compliance with that clause. We held that, even in the case of a total breach, \u201c \u2018[t]he contract is not put out of existence, though all further performance of the obligations undertaken by each party in favour of the other may cease. It survives for the purpose of measuring the claims arising out of the breach, and the arbitration clause survives for determining the mode of their settlement. The purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the contract have failed, but the arbitration clause is not one of the purposes of the contract.\u2019 \u201d Id., 10, quoting <em>Heyman </em>v. <em>Darwins, Ltd., </em>1942 A.C. 356, 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Like the arbitration clause at issue in <em>Batter Building Materials Co., </em>the one year suit provision at issue here was not one of the purposes of the oral binder. Even after a repudiation of the oral binder, the provision continued to govern the time, and mode, of resolving disputes arising thereunder. Thus, Fireman\u2019s denial of liability did not excuse Hanover from compliance with the provision requiring suit within one year of the date of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Hanover further maintains that Fireman\u2019s is estopped, by virtue of its oral binder, or because of its conduct, from insisting upon Hanover\u2019s compliance with the one year suit provision mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 38-98 and 38-100. This claim relies, on the one hand, on legal inferences to be drawn from the issuance of the binder and, on the other hand, on inaction or on statements by Fireman\u2019s personnel. We agree with the trial court that the record in this case does not establish estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Hanover\u2019s argument on legal inferences is derived from a number of out-of-state cases involving written insurance policies that failed to include a statutory limitation of suit clause. In such circumstances, some courts have held that the issuance of a nonconforming policy may estop the insurer from invoking the statutory protection that it might otherwise have enjoyed. See, e.g., <em>Peters </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>213 F. Sup. 441, 442 (S.D.N.Y. 1963) (dictum); <em>Aarons Fifth Ave., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of North America, </em>52 App. Div. 2d 855, 383 N.Y.S.2d 45 (1976); <em>Becker-Fineman Camps, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Service Mutual Ins. Co., </em>52 App. Div. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>656, 382 N.Y.S.2d 122 (1976); <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Yorkshire Ins. Co., </em>5 Misc. 2d 670, 671-72, 163 N.Y.S.2d 28 (1957). We decline Hanover\u2019s invitation to adopt these rulings in the context of this case. Principles of estoppel arising out of arguably misleading written insurance policies do not inform a controversy involving a temporary oral binder of insurance whose terms are dictated by \u00a7\u00a7 38-100 and 38-98. This case is far more analogous to <em>Kahn </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>293 F. Sup. 985, 988 (E.D.N.Y. 1968), in which an oral binder was held to include the one year limitation of suit provision that is part of New York\u2019s standard fire insurance policy. Hanover does not claim that the terms of the oral binder in any way misled it into believing that any suit it might have brought would not have been subject to the Connecticut one year suit requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Hanover maintains, in the alternative, that even if the one year suit provision were a term of the oral binder, Fireman\u2019s, by its conduct, had either waived, or was estopped from raising, the provision. The trial court found that shortly after the fire at Anthony\u2019s, Hanover contacted Fireman's, which then denied the existence of a binder. Six months later, on August 3, 1983, Hanover\u2019s insurance adjuster notified Fireman\u2019s, by certified letter, that Hanover was seeking contribution for payment of the fire loss at Anthony\u2019s. Fireman\u2019s never responded to that letter. Hanover took no further action until July, 1984, seventeen months after the loss, when it sent another letter to Fireman\u2019s demanding payment. Fireman\u2019s claims supervisor, responding by letter on August 28, 1984, requested additional information regarding Hanover\u2019s claim, and thereafter in another letter, dated November 12,1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>denied the claim. The trial court held that this evidence failed to support Hanover\u2019s waiver or estoppel claims. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Our review of the trial court\u2019s determination is guided by the principle that, because waiver and estoppel are questions of fact; <em>New York Annual Conference </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>182 Conn. 272, 300, 438 A.2d 62 (1980); we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980). In undertaking this review, we can conveniently distinguish between events that transpired within one year of the fire loss and those that transpired thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The only possible basis for estoppel within the one year period are Fireman\u2019s initial denial of the existence of an oral binder and its subsequent failure to respond to Hanover\u2019s August, 1983 letter demanding payment. We agree with the trial court in its rejection of this claim. It is well settled that silence will not operate as estoppel absent a duty to speak. <em>Eis </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>213 Conn. 29, 34, 566 A.2d 422 (1989); <em>S.H.V.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>188 Conn. 503, 511-12, 450 A.2d 351 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>American News Co., </em>152 Conn. 101, 113, 203 A.2d 296 (1964); <em>Flaxman </em>v. <em>Capitol City Press, Inc., </em>121 Conn. 423, 430,185 A. 417 (1936). Hanover was aware of the one year suit provision in \u00a7 38-98, yet failed to exercise due diligence in ascertaining whether Fireman\u2019s planned to rely on the terms of the provision. Under these circumstances, Fireman\u2019s was under no duty to inform Hanover whether it intended to enforce the provision. To borrow the words of one court: \u201c[T]he record is persuasive that this is a case not of the defendants\u2019 lulling the plaintiff into a sense of false security but of the latter\u2019s sleeping on his rights.\u201d <em>Proc </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>17 N.Y.2d 239, 246, 217 N.E.2d 136, 270 N.Y.S.2d 412 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The trial court also refused to find estoppel or waiver on the basis of representations by Fireman\u2019s in August and November, 1984, that postdated the expiration of the one year suit limitation. The court relied <em>on Hawley Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>621 F. Sup. 190, 192 (D. Conn. 1985), for the proposition that acts occurring after the period for suit had run could not constitute a basis for either waiver or estoppel. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The essential elements of estoppel are that \u201c \u2018 \"the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>Bergenty, </em>214 Conn. 641, 648, 573 A.2d 729 (1990). Hanover\u2019s change of position in this case, its failure to initiate suit within one year of the fire loss, cannot logically be linked to events occurring after the one year period had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We are equally unpersuaded that post one year anniversary communications between the parties support Hanover\u2019s claim of waiver. Waiver is the \" \u2018intentional relinquishment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olean </em>v. <em>Treglia, </em>190 Conn. 756, 772, 463 A.2d 242 (1983); <em>Multiplastics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arch Industries, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 280, 286, 348 A.2d 618 (1974). In the absence of allegation or proof that anyone ever affirmatively stated, on behalf of Fireman\u2019s, that it would not invoke the one year suit provision, Hanover has not stated a case for a finding of express waiver. Its argument for an implied waiver rests on the failure of Fireman\u2019s to advert to the one year provision when it denied Hanover\u2019s demand for payment in 1984. This court, while recognizing the analytic distinction between express waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>and estoppel, has held that \u201cimplied waivers and estoppels by conduct are so similar that they are nearly indistinguishable.\u201d <em>S.H.V.C., Inc. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>supra, 510; <em>Novella </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>163 Conn. 552, 564, 316 A.2d 394 (1972).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of this equivalence, Hanover\u2019s implied waiver claim is as unavailable as was its estoppel claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Hanover next maintains that even if the one year suit provision in \u00a7 38-98 precludes its suit in subrogation, it can recover from Fireman\u2019s on a theory of contribution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court, however, rejected Hanover\u2019s claim for contribution on two substantive grounds. Relying on the fact that both the Hanover policy and the Fireman\u2019s binder covering the fire loss at Anthony\u2019s contained pro rata liability clauses,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court first concluded that each insurer was contractually liable to Anthony\u2019s for only one half of Anthony\u2019s loss. In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>circumstances, the trial court concluded that Hanover was not entitled to contribution because in paying the entire claim when it was liable for only one half thereof, Hanover had acted as a \u201cvolunteer.\u201d The court also invoked a second basis for rejecting Hanover\u2019s claim when it cited <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 405, 412, 207 A.2d 732 (1965), for the proposition that \u201ccontribution involves a claim for reimbursement of a share of a payment necessarily made by the claimant which <em>equitably </em>should have been paid in part by others.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then concluded that there were \u201cno compelling reasons from the evidence adduced at trial to find contribution in this case.\u201d We affirm the trial court\u2019s resolution of Hanover\u2019s contribution claim on the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The right of action for contribution, which is equitable in origin, arises when, as between multiple parties jointly bound to pay a sum of money, one party is compelled to pay the entire sum. That party may then assert a right of contribution against the others for their proportionate share of the common obligation. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>supra, 412; <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>124 Conn. 227, 231-32, 199 A. 93 (1938); <em>Azzolina </em>v. <em>Sons of Italy, </em>119 Conn. 681, 692, 179 A. 201 (1935); <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>110 Conn. 342, 345, 148 A. 326 (1930); <em>Bulkeley </em>v. <em>House, </em>62 Conn. 459, 467, 26 A. 352 (1893).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">In the circumstances of this case, we are unpersuaded that the trial court was required to conclude that Hanover had established an equitable basis for a right to contribution. It is not clear, given the pro rata liability clauses in Hanover\u2019s policy and Fireman\u2019s oral binder, that Hanover could legally have been compelled to pay the fire loss in its entirety, classically a prerequisite to an action for contribution. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Waters, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>supra. Although the doctrine that denies a \u201cvolunteer\u201d a right to contribution has been criticized,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we have not had the occasion to confront this issue directly and we need not decide it in this case. To the contrary, the trial court found that Fireman\u2019s had reasonably denied the existence of a binder. The facts in this case that shed light on the equities between the parties support the trial court\u2019s denial of relief to Hanover.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As an equitable matter, the court might have assigned some weight to Hanover\u2019s failure to avail itself of its contribution claim in a timely fashion. Although Hanover argues that its contribution claim did not rest \u201con the policy,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and was therefore governed, not by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00a7 38-98, but rather by General Statutes \u00a7 52-581,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the statute of limitations for oral contracts, the contrary conclusion is equally possible. By its terms, \u00a7 38-98 applies to claims brought in \u201cany court of law or equity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Arguably, then, the section may apply to an equitable contribution claim such as Hanover\u2019s. Without deciding that question, however, we note that the policy of swift settlement of claims promoted by the one year suit provision in \u00a7 38-98 would be undermined if insurers who failed to bring a timely subrogation claim could simply bypass the one year suit requirement, as Hanover seeks to do, by also alleging an independent contribution claim subject only to a three year statute of limitation. Consequently, the fact that the trial court might have assigned some, perhaps even considerable, weight to Hanover\u2019s untimely assertion of its contribution claim would have been entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Further, as an additional equitable consideration, the court might have taken notice of the relationship between the two insurance policies at issue in this case. The record demonstrates that the insured sought coverage from Fireman\u2019s to replace, rather than to supplement, the fire insurance for which it had received a notice of cancellation from Hanover, effective February 7,1983.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It was therefore entirely fortuitous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>unanticipated that, because the oral binder was issued on January 31, 1983, both the old and the new insurance were in effect on February 3, 1983, the date of the fire at Anthony\u2019s. But for this fortuitous overlap, Hanover would have remained liable for the entire fire loss at Anthony\u2019s. In these circumstances, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that Hanover\u2019s payment was not one \u201cwhich equitably should have been paid in part\u201d by Fireman\u2019s. <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>supra, 412.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In this opinion, Callahan, Covello and Borden, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\"> Because Hanover withdrew its claims against Minogue prior to the trial court\u2019s rendering of its decision in this case, Minogue is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38-97 provides: \u201cThe form of policy of fire insurance set forth in section 38-98 shall be known and designated as \u2018The Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>dard Fire Insurance Policy of the State of Connecticut.\u2019 The standard form of policy shall be plainly printed, and no portion thereof shall be in type smaller than the type used in printing such form on file in the office of the commissioner.

Nonetheless, in two trial court memoranda of decision, on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, and on Hanover\u2019s request for an articulation, the merits of Hanover\u2019s contribution claim were addressed even though the trial court might well have refused to consider this issue. On this state of the record, we will briefly consider whether the trial court correctly rejected Hanover\u2019s contribution claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\"> The pro rata liability clause in the oral binder is part of the standard fire insurance form.

Richards, Insurance (6th Ed. 1990) \u00a7 12:3, pp. 336-37. The volunteer doctrine allegedly fails to recognize that insurers are often called upon to pay claims at times when they have bona fide questions regarding their liability, and the liability of other insurers. As one treatise states, \u201c[wjhen an insurance company pays a claim that is covered by another policy, it does so not as a volunteer, but because, by virtue of its lack of knowledge of or about another policy or the recalcitrance of the other insurer, it feels compelled to treat the claims as its own responsibility.\u201d A.

I agree with Part I of the majority opinion, rejecting Hanover\u2019s subrogation claim for failure to bring suit within one year after the loss in accordance with the standard policy provision implicitly contained in Fireman\u2019s binder agreement by virtue of General Statutes 38-98.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I disagree, however, with the grounds upon which the majority in Part II relies to affirm the denial of Hanover\u2019s claim of contribution, which the trial court considered despite the failure to plead it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The majority eschews reliance upon the only ground specifically articulated in the memorandum of decision for denying the contribution claim: \u201cThe plaintiff acted as a volunteer when it made full payments to [Anthony\u2019s], the insured.\u201d Because I disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>grounds advanced by the majority to support the judgment, I must express my agreement with the more recent cases and commentators<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that have rejected the application of the volunteer doctrine in a situation like this one in which the insurer seeking contribution has no basis for contesting its own coverage of the entire loss except that the pro rata clause in its policy may obligate it to pay only a portion thereof if a dispute over duplicate coverage by another insurer is ultimately resolved by a finding of such coverage, as in this case. Adherence to the volunteer doctrine in such circumstances would encourage insurance companies to withhold payments until disputes involving other insurance were resolved in court. It would often compel the insured to bring suit for breach of contract against both insurers when one of them would have paid the entire loss but for concern over preserving its claim for contribution. As one commentator has indicated, the application of the volunteer doctrine in the pro rata clause context stems from \u201c[a] failure to perceive clearly that contribution is based on unjust enrichment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. Palmer, Law of Restitution (1978) \u00a7 1.5 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The majority appears to construe the supplemental memorandum of decision responding to the motion for articulation of the reasons for denying contribution as basing that determination on alternative grounds independent of the volunteer doctrine, which the trial court relied on expressly. The inclusion in the memorandum of a quotation defining contribution as involving \u201ca claim for reimbursement of a share of a payment <em>necessarily made by the claimant </em>which equitably should have been [made] by others\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Merberg Wrecking Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 405, 412, 207 A.2d 732 (1965); indicates explicitly that the court relied on the volunteer doctrine, but sheds no light upon whether any other equitable considerations entered into the decision. Similarly, the general statement that \u201c[t]he [trial] court finds no compelling reasons from the evidence adduced at trial to find contribution in this case\u201d hardly suggests that any of the alternative grounds relied on by the majority as possible bases for the decision were ever considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The majority declares that \u201c[t]he facts in this case that shed light on the equities between the parties support the trial court\u2019s denial of relief to Hanover\u201d and proceeds to speculate that the court \u201cmight have assigned some weight\u201d to two factors: (1) the failure to bring suit within one year after the loss as required by the standard policy clause incorporated into the binder agreement by \u00a7 38-98; and (2) the \u201centirely fortuitous and unanticipated\u201d circumstance that both the old and the new insurance coverage were in effect at the time of the loss. The majority does not indicate that either or both of these possible grounds for the decision would have necessitated as a matter of law the denial of contribution, but only that the trial court was not \u201crequired to conclude that Hanover had established an equitable basis for a right to contribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Before addressing the merits of the two grounds advanced by the majority, I must object to the speculation in which it has indulged by assuming that the trial court ever considered either of them as a basis for the decision or weighed them against an otherwise viable contribution claim. The vague allusions to equity in the memorandum of decision may readily be viewed as relating to the validity of the contribution claim simply on the basis of the volunteer doctrine, which has generally been regarded as an equitable principle. Appellate review of a trial court decision should not be conducted in the same manner as when a jury verdict is challenged for lack of evidence, necessitating a search of the record for any conceivable basis to support the jury finding. Practice Book \u00a7 4059, by requiring in nonjury trials that the court \u201cstate its decision on the issues in the case,\u201d including \u201cits conclusion as to each claim of law raised by the parties,\u201d contemplates that appellate review will be conducted on the basis of the grounds actually relied upon by the trial court. Only when a ground not considered by the court would determine the outcome of an appeal as a matter of law should an appellate court rest its judgment thereon, a circumstance the majority does not claim to exist in this case. Instead of speculating that the court in this case <em>might </em>have relied upon matters not specified in the memorandum, we should exercise our authority pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4061 to order a further articulation by the trial court of the grounds it relied upon apart from the volunteer doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">With respect to the merits of the first proposition advanced by the majority, that \u00a7 38-98, the one year limitation established as a term of the insurance binder, \u201carguably\u201d may apply to Hanover\u2019s equitable contribution claim just as it applies to its subrogation claim, I must express my disagreement. The majority overlooks the classic distinction between an action on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>contract, such as subrogation, which \u00a7 38-98 unquestionably governs, and an action for contribution, which is based on the equitable principle of unjust enrichment. The statute does not purport to apply to anything but the terms of the insurance contract. Equitable claims of contribution or indemnification, which do not arise until payment to the insured has been made, should not be governed by a provision limiting the period for suit to one year from the date of the <em>loss. </em>Even if \u00a7 38-98 were to be given some force by analogy in determining the time reasonably to be allowed for seeking contribution, it would be necessary to weigh all of the factors involved, including Fireman\u2019s dilatory tactics in failing to respond promptly to Hanover\u2019s inquiry about the binder, before deciding whether the delay here was unreasonable. We should not speculate that the trial court found laches when there is no mention of that subject in the memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">As for the \u201cadditional equitable consideration\u201d that the trial court \u201cmight have taken notice of,\u201d that the overlap in coverages was fortuitous, I see no basis for viewing it as a justification for denying Hanover\u2019s claim. Fireman\u2019s was entitled to charge a premium from the date of the oral binder and was no less bound than Hanover to pay the loss when it occurred on February 3,1983, as the trial court determined. In any event, there is nothing in the memorandum of decision to indicate that the trial court ever considered this second ground speculatively attributed to it by the majority or weighed it against the equities involved in Hanover\u2019s contribution claim. This court cannot perform functions that are plainly those of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\"> See footnote 2 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\"> See footnote 11 of the majority opinion; see also A.

An example is provided by cases in which policies of two insurers cover the same loss, with each policy containing a pro rata clause. The effect of such a clause is that the liability of each insurer is limited to his portion of the total coverage. If one insurer pays more than his share, some courts have denied contribution, even though the payment was made in such circumstances that in other contexts restitution would be granted because of the benefit conferred on the other insurer. Thus, in one case the entire loss was paid by an insurer who was unware of the fact that the insured carried other insurance. In general terms, one person has paid the obligation of another in the mistaken belief that he is paying his own obligation. The right to restitution is clear and in other settings is nearly always recognized. But in the case in question, contribution was refused; such relief is available, the court said, only when the payor discharges a \u2018common burden, obligation or liability.\u2019 \u201d G.
