The trial court determined that the board\u2019s interpretation of the regulation was reasonable and upheld the board\u2019s decision denying the application of the plaintiff, Richard Spero, for a permit to construct such an ordering station outside of his restaurant. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The facts giving rise to this appeal are not in dispute. The plaintiff owns and operates a McDonald\u2019s restaurant located in a commercial zone in Guilford. In April, 1989, the plaintiff applied to the Guilford zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>enforcement officer for a permit to erect an ordering station outside the restaurant. The proposed ordering station consisted of an outside menu board and intercom system that would enable the plaintiff\u2019s patrons to drive up and place take-out orders while remaining in their vehicles. The patrons would then park their vehicles and retrieve the food and beverages ordered by entering and exiting the building through a \u201ctakeout\u201d door that the plaintiff proposed to add to his existing facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On May 3, 1989, the zoning enforcement officer denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for failure to comply with Article II, \u00a7 23, Table No. 2b, item 28 (a) of the Guilford zoning regulations, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cRestaurants and other Food and Beverage Service Establishments, as follows: a. where customers are served food and/or beverage only when they are seated at tables or counters and at least 75% of the customer seats are located within an enclosed building, <em>which use may include a food and beverage takeout service from within the building (excluding take-out </em>windows) when only incidental to the primary permitted use.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The zoning enforcement officer stated as his grounds for denial: \u201cThe taking of orders is a part of the service and the Regulation does not provide for any service outside the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the board from the denial of his application. The board conducted a public hearing regarding the appeal on May 24, 1989, and it was agreed that the appeal would be tabled pending receipt of advice from the town\u2019s legal counsel. Thereafter, the board submitted this question to counsel: \u201cWhether the Guilford Zoning Regulations permit as part of a restaurant use the establishment of an outside drive-up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ordering station where orders are placed from the customer\u2019s vehicle. The customer then parks and enters the restaurant to receive his or her order. . . .\u2019\u2019In response, counsel advised the board in a letter: \u201cAfter reviewing the Zoning Regulations I am of the opinion that the proposed use described herein is not permitted. I agree with the opinion rendered by the Zoning Enforcement Officer . . . .\u2019\u2019On June 19, 1989, the board reconvened to consider the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The minutes of the meeting reveal that counsel\u2019s opinion letter was read and considered. At the conclusion of the meeting, the board issued a written denial of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal stating in pertinent part: \u201cIt is the opinion of this Board that the decision of the Zoning Enforcement Officer ... is correct and the Board concurs with this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The plaintiff then appealed to the Superior Court, alleging in part: (1) that the board\u2019s determination that the regulation did not permit the use of his proposed ordering station was unreasonable; (2) that the board illegally delegated its decision-making authority to town counsel by allowing counsel to decide his appeal; and (3) that the regulation was impermissibly vague in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to due process of law. The trial court decided each of these issues against the plaintiff and rendered judgment dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff petitioned for and was granted certification to appeal from the judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023. The plaintiff now claims that the court improperly determined: (1) that the board reasonably interpreted the regulation to prohibit the use of his proposed ordering station; (2) that the board did not ille<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>gaily delegate its decision-making authority to town counsel; and (3) that the regulation was not unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The plaintiffs principal claim is that the board unreasonably interpreted the regulation\u2019s requirement that take-out service occur within a restaurant building to prohibit the use of his proposed ordering station. In support of his claim, the plaintiff notes that the regulations do not define the word \u201cservice,\u201d and that one dictionary definition of the word focuses upon the delivery aspect of restaurant service: \u201c[T]he bringing of food and drink to diners seated at a table; the work or activity of waiting at table . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. He therefore contends that accepting take-out orders, as distinguished from delivering the items ordered, is not part of the \u201ctakeout service\u201d that is required by the regulation to occur within his restaurant building. Since the use of the proposed ordering station would not involve delivery of take-out orders outside the building, and the accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>anee of such orders would not be accomplished by an impermissible \u201ctake-out window,\u201d the plaintiff concludes that the board\u2019s interpretation and application of the regulation was unreasonable. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201cGenerally, it is the function of a zoning board or commission to decide \u2018within prescribed limits and consistent with the exercise of [its] legal discretion, whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it does apply. The trial court had to decide whether the board correctly interpreted the section [of the regulations] and applied it with reasonable discretion to the facts. <em>Pascale </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 113, 116, 117, 186 A.2d 377 [1962]; <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>140 Conn. 241, 244, 99 A.2d 130 [1953]. . . .\u2019 <em>Toffolon </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 558, 560-61, 236 A.2d 96 (1967).\u201d <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 146, 152, 543 A.2d 1339 (1988). In applying the law to the facts of a particular case, the board is endowed with a liberal discretion, and its decision will not be disturbed unless it is found to be unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal. Id. \u201c \u2018[U]pon appeal, the trial court reviews the record before the board to determine whether it has acted fairly or with proper motives or upon valid reasons . . . .We, in turn, review the action of the trial court.\u2019 <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>152 Conn. 247, 248-49, 206 A.2d 110 (1964).\u201d <em>Adolphson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 703, 707, 535 A.2d 799 (1988). The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to demonstrate that the board acted improperly. Id. Because the record discloses that the board correctly interpreted and applied the regulation, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the board\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was not unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The regulation is a local legislative enactment, and in its interpretation we seek to discern the intent of the legislative body as manifested in the words of the regulation. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>208 Conn. 696, 705, 546 A.2d 823 (1988). Since zoning regulations are in derogation of common law property rights, however, the regulation cannot be construed beyond the fair import of its language to include or exclude by implication that which is not clearly within its express terms. Id.; <em>Capalbo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>208 Conn. 480,490-91, 547 A.2d 528 (1988). The words employed by the local legislative body are to be interpreted in accordance with their natural and usual meaning; <em>Silitschanu </em>v. <em>Groesbeck, </em>208 Conn. 312, 315, 543 A.2d 737 (1988); <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>194 Conn. 187,193, 479 A.2d 808 (1984); and any interpretation that would torture the ordinary meaning of the words to create ambiguity will be rejected. <em>DeWitt </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 590, 594, 501 A.2d 768 (1985). Common sense must be used in construing the regulation, and we assume that a rational and reasonable result was intended by the local legislative body. See <em>Nickel Mine Brook Associates </em>v. <em>Joseph E. Sakal, P.C., </em>217 Conn. 361, 370-71, 585 A.2d 1210 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We first note that the dictionary definition relied upon by the plaintiff does not conclusively establish that the word \u201cservice\u201d in the regulation means only the delivery of take-out food and beverages. That definition clearly concerns service rendered to restaurant patrons who consume food and beverages while seated at tables. The regulation, on the other hand, applies to \u201ctake-out\u201d restaurant service. As demonstrated by the dictionary definition of the word \u201ctake-out,\u201d restaurant service of the take-out type is rendered in connection with \u201cfood not to be consumed on the premises.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>More instructive in this case, therefore, is the dictionary definition of the word \u201cservice\u201d that is not primarily directed toward traditional table dining: \u201c[T]he work performed by one that serves.\u201d Id. The word \u201cserve,\u201d in turn, is variously defined as \u201cto wait on customers,\u201d and \u201cto furnish or supply with something needed or desired.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In light of these definitions, and taking a common sense approach to the construction of the regulation, we cannot say that the board unreasonably interpreted the regulation to mean that the accepting of orders for take-out food and beverages is a part of the take-out service that must occur within the plaintiffs restaurant building. The proposed ordering station is designed by the plaintiff to attract additional take-out business, and to simplify the purchasing process for those of his patrons who prefer to be accommodated, at least in part, while in their vehicles. Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s provision of the ordering station is in the broad sense a \u201cservice\u201d that he would render to his patrons. More fundamentally, the ordering station is a mechanism by which his employees, whose voices would be electronically transmitted over an intercom located outside of the building, could accept orders for take-out food and beverages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Without the acceptance of such orders, their ultimate delivery, and in fact the entire transaction, could not occur. The acceptance of orders is therefore an integral and indeed indispensable component of the take-out service that the plaintiff would provide. Consequently, we conclude that the construction of the regulation adopted by the board and upheld by the trial court was not unreasonable, arbitrary or illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Our conclusion is reinforced by the express exclusion in the regulation of \u201ctake-out service windows,\u201d with which the provision permitting \u201ctake-out service from within the building\u201d must be reconciled. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, 706; see <em>Essex Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>206 Conn. 595, 601, 539 A.2d 101 (1988). Although the meaning of the phrase \u201ctake-out service window\u201d is not defined in the regulation, a take-out window at a restaurant is commonly operated in conjunction with an ordering station such as that proposed by the plaintiff. The fair import of the phrase \u201ctake-out service window\u201d thus encompasses its typical adjunct, the ordering station. It is therefore reasonable to presume that in aiming to eliminate the use of take-out windows, the local legislative body did not intend to prevent restaurant owners from using only such windows, but also intended to eliminate other commonly associated adjuncts to \u201cdrive-through\u201d service such as the ordering station. To allow the plaintiff to construct and operate his combination of ordering station and take-out door would thus thwart the evident purpose of the local legislative body. See <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>supra, 704; see also <em>Caltabiano </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>211 Conn. 662, 667, 560 A.2d 975 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the board illegally delegated its decision-making authority to town counsel by allowing counsel to decide his appeal. In support of this claim, the plaintiff principally relies on the fact that at the June 19,1989 meeting, the chairman of the board stated that he \u201cfelt that since the Board sought the advice of town counsel they should accept his opinion,\u201d and on the further fact that the board ultimately denied his appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff therefore asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the board delegated its duty to interpret the regulation to counsel. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The board, composed of laymen, is entitled to technical and professional assistance regarding matters beyond its expertise. <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 471, 478, 562 A.2d 1093 (1989); <em>Frito-Lay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>206 Conn. 554, 571, 538 A.2d 1039 (1988). This entitlement is necessarily implied in the legislation creating the board and setting forth its duties. See <em>Yurdin </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 416, 421, 143 A.2d 639, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 894, 79 S. Ct. 155, 3 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In this case, the assistance rendered to the board by town counsel concerned the statutory construction of a zoning regulation. The board was no less entitled to such advice on a primarily legal question, a matter certainly within the technical expertise of an attorney, than it is entitled to factual and statistical information supplied by its personnel trained in such matters. See <em>Holt-Lock, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning &amp; Planning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 182,185, 286 A.2d 299 (1971); <em>McCrann </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 65, 77, 282 A.2d 900 (1971); <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 207, 212, 240 A.2d 914 (1968); see also <em>Yurdin </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. Moreover, although counsel\u2019s construction of the regulation was adverse to the plaintiff, he was a neutral employee of the board rather than a party to the controversy. See <em>McCrann </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 78; <em>Kyser </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 236, 251, 230 A.2d 595 (1967); compare <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 474 (information supplied by attorney for party to controversy); <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 208, 355 A.2d 21 (1974) (information supplied by party to controversy). There is no evidence that he was biased against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In addition, there is no indication in the administrative record that the board treated the opinion of counsel as anything more than advice. While the chairman suggested that counsel\u2019s advice should be accepted, the record reveals that at least two members of the five member board were unprepared to accept that advice because counsel had not cited any legal authority in his letter. These members supported the plaintiff\u2019s position in the vigorous debate that ensued regarding the meaning of the regulation, and two other members of the board expressed reasons for supporting the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s interpretation that were not set forth by counsel in his letter. There is no evidence that either counsel\u2019s opinion or the chairman\u2019s statement influenced the alignment of these members in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. Furthermore, despite the chairman\u2019s initial statement, there is no indication that the chairman ultimately cast his vote against the plaintiff in reliance solely or decisively on the opinion of counsel rather than on the reasons advanced by his fellow board members. We therefore conclude that the trial court properly determined that the board did not illegally delegate its decision-making authority to town, counsel or otherwise act arbitrarily in requesting and considering counsel\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s final claim is that the terms of the regulation are vague and imprecise, thus rendering the regulation susceptible to arbitrary application in violation of his federal and state constitutional rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>due process of law. Although he concedes that \u201can attack on zoning regulations as unconstitutional per se requires an independent proceeding,\u201d the plaintiff contends that \u201c[t]he constitutional injunction against vagueness is determined by the application of a regulation to the particular facts at issue and requires examination of the claim within that factual context . . . .\u201d He relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>215 Conn. 173, 575 A.2d 216 (1990), in support of this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 179-80, we considered a criminal defendant\u2019s vagueness challenge to a criminal statute, and we stated that \u201cit is well established that, as a general rule, \u2018the constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue. . . .\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) As the board points out, however, \u201c[t]he rule extant under our zoning cases is that a party who has sought to avail himself of a zoning ordinance by making an application thereunder is precluded in the same proceeding from raising the question of its constitutionality. . . . A party, however, could of course attack the constitutionality of the zoning regulations in an independent proceeding.\u201d <em>Bierman </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>185 Conn. 135,139-40, 440 A.2d 882 (1981). This rule requiring the validity of a zoning regulation to be independently challenged in a declaratory judgment action serves the important policy of \u201censuring] that all affected landowners would be provided with an opportunity to become involved in the proceedings.\u201d <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Norwalk Wilbert Vault Co., </em>208 Conn. 1, 7, 544 A.2d 152 (1988). Since this policy concern is not implicated in the criminal context, <em>Jones </em>did not overrule or otherwise modify the rule applicable in zoning cases. We therefore conclude that the plaintiff, having availed himself of the regulation by filing an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>cation thereunder, is not entitled to attack the regulation as unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> The zoning enforcement officer granted the plaintiff permission to add the take-out door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\"> The plaintiff also claims that the board\u2019s consideration of town counsel\u2019s opinion letter after the close of the public hearing amounted to an illegal consideration of \u201cex parte evidence\u201d that he had no opportunity to examine or refute, and that the trial court improperly placed the burden of proving prejudice arising from this action upon him. Although the plaintiff included the former allegation in his complaint, he failed to brief the issue in his trial brief, and presumably for this reason, the court did not address the issue in its memorandum of decision. See Practice Book \u00a7 285A. If the plaintiff orally argued the issue before the court, which we are unable to determine without the benefit of the trial transcript, it was incumbent upon him to move for an articulation with respect to the issue pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051. Having failed to do so, the plaintiff has not fulfilled his duty to provide an adequate record for our review; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061; and we therefore decline to review his claims. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185; <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corporation, </em>217 Conn. 371, 393, 585 A.2d 1216 (1991); <em>Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chagnon, </em>210 Conn. 734, 747, 557 A.2d 525 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\"> We are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs argument that the use of an ordering station for the acceptance of take-out orders should be viewed as equivalent to the acceptance of such orders over a telephone, a use which is not prohibited. The acceptance of orders over a telephone is not accomplished by telephones provided by the plaintiff outside his restaurant building, but by telephones purchased by patrons and installed in their homes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> The plaintiff also points to the board\u2019s written denial of his appeal, the substance of which in his view \u201csubstantially mirrored\u201d the content of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sel\u2019s letter. Since both documents contain only a general statement of agreement with the decision of the zoning enforcement officer, we find this facial similarity inadequate to demonstrate that the board delegated its decision-making authority to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
