McCarthy, an inmate of the state prison at Somers, brought a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the judicial district of Tolland. In his petition he alleged that he was illegally confined for two reasons pertinent to this appeal. He first claimed that the respondent\u2019s method of calculating good time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> credits on his consecutive sentences was incorrect and deprived him of good time to which he was statutorily entitled, and also deprived him of the equal protection of the law guaranteed to him by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution. Second, he contended that the respondent improperly refused to credit him with presentence jail time<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to which he was entitled for the period from Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>tember 4, 1980, to September 28, 1982. The habeas court agreed with the petitioner as to his first claim and granted the requested relief. The court, however, disagreed with the petitioner\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The petitioner is currently held in the state prison pursuant to two orders of the Superior Court. The first, a mittimus issued by the Superior Court for the judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport on June 26,1981, ordered that the petitioner be imprisoned for an indeterminate term of not less than ten years nor more than twenty years for several burglaries and larcenies. He is presently serving that term. The second, a mittimus issued by the Superior Court for the judicial district of Danbury on January 11,1983, ordered that the petitioner be imprisoned for a definite term of six years as a result of six consecutive one year sentences for multiple counts of burglary and larceny. The petitioner\u2019s six year sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to his ten to twenty year sentence. All the crimes for which the petitioner was sentenced were committed in 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In his first claim, the petitioner argues that he is entitled under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to have his ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>to twenty year sentence aggregated with his six year sentence and to have his sentences construed as one continuous term of imprisonment for the purpose of calculating his good time credits. He argues, further, that he is entitled under General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a)* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to have his good time credited at the rate of fifteen days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>per month for the sixth and each subsequent year of his aggregated sentence. If correct, the petitioner will serve his entire six year sentence receiving good time credit at the rate of fifteen days per month. The respondent, on the other hand, argues that \u00a7 18-7 has no application to the petitioner, that the petitioner received two separate and distinct sentences that must be served as such, and that the petitioner must be released or paroled from his ten to twenty year sentence before he can commence serving his six year sentence. If the respondent is correct, the petitioner, under \u00a7 18-7a (a), will receive good time credit of only ten days per month for the first five years of his six year sentence rather than the fifteen days per month to which he claims to be entitled. The habeas court determined that the provision of \u00a7 18-7 mandating the aggregation of consecutive sentences for the purpose of calculating a prisoner\u2019s good time credits was applicable to the petitioner and ordered the respondent \u201cto construe the petitioner\u2019s 10 to 20 year sentence and his six year sentence as one continuous term for the purpose of calculating [his] good time.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The relevant portion of \u00a7 18-7 provides: \u201cWhen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section.\u201d The amount of commutation or diminution of his sentence, i.e., good time credit, that a prisoner can earn by good conduct and obedience to the rules of the institution under \u00a7 18-7 is \u201c[s]ixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years; and ninety days for the sixth and each subsequent year, and pro rata for a part of a year</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The legislature repealed the existing \u00a7 18-7 by the enactment of Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358, \u00a7 1. Public Act No. 76-358, \u00a7 1, then reenacted \u00a7 18-7 in its previous form except that the words \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1,1976,\u201d were inserted in the third sentence so that the third sentence of the present \u00a7 18-7<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reads: \u201cAny prisoner sentenced to a term of imprisonment <em>prior to October 1, 1976, </em>may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence, as follows: Sixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years; and ninety days for the sixth and each subsequent year and pro rata for part of a year . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In the same session the legislature enacted Public Acts 1976, No. 76-358, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That section of Public Act No. 76-358 increased the amount of statutory good time credits to which a prisoner sentenced after October 1, 1976, is entitled, from the previous annual sixty and ninety day limits of \u00a7 18-7 to \u201cten days for each month, and pro rata for a part of a month, of a sentence which is for not more than five years, and fifteen days for each month, and pro rata for part of a month, for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence of more than five years.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no provision in \u00a7 2 of Pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>lie Act No. 76-358 that multiple prison sentences be aggregated and construed as one continuous term for the purpose of calculating the amount of good time that a prisoner may earn.</p>\n<p id=\"AD1r\">In order to resolve the petitioner\u2019s first claim, it is necessary, therefore, to determine whether, by its repeal, revision and reenactment of \u00a7 18-7 and its enactment of \u00a7 18-7a (a), the legislature intended to exclude prisoners sentenced after October 1, 1976, from the statutory mandate of \u00a7 18-7 that consecutive sentences of imprisonment be aggregated and treated as one continuous term of imprisonment for the purpose of calculating good time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">As revised and reenacted by the 1976 legislature, \u00a7 18-7 manifestly limited its provision concerning the <em>amount </em>of good time an inmate of the state prison could earn to those inmates sentenced before October 1, 1976. <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>176 Conn. 638, 642-43, 410 A.2d 475 (1979).* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All the other provisions of the previous \u00a7 18-7, however, were reenacted and left intact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Those provisions that were left unchanged relate generally to the duties and prerogatives of the warden of the prison and the commissioner of correction in relation to the inmates. Included among the reenacted provisions is that which states: \u201cWhen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 18-7. Whether the legislature by its reenactment of that provision of \u00a7 18-7 and its silence concerning the aggregation of sentences in \u00a7 18-7a (a) intended that the aggregation provision of \u00a7 18-7 apply to prisoners sentenced after October 1, 1976, is unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Because the statutes in question are ambiguous, it is necessary that we address the statutes\u2019 legislative history and other criteria for guidance in determining the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>212 Conn. 195, 200, 562 A.2d 481 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). \u201cThe basic rule of statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intention of the law-making body . . . and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Green </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>178 Conn. 634, 637-38, 425 A.2d 128 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grullon, </em>supra, 199; <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 393, 362 A.2d 971 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The legislative history of Public Act No. 76-358 reveals that the manifest intention of the legislature in enacting it was to consolidate good time statutes and make good time equal and uniform throughout the correctional system by eliminating multiple systems of crediting good time, by increasing standard good time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>by eliminating meritorious time service awards,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and by repealing separate good time statutes for community correctional centers and the Cheshire correctional institution. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Humane Institutions, 1976 Sess., January 27, pp. 53-55, 65-68; see <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 651. There is nothing in the legislative history of Public Act No. 76-358 to indicate that the legislature intended to abrogate the aggregation of consecutive sentences for the purpose of calculating a prisoner\u2019s good time.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The intention of the legislature as to whether multiple sentences of imprisonment should be construed as one continuous term is, moreover, manifested in other existing statutes. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 18-98b<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requires that \u201c[w]hen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction the several terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for purposes of determining eligibility for any outstandingly meritorious performance award . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> requires the sentencing court when it imposes multiple sentences of imprisonment on a person at the same time, or when it imposes an additional sentence on a prisoner with an undischarged term of imprisonment, to state whether the sentences are concurrent or consecutive and to state the total \u201ceffective\u201d sentence imposed. See <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 440, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981) (effective sentence is standard by which good time is computed). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b) (2)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> mandates that if multiple definite sentences run consecutively, the terms of the sentences must be added to arrive at an \u201caggregate term\u201d and the sentences are satisfied by the discharge of the \u201caggregate term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Furthermore, it is a well established rule of statutory construction that repeal of the provisions of a statute by implication is not favored and will not be presumed where the old and the new statutes, in this case \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a (a), can peacefully coexist. <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>199 Conn. 294, 307, 507 A.2d 92 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>198 Conn. 671, 679, 504 A.2d 1053 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>172 Conn. 242, 256, 374 A.2d 215, cert. denied, 431 U.S. 967, 97 S. Ct. 2925, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1063 (1977); <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>162 Conn. 390, 404, 294 A.2d 546 (1972). If, by any fair interpretation, we can find a reasonable field of operation for both \u00a7\u00a7 18-7 and 18-7a (a), without destroying or perverting their meaning and intent, it is our duty to reconcile them and give them concurrent effect. <em>Windham First Taxing Districts. Windham, </em>208 Conn. 543, 553, 546 A.2d 226 (1988); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 365, 488 A.2d 790 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carbone, </em>supra; <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Furlong, </em>supra. We also note that the provision of \u00a7 18-7 requiring the aggregation of multiple sentences has been a part of the general statutes governing the award of good time since 1902. See General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 2900. \u201cIn the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u201d <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954). If the legislature had intended by enacting \u00a7 18-7a (a) to do away with the longstanding policy of aggregation of multiple sentences, it could easily have said so. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 623,441 A.2d 600 (1981). \u201cFurthermore, there is a presumption that an amendatory act does not change the existing law further than is expressly declared or necessarily implied.\u201d <em>Norwalk </em>v. <em>Daniele, </em>143 Conn. 85, 89, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>119 A.2d 732 (1955); 1A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 22.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The legislative history of Public Act No.76-358 and tenets of statutory construction, coupled with the extant statutes that indicate a legislative preference for the aggregation of sentences, lead us to conclude that the legislature did not intend by its enactment of \u00a7 18-7a (a) to exclude those sentenced after October 1, 1976, from the operation of that portion of \u00a7 18-7 requiring that multiple terms of imprisonment be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of calculating good time credits. In fact, this court in a 1981 appeal concerning a 1979 sentence, a sentence imposed well after the effective date of \u00a7 18-7a (a), appears to have recognized the continued vitality of the sentence aggregation provision of \u00a7 18-7. In <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Man</em>son, supra, 440, we quoted the aggregation provision of \u00a7 18-7 and commented, albeit in dicta, that \u201cthe legislature has chosen to make the \u2018effective sentence\u2019 the standard by which \u2018good time\u2019 is computed\u201d and \u201cthat the legislature [by the sentence aggregation provision of \u00a7 18-7] explicitly chose to make the \u2018effective sentence\u2019the benchmark for\u2018good time\u2019 . . . .\u2019\u2019See also <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 651.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Further, it appears from a stipulation of the parties filed in the trial court in the cases of <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>and <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>217 Conn. 584, 587 A.2d 124 (1991), the appeals of which were heard the same day as this appeal, that the commissioner of correction is in fact aggregating some consecutive sentences imposed after October 1, 1976, the effective date of \u00a7 18-7a (a), for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the purpose of awarding statutory good time credits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Whether sentences imposed after that date are aggregated appears to depend to a great extent on the date the sentences were imposed, whether the sentences were definite or indeterminate, and principally whether the sentences were imposed on the same day by the same court or on different days by different courts. That interpretation of the sentencing statutes by the commissioner raises a serious question as to whether such diverse treatment of prisoners, all similarly situated in that they were sentenced after October 1,1976, violates the equal protection clause of the United States constitution. See <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>185 Conn. 540, 543, 441 A.2d 166 (1981); see <em>also Bolling </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>345 F. Sup. 48, 52 (D. Conn. 1972); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Clearly, a prisoner whose consecutive sentences are aggregated to allow his second sentence to earn good time at the increased rate of fifteen days a month immediately at the conclusion of his first sentence receives greater good time credit than a prisoner, who, because his sentences are not aggregated, must commence serving his second sentence at the conclusion of his first sentence. <em>See Alexander </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 545. We need not, however, address the petitioner\u2019s equal protection claim if the statutes in question can reasonably be construed to avoid a constitutional problem. <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>supra, 437; <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 37-38, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). In choosing between two statutory constructions \u201cone valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>212 Conn. 258, 269, 562 A.2d 1060 (1989); <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Beverly Enterprises-Connecticut, Inc., </em>209 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>692, 706, 553 A.2d 596 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 362, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">That search has led us to the conclusion that the provision of \u00a7 18-7 requiring that prisoners held under more than one conviction have their several terms of imprisonment construed as one continuous term for the purpose of calculating their good time credits is still viable. The petitioner is, therefore, as the habeas court concluded, entitled to the number of days of good time provided for in \u00a7 18-7a (a) and entitled to have his consecutive sentences construed as one continuous term of imprisonment as provided for in \u00a7 18-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The petitioner next claims that he is entitled to receive presentence credit under General Statutes \u00a7 18-98<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for jail time spent at the Bridgeport correctional center from September 4,1980, to September 28, 1982. During that period and also prior to September 4, 1980, the petitioner was confined at the correctional center for burglaries and larcenies committed in Wilton for which he received a sentence of ten to twenty years from the Superior Court in the judicial district of Fairfield at Bridgeport.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">While the petitioner was confined on the Wilton charges, a warrant issued by a judge of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Danbury charging him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>with burglaries and larcenies in Ridgefield was lodged as a detainer against the petitioner with the department of correction at the Bridgeport correctional center.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The warrant in the upper right hand comer of its face sheet bore the notation \u201cBond 25,000 W.P._.\u201d The warrant was not executed, however, but simply-remained lodged as a detainer against the defendant at the correctional center until September 28, 1982, when the petitioner was transported to the Danburyjudicial district and arraigned on the offenses charged in the warrant. At his arraignment, the court committed the petitioner to the custody of the commissioner of correction on a continuance mittimus in lieu of his posting a bond. It is undisputed that when later sentenced by the Superior Court in Danbury, the petitioner was given credit on the six year sentence that he received for the time spent in the correctional center from the date of his arraignment on September 28, 1982, until the date of his sentence on January 11,1983. He argues, however, that he is also entitled to credit against his six year sentence from the time that the warrant issued by the Danbury Superior Court was lodged as a detainer at the correctional center on September 4,1980, until September 28,1982, the date of his arraignment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">An unexecuted warrant filed as a detainer is simply notification to the institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated advising the institution that the prisoner is wanted on other charges and requesting the institution either to hold the prisoner for the notifying agency or to alert the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent. <em>Carchman </em>v. <em>Nash, </em>473 U.S. 716, 719, 105 S. Ct. 3401, 87 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1985); <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 80 n.2, 97 S. Ct. 274, 50 L.

Ed. 2d 786 (1985); <em>see Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>173 Conn. 312, 314, 377 A.2d 335 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In this instance, the release of the petitioner from confinement on the Wilton charges for which he had originally been incarcerated was never imminent. The petitioner, rather, remained confined on those charges during the entire time that the Ridgefield detainer was lodged at the correctional center. The petitioner, therefore, was not confined pursuant to the Ridgefield warrant for his inability to obtain bail until the warrant was executed and the petitioner arraigned in the Dan-bury judicial district when he was committed because he was unable to post a bond on the Ridgefield charges. That scenario does not entitle the petitioner to presentence credit under \u00a7 18-98 from the moment the detainer was lodged. In order for the petitioner to be entitled to presentence credit toward his Danbury sentence under \u00a7 18-98, he must have been arrested and confined for his inability to obtain bail on the charges for which he was eventually sentenced in Danbury. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 315-16; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 252-53, 363 A.2d 121 (1975). The petitioner was not so confined until September 28, 1982, the date of his arraignment in the Danbury judicial district. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 316. We conclude, therefore, as did the habeas court, that the petitioner was entitled to presentence credit for jail time only from September 28,1982, the date of his arraignment, until January 11, 1983, the date of his sentence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\"> \u201c \u2018[G]ood time\u2019 is a commutation of a sentence, affecting an inmate\u2019s parole and discharge dates, thereby serving an important rehabilitative function by allowing an inmate the opportunity to earn an earlier release for himself.

Any prisoner sentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to October 1, 1976, may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence, as follows: Sixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years; and ninety days for the sixth and each subsequent year, and pro rata for a part of a year, and, in addition thereto, five days for each month as a meritorious time service award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>which may be granted in the discretion of the warden and the commissioner for exemplary conduct and meritorious achievement; provided any serious act of misconduct or insubordination or persistent refusal to conform to institution regulations occurring at any time during his confinement in said prison shall subject the prisoner, at the discretion of the warden and the commissioner, to the loss of all or any portion of the time earned. Said commutation of sentence shall apply to any prisoner transferred from the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers, to the John R. Manson Youth Institution, Cheshire. When any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section. The commissioner may employ prisoners outside the institution walls, within the state, under the charge of some officer of the institution. He shall provide for the prisoners suitable food and clothing and suitable implements and materials for their work, and shall provide for the relief of any sick or infirm prisoner, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated and available for such purpose. The warden shall superintend the labor and conduct of the prisoners, and, when requested, shall communicate to the commissioner any information in his knowledge respecting the prison.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a) provides: \u201cgood conduct credit for prisoners, (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, on and after October 1, 1976, and while still serving such sentence whether such sentence is for a definite, indefinite or indeterminate term, and regardless of the institution wherein the prisoner is confined may, by good conduct and obedienee to the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence in the amount of ten days for each month, and pro rata for a part of a month, of a sentence which is for not more than five years, and fifteen days for each month, and pro rata for a part of a month, for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence of more than five years.
