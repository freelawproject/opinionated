The dispositive issue is whether General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (ll)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the university to withhold such information. We hold that when students\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>names are sought based on their student status, \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) allows the university to withhold that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The FOIC found the following facts, which are not in dispute. On November 5,1987, Karen Ali, a reporter for The Daily Campus (the UConn student newspaper) wrote to the UConn police department to request a list of UConn students employed with the police department from September 1 through November 5, 1987. The department\u2019s executive director then asked its fifty-five student employees for permission to release their names. Forty-two objected, four indicated no preference, and nine did not respond. The director offered Ali the opportunity to review only the names of the thirteen student employees who did not object to disclosing their names. Ali and The Daily Campus thereafter filed a complaint with the FOIC. The FOIC ordered the university to disclose the names. UConn appealed to the Superior Court, but the trial court dismissed the appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The administrative record shows that the fifty-five student employees received hourly wages in exchange for duties which included giving parking tickets, escorting other students across campus, operating security and information booths, and supplementing dormitory security. They received no academic credit for their employment. The positions they held were, however, limited to students of the university.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Connecticut Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 through l-21k, lists a number of exemptions from its broad mandate of disclosure. One such exemption is \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11), which provides that \u201c[njothing . . . shall be construed to require disclosure of ... (11) names or addresses of students enrolled in any public school or college without the consent of each student whose name or address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>is to be disclosed who is eighteen years of age or older and a parent or guardian of each such student who is younger than eighteen years of age . . . The FOIC construed the term \u201cstudents\u201d to include only those persons whose <em>sole </em>affiliation with an educational institution is as students or, possibly, whose affiliation includes employment directly related to a program of study. Accordingly, the FOIC concluded that because the students in question were hourly employees whose employment was unrelated to their educational experience, \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) did not permit the university to withhold their names from the student reporter who sought them.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The FOIC then considered the university\u2019s contention that \u00a7 1-19 (a), which requires disclosure \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute,\u201d exempted it from disclosing the names requested because 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the \u201cBuckley Amendment,\u201d prohibits federal funding of educational institutions that disclose such information about students. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The FOIC concluded that because the Buckley Amendment merely conditioned funding on nondisclosure and did not prohibit disclosure, it did not come within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00a7 1-19 (a) \u201cfederal law\u201d exemption to disclosure. Because we hold that \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) permits the university to withhold the requested information, we do not address this second issue.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The trial court limited its review of the FOIC decision to whether the FOIC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 1-19 was \u201creasonable.\u201d While we ordinarily accord deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the legislation it is charged with enforcing; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110,119-20, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991); the agency\u2019s interpretation is only persuasive, not dispositive. \u201cThe interpretation of statutes presents a question of law\u201d; <em>Board of Education v. Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 153, 158, 585 A.2d 82 (1991); which is ultimately for the court to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">If the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is not subject to construction. <em>Cilley </em>v. <em>Lamphere, </em>206 Conn. 6, 9-10, 535 A.2d 1305 (1988). When application of the statute to a particular situation reveals a latent ambiguity in seemingly unambiguous language, however, we turn for guidance to the purpose of the statute and its legislative history to resolve that ambiguity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988). Despite the \u201cparade of horribles\u201d suggested by the FOIC,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> no such latent ambiguity is suggested by the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>It is undisputed that the students whose names were sought were enrolled in the university. The plain language of \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) applies, therefore, to protect them from the mandatory disclosure requirements of the FOIA. The FOIC contends, however, that the students were the subject of inquiry in their capacity as employees, not in their capacity as students, and that this difference renders \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) ambiguous and subject to the rule of construction that exemptions from the FOIA will be narrowly construed. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 160. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The facts before us do <em>not </em>indicate that student status was merely incidental to the claimant\u2019s request. Ali\u2019s letter specifically sought \u201ca list of <em>all those UConn students </em>that have been employed by the police department from September 1 through November 5,\u201d 1987. (Emphasis added.) Regardless of the limitation of the request to students who were employees, we construe \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11) to permit withholding of the names of those employees whose student status was a condition of their employment. Uncontroverted testimony made clear that the students employed by the department held positions reserved exclusively for students of the university. These facts suggest no reason for us to depart from the plain meaning of the statute, which exempts from the disclosure requirement the \u201cnames [and] addresses of students enrolled in any public . . . college.\u201d As there is no ambiguity in the statute as applied to this request, the FOIC\u2019s ruling was based on an error of law and should have been reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 provides in pertinent part: \u201cACCESS TO PUBLIC records, exempt records, (a) Except as otherwise provided by any federal law or state statute, all records maintained or kept on file by any public agency, whether or not such records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly during regular office or business hours or to receive a copy of such records in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u201c(b) Nothing in sections . . . 1-19 . . . shall be construed to require disclosure of . . .

Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7 99.3 (1990) provides in part: \u201cEducation records (a) The term means those records that are: (1) Directly related to a student; and (2) Maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution, (b) The term does not include ... (3) (i) Records relating to an individual who is employed by an educational agency or institution, that: (A) Are made and maintained in the normal course of business; (B) Relate exclusively to the individual in that individual\u2019s capacity as an employee; and (C) Are not available for use for any other purpose, (ii) Records relating to an individual in attendance at the agency or institution who is employed as a result of his or her status as a student are education records and not excepted under paragraph (b) (3) (i) of this definition.\u201d Thus, the Buckley Amendment does prohibit funding of colleges that disclose information contained in the records of student employees when, as here, the students are employed by virtue of their student status. The Buckley Amendment permits routine disclosure of \u201cdirectory information\u201d; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (b) (1) and (a) (5) (A); see footnote 2, supra; if the educational insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tution follows an \u201copt-out\u201d procedure allowing a parent to object to the disclosure. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g (a) (5) (B). To answer the request at issue, however, UConn would have had to disclose not only mere names and addresses, but also the fact that the named students were employed by the university police department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> The FOIC contends, for example, that a literal interpretation of the statute could lead to a bizarre result if the \u201cstudent\u201d is a regular police officer enrolled in one evening course at the university. Applying such an interpretation, UConn would then be permitted to withhold the name of the officer from an individual seeking to depose the officer in connection with a lawsuit, to make a complaint about a false arrest, or to bring an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violation of his civil rights by the officer in the exercise of his police duties. If student status is not a condition of his employment, however, our decision in this case would not authorize withholding the name of the officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> Our conclusion is bolstered by the legislative history of subdivision (11) to General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b), which was added to No. 77-609 of the 1977 Public Acts as a house amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">At a hearing on the original, unamended version of the bill, held before the Joint Standing Committee on Government Administration and Policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>an attorney for the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, Jeffrey C. Pingpank, brought up the potential conflict between the Buckley Amendment and the FOIA. He cited a ruling by the FOIC ordering a school to disclose information about a student despite the school\u2019s contention that such a disclosure would violate the Buckley Amendment and cause it to lose federal funds. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Government Administration and Policy, Pt. 2,1977 Sess., p. 406. In fact, the FOIC had made several such rulings in 1976-77. See, e.g., <em>In the Matter of Volak </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>Docket No. FIC76-176 (February 3, 1977); see also <em>In the Matter of Wilkim </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>Docket No. FIC77-56 (April 27,1977); <em>In the Matter of Cosgrove </em>v. <em>State, </em>Docket No. FIC76-216 (January 17,1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Three months after the committee hearing, house amendment A to the original bill was submitted for a vote. That amendment contained what is now \u00a7 1-19 (b) (11). Expressing guarded support for the amendment, Senator Joseph Lieberman commented, \u201cMr. President, I support adoption of the amendment with this caveat. In my understanding of it, it represents a legislative attempt to, in a sense, amend the ruling of the Freedom of Information Commission . . . .\u201d 20 S. Proc., Pt. 10,1977 Spec. Sess., p. 4128.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">While we must be cautious in relying upon statements made in committee hearings or by supporting legislators, this legislative record strongly suggests, at the least, that the legislature intended to free educational institutions from the risk of losing their federal funding by violating the Buckley Amendment in order to comply with the FOIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
