We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The pertinent facts are essentially undisputed. At all times relevant to this matter, the board sponsored a high school literary magazine entitled Lodestar. The magazine published submissions from students, faculty and alumni. The June, 1987 edition of Lodestar contained a controversial alumni contribution. In reaction to the ensuing controversy, the superintendent of schools for the town of Ridgefield, Dr. David Larson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>decided to exclude alumni submissions from future editions of Lodestar.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Robert Cox, a faculty advisor to Lodestar, and members of the magazine\u2019s editorial board opposed the decision and retained legal counsel, Attorney William Laviano. After two discussions with Larson and a third discussion with the board\u2019s counsel, John Sabanosh, Laviano submitted a letter to Larson dated April 13, 1988, analyzing the existing confrontation and its legal implications, and demanding that the board rescind its decision by April 26,1988, in order to avoid legal action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">On April 25, 1988, the board held a regular public meeting during which it convened in a closed door, executive session together with Sabanosh and Larson. The publicly stated purpose for the executive session was, among others, to receive advice from counsel on the Lodestar matter. During the course of the executive session, the April 13 letter from Laviano was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cussed and a proposed resolution was finalized for presentation and action in regular session. Upon reconvening the regular session, the board adopted a resolution ratifying the superintendent\u2019s decision to restrict materials appearing in Lodestar to items submitted by members of the students and faculty of Ridgefield High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On April 28, 1988, Laviano, on behalf of Cox, submitted a letter of complaint to the defendant alleging that the board had met in executive session for an impermissible purpose. After a full hearing, Commissioner Joan M. Fitch found \u201cthat the respondent [board] did not meet in executive session for a purpose permitted by either \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a (e) (2) or l-18a (e) (5), G.S.,\u201d and concluded, therefore, that, \u201cthe respondent violated \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a (e), 1-21 (a) [sic] and l-21g (h) [sic], G.S., by convening in executive session for an impermissible purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On January 25,1989, the defendant adopted the findings of Commissioner Fitch and made certain specific findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequent thereto, on March 17,1989, the board appealed the defendant\u2019s decision to the Supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>rior Court. The trial court sustained the appeal of the board, finding that the defendant\u2019s decision was in \u201cderogation of the law, an abuse of discretion, [and] not based on [the] facts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">From that decision, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court on March 14, 1990, and the case was subsequently transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court: (1) exceeded its authority by substituting its judgment for that of the defendant; (2) incorrectly ruled that the demand of the student editors and Cox, as set out in Laviano\u2019s letter, constituted a pending claim that the board could discuss in executive session; and (3) incorrectly interpreted General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (5) in finding that the discussion of a draft resolution was protected from public disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court exceeded the permissible scope of its review in determining that Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a pending claim. The defendant argues that the trial court should be reversed for failing to defer to the defendant\u2019s determination of this issue. A brief overview of the statutory background of this claim is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a)* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that public agencies may adjourn from a public hearing into executive session in only a few narrowly defined circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>one of which is to discuss \u201cstrategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims and litigation to which the public agency ... is a party . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant therefore had to determine whether Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a \u201cpending claim\u201d and whether the board\u2019s discussion in executive session was properly devoted to \u201cstrategy and negotiations\u201d concerning that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The interpretation of statutes presents a question of law. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 139-40, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986). The disposition of the present case hinges on whether Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a \u201cpending claim\u201d within the meaning of the statute. This issue in turn is dependent on the interpretation of the statutory term \u201cpending claim.\u201d The defendant\u2019s finding that the letter did not constitute a pending claim was therefore a determination of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (d) provides that appeals from the defendant are taken pursuant to the Uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189. Under the UAPA, a trial court may reverse the decision of an administrative agency if that decision evinces an \u201cerror of law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j) (4). The trial court need not defer to an incorrect decision of law by the agency. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>supra, 140. \u201c 'Although the factual and discretionary determinations of administrative agencies are to be given considerable weight by the courts ... it is for the courts, and not for administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law.\u2019 \u201d Id. The defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We next turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that Laviano\u2019s letter did not constitute a \u201cpending claim\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). The defendant argues that although the letter threatened legal action, it cannot be considered a pending claim because it was not a claim formally submitted to an adjudicatory body and was therefore not \u201cpending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The defendant contends that the phrase \u201cpending claims and litigation\u201d must be construed narrowly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>because, as used in \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2), it establishes an exception to the basic openness requirement of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). This basic proposition, that exceptions to the FOIA\u2019s open hearings requirement are to be construed narrowly, is firmly established in our law. See <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 775, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). Even when construing statutory language narrowly, however, we cannot ignore the plain meaning of the words of the statute. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>202 Conn. 158, 168, 520 A.2d 190 (1987). The defendant\u2019s reading of the statute loses sight of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We note at the outset that \u201cpending claims and litigation\u201d must refer to a wider class of claims than those already filed in court. To hold otherwise would render the term \u201cpending claims\u201d superfluous. See, e.g., <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985) (no part of legislative enactment is to be treated as insignificant or unnecessary). We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to construe \u201cpending claims and litigation\u201d to encompass only those claims presently in litigation or pending before some other adjudicatory body.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In an earlier case we wrote that the term \u201c \u2018[c]laim\u2019 in its primary meaning is used to indicate the assertion of an existing right.\u201d <em>Beach\u2019s Appeal, </em>76 Conn. 118, 125, 55 A. 596 (1903). Today, \u201cclaim\u201d is commonly defined as \u201c[a] demand for something as one\u2019s rightful due ... [a] basis for demanding something; title or right\u201d; American Heritage Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1985); and \u201c[djemand for money or property.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). These definitions, read in the context of \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2), suggest that \u201cclaim,\u201d as used in the statute, should be understood to mean the assertion of a positive legal right, which a court, administrative agency or other public agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>could implement. \u201cPending\u201d has been defined as \u201c[b]egun, but not yet completed; before the conclusion of\u201d; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979); and \u201c[not] yet decided or settled; awaiting conclusion or confirmation.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary (2d College Ed. 1985). From these definitions it may reasonably be inferred that a pending claim is one already in existence and in progress. The defendant further contends, however, that only claims formally submitted to some adjudicatory forum may be deemed to be in progress. We do not discern in the applicable definitions a requirement that a claim, to be \u201cpending,\u201d must be formally under adjudication. Such a requirement, moreover, has no basis in reality, for it would deprive public agencies of the ability to formulate in private a response to the threat of imminent legal action until that action has commenced in court, thereby placing public agencies at a serious disadvantage. Such a rule would make it extremely difficult, for instance, for a public agency ever to settle a legal demand against it prior to the institution of suit. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpending\u201d thus renders litigation a tool of first, rather than last, resort for public agencies and those seeking to deal with them, a result wasteful of scarce governmental resources and thus contrary to public policy. We, therefore, reject it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">It is neither necessary nor desirable, however, for this court to define further the parameters of the term \u201cpending.\u201d That task is properly left with the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>istrative agency, on a case-by-case basis. <em>Cos Cob Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1, Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>212 Conn. 100, 105-106, 561 A.2d 429 (1989). The next question we face is whether the trial court correctly determined that Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a \u201cpending claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Upon reviewing the evidence in the administrative record, we agree with the trial court that Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a claim within the proper meaning of the statute. In that letter, the board had before it a carefully articulated demand for certain legal relief, a demand asserted to vindicate an alleged legal right personal to Laviano\u2019s clients. <em>Beach\u2019s Appeal, </em>supra, 125. The letter requested that by April 26,1988, the board rescind Larson\u2019s order prohibiting the magazine from publishing alumni submissions, and stated that Cox and the students would file suit if this was not done. Laviano\u2019s letter purported to address the legal merits of the students\u2019 claim. Although he stated at several points in the letter that Cox and the students wished to avoid litigation, the only way to avert that outcome, under the terms of the letter, was for the board essentially to capitulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The facts of this case lead inescapably to the conclusion that the claim was \u201cpending\u201d within the meaning of the statute. It defies common sense to assert that the claim of Laviano\u2019s clients had not yet \u201cbegun\u201d by the time of the challenged executive session, when, in fact, that claim, reduced to writing, was in the board\u2019s hands and awaiting its decision. The claim was both in existence and in progress. The trial court, therefore, correctly determined that Laviano\u2019s letter constituted a \u201cpending claim.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Finally, we consider whether the board\u2019s discussion concerned <em>\u201cstrategy and negotiations </em>with respect to pending claims and litigation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). At oral argument the defendant questioned whether the topic of the board\u2019s discussion in executive session was a permissible one under \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). The defendant argued that the board\u2019s discussion of the draft proposal affirming Larson\u2019s order concerned a matter of school board policy, and as such should have been held publicly. General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">It is permissible for public agencies to adjourn into executive session to discuss \u201cstrategy and negotiations with respect to pending claims and litigation to which the public agency ... is a party . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). The \u201cpending claim\u201d concerning the board was the demand that Larson\u2019s order be rescinded. The discussion in executive session concerned whether to do so, and if not, the manner in which to affirm his order. The board could reasonably have believed that the threat of litigation contained in Laviano\u2019s letter was real, and that its decision on this matter would determine whether litigation would be avoided or would go forward. The board\u2019s discussion in executive session thus came well within any reasonable interpretation of the term \u201cstrategy and negotiations.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\"> Although Larson decided in the summer of 1987 to exclude alumni submissions to Lodestar, he did not reduce that decision to writing until April 8, 1988, in a letter to Robert Cox, a faculty advisor for Lodestar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> Pertinent portions of Laviano\u2019s letter follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\u201cIn an attempt to avoid litigation, which is a very <em>real </em>possibility in this case, I have requested that you withdraw your order of April 8,1988 with regard to this year\u2019s Lodestar ....

Indeed, it is found that immediately after the executive session adjourned, the respondent reconvened in public session, had the revised statement read aloud, and without discussion unanimously vot\u00e9d to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">\u201c17. It is also found that the complainant\u2019s attorney\u2019s letter, explained in the executive session, contains no information privileged by the respondent\u2019s attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">\u201c18.

It is concluded, therefore, that the respondent violated \u00a7\u00a7 l-18a (e) 1-21 (a), [sic] and l-21g (h) [sic], G.S., by convening in executive session for an impermissible purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 1-21 (a) reads in pertinent part: \u201cThe meetings of all public agencies, except executive sessions as defined in subsection (e) of section l-18a, shall be open to the public.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> The relevant portions of General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) read as follows: \u201c \u2018Executive sessions\u2019 means a meeting of a public agency at which the public is excluded for one or more of the following purposes ...

This factual background, as well as Laviano\u2019s letter, was the subject of testimony before the defendant. Robert Cox testified that, prior to the board\u2019s receipt of Laviano\u2019s letter, numerous conversations regarding this controversy had transpired between Larson, Cox, Laviano, Sabanosh and the student editors of the magazine. The defendant argues that, because these conversations may have colored the board\u2019s perception of the threat of litigation underlying Laviano\u2019s letter, it was for the defendant, as trier of fact, to determine whether these conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tions had such an effect, and that this determination transformed the question of the letter\u2019s meaning into one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that the letter could not reasonably have been viewed by the board as a \u201cpending\u201d claim. First, the defendant\u2019s final decision does not suggest that the board members, as a result of prior conversations with Cox, Laviano, or anyone else, failed to view the letter as a demand for legal relief. Second, in reviewing the administrative record we find no testimony regarding those conversations that could have led the defendant reasonably to believe that the board gave the letter anything other than a literal reading. Indeed, the testimony before the defendant reveals that Laviano\u2019s letter was merely a written memorialization of the position of Cox and the students as expressed in prior conversations with Larson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b181-5\"> We further note that during the legislative deliberations prior to the enactment of Public Acts 1977, No. 77-609 (now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a [e] [2]), an amendment was offered that would have restricted the meaning of pending claims to include only pending \u201cclaims\u201d for which \u201clegal notice has been filed.\u201d Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Government Administration &amp; Policy, Pt. 2,1977 Sess., p. 423. The amendment would have narrowed the scope of \u201cpending claims\u201d in a manner similar to that proposed by the defendant in the present case. The amendment, however, was defeated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b182-7\"> The defendant further claimed that, because no claim was \u201cpending,\u201d there was nothing to which the board could be a party. General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (2). This claim is disposed of by our determination that there was a pending claim, directed at the board. The board, therefore, was a party to the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\"> The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court incorrectly ruled that the board could avail itself of General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (e) (5), which permits the discussion, in executive session, of \u201cany matter which would result in the disclosure of public records or the information contained therein\u201d including \u201ccommunications privileged by the attorney-client relationship.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (b) (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Having already determined that there was an adequate legal basis for the executive session, namely, the discussion of strategy or negotiation with respect to a pending claim to which the board was a party, we need not consider the merits of this alternative legal basis for the executive session.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
