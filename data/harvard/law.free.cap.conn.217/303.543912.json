J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARK\">The principal issue in this appeal is the scope of the taxing authority retained by a town\u2019s board of selectmen after the town\u2019s electors have voted to reject town budgets recommended by the town\u2019s board of finance. The plaintiff, William Moshier, a taxpayer of the town of Old Saybrook,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a complaint alleging that, because the town\u2019s electors had defeated four proposed 1990-91 budgets, the defendants, the town\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>board of selectmen,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> should be enjoined from collecting any taxes in accordance with a July 18, 1990 tax levy based on estimated unreimbursed expenditures for the 1990-91 fiscal year. After a hearing, the trial court issued an order temporarily enjoining the defendants from collecting any taxes. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendants received permission to file an immediate expedited appeal from this interlocutory order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We now reverse the judgment of the trial court and direct that judgment be rendered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On October 25,1990, subsequent to the filing of the defendants\u2019 appeal, the electors of the town approved a 1990-91 fiscal year budget. Pursuant to the new budget, the town\u2019s board of finance that same day set a new mill rate identical to that which had earlier been established in the defendants\u2019 contested rate bill of July 18,1990.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since the plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not challenge the validity of .the October 25 budget or the new mill rate, the first issue that we must decide is whether the defendants\u2019 appeal must be dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The standards governing mootness are well established. Because this court has no jurisdiction to give advisory opinions, no appeal can be decided on its merits in the absence of an actual controversy for which judicial relief can be granted. <em>Sobocinski </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>213 Conn. 126,134-35, 566 A.2d 703 (1989); <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>197 Conn. 566, 571, 499 A.2d 1158 (1985); <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>186 Conn. 247, 249-50, 440 A.2d 310 (1982); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number><em>Connecticut Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>International Ladies Garment Workers Union, </em>177 Conn. 17, 19, 411 A.2d 1 (1979); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vroom, </em>130 Conn. 512, 515, 36 A.2d 22 (1944). The mill rate that the trial court\u2019s interlocutory injunction rendered unenforceable has now been validated, for the future, by the action of the town\u2019s electors. This ratifying action, which indubitably requires dissolution of the injunction against collecting further taxes, raises a serious question about the continued viability of any part of the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The parties in their briefs urge us nonetheless to reach the merits of the appeal on the theory that this case is an instance of a moot question that is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d See <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 148-49, 96 S. Ct. 347, 46 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1975); <em>Sobocinski </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 135; <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 437, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981). In deciding whether to invoke this mitigating principle, we have considered not only the practical difficulties of timely judicial review but also \u201c(1) the public importance of the question presented; (2) the potential effect of the ruling on an ongoing program of the state\u2019s penal or civil system; and (3) the possibility of a similar effect on the plaintiff himself in the future.\u201d <em>Shays </em>v. <em>Local Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 572-73; <em>Waterbury Hospital </em>v. <em>Connecticut Health Care Associates, </em>supra, 253 n.5; <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra. The present appeal does not satisfy either of the latter two criteria: no ongoing program of the state is at issue and the future relationship between this taxpayer and his town\u2019s budgets is speculative at best. Although straitened economic times may portend increased taxpayer resistance to rising property tax rates, that political fact of life does not, in and of itself, prevent an appeal from becoming moot if no actual or practical relief can follow from our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>At oral argument, however, the plaintiff suggested a practical consequence that might attach to a decision in this appeal. Having failed to pay the local taxes as assessed, the amount of his liability for interest will depend upon the date on which the effective mill rate was legally set. Because his interest liability will be greater if the defendants had the independent authority to set the mill rate in July than if that authority depended upon the favorable town referendum in October, he claims that the defendants\u2019 appeal is not moot. The defendants have not challenged the accuracy of the plaintiff\u2019s representation about his tax delinquency or its consequences. Taking this fact in conjunction with the importance of the issue raised, and the difficulty of timely appellate review, we conclude that the relief we might grant is not so de minimis as to require us to dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On the merits, the dispositive issue is one of statutory construction. The defendants contend that, despite four town referenda rejecting budgets proposed by the town\u2019s board of finance, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-344 and 12-123<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> authorized them to set a mill rate and to levy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>taxes based on an informed estimate concerning projected town expenditures <em>for 1990-91. </em>Relying on figures generated by the board of finance about estimated expenditures, reduced by estimated revenues from nontax sources and adjusted for the estimated collection rate, they determined that a mill rate of 13.5 would generate the necessary tax revenues.* **<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff has challenged neither the mathematical accuracy of the defendants\u2019 calculations nor the necessity of the expenditures proposed to be financed. He maintains instead that General Statutes \u00a7 7-405<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> limited the scope of the defendants\u2019 authority to the setting of interim budgets based on the line item limits <em>for 1989-90. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>trial court, agreeing with the plaintiff, concluded that \u201c[t]he board of selectmen was in error in adopting the board of finance\u2019s recommendation of July, 1990. The board of selectmen should have adopted the budgetary items from the fiscal year 1989-90.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Only one Connecticut case has considered the scope of municipal authority to fix a mill rate in the face of formal rejection of a proposed town budget. In <em>State ex rel. Feigl </em>v. <em>Raacke, </em>32 Conn. Sup. 237, 241-44, 349 A.2d 150 (1975), the court construed \u00a7 12-123 to sustain the discretionary authority of a board of selectmen to establish a proper mill rate for current expenses in such circumstances. The court permitted the selectmen to base their mill rate on the operating budget earlier requested and recommended by the board of finance pursuant to \u00a7 7-344, even though that recommended budget had been disapproved by the town meeting. Id., 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The plaintiff contends that, even if we were inclined to follow <em>Feigl, </em>its holding has been undermined by subsequent statutory revision. When a town has failed \u201cto lay necessary taxes or to lay a tax . . . sufficient to pay the current expenses of such town,\u201d \u00a7 12-123 authorizes the town\u2019s selectmen to \u201cmake a rate bill upon its list last completed for the amount necessary, or for an amount sufficient to pay the deficit in such current expenses . . . .\u201d The plaintiff maintains that the meaning of \u201ccurrent expenses\u201d in \u00a7 12-123 must be determined by reference to a 1977 amendment to \u00a7 7-405. Public Acts 1977, No. 77-384. That section addresses the authority of a municipality\u2019s disbursing officers to make necessary expenditures whenever \u201cannual appropriations have not been made by a municipality before the beginning of any fiscal year.\u201d For the first ninety days, \u00a7 7-405 permits necessary expenditures to be made in accordance with amounts autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>rized by the municipal \u201cappropriating body or by the board of finance or other budget-making authority.\u201d After the initial ninety day period, however, \u00a7 7-405 limits even authorized disbursements to \u201cappropriations specified in budgetary line items for the previous fiscal year.\u201d When <em>Feigl </em>was decided, prior to the 1977 amendment to \u00a7 7-405, the statutes contained no provisions for ongoing municipal expenditures beyond the initial ninety day period. The plaintiff maintains that, since 1977, the authority conferred upon selectmen by \u00a7 12-123 to levy taxes to meet \u201ccurrent expenses\u201d must be read in pari materia with \u00a7 7-405 so as to permit only an initial ninety day budget and thereafter to permit only monthly determinations of a mill rate set by reference to \u201cbudgetary line items for the previous fiscal year.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The linchpin of the plaintiffs argument is his assertion that \u00a7\u00a7 12-123 and 7-405 jointly address and circumscribe the discretion of selectmen to levy taxes. The language of the two statutes belies this argument. The authority conferred upon selectmen by \u00a7 12-123 is on its face greater than that conferred upon disbursing officers by \u00a7 7-405. Under \u00a7 12-123, selectmen have unlimited authority to \u201cmake a rate bill upon [the] list last completed\u201d to pay necessary expenses when, as in this case, the town has \u201cfailed to lay necessary taxes.\u201d The selectmen\u2019s authority to remedy a deficit in funding for \u201ccurrent expenses\u201d arises only when the town has failed to lay a tax \u201csufficient to pay\u201d such expenses, i.e., when a budget properly voted is insufficient to meet town needs. There is nothing in \u00a7 12-123, read in its entirety, to suggest a limiting construction for \u201ccurrent expenses.\u201d Taxing authorities are generally afforded broad discretion in setting tax rates. 16 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 44.100, and cases therein cited. By contrast, nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in \u00a7 7-405 suggests that disbursing officers are granted, or should be granted, similarly broad authority. The legislative history of the 1977 amendment to \u00a7 7-405 makes clear that its purpose was to provide some flexibility for a board of finance to authorize interim disbursements after a ninety day temporary budgetary process had failed to produce a permanent budget. The constraints contained therein were not addressed to the taxing authority of the board of selectmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We are equally unpersuaded that the 1977 amendment to \u00a7 7-405 was a legislative effort to overturn <em>Feigl. </em>Had the legislature intended such a result, the logical path would have been to amend \u00a7 12-123 or \u00a7 7-344. Failing that, the legislative history would have disclosed some reference to <em>Feigl, </em>to an intent to limit the authority of boards of selectmen, or, finally, to a perceived connection between the amendment to \u00a7 7-405 and the unamended \u00a7 12-123 or \u00a7 7-344. The legislative record indicates, to the contrary, that the focus of the legislative deliberations was the scope of additional authority for interim financing that might be conferred on disbursing agents and boards of finance, and not the authority previously conferred on boards of selectmen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">We conclude that <em>Feigl </em>correctly construed \u00a7 12-123 as vesting broad statutory authority in boards of selectmen to set tax rates for their towns when the defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>of a town budget has created a fiscal vacuum. Despite voter disapproval, the legislature provided a mechanism by which presently accruing town bills could be met even if they exceeded a prior year\u2019s budgetary line item. Such a construction of \u00a7 12-123 does not leave a disapproving taxpayer remediless. In the event that a subsequently approved budget reduces the town\u2019s authorized expenditures, a taxpayer may be entitled to recover excess assessments or to claim a corresponding reduction in his tax bill for the following tax year. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-344; <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>178 Conn. 81, 85, 420 A.2d 1160 (1979). A taxpayer, however, has no statutory right to enjoin collection of taxes that are not an abuse of the broad discretion conferred upon boards of selectmen by \u00a7 12-123.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> Although the plaintiff sought to bring his action as a class action on behalf of all the taxpayers of the town of Old Saybrook, the trial court made no ruling concerning his request for class action certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-5\"> The defendants are Roger Goodnow, Carl Von Dassel and Robert Fish, individually and as the board of selectmen for the town of Old Saybrook, and Olive D.

The parties then agreed that moneys received by the tax collector between October 11,1990, the date of the injunction, and October 22,1990, the date of our order granting the stay, would be held in escrow pending the final resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> On October 25,1990, the electors of the town of Old Saybrook by referendum approved a 1990-91 budget in the amount of $17,152,153. That amount was $444,600 less than the disputed estimated expenditure figure of $17,596,753 used by the board of selectmen in setting a mill rate and levying a tax on July 18,1990. Following the adoption of the October 25, 1990 budget, the board of finance nonetheless set the same mill rate of 13.5 that had earlier been set by the board of selectmen. This choice of mill rate reflected decreases in projected revenues, downward adjustments to the grand list, and reconsideration of the propriety of forecasting a 95 percent collection rate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-344 provides in relevant part: \u201cappropriations, laying OF TAX. . . .

When annual appropriations have not been made by a municipality before the beginning of any fiscal year, the disbursing officers may make necessary expenditures during the period of ninety days after the beginning of such year on proper warrants for purposes and in amounts authorized by the appropriating body or by the board of finance or other budget-making authority. When annual appropriations have not been made by such municipality before the end of such ninety-day period, the disbursing officers may make necessary expenditures during successive monthly periods in such year on proper warrants for purposes and in amounts authorized by the appropriating body or by the board of finance or other budget-making authority within the limits of appropriations specified in budgetary line items for the previous fiscal year. For this purpose, necessary borrowing may be authorized by resolution of the budget-making authority, provided all such borrowing shall mature and be payable not later than the end of the fiscal year for which such borrowings are made. Any notes so authorized may be issued and sold in the manner provided by such resolution. Such expenditures authorized by this section and interest costs and other expenses incidental to any such borrowing shall constitute the first charges against appropriations for the fiscal year in which they are made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> Committee Bill No. 719, which was the legislative antecedent of Public Acts 1977, No. 77-384, \u00a7 1, amending General Statutes \u00a7 7-405, never purported to amend General Statutes \u00a7 12-123. Early versions of the committee bill contained differing authorizations for interim tax levies by boards of finance, either at the same rate as in the previous year, or at a higher rate needed to pay necessary expenditures. The legislative record does not reveal why all references to interim tax levies were deleted in the bill as finally enacted. Senator Audrey Beck, a sponsor of the bill in its final form, indicated, however, that the bill was concerned with the authority of boards of finance rather than that of boards of selectmen. 20 S.
