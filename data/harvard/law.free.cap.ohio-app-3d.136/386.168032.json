Because we conclude that the trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant in admitting the results of polygraph examinations and then failing to consider that evidence, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">As a result of an incident that occurred on a school bus, a complaint was filed against appellant alleging that he committed acts which, if an adult, would constitute aggravated menacing, in violation of R.C. 2903.21. At the adjudicative hearing before a magistrate, several witnesses testified. Chad Miller, the bus driver, stated that when he reached the last stop on his route, appellant made comments to him after being told of a change in appellant\u2019s drop-off location. As appellant left the bus, a hostile exchange occurred between him and Miller. According to the driver, appellant angrily called him names and threatened to \u201ckick [his] ass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Miller testified that appellant\u2019s mother arrived in her pickup truck shortly after the bus arrived at the drop-off location. She parked in the parking lot, some seventy-five to one hundred feet away from the bus. Appellant then exited the bus, walked a few feet away, and continued yelling at him, daring Miller to fight since they were \u201cnot on school property.\u201d Miller testified that he repeatedly told appellant to get into his mother\u2019s vehicle. Miller further testified that appellant threatened to \u201ckill him,\u201d and personally felt that appellant intended to seriously harm him. Ultimately, appellant turned and entered the truck. Miller stated that he was \u201camazed\u201d because he had never seen appellant act this way before. When Miller went over to talk with appellant\u2019s mother, he was, however, unable to discuss the problem due to appellant\u2019s agitated state. Miller then returned to his bus. He reported the incident to his supervisor and eventually filed a police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, appellant moved for dismissal, stating that the court lacked jurisdiction since the state had failed to put forth evidence of appellant\u2019s age. The magistrate granted appellant\u2019s motion. Pursuant to objections filed by the state, the juvenile court, nevertheless, reinstated the case, ruling that appellant\u2019s age was not an essential element of the crime alleged and that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction over the case simply by the failure to present evidence of appellant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">At a subsequent hearing, appellant\u2019s mother testified that she arrived at the drop-off point at approximately the same time as the bus and parked only fifteen feet away from the bus. She noticed that appellant and the driver were conversing before appellant left the bus. She testified that as appellant walked away from the bus, Miller came to the bus door and yelled at her son, \u201cJust get in the truck.\u201d According to the mother, appellant then stopped approximately ten feet away from the bus, turned and said \u201cWell, you can\u2019t make me. I\u2019m not on school property.\u201d The driver again told appellant to get in the truck or he was going to have a problem. Miller then turned back to the bus and said he was going to call the Sheriffs Department. Appellant then allegedly said, \u201cFine. Go ahead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">According to appellant\u2019s mother, appellant then sat in the truck. Miller left the bus and hurried over to the driver side of the truck. Appellant\u2019s mother stated that Miller was very agitated and aggressive toward appellant. She said Miller did not appear frightened, but followed appellant who had walked away and entered the truck. Appellant\u2019s mother said that Miller stuck his head into her window and continued the confrontation, telling appellant \u2018Well. You made a big mistake this time.\u201d She stated that she asked Miller to calm down and explain what was going on. However, she said that neither appellant nor Miller would respond. Miller allegedly would not look at her or tell her what was wrong, but just told appellant again that he had made a big mistake. Appellant replied \u2018Well, what are you going to do about it?\u201d Miller replied \u201cWell, you will find out on the bus tomorrow.\u201d Appellant\u2019s mother then closed the truck\u2019s window and drove away. Appellant\u2019s mother stated that she never heard appellant threaten Miller in any way. Appellant\u2019s mother also testified that she spoke with Miller later that day and was told that he would not be filing a police report, but that a meeting with appellant\u2019s parents to address the incident would take place at school the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Appellant testified that when the bus arrived at his stop, he had been closing the bus windows. He claimed that he was talking quietly to himself when Miller questioned him as to what he had said. After appellant told Miller that he was just talking to himself, Miller allegedly said \u201cNext time you talk to yourself, keep your mouth shut.\u201d Appellant said he then got off the bus and, when he stopped a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>couple car lengths from the bus, the driver yelled for him to get in the truck or he would have trouble. Appellant admitted telling Miller that he could not do anything because they were not on school property. Miller then ordered him into the truck or he would have a problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">When appellant asked what he was going to do, Miller informed him he would call the sheriff. Appellant stated: \u201cGo ahead.\u201d and \u201cWe can settle this right now.\u201d Miller then came to the driver\u2019s side window, of the truck screaming \u201cYou made a big mistake now.\u201d Appellant stated that Miller did not look or act scared but just kept yelling at him. Appellant stated that he had no idea why Miller became so agitated and denied that he swore at Miller or threatened to \u201ckill\u201d or \u201cbeat [him] up.\u201d Appellant also testified that he had taken a polygraph test which corroborated the facts that he had never threatened Miller or used foul language.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Appellant\u2019s therapist, who testified out of sequence during the previous hearing, stated that appellant had been taking medication and dealing with his behavior issues. The therapist opined that it was extremely out of character that appellant would have spoken and acted in the manner described by the driver. The therapist also noted that appellant\u2019s mother did not \u201ccover\u201d for her son and was straightforward in dealing with her son\u2019s behavior issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The magistrate then issued a decision, essentially finding that appellant\u2019s version of the incident, insofar as it conflicted with the driver\u2019s, was not credible. The magistrate gave no weight to appellant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s polygraph results pursuant to admissibility requirements, despite a stipulation by all the parties that they were admissible. Appellant\u2019s objections to the decision were overruled and the juvenile court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Appellant now appeals this judgment, setting forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201c1. The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant by denying the motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the state\u2019s case in chief where the state failed to prove the age of the defendant, which is an essential element that must be proven at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">\u201c2. The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant by not permitting the admission of the results of the polygrapher when the admission of the polygraph results had been stipulated by the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction over him since the state failed to present evidence of his age. We find no merit in this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>A court has jurisdiction to rule on a controversy between parties if it has obtained personal jurisdiction over the parties and possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the parties\u2019 claims. The subject matter jurisdiction of a court is a court\u2019s \u201cpower to hear and decide a case upon its merits[.]\u201d <em>Morrison v. Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 86, 61 O.O.2d 335, 290 N.E.2d 841, paragraph one of the syllabus. A court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is invoked by the filing of a complaint. See <em>Wilson v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 496, 499, 597 N.E.2d 1148, 1149-1150. Once a court of competent jurisdiction acquires jurisdiction over an action, its authority continues until a final judgment on the merits of the dispute before it has been issued. <em>John Weenink &amp; Sons Co. v. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1948), 150 Ohio St. 349, 38 O.O. 189, 82 N.E.2d 730, paragraph three of the syllabus. The defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived. <em>Time Warner AxS v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 229, 233, 661 N.E.2d 1097, 1101. Objections based upon lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, <em>In re Byard </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 294, 296, 658 N.E.2d 735, 737, and may even be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Jenkins v. Keller </em>(1966), 6 Ohio St.2d 122, 35 O.O.2d 147, 216 N.E.2d 379, paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In contrast, personal jurisdiction can be waived. Civ.R. 12(H). A court obtains personal jurisdiction over a defendant by service of process, or by the defendant\u2019s voluntary appearance or actions. <em>Maryhew v. Yova </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 154, 156, 11 OBR 471, 472-473, 464 N.E.2d 538, 540-541. Thus, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction is waived if it is not raised in a responsive pleading or in a motion filed prior to the answer. Civ.R. 12(B) and (H); see also <em>Franklin v. Franklin </em>(1981), 5 Ohio App.3d 74, 76, 5 OBR 186, 188-189, 449 N.E.2d 457, 459-460.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">We will now specifically examine the question of jurisdiction of the juvenile court in the present case. A juvenile court has exclusive original subject matter jurisdiction under the Revised Code concerning children who are alleged to be delinquent or who have been placed under arrest. R.C. 2151.23(A)(1) and (8); 2151.31(A)(2); <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 40, 43, 652 N.E.2d 196, 198-199. R.C. 2151.02(A) provides that a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d is any child who \u201cviolates any law * * * which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d A \u201cchild\u201d is defined for purposes of the instant case by R.C. 2151.011(B)(1) as a person who is under the age of eighteen years at the time of his commission of an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\"> Since the complaint in this case alleged appellant to be a delinquent child, the juvenile court had subject matter jurisdiction. Appellant is not, however, arguing that he was in fact over the age of eighteen. Therefore, he is not challenging the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, he is, in reality, contending that the court had no personal jurisdiction because appellee failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>present evidence at trial of his age. Since appellant failed to challenge personal jurisdiction either in a responsive pleading or a motion prior to his answer, he waived any defense based upon personal jurisdiction. Moreover, because appellant was, in fact, under eighteen at the time of the offense, any such motion would have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Appellant may also be arguing that appellee failed to establish his age which is an essential element to prove a delinquency charge. This argument is basically a sufficiency of the evidence issue. However, in our view, once a trial court has properly established subject matter and personal jurisdiction over an alleged juvenile offender, additional evidence of the juvenile\u2019s age is not essential to a finding of delinquency, unless one of the elements of the adult crime alleged requires specific proof of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Appellant, in his second assignment of error, contends that trial court erred in excluding the polygraph results which had been stipulated to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The admission or exclusion of evidence is generally left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 265, 15 OBR 379, 401-402, 473 N.E.2d 768, 791-792. Polygraph results may be admitted for corroboration or impeachment if all parties sign a written stipulation as to the admission of the results and the examiner\u2019s opinion and if the trial court then finds that the examiner is qualified and the test was properly conducted. <em>State v. Souel </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 123, 7 O.O.3d 207, 372 N.E.2d 1318, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">In this case, the record reveals that the parties stipulated to the admission of the test results and, without further inquiry, the magistrate did, in fact, admit those exhibits. Nevertheless, the magistrate later decided to give those results no weight based only upon the <em>admissibility </em>requirements of <em>Souel. </em>In other words, the magistrate admitted the evidence and then, essentially revoked that admission, without providing appellant the opportunity to object or respond to concerns regarding the examiner\u2019s qualifications or other conditions pertaining to the test. In our view, this was a clear abuse of discretion. Once the test results were admitted, the magistrate was then bound to consider them. Moreover, we cannot say that such an error was harmless since the polygraph results had a direct bearing on appellant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s credibility, the central issue of the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">We must also note here that the magistrate\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact\u201d were not actually true findings, but rather merely a summary of the testimony presented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In addition the magistrate\u2019s finding that appellant\u2019s version of the incident not credible to \u201cthe extent that [appellant\u2019s] testimony conflicts with that of Mr. Miller * * * \u201d is confusing at best. We conclude that the magistrate\u2019s decision does not adequately indicate which specific details the magistrate found to be in conflict. Therefore, to properly indicate the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact, the decision should be corrected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The judgment of the Ottawa County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed and the cause is remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-8\">Melvin L.
