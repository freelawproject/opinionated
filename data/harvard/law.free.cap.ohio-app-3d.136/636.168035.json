The charges arose from the death of appellant\u2019s stepfather, Harry Sisco, on September 15, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">A jury trial commenced on September 1,1998. The jury found appellant guilty as charged except for the grand theft count where the jury found appellant guilty of the lesser included offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2913.03. By judgment entry filed September 24, 1998, the trial court sentenced appellant on the aggravated murder conviction to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after twenty years, plus eight years mandatory incarceration for the firearm specifications, to be served consecutively. The trial court also sentenced appellant to terms of seventeen months and eleven months for fleeing and eluding and having a weapon while under disability to be served consecutively to the aggravated murder sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">\u201cI. Defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated when the prosecution submitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to silence and emphasized that invocation in closing argument. This violated defendant\u2019s rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments under the United States Constitution and Article I, [Sections] 2, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in admitting cumulative, extensive inadmissible hearsay evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in violation of the evidence rules. The admission of these statements violated appellant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him and violated both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">\u201cHI. Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, [Sections] 2, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution by numerous acts and omissions of his trial counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred in modifying appellant\u2019s sentence outside of his presence in violation of Crim.R. 43 and the guarantees of both the federal and state constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>\u201cV. The trial court erred in instructing the jury in response to a question during deliberations, the court\u2019s instruction was incorrect and denied appellant a fair trial. Further, the record is unclear as to what each question was or the answers that were ultimately given and thus denies appellant proper appellate review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">\u201cVI. The trial court erred when it empaneled an anonymous jury in the absence of any evidence or findings that an anonymous jury was necessary in this case, thereby committing structural error in violation of appellant\u2019s due process rights under the United States Constitution, including his right to the presumption of innocence, and his right to a fair and impartial jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Appellant claims the state improperly introduced evidence of his invocation of his right to remain silent and improperly emphasized such during closing argument. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">On direct examination, Detective David Bailey of the Lancaster Police Department testified as follows to his pre-interview (interview prior to tape recorded statement) with appellant and what appellant said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">\u201cQ. And during that pre-interview, when you confronted him [appellant] about the homicide, the murder of Harry Sisco, what, if anything, did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">\u201cA. I told him that Harry Sisco was the victim of a shooting homicide and he told me that\u2019s the first time that he heard it, that that had taken place. I then confronted him with some of the meager information that I had at that point about him being seen in the area, also about the argument prior to the homicide. And his exact words to me at that point were, \u2018You do what the fuck you have to. I\u2019m not saying anything.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">The state then attempted to play appellant\u2019s tape recorded statement to the jury. Defense counsel objected claiming appellant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights had been violated. Defense counsel argued once appellant refused to talk, Bailey should have stopped the interview. The trial court recessed the jury and permitted a voir dire of Bailey regarding the circumstances surrounding the interview. Following the voir dire proceeding and argument from counsel, the trial court suppressed the entire tape recorded statement, ruling that:</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">\u201cWith the above case law in mind and considering the facts at bar, it appears that the Defendant\u2019s statement, T am not saying anything else,\u2019 is comparable to that of the Defendant Mosely\u2019s statement, and would comport with the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s requirement of an affirmative statement by the suspect to terminate the interrogation. Moreover, the interrogating officer in this case stated in the suppression hearing that he understood the suspect\u2019s statement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>mean that he was asserting his right to silence with regard to the murder. Thus, the officer understood * * * that the Defendant was asserting his privilege against self-incrimination. It seems clear that based upon <em>Mosely </em>and upon several Ohio cases cited herein, that the Defendant did rescind his prior waiver, and pursuant to Miranda, the questioning should have ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">\u201cIt is important to note that unlike the <em>Mosely </em>facts where the officers honored the suspect\u2019s desire to remain silent only reinitiating questioning after a significant period of time and after obtaining a fresh waiver from the suspect, the interrogating officer in this case, sub judice, did not suspend the questioning, nor did he readvise the Defendant of his rights prior to immediately continuing the recorded interrogation. Accordingly, in the absence of such measures required under <em>Mosely, </em>the Defendant\u2019s statements subsequent to his rescission of the waiver must be suppressed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Because of the unusual procedure <em>sub judice, </em>the jury heard appellant\u2019s request to terminate the interrogation before the trial court ruled on the motion to suppress. We note prior to the ruling that the state did not violate any <em>Miranda </em>ruling because none had been made. Although the trial court suppressed the tape recorded statement, the trial court permitted appellant\u2019s preinterview statements up to the point where appellant had said \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The jury was then returned to the courtroom. No limiting instruction was given to the jury nor was any requested. Bailey resumed the stand. During his testimony, the state again brought up appellant\u2019s pre-interview statements and specifically elicited appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">\u201cA. Near the end of the early interview of the non-taped interview, I explained to him that Harry Sisco had died of a homicidal shooting and I told him that witnesses had placed him at the scene and that witnesses had discussed a serious argument or disagreement. And then I asked him if he was involved in it, and that\u2019s when the response occurred that I mentioned yesterday, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">\u201cQ. And do you recall what that response was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-10\">\u201cA. That response was, \u2018Do you what the fuck you have to do. I\u2019m not saying anything.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-11\">\u201cQ. And what was his demeanor at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">\u201cA. It had changed from sort of anxious and nervous to hostile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">At no time did appellant take the witness stand. During closing argument, the state argued appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-14\">\u201cAnd David Bailey told you, when he started asking him questions about what had happened to Harry Sisco, the tenor of the conversation changed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Defendant became hostile, is the way he described it. It changed. And I believe it was something to the effect of, \u2018You do whatever the fuck you have to do. I\u2019m not saying anything.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Defense counsel did not object to these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield </em>(1986), 474 U.S. 284, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Doyle v. Ohio </em>(1976), 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, noting \u201c[i]n <em>Doyle, </em>we held that <em>Miranda </em>warnings contain an implied promise, rooted in the Constitution, that \u2018silence will carry no penalty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wainwright </em>at 295, 106 S.Ct. at 640, 88 L.Ed.2d at 632, quoting <em>Doyle </em>at 618, 96 S.Ct. at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98. The <em>Wainwright </em>court stated at 295, 106 S.Ct. at 640, 88 L.Ed.2d at 632, that \u201c[w]hat is impermissible is the evidentiary use of an individual\u2019s exercise of his constitutional rights after the State\u2019s assurance that the invocation of those rights will not be penalized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 70, 512 N.E.2d 581, the Supreme Court of Ohio, in reviewing a case wherein the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to silence was commented upon without objection, discussed at length the <em>Wainwright </em>and <em>Doyle </em>decisions and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-8\">\u201cWe note that federal courts, in applying the plain or harmless error analysis in cases where there had been <em>Doyle </em>violations, with near unanimity, have held such to be violative of due process and therefore prejudicial, requiring a reversal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">We find the fact scenario <em>sub judice </em>to be tantamount to a <em>Doyle </em>violation. The trial court specifically ordered that the state could only argue and present evidence up to appellant\u2019s remark invoking his right to remain silent. The state, after that admonition, elicited the remark again. The state then commented on appellant\u2019s invocation during closing argument and rebuttal. In its closing argument, the state asked the jury \u201c[w]hat does your common sense tell you about these statements the Defendant is making?\u201d The entire tenor of the state\u2019s closing argument focused on appellant\u2019s actions on the day of the incident as testified to by numerous witnesses and appellant\u2019s inability to recall the day\u2019s events as testified to by Bailey. There was no reason to comment upon appellant\u2019s invocation except to emphasize appellant\u2019s guilt and refusal to incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-10\">Upon review, we conclude it was plain error to permit testimony and argument on appellant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">Assignment of Error I is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Appellant claims the trial court erred in using the anonymous juror system. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The anonymous juror system as applied <em>sub judice </em>did not permit trial counsel to know the name and addresses of the venire. In fact, the jury verdict forms in the file have all the signatures blocked out. The verdict forms with the jurors\u2019 signatures were sealed and were not examined by trial counsel after the verdicts were read.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">During voir dire, the trial court explained to the venire they were being referred to by number \u201cfor your anonymity, your privacy.\u201d The trial court explained \u201ca year or so ago, the Court decided \u2014 the Judges decided that a number of jurors asked to remain anonymous.\u201d During the actual questioning of the jurors, the trial court and counsel used juror questionnaires.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No one was questioned as to their name or address. Jurors were asked their familiarity with the scene of the offense, the witnesses and the lawyers, and their employment. The trial court did not attempt to limit the questioning in any other matters except for the names and addresses of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Defense counsel did not object to this process or to the venire, and did not use all of his peremptory challenges. As a result of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object, we must review this issue under one of two standards. The state argues the plain error standard should prevail. See, Crim.R. 52(B). In order to prevail under a plain error analysis, appellant bears the burden of demonstrating the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804. As a result of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object and use all of his peremptory challenges, we find appellant cannot demonstrate plain error. Appellant argues the appropriate standard of review is under the doctrine of \u201cstructural error.\u201d In support, appellant cites the case of <em>State v. Esparza </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 660, 661, 660 N.E.2d 1194, 1196, wherein the Supreme Court of Ohio stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201cIn <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302, the United States Supreme Court distinguished between two types of constitutional error: \u2018trial error\u2019 and \u2018structural error.\u2019 Trial error \u2018occurfs] during the presentation of the case to the jury, and * '* * may therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 499 U.S. at 307-308, 111 S.Ct. at 1264, 113 L.Ed.2d at 330. Structural error affects \u2018the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end\u2019 as well as \u2018the framework <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>within which the trial proceeds.\u2019 Such errors \u2018defy analysis, by \u201charmless-error\u201d standards.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 309-310, 111 S.Ct. at 1265, 113 L.Ed.2d at 331.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The question to be resolved is whether the <em>per se </em>rule of the trial court to use the anonymous jury system is a structural error. We answer the question in the affirmative for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">In Ohio, the sanctity of the jury system has been staunchly defended as courts have held true to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Sections 5 and 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. In 1853, Justice Ranney, writing for the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Work v. State of Ohio </em>(1853), 2 Ohio St. 296, 303, noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cIt thus appears that persons accused of crime have, for every moment of time since civil government existed within the territory of this state, by fundamental laws, been secured in the right of trial by jury. An institution that has so long stood trying tests of time and experience, that has so long been guarded with scrupulous care, and commanded the admiration of so many of the wise and good, justly demands our jealous scrutiny when innovations are attempted to be made upon it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Because there are no Ohio cases to give us guidance on this issue, we must look to the federal courts. In writing for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Krout </em>(C.A.5, 1995), 66 F.3d 1420, 1427, Judge Edith H. Jones stated that \u201cthe decision to empanel an anonymous jury * * * is a drastic measure, which should be undertaken only in limited and carefully delineated circumstances.\u201d Federal courts have sanctioned anonymous juries when \u2018 \u201cthere is a strong reason to believe the jury needs protection\u201d and the district court \u201ctak[es] reasonable precautions to minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant and to ensure that his fundamental rights are protected.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1427, quoting <em>United States v. Wong </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 40 F.3d 1347, 1376. The <em>Krout </em>court at 1427 set forth the following factors that may justify the use of an anonymous jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">\u201cFactors that may justify jury protection by anonymity include: (1) the defendants\u2019 involvement in organized crime; (2) the defendants\u2019 participation in a group with the capacity to .harm jurors; (3) the defendants\u2019 past attempts to interfere with the judicial process or witnesses; (4) the potential that, if convicted, the defendants will suffer a lengthy incarceration and substantial monetary penalties; and, (5) extensive publicity that could enhance the possibility that jurors\u2019 names would become public and expose them to intimidation and harassment. <em>United States v. Paccione, </em>949 F.2d at 1192; <em>United States v. Amuso, </em>21 F.3d at 1264-65; <em>United States v. Ross, </em>33 F.3d at 1520. Furthermore, as a caution that use of anonymous juries will remain a device of last resort, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>necessary that the district court base its decision on more than mere allegations or inferences of potential risk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">These factors have been consistently applied in our federal court and others. See, <em>United States v. Sanchez </em>(C.A.5, 1996), 74 F.3d 562; <em>United States v. Talley </em>(C.A.6, 1999), 164 F.3d 989,.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>no specific factors were considered in deciding to use the anonymous jury. The anonymous jury system is a rule of court used in all jury trials in the Court of Common Pleas for Fairfield County, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The anonymous jury system is a significant alteration to the way jury trials have been conducted in this state. Although not contained in the record, one can theorize this carte blanche anonymous jury system is a result of the trial court\u2019s concern for accommodating jurors who may be hesitant or timid about jury service. Although the concern exhibited by the trial court is laudable in some respects, it nonetheless flies in the face of history, precedent, custom and the federal cases cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The empaneling of a jury is the first step in the commencement of the actual trial. It is from the venire that citizens of our state pick the jury of their peers. To deny citizens the right to know the names and addresses of their potential peers affects the entire trial from beginning to end and is indeed a structural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">An argument can be made that if a trial court permits lenient questioning, as in this case, there is no reason to know a potential juror\u2019s name or address. We disagree with this argument in that there are many times when the neighborhood where a juror lives could significantly impact on the use of a peremptory challenge in selecting a peer <em>i.e., </em>if a neighborhood is a high or low crime area. As the state pointed out during oral argument, there are many times the state is interested in names of potential jurors in determining the use of challenges and in testing the credibility to certain questions. As an example, the state might want to know if a juror is the relative of someone aggrieved by some prior prosecutorial action. The name of the juror might be very helpful in this respect. Also, many times faces are not familiar but names may ring a bell or sound an alarm that a juror should be questioned further.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">We concur with the statement by Justice Ranney that any change to the jury system deserves \u201cour jealous scrutiny.\u201d Absent any particularized need as delineated in the federal cases cited <em>supra, </em>and conscious of the right to trial by jury as the foundation of our civil and criminal justice system in Ohio, we find the trial court erred in using the anonymous jury system. This structural error necessitates a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Assignment of Error VI is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>II, III, iv, v</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Based upon our decision in Assignments of Error I and VI, we find these assignments to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County, Ohio is hereby reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A0S\">Gwin, P.J. and Hoffman, J. concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\">.
