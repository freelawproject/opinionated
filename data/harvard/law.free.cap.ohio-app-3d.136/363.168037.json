In the first appeal, this court held that the property owner owed no duty to appellant El\u00edseo Cefaratti. <em>Cefaratti v. Mason Structural Steel Co., Inc. </em>(May 22, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70971, unreported, 1997 WL 272876. The Ohio Supreme Court reversed that decision and returned the matter to the trial court to rethink <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Cefaratti </em>in light of its decision in <em>Sopkovich v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 628, 693 N.E.2d 233. See <em>Cefaratti v. Mason Structural Steel Co. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 121, 694 N.E.2d 915. The trial court again granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Panzica Construction Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">We now review, in this accelerated appeal, appellant\u2019s sole assigned error that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to appellee in view of <em>Sopkovich. </em>We agree and note that in an accelerated appeal, App.R. 11.1 allows for our decision to be in brief, conclusory form. Consequently, this opinion will not contain a \u201ccomprehensive exposition of our reasons\u201d for reversing the trial court\u2019s decision. See <em>Crawford v. Eastland Shopping Mall </em>Assoc. (1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 158, 11 OBR 240, 463 N.E.2d 655. Cefaratti assigns the following error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting summary judgment since there exist genuine issues of material fact under <em>Sopkovich v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>and other existing case law. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Having reviewed the record and the legal arguments of the parties, we reverse the decision of the trial court. The apposite facts follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Cefaratti, an employee of independent subcontractor American Piping, fell from a stairwell while installing pipes at appellee\u2019s building construction site. Prior to the fall, appellee had a guard rail on the stairwell, which evidenced an appreciation for the danger. However, appellee removed the rail without warning the workers to avoid the area. Appellee\u2019s removal of the rail \u201cinterfered with appellant\u2019s work by creating a condition that required him either to cease work altogether or to work in an unsafe area.\u201d <em>Cefaratti v. Mason Structural Steel Co. </em>(May 22, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70971, unreported, 1997 WL 272376 (Karpinski, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In light of the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s remand of <em>Cefaratti, </em>the issue for us in this accelerated appeal is whether appellee retained control over a critical variable in the workplace and, therefore, is liable for the injuries sustained by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">In <em>Sopkovich v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio refined the law on the liability of general contractors in Ohio. In <em>Sopkovich, </em>the court held that a general contractor can be held liable to the independent contractor\u2019s employees if (1) the general contractor exercises control over the work activities or (2) the general contractor retains control over a critical variable in the workplace. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 693 N.E.2d at 243-244.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">In the instant case, appellant asserts that appellee, as the general contractor, retained and exercised exclusive control over a critical variable in the working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>environment, <em>ie., </em>the metal staircase frame, without temporary safety railing. Appellant notes that temporary safety railing is required by OSHA, the Ohio Administrative Code, and the industry custom. However, appellant alleges that appellee removed the temporary safety railing and that appellant's accident occurred before appellee installed the permanent railings.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We find that, notwithstanding the fact that appellee did not actively participate in the specific job activities of appellant, there is still a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellee is responsible for the absence of guard railing and whether the absence of guard railing constituted a critical variable in the workplace. Appellant has presented evidence, sufficient to defeat a motion for summary judgment, that appellee retained control over the staircase (without railing) and that this was a critical variable in the workplace. Thus, pursuant to <em>Sopkovieh, </em>summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Consequently, these facts are not controlled by the work-activities cases of <em>Cafferkey v. Turner Constr. Co. </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 110, 21 OBR 416, 488 N.E.2d 189; <em>Wellman v. E. Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 103, 51 O.O. 27, 113 N.E.2d 629; and <em>Bond v. Howard Corp. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 332, 650 N.E.2d 416, but is a work environment case in line with <em>Sopkovieh </em>and <em>Hirschbach v. Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 206, 6 OBR 259, 452 N.E.2d 326. This case is a work environment case, which means the appellee controlled the danger, not the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b404-9\">Spellacy, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aaq\">O\u2019Donnell, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
