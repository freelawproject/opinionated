We dismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">On July 6, 1998, a magistrate\u2019s decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law was journalized in the court of common pleas. That decision found that the covenant not to compete in appellee Dennis Harkai\u2019s employment agreement with appellant was unreasonable and should be modified to restrict competition for eighteen months, a shorter period of time than that stated in the agreement. The magistrate also directed Harkai\u2019s counsel to prepare a journal entry. The parties filed objections, and on September 23, 1998, the trial court journalized an order, which it captioned \u201cJudgment Entry\u201d and which affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review this case because the trial court has failed to enter a \u201cjudgment or final order\u201d that disposes of the issues before the court. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201c[c]ourts of appeals shall have such jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals.\u201d The September 23, 1998 order is not a \u201cjudgment or final order\u201d pursuant to the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, and judicial determinations that define our jurisdiction under the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Our jurisdictional analysis in this case begins with an examination of the definition of \u201cjudgments or final orders.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> states: \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is * * * [a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d Civ.R. 54(A) defines a \u201cjudgment\u201d as \u201cany order from which an appeal lies as provided in section 2505.02 of the Revised Code.\u201d For the purposes of determining our jurisdiction, therefore, \u201cjudgment\u201d and \u201cfinal order\u201d are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">R.C. 2505.02 is considered a \u201clegislative restatement\u201d of the judiciary\u2019s definition of a final order. <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pope </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 12, 16, 8 O.O.3d 7, 9, 374 N.E.2d 406, 409; <em>Klein v. Bendix-Westingkouse Automotive Air Brake Co. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 85, 86-87, 42 O.O.2d 283, 284, 234 N.E.2d 587, 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court has elaborated upon the statutory definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cFor an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for the party appealing, it must dispose of the whole merits of the cause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court.\u201d <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260, 1267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The courts have similarly described a \u201cjudgment\u201d: \u201cA judgment is the final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction upon matters submitted to it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Curran v. Brookes </em>(1943), 142 Ohio St. 107, 26 O.O. 287, 50 N.E.2d 995, paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cA final judgment is one which determines the merits of the case and makes an end to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110, 26 O.O. at 288, 50 N.E.2d at 998.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u201cA final judgment is one which operates to divest some right in such a manner as to put it beyond the power of the court making the order to place the parties in their original condition after the expiration of the term; that is, it must put the case out of court and must be final in all matters within the pleadings.\u201d <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Estate of Castrovince </em>(Aug. 16, 1996), Portage App. No. 96-P-0175, unreported, 1996 WL 1056815, citing <em>In re Thomas\u2019 Will </em>(1948), 84 Ohio App. 30, 39 O.O. 46, 84 N.E.2d 294. Regardless of whether an order is characterized as a \u201cfinal order\u201d or \u201cjudgment,\u201d the result is the same: if the order is final, the timely filing of a notice of appeal will divest the trial court of jurisdiction to alter the order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Yee v. Erie Cty. Sheriff\u2019s Dept. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 43, 44, 553 N.E.2d 1354, 1355; <em>In re Kurtzhalz </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 432, 25 O.O. 574, 48 N.E.2d 657, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">That is not to say that a trial court cannot change its judgment. All judgments are potentially voidable, either by the trial court itself or by an appellate court. <em>Eisenberg v. Peyton </em>(1978), 56 Ohio App.2d 144, 151, 10 O.O.3d 158, 163, 381 N.E.2d 1136, 1141; <em>Walker v. Walker </em>(Aug. 5, 1987), Summit App. No. 12978, unreported, 1987 WL 15591. Rules of procedure, however, limit the avenues through which a party may petition the trial court to change its own judgment. <em>In re Guardianship of Maurer </em>(1995), 108 Ohio App.3d 354, 357, 670 N.E.2d 1030, 1032; <em>Cale Products, Inc. v. Orrville Bronze &amp; Aluminum Co. </em>(1982), 8 Ohio App.3d 375, 8 OBR 489, 457 N.E.2d 854, paragraph one of the syllabus. For example, a party may file a Civ.R. 50(B) motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c) objections after entry of judgment, or a Civ.R. 59 motion for new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if a notice of appeal has been filed, the trial court will not have jurisdiction to rule on the motion absent a remand from the appellate court. See <em>Ford v. Tandy Transp., Inc. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 364, 383-384, 620 N.E.2d 996, 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The foregoing definitions stress that the primary function of a final order or judgment is the termination of a case or controversy that the parties have submitted to the trial court for resolution. This court must look to the language employed in the purported judgment entry to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s entry accomplishes that result. See <em>Peters v. Arbaugh </em>(1976), 50 Ohio App.2d 30, 32-33, 4 O.O.3d 17, 18-19, 361 N.E.2d 531, 533. One fundamental principle in the interpretation of judgments is that, to terminate the matter, the order must contain a statement of the relief that is being afforded the parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Reiter v. Reiter </em>(May 11, 1999), Hancock App. No. 5-98-32, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>unreported, 1999 WL 378354; <em>Pace v. Pace </em>(Oct. 8, 1996), Gallia App. No. 95 CA 17, unreported, 1996 WL 595846; <em>Martin v. Martin </em>(June 24, 1994), Portage App. No. 93-P-0065, unreported, 1994 WL 315667; <em>Walker v. Walker </em>(Aug. 5, 1987), Summit App. No. 12978, unreported, 1987 WL 15591; <em>Gaines v. Gaines </em>(Apr. 8, 1980), Greene App. No. 1109, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In <em>Walker, </em>this court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201c[T]he content of the judgment must be definite enough to be susceptible to further enforcement and provide sufficient information to enable the parties to understand the outcome of the case. If the judgment fails to speak to an area which was disputed, uses ambiguous or confusing language, or is otherwise indefinite, the parties and subsequent courts will be unable to determine how the parties\u2019 rights and obligations were fixed by the trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The characteristics of a judgment were similarly described in <em>In re Michael </em>(1991), 71 Ohio App.3d 727, 730, 595 N.E.2d 397, 399, quoting <em>Lavelle v. Cox </em>(Mar. 15, 1991), Trumbull App. No. 90-T-4396, unreported, 1991 WL 35642, (Ford, J., concurring) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">\u201c \u2018It is fundamental that the trial court employ diction which should include * * * operative, action-like and conclusionary verbiage * * *. Obviously, it is not necessary for such directive to be encyclopedic in character, but it should contain clear language to provide basic notice of rights, duties, and obligations.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">If the trial court intends to terminate the dispute between the parties, it must issue an entry that includes the \u201cprescription for action\u201d in the case. Walker, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Moreover, a \u201cjudgment\u201d must be distinguished from a \u201cdecision.\u201d See Sup.R. 7(A); Civ.R. 58(A); <em>William Cherry Trust v. Hofmann </em>(1985), 22 Ohio App.3d 100, 104, 22 OBR 288, 292, 489 N.E.2d 832, 835. Indeed, pursuant to Civ.R. 54(A), a judgment \u201cshall <em>not </em>contain a recital of pleadings, the magistrate\u2019s decision in a referred matter, or the record of prior proceedings.\u201d These matters are properly placed in the \u201cdecision.\u201d A decision announces what the judgment will be. The judgment entry unequivocally orders the relief. See <em>St. Vincent Charity Hosp. v. Mintz </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 121, 123, 515 N.E.2d 917, 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Having discussed the \u201cjudgment or final order\u201d element necessary to our jurisdiction under the Ohio Constitution, we now discuss the limitation on our jurisdiction to judgments or final orders of \u201ccourts of record.\u201d An order is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>order of a court of record unless certain formalities have been met. For example, a purported civil judgment must comply with Civ.R. 58(A), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201c[U]pon a general verdict of a jury, upon a decision announced, or upon the determination of a periodic payment plan, the court shall promptly cause the judgment to be prepared and, the court having signed it, the clerk shall thereupon enter it upon the journal. A judgment is effective only when entered by the clerk upon the journal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Only through compliance with Civ.R. 58(A) can an appellate court be certain that the order reflects judicial action. See <em>Peters v. Arbaugh, </em>50 Ohio App.2d at 35-36, 4 O.O.3d at 20-21, 361 N.E.2d at 534-535 (Whiteside, J., concurring). Moreover, compliance with Civ.R. 58(A) also ensures that the matter has been terminated. \u201cAbsent such entry, a \u2018judgment\u2019 that is merely pronounced is inchoate only. \u2018Though possessing the character of potentiality, it lacks the character of actuality, and hence is without probative force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horner v. Toledo Hosp. </em>(1993), 94 Ohio App.3d 282, 289, 640 N.E.2d 857, 862, quoting <em>Coe v. Erb </em>(1898), 59 Ohio St. 259, 263, 52 N.E. 640, 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The procedure prescribed by Civ.R. 53 fits neatly into this analysis. That rule permits the use of magistrates to assist courts in their judicial functions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">\u201cIt is the primary duty of the court, and not the referee, to act as a judicial officer. Indeed, the court must approve the referee\u2019s report and enter it upon its own record in order for that report to have any validity or binding effect. Civ. R. 53(E)(5). As was stated in the 1970 Staff Note to Civ. R. 53:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201c \u2018 * * * Rule 53 contemplates that a referee <em>shall aid the court </em>in the expedition of the court\u2019s business and <em>not be a substitute </em>for the functions of the court.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d <em>Normandy Place Assoc. v. Beyer </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 102, 105, 2 OBR 653, 655, 443 N.E.2d 161, 164.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cCiv.R. 53 places upon the court the ultimate authority and responsibility over the referee\u2019s findings and rulings. The court must undertake an independent review of the referee\u2019s report to determine any errors. * * * The findings of fact, conclusions of law, and other rulings of a referee before and during trial are all subject to the independent review of the trial judge. Thus, a referee\u2019s oversight of an issue or issues, even an entire trial, is not a substitute for the judicial functions but only an aid to them.\u201d <em>Hartt v. Munobe </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 3, 5-6, 615 N.E.2d 617, 620.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Thus, only a judge, not a magistrate, may terminate a claim or action by entering judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Whereas Civ.R. 53(C)(2) permits magistrates to enter certain interlocutory orders that \u201cregulate [the] proceedings,\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(1) permits a magistrate only to \u201cprepare, sign, and file a magistrate\u2019s <em>decision, </em>\u201d not a \u201cjudgment.\u201d See <em>Barker v. Barker </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 706, 711, 693 N.E.2d 1164, 1167. Once a magistrate\u2019s decision has been filed and served upon the parties, the trial court must then act upon the decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties are given the opportunity to object to the decision either before entry of judgment or within fourteen days thereafter. Although the judge entirely agrees with the decision of the magistrate, the judge must still separately enter his or her own judgment setting forth the outcome of the dispute and the remedy provided. See, <em>e.g., Wellborn v. K-Beck Furniture Mart, Inc. </em>(1977), 54 Ohio App.2d 65, 66, 8 O.O.3d 93, 94, 375 N.E.2d 61, 62; <em>Pace v. Pace </em>(Oct. 8, 1996), Gallia App. No. 95 CA 17, unreported, 1996 WL 595846. The judge is not permitted to conclude the case by simply referring to the magistrate\u2019s decision, even though it may appear more expedient to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Once an appellate court has determined that an order is \u201cfinal,\u201d it must also determine whether it is \u201cappealable.\u201d \u201c[A]ll final orders are not <em>ipso facto </em>appealable orders.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Pope, </em>54 Ohio St.2d at 16, 8 O.O.3d at 9, 374 N.E.2d at 409. The Ohio Constitution vests the Ohio Supreme Court with rule-making authority to \u201cprescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state.\u201d Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Those rules may not \u201cabridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 158, 159-160, 3 O.O.3d 174, 175, 359 N.E.2d 702, 703.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consistent therewith, R.C. 2505.03(C) states that \u201c[a]n appeal of a final order, judgment, or decree of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>shall be governed by the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\u201d Thus, an order may be final, thereby creating a right of appeal, but, nevertheless, cannot be reviewed unless the appeal is perfected pursuant to the Appellate Rules of Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">For example, App.R. 4 governs when a notice of appeal may be filed. App.R. 4(B)(5) provides that an order filed under Civ.R. 54(B) shall be appealed within thirty days from entry of the order. See, also, App.R. 4(A). Civ.R. 54(B) provides that a final order that disposes of fewer than all of the claims against all of the parties is not appealable unless the trial court certifies that there is \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d Unless the trial court so certifies, a court of appeals cannot yet exercise jurisdiction despite the finality of the order. See <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 89-90, 541 N.E.2d 64, 67-68. Conversely, although interlocutory orders are not final and, therefore, not <em>immediately </em>appealable, they may be reviewed by an appellate court after a final judgment has been entered. <em>DiLacqua v. DiLacqua </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 48, 57, 623 N.E.2d 118, 124, citing Whiteside, Ohio Appellate Practice (1991) 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The foregoing requirements are essential to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. Before this court can exercise its appellate jurisdiction to review any case, we must find that the order being appealed is (1) \u201cfinal\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, as further defined by case law; (2) issued by a \u201ccourt of record;\u201d that is, signed by the court and journalized; and (3) appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.03 and the Appellate Rules of Procedure. When reviewing whether the order is final, we ask whether the essential functions of a judgment have been fulfilled. Does the order terminate a claim between the parties' to the action? To do so, the order must contain a statement of the relief to which the parties are entitled. Does the order provide notice of the parties\u2019 rights, duties, and obligations? In this regard, the language used in the judgment must be sufficiently complete so that the parties can enforce their rights and obligations through execution on that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Although our authority to exercise jurisdiction depends upon a determination that a purported judgment meets the foregoing requirements, it is not always clear whether a particular order actually does so. The nature of the case and the type of relief granted necessarily dictates what language must be used to terminate the claim and render the order appealable. <em>Walker v. Walker, supra. </em>Every case must be determined on its own facts. <em>Millies v. Millies </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 43, 44, 1 O.O.3d 26, 27, 350 N.E.2d 675, 676.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In cases referred to a magistrate, the determination of appellate court jurisdiction is complicated by the trial court\u2019s use of form orders and boilerplate language that is intended to adopt a magistrate\u2019s decision and enter final judgment upon it simultaneously. In that situation, the appellate courts must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>differentiate between those requirements that affect appellate court jurisdiction, that is, entry of a judgment setting forth relief, and those that impose procedural requirements on the trial court, such as adoption of a magistrate\u2019s decision. See, generally, <em>Eisenberg v. Peyton, </em>56 Ohio App.2d at 148, 10 O.O.3d at 161, 381 N.E.2d at 1139.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the first instance, the absence of a final order or judgment precludes appellate review. In the second instance, provided there has been a final order or judgment entered, the filing of a notice of appeal in compliance with the appellate rules vests jurisdiction in the appellate court. If the appellate court finds that noncompliance with Civ.R. 53 procedures has resulted in prejudice to the parties, the trial court\u2019s judgment is voidable, and the court of appeals shall render its judgment accordingly. See <em>State ex rel. Lesher v. Kainrad </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 68, 71, 19 O.O.3d 261, 263, 417 N.E.2d 1382, 1384; <em>Eisenberg, </em>56 Ohio App.2d at 150-151, 10 O.O.3d at 162, 381 N.E.2d at 1141; <em>Walker v. Walker, supra; </em>See, generally, App.R. 12(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We turn now to the order entered by the trial court in this case. In its entirety, the order states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cThis matter came on for hearing on the 28th day of August, 1998, upon the Defendant\u2019s Objections to the Magistrate\u2019s decision filed July 6, 1998, the Supplement to Defendant\u2019s Objections, and the Plaintiffs Response thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201cUpon due consideration, the decision of the Magistrate is hereby AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201cSO ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The trial court most likely intended that this entry constitute the \u201cjudgment\u201d in the case. Indeed, it captioned the order \u201cJudgment Entry.\u201d It is the substance of the entry, however, that must control. See <em>St. Vincent Charity Hosp. v. Mintz, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 123, 515 N.E.2d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">As we stated in <em>Walker, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">\u201cWhat the referee does is not a judicial act. Therefore, can the judge by \u2018incorporating the referee\u2019s report\u2019 or by \u2018adopting the referee\u2019s report\u2019 raise the report to the status of a judicial act? The answer must be no. Aside from the fact that to do so would be the equivalent of allowing the referee to perform a judicial act, such incorporation or adoption of a judgment fails to meet the requirement of the certainty of judgments since it fails to disclose how the matter was resolved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Other courts have agreed that a trial court order stating <em>only </em>that it is adopting a magistrate\u2019s decision does not disclose how the trial court is resolving the issues submitted to it, and, therefore, is not final.

The trial court\u2019s statement that it \u201caffirms\u201d the magistrate\u2019s decision is not a statement of the relief ordered for the parties to remedy the dispute between them. Accordingly, this entry is not a judgment or final order from which an appeal might lie. Nor is this a post-judgment entry as contemplated by Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c). As noted above, after a magistrate\u2019s decision has been filed and served upon the parties, the trial court need not wait to enter judgment for the time period to pass for filing objections. Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c). The record in this case does not reveal a prior judgment entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">At this point, this court feels constrained to note that we have not consistently followed the reasoning set forth herein. Past decisions from this court have suggested that we do not have jurisdiction when the trial court has not explicitly stated whether it is \u201cadopting, modifying, or vacating\u201d a magistrate\u2019s decision or, if a prior judgment has been entered, whether it is \u201cvacating, modifying, or adhering to its prior judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We now retreat from that position.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the trial court\u2019s action on the magistrate\u2019s decision is not an essential element of a final order or judgment as defined by R.C. 2505.02, Civ.R. 54, Civ.R. 58, and the common law, it is not a jurisdictional prerequisite. This approach is consistent with the policy that the courts should liberally construe procedural rules to protect substantive rights and assist the parties in obtaining justice. <em>Maritime Mfrs., Inc. v.

To the extent that our prior decisions are inconsistent with the principles set forth in this opinion, those cases are overruled and shall no longer be given persuasive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

We do not discuss the other subsections of R.C. 2505.02 because they are not applicable to the instant case; in any appeal, however, an appellate court must determine, before it exercises jurisdiction, that the order is \"final\u201d under one of the subsections of that statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\">. If the order does not terminate the entire case, but only a distinct claim thereof, it must also contain an express certification pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B) in order to be immediately appealable. <em>Noble v.

Both <em>Normandy Place </em>and <em>Hartt </em>were cases that were decided by the Ohio Supreme Court prior to the 1995 amendment to Civ.R. 53. Regardless of the impact that the amendment has upon the extent of the review that a court must undertake, it did not eliminate the requirement that the court must enter its own judgment. Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c) requires the court, if it is adopting the magistrate's decision, to both adopt the decision <em>and </em>enter judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. The trial court has three options: (1) it \u201cmay adopt [the] magistrate's decision and enter judgment\u201d without waiting fourteen days for objections to be filed to the decision, Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c); or, (2) after the time period for filing objections has passed, it \u201cmay adopt, reject, or modify the magistrate's decision, hear additional evidence, recommit the matter to the magistrate with instructions, or hear the matter,\u201d Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(b); or, finally, (3) it may enter an interim order, pursuant to Civ.R. 53(E)(4)(c), that is only temporarily effective. <em>Brown v.
