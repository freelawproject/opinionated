Sweeney, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b140-16\">Third-party defendant-appellant Buckeye Union Insurance Company (\u201cBuckeye\u201d) appeals from the denial of its motion for summary judgment and the granting of defendant-appellee Cardinal Packaging, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cCardinal\u201d) motion for summary judgment with regard to the issue of insurance coverage. For the reasons adduced below, we reverse and enter judgment in favor of Buckeye.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">A review of the record on appeal indicates that on July 28,1994, plaintiff Floyd N. Moore II was injured in the course of his duties at his employer, Cardinal, while unloading a truck when the forklift he was operating tipped over and crushed one of his legs. The leg was subsequently surgically amputated. Moore filed his complaint on July 26, 1996, alleging: (1) a cause of action for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201csubstantial certainty\u201d-type intentional tort against his employer, Cardinal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; and, (2) a cause of action for products liability and/or negligence against the remaining named defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Cardinal requested a defense and indemnification by Buckeye pursuant to a policy of commercial general liability insurance (\u201cCGL\u201d) issued by Buckeye to Cardinal. Buckeye agreed to provide a defense to Cardinal, but maintained that there was no coverage for the claim of intentional tort by an employer and that no indemnification would be provided pursuant to the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On September 20, 1996, Cardinal filed its third-party complaint against its insurer, Buckeye seeking a determination of the rights and responsibilities under the Buckeye policy of insurance. Buckeye filed its answer to the third-party complaint on November 22,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Thereafter, Cardinal and Buckeye filed cross-motions for summary judgment as to the issue of insurance coverage as contained in the first and second claims contained in the third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">On August 19, 1998, the trial court issued its ruling on the motions for summary judgment relevant to this appeal utilizing a half-sheet status form entry containing conclusory statements with no legal reasoning. On September 1, 1998, the trial court issued a two-paragraph order, again using conclusory statements without legal reasoning, which expressly found: (1) that Cardinal is entitled to defense and indemnification from Buckeye pursuant to the policy of insurance, (2) that Buckeye\u2019s denial of coverage for Moore\u2019s claim constitutes a breach of the policy, and, (3) no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>On September 17, 1998, Buckeye filed its notice of appeal from the order of September 1,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Buckeye\u2019s lone assignment of error provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in finding that the Buckeye policy provides coverage for the employment intentional tort alleged by Floyd Moore against Cardinal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The relevant language of the CGL includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cSection I \u2014 Coverages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">\u201cCoverage A.

Where permitted by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Upon reading the SELC, it is crystal clear that employer intentional torts, whether direct-intent type or substantial-certainty type, are specifically excluded from coverage by the terms of the policy. In addition, we note that similarly worded intentional tort exclusionary language contained within other insurance policies has been determined to be clear and unambiguous by this court. See <em>State Auto Ins. Co. v. Golden </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 674, 709 N.E.2d 529; <em>Lakota v. Westfield Ins. Co. </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 138, 724 N.E.2d 815; <em>Izold v. Suburban Power Piping Corp. </em>(Mar. 20, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 70873, unreported, 1997 WL 127197; also see, <em>Presrite Corp. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 38, 680 N.E.2d 216 (an exclusion of \u201csubstantial certainty\u201d intentional torts from coverage is effective only where the policy explicitly excludes this type). We similarly conclude that the policy exclusion <em>sub judice </em>is clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">To defeat this unambiguous preclusion of coverage, it was advanced before the trial court by Cardinal that: (1) the enforcement of the preclusion of coverage would render the SELC endorsement illusory in violation of public policy, and (2) the parol evidence represented by the deposition testimony of the insurance agent, Mr. Ball, who renewed the policy at the, behest of Cardinal, should be permitted to alter the written terms of the policy to provide coverage for employer intentional torts. Inexplicably, the trial court apparently found one, or both, of these subarguments to be persuasive and entered judgment against the insurer. Both of these arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>As to the first subargument, it is noted that the CGL excludes coverage for product liability claims brought against the insured by its employees under the dual capacity doctrine, and consortium claims by relatives of those employees who are themselves injured during the scope of their employment. The SELC removes this exclusion for such claims and damages and permits indemnification for same. As this court stated in <em>State Auto Ins. Co. v. Golden, supra, </em>at 678, 709 N.E.2d 529, citing <em>Royal Paper Stock v. Meridian Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 327, 334, 640 N.E.2d 886, and <em>Izold v. Suburban Power Piping Corp., supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cWhen some benefit to the insured is evident from the face of the endorsement, the endorsement is not an illusory contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Based on <em>Golden, </em>the SELC <em>sub judice </em>is not illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">As to the second subargument regarding the use of parol evidence to alter the clear and unambiguous terms of a written contract, it is fundamental that parol evidence cannot be used in such a manner. This doctrine is explained by Judge Abele in <em>Medley v. Portsmouth </em>(Dec. 23, 1996), Scioto App. No. 96 CA 2426, unreported, 1996 WL 737587, at 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cOhio courts have consistently held that when a contract is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the parties must be determined from the contract itself. In <em>Trader v. People Working Cooperatively, Inc. </em>(1994), 104 Ohio App.3d 690, 694, 663 N.E.2d 335, 337, the court summarized Ohio law barring parol evidence in pertinent part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">\u201c \u2018When a court construes a contract, its overriding goal is to give effect to the intent of the parties. <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 132 [31 OBR .289, 291], 509 N.E.2d 411, 413. When the terms of a written contract are clear, the court presumes that the parties\u2019 intent resides in the words of the agreement. <em>Id.; Alexander v. Buckeye Pipeline Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 246 [7 O.O.3d 403, 406], 374 N.E.2d 146, 150; <em>Inland Refuse Transfer Co. v. Browning-Ferris Industries </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 321, 323 [15 OBR 448, 449-450], 474 N.E.2d 271, 273; <em>Stony\u2019s Trucking Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St.2d 139, 142 [61 O.O.2d 388, 389-390], 290 N.E.2d 565, 568. In such a case, the parol evidence rule prevents parties from introducing evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations that would alter the terms of the written document. <em>Uebelacker v. Cincom Systems, Inc. </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 268, 273, 549 N.E.2d 1210, 1217.\u2019 See, also, <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684, 686. Courts may not admit parol evidence to vary, alter, or modify the terms of a clear and unambiguous written agreement. <em>Trader, Kelly; Uebelacker.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we necessarily affirm the assignment of error, reverse the ruling of the trial court, and enter judgment in favor of Buckeye Union Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">This cause is reversed and judgment entered in favor of Buckeye Union Insurance Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is, therefore, considered that the appellant recovers of the appellees its costs herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It is ordered that a special mandate be sent to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b146-10\">Patton, P.J., and Porter, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">.
