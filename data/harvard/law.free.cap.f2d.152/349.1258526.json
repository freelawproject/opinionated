There was ample evidence to justify the jury in finding that each of the defendants made false statements in his application in answer to items Nos. 10 and 15. No. 10 required the applicant to tell what his \u201cactivities\u201d had been or in what \u201cactivities\u201d he intended to be engaged; in this connection he was called on to state his \u201cmembership or activities in clubs, organizations or societies.\u201d No. 15 required him to state what \u201corganizations,\u201d engaged in whole or part in propaganda in the United States, he had \u201cbeen affiliated with or active in.\u201d We think it clear that \u201cactivities\u201d, in both 10 and 15, meant the applicant\u2019s personal activities. In addition, in No. 10, \u2019\u2019activities\u201d explicitly included \u201cmembership\u201d; in No. 15, \u201cactivities\u201d explicitly included being \u201ca member of\u201d or a \u201cworker for\u201d such an organization. Each question thus required disclosure of membership in such an organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Of the defendants who were full members of the Party, some answered that they were aiding \u201cno activities in the United States.\u201d The jury could reasonably find that such answers were untrue. Other full members said they were \u201cnon-resident\u201d members. We think that the jury' could reasonably have found such answers also false. For the phrase \u201cnon-resident\u201d members might mean that such a person, although a Nazi, was a \u201cnon-resident\u201d of Germany residing in this country and not a member of a party active here; and No. 15 was designed to call for disclosure of activities in the United States. The answers, to say the least, were misleading, for they created the impression that the defendant\u2019s connection with the Party was such that he had no \u201cactivity\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">Other defendants were \u201canwaerters\u201d who, in their answers, revealed nothing whatever as to their connection with the Party. The jury could have found their answers false. No. 10 called for an answer as to \u201cactivities\u201d; No. 15 called for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\"affiliation.\u201d The jury could reasonably have found that these defendants were \u201caffiliated\u201d with and \u201cactive\u201d in the Party.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">2. But the making of such false statements was not enough to justify a verdict of guilt. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 88, each of the defendants was charged with and convicted of conspiring to defraud the United States by the filing of statements in violation of the Alien Registration Act, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 452 et seq. Section 457(c) of that Act imposes a penalty on an alien who \u201cfiles an application for registration containing <em>statements known by him to be false </em>* * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the substantive crime thus involved both (a) falsity and (b) knowledge of the falsity, the defendants were obviously entitled to have the judge charge, in the most unmistakable language, that no defendant here could be found guilty unless he was a party to an agreement, plan, or combination, to file an application containing statements known to him to be false.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The existence of \u00e1 common undertaking, in which a defendant joined, merely to file statements which were false, but not known to him to be false, could not support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Yet nowhere did the judge plainly so advise the jurors. He carefully read to the jurors 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 452(a) but he neither read nor mentioned to them \u00a7 457 (c) which, as above noted, defined the substantive crime as involving the filing by an alien of statements \u201cknown by him to be false.\u201d It is clear, we think, that the judge did not consider it necessary that each defendant should have \u201chad in contemplation all the elements of the crime\u201d he was \u201ccharged with conspiracy to commit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Why he did not do so is, we think, made manifest by the following: Defendants requested a charge No. 34 reading, \u201cIf the evidence leaves you with a reasonable doubt whether any defendant believed the answers to questions * * * which he or she was advised to make by the German Consul, fairly complied with the instructions contained in Government\u2019s Exhibit 235, you must resolve that doubt in favor of such defendant and find him or her not guilty.\u201d In response to this request, the trial judge said: \u201cNo 34 is denied since no defendant is charged with the substantive crime. The question is whether there was a conspiracy.\u201d This was the equivalent of saying that, where a substantive crime involves knowledge, a conspiracy to commit that crime need not. His comment, we think, shows that the trial judge entertained this notion: Knowledge by a defendant of the falsity of his statements was not necessary if that defendant confederated with another person, Draeger, who, unknown to that defendant, intended to, and did, bring about the filing by that defendant of an application, containing statements known by Draeger to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Such a notion is not uncommon. But we consider it erroneous. It might often result in the conviction of men not guilty of wrongdoing who innocently associated themselves with others intent on wrongdoing. The conspiracy doctrine is, at best, a dangerous instrumentality the use of which is fraught with dangers to the innocent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If extended in accordance with the notion we have described, it would indeed be a menace to honest men. Cf. United States v. Peoni, 2 Cir., 100 F.2d 401, 403. As Judge Thomas said in Fulbright v. United States, 8 Cir., 91 F.2d 210, 211, where \u201cknowledge * \u25a0 * * is made an essential element of the substantive crime * * * it must adhere in a charge of conspiracy to commit that crime.\u201d Escape from that doctrine cannot be had through the suggestion that the conspiracy here was \u201cto defraud the United States,\u201d for here the conspiracy to defraud, if it existed, consisted of a conspiracy to have each defendant file statements known by him to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Here, then, it was not enough that a defendant gave an answer which in fact was false, or one which was known to Draeger to be false; it was necessary for a conviction of any defendant to prove that he gave an answer which that defendant knew to be untruthful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the evidence, the jury, correctly instructed, could properly have concluded that each defendant had the requisite knowledge. But the judge\u2019s instructions were such that we fear the jurors may not have comprehended that they were called upon to decide that issue of fact. Had the instructions clearly apprised them that they must pass upon that issue, we think that, having in mind the authority-loving character of many modern Germans, and particularly of Nazis, the jurors could reasonably have believed that these defendants accepted as truthful the answers suggested to them by Draeger, a German official. We may dislike the Teutonic veneration of officialdom, but it is not criminal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We are not to be taken as saying that it was necessary for the judge to give an instruction worded precisely as was the requested Charge No. 34,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to which we refer primarily because his explanation of his refusal to give it illuminates his failure to instruct clearly as to the necessity of knowledge. We think that the failure so to instruct was so important that we would reverse even had no such request been made and no exception been taken to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It is suggested that the portion of the indictment read by the judge to the jury charged each defendant with the requisite knowledge. Whether that be true is not entirely clear.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But assuming arguendo (1) that knowledge by each of the appellants of the falsity of his statements was there charged and (2) that the reading of that part of the indictment to the jury would have been sufficient had the judge instructed the jurors that they should not render a verdict against a defendant unless they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that that defendant behaved as thus charged in the indictment, the fact is that here the judge gave no such instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">It is suggested that the necessity of knowledge was adequately stressed when the judge said (1) that a conspiracy involves \u201can understanding of a common purpose to be attained and the methods to be employed in bringing it about,\u201d and that each individual defendant was \u201centitled to have the evidence separately examined as to him or her,\u201d (2) that circumstantial evidence would be sufficient if \u201cconsistent only with knowledge of the common purpose and participation in that common purpose,\u201d and (3) that the jury should consider \u201cwhether there was present in the mind of any defendant knowledge of a common purpose and an effort to carry out that purpose.\u201d But these remarks were highly ambiguous. Without a sharper definition, they could well have led the jury to think the judge was referring merely to knowledge of a common purpose to file statements which in fact were false even if not known to a particular defendant to be false; and that such was the intention of the judge we think appears from his comment (discussed above) when he denied requested Charge No. 34. The government also makes much of the fact that defendants withdrew requested Charges No. 13, No. 14 and No. 15.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the withdrawal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>of those requests was not an acquiescence in the error we have -been discussing, for these requests dealt with knowledge of the existence of a conspiracy, not with knowledge of the falsity of the statements; they referred to knowledge of a combination to file statements which in fact were false but not to a combination to file statements known to individual defendants to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The defect in the instructions was not cured when the judge gave the usual general charges as to presumption of innocence, burden of proof and reasonable doubt; in the absence of a specific charge as to knowledge of the falsity, such general charges were insufficient. Because there is altogether too much danger that the jury may not have understood that such knowledge was an essential element of guilt, we conclude that the verdict cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Because of the defect in the instructions, we need not consider whether the evidence was sufficient to prove an alternative basis which would support conviction of any defendant, i.e., that he had knowledge of Draeger\u2019s intention to have other applicants file applications containing false statements known by such defendant to be false.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> See United States v.
