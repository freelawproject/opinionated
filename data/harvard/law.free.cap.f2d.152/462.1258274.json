The case was tried to the court without a jury, and resulted in dismissal of the complaint on the ground that as to some defendants the action was barred by releases given by the corporation after a fair settlement, and as to others the action was not proved. In so far as the appeal raises questions of fact we think the findings of the trial judge are supported by the evidence; in so far as it involves questions of law we agree with his disposition of them. The judgment is affirmed on the opinion below, 48 F.Supp. 465.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
