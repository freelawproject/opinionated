Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 33 S.Ct. 780, 57 L.Ed. 1232; Gorin v. United States, 312 U.S. 19, 61 S.Ct. 429, 85 L.Ed. 488. However, under our view of the case, it is not necessary to decide the constitutional question, since apart from the regulation the indictment is sufficient to charge an offense under 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">When we strip away Selective Service Regulation 626.1 (b) and leave only the quoted excerpt of Section 311, just adverted to, we find that the indictment clearly and plainly charges a violation of this statute and is in nowise vague, indefinite or uncertain. Moreover, if the indictment charges a crime under any law of the United States, it is sufficient to support the verdict. Wessels v. United States, 5 Cir., 262 F. 389, certiorari denied 253 U.S. 485, 40 S.Ct. 481, 64 L.Ed. 1025; Moore v. Hudspeth, 10 Cir., 110 F.2d 386, certiorari denied 310 U.S. 643, 60 S.Ct. 1106, 84 L. Ed. 1411; Pickens v. United States, 5 Cir., 123 F.2d 333, certiorari denied 316 U.S. 669, 62 S.Ct. 1039, 86 L.Ed. 1744.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">We find no reversible error in the record and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A7N\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
