Int. Rev.Acts, p. 1087, and hence was not taxable under \u00a7 207(a). Appellee denied that appellant was a life insurance company within the meaning of \u00a7 201(a). On this issue, appellant had the burden of proof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus appellant had the burden of proving that it was engaged in the business of issuing life insurance and annuity contracts, and that its reserve funds held for the fulfillment of such contracts comprised more than 50% of its total reserve funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The burden was not sustained.
