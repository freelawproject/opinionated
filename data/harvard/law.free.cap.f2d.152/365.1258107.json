HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Both parties .appeal from a judgment' which (1) held that the defendant had infringed both claims of the plaintiff\u2019s patent No.- 2,178,893, granted to Mabel C. McCur-rach on November 7, 1939; (2)\u2018which dismissed, though not upon the merits, a cause of action under \u00a7 66, Title 35 U.S.C.A., upon an alleged interference between the plaintiff\u2019s patent and Patent No. 2,291,531, granted to Cheney and Tedford on July 28, 1942, and owned by the defendant; and (3) which dismissed, also not upon the merits, a cause of action to declare that the plaintiff\u2019s product did not infringe the claims of the defendant\u2019s patent and that that patent was invalid. Both patents \u201crelated to neckties,\u201d but, in the view that we take it will not be necessary to describe the defendant\u2019s in detail. The plaintiff\u2019s patent is \u201cto provide improved means * * * for producing a predetermined indentation or pleat-like drape formation in the front of the necktie just below the knot\u201d (p. 1, lines 6-11). (This is commonly called a \u201cdimple,\u201d and is meant to give the tie a more pleasing appearance.) The means employed is a \u201cforming element\u201d in the shape of an M in cross-section, separate from, and inside, the main fabric of the tie. Since most ties have an inner lining, the \u201cforming element\u201d is either attached to it, or is a part of it. When the tie is made up, the main fabric \u2014 silk or other \u2014 follows the middle fold, or \u201cvalley,\u201d of the M just below the knot. In one form the \u201cforming element\u201d is a separate \u201cpreformed pleated piece of any suitable material which is pliable and capable of retaining a fold or pleat. Preferably it consists of a textile fabric which may be relatively heavy\u201d (p. 1, lines 26-30). It is \u201cformed with two longitudinally extending parallel pleats, each affording an apex or fold line * * *. Intermediate of the pleats is,another pleat or fold line, 15, which projects towards the rear\u201d (p. 1, lines 31-37). (This is what we have called the \u201cvalley\u201d of the M.) The \u201cforming element\u201d may be \u201cstiffened by a suitable backing, or by being coated or impregnated\u201d (p. 1, lines 53-54). The specification also disclosed a variant of the \u201cforming element\u201d; i. e., \u201can integral stiffened, pleated section, 23, which affords a conformation and arrangement\u201d like the first form (p. 2, lines 14-16). The plaintiff made up some assortments of neckties according to the patent, and sold them to three dealers, who advertised them in 1939. They were marketed for about eighteen months, but production was discontinued, owing to the scarcity of materials during the war. The extent of the sales is not shown; and the possible success of the necktie in making any place for itself in the market remains to be determined; it cannot be said to have been a failure; nor can it be said to have been a success.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">The plaintiff\u2019s patent was not the only effort to produce a \u201cdimple\u201d in a necktie. On March 17, 1936, Patent No. 2,034,652 was issued to Fallar &amp; Fallar, for that purpose. There were two forms of this; in one the edges of the lining of the necktie were reinforced, the idea being that the reinforcement would bring the edges forward when the tie was made up, making a \u201cvalley\u201d at each side, and forcing the center part of the material forward into a bulge. The second form was to produce a \u201cdimple\u201d like the patent in suit, either by a lining in two pieces stitched together in the center and at the sides, with vertical slits between the stitching; or by a single lining with two vertical slits near the margin. The notion as to this was that, when the tie was made up, the slits would cause the lining to bulge forward at the sides making a \u201cdimple\u201d in the center. On April 5, 1938, one, Kleinmann was granted Patent No. 2,113,113, whose object was \u201cto provide a four-in-hand tie with a longitudinally creased reinforcement whereby the center longitudinal outer portion of the tie is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>shaped to produce a ridged appearance on the outer side\u201d (p. 1, lines 7-11). A lining of the usual sort was to be slit along the center; or, if it was \u201cquite flexible,\u201d it need only be folded. Over the cut or fold \u201ca sheet of strong, fairly stiff fabric, 20, is folded along its longitudinal center, as in Fig. 6, and is secured by an adhesive, 21, to each side portion of the folded lining\u201d (cqI. 1, line 51; col. 2, lines 1-4). The lining so reinforced pushes the material of the tie forward into a bulge: the desired \u201cridged appearance.\u201d Cloke, in Patent No. 1,990,167, granted on February 5, 1935, also disclosed a method of producing a \u201cdimple\u201d in the same place as McCurrach, though by quite different means, and so did Goldman, on April 19, 1938, in Patent No. 2,114,376.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It is conceivable, since the limitations upon manufacture imposed by the war have now ended, that the plaintiff's tie may in time have wider acceptance than any which it has had so far; and if so, we might be convinced on another record that the art had really been waiting for it; and this might in turn satisfy us that Mrs. McCur-rach made an invention, as we were satisfied in Kurtz v. Belle Hat Lining Co., 2 Cir., 280 F. 277, and Franc-Strohmenger &amp; Cowan Inc. v. Arthur Siegman, Inc., 2 Cir., 27 F.2d 785. But, as the record stands, there is no setting or background which convinces us that what she did was more than to vary a device already known to her to produce a result, not new in conception; and that too, a device which, up to the present time, has proved sterile. We do indeed yield our naive conclusions drawn from a comparison of a patented disclosure with the earlier approaches of the art, when we can find valid history to correct them. If the need has existed for a long time; if there have been repeated unsuccessful efforts; if the patent has put aside what went before and occupies the field alone: if that is what the evidence shows, we have repeatedly said that the apparent simplicity of the solution will not prevail. All this is very trite and threadbare; and it does <em>not help the </em>plaintiffs Fere. Cloke filed his application less than rour years before Mrs. McCurrach; Fallar less than four; Goldman less than one; so that the art did not have to wait long for her. Even so, if her tie had gone into wide favor, we might feel bound to say that there must have been difficulties we do not understand; but that conclusion would be premature, as we have said. The record nowhere challenges the operability of Fallar\u2019s device; certainly it is as simple and convenient as hers, and incidentally it is far closer to the defendant\u2019s tie.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Nor can we credit Mrs. McCurrach with any substantial originality in the means which she chose. We have described Kleinmann\u2019s second patent which disclosed an inverted V as a means of producing a \u201cridged\u201d front to a tie. Two such Vs side by side form an M, the \u201cforming element\u201d of the patent in suit. The plaintiffs had acquired this patent before the invention was made; they had actually experimented with it, and although the only testimony is that \u201cit just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d its serves to limit the scope of any originality which the patentee actually contributed, however little it might have counted as part of the prior art. All that in fact she did was to make a \u201cdimple\u201d in a tie by duplicating the Kleinmann\u2019s stiffener; and, whatever we might have felt forced to concede, had that proved a revelation to the art, so far it has proved of no consequence. As things stand, it is one of those trifling variants which an art throws out spontaneously under the stimulus of trial and error at the hands of commonplace ingenuity in which, happily for us, our people abound. We hold the patent in suit invalid for lack of invention and the first cause of action must be dismissed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">This decided, the cause of action for interference must also be dismissed and upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">As to the third cause of action, at the trial the defendant expressly disclaimed any claim that the plaintiff infringed its patent, and there was no room thereafter for a declaratory judgment as to invalidity. Cover v. Schwartz, 2 Cir., 133 F.2d 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Judgment reversed upon the first and second causes of action and complaint dismissed upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">Judgment affirmed on the third cause of action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b425-13\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">I agree generally, though I think refusal of the declaratory judgment as to defendant\u2019s patent should be placed expressly on grounds of discretion and lack of utility of such a declaration where defendant has specifically disclaimed any assertion of infringement and the issue of validity has not been adjudicated below, Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, 2d Ed. 1941, 299, 307, and should not be left with the ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>statement that there is no \u201croom\u201d for a declaratory judgment. Since the statement may mean no more than I have said, I should have refrained from adverting to the matter but for the supporting citation of a case \u2014 dealing, it is true, with other facts not directly involving the declaratory procedure \u2014 which went on the arid ground of lack of \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d As there, there seems to me undoubted general jurisdiction here, cf. 52 Yale L.J. 909; Borchard, Challenging \u201cPenal\u201d Statutes by Declaratory Action, 52 Yale L.J. 445, 449, n. 10; 1 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, 1942 Cum.Supp., 133-135; and I am convinced that it is quite undesirable to suggest limitations on this useful procedure by any unusual resort to the vague abstraction of jurisdiction. Actions may speak louder than words, even in law; and there may well be cases where a defendant\u2019s acts show an actual controversy, notwithstanding the protective screen of a verbal disclaimer. Moreover, the Supreme Court has now admonished us not to avoid the issue of validity, and has stressed \u201cwhat will usually be the better practice\u201d of \u201cinquiring fully into the validity\u201d of a patent.
