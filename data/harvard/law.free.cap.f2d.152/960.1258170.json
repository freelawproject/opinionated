She admitted the untruth of her first statement, and claimed she was then intimidated by the accused. The United States could use her as a witness, no government representative being shown to have procured her to swear falsely, leaving it to the jury to determine which of her differing statements was true. This is an ordinary function of the jury. Their decision is not reviewable on habeas corpus. The decision in Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, <em>79 </em>L.Ed. 791, 98 A.L.R. 406, has no application. Compare Wilhoit v. Hiatt, Warden, D.C., <em>60 </em>F.Supp. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-25\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
