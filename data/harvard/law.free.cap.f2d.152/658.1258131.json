It is impossible to say\u00bb from the libellant\u2019s testimony how long the condition had existed of which he complained. The judge\u2019s finding of fact was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d that \u201cthere was no credible evidence in this case that either the galley or alley-way was wet or greasy, and that the defendant had actual or imputed notice thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
