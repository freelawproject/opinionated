The answer to the question depends upon the proper construction of \u00a7 1426(h) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code (as \u00a7 1426 was amended by \u00a7 606 of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1939, c. 666, 53 Stat. 1360, 1383-1387, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rcv.Code, \u00a7 1426),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which defines the term \u201cagricultural labor\u201d as including \u201call services performed * * * in connection with the hatching of poultry.\u201d The District Court ruled, in substance, that the services of all of the employees of the taxpayer were essential to the operation of the hatchery and were performed \u201cin connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tion with the hatching of poultry\u201d; that the employees were therefore engaged in \u201cagricultural labor\u201d; and that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund of all the social security taxes which it sought to recover in this action. Judgment was entered accordingly, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">It is conceded that if the District Court\u2019s construction of the applicable statute is correct, the judgment should be affirmed. The appellant contends, however, that services performed \u201cin connection with the hatching of poultry\u201d include only such services as are performed in the physical process of the incubation of the eggs, and that, if this is so, the taxpayer is entitled to recover nothing, since its claims for refund were insufficient to enable the appellant to determine what amount, if any, should be refunded on account of taxes paid with respect to wages of employees who were engaged in the actual process of incubation.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The facts are not in dispute. They are accurately stated by the appellant in his brief as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">\u201cIn its operations taxpayer normally hatches some three million baby chicks a year which .are sold to' farmers, either as day-old chicks or when six weeks or two months old. Taxpayer employs from 8 or 10 to 150 persons in connection with its business, who are engaged variously in gathering, receiving, candling and sizing eggs; performing the various necessary operations around the incubators; sorting, sexing and shipping baby chicks; tending chicks in brooderhouses; culling, sorting and grading flocks on farms from which the eggs for hatching are produced; working in the office writing and receiving orders and letters concerning orders for chicks, making out shipping tags and directions, answering the telephone, keeping books, and in executive capacities conducting and promoting the hatchery business and superintending the help therein. Each of these employees renders services in connection with the hatching of poultry necessary to the taxpayer\u2019s business, without which it could not be carried on. It is fully as necessary to the operation of taxpayer\u2019s hatchery that the orders be received and billed out and the chickens sold and removed from the hatchery as it is to put the eggs into the incubator or to take the chicks therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">\u201cSix months before bringing the instant suit, taxpayer filed timely claims for refund of social security taxes paid on its employees, stating as the basis of its claim that \u2014 \u2018Each of the persons upon whose wages this tax was paid was performing services in connection with the hatching of poultry, necessary to the business, and without which it could not be carried on.\u2019 \u201d The statute here involved amended the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, 643, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 901, 1107. The Social Security Act excepted from the term \u201cemployment,\u201d \u201cagricultural labor.\u201d Sec. 907 (c), 49 Stat. 643, and \u00a7 1107(c), 42 U.S. C.A. The term \u201cagricultural labor\u201d was not defined in the original Act. As was to be expected, the courts and the Bureau of Internal Revenue placed a strict con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>struction upon the term \u201c.agricultural labor.\u201d See Jones v. Gaylord Guernsey Farms, 10 Cir., 128 F.2d 1008; Chester C. Fosgate Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 125 F.2d 775. In a ruling specifically directed at hatchery operations such as those conducted by the taxpayer in the instant case, the Bureau held that the \u201cagricultural labor\u201d exemption did not apply. S.S.T. 117, 1937-1 Internal Revenue Cum. Bull., pages 395, 396. In its ruling, the Bureau said:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">\u201cIt is held that the services of the employees of the M Company, which is engaged in the business of hatching chickens, can not properly be classified as \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 inasmuch ,as such services are commercial and are not performed as an incident to ordinary farming operations. The taxing provisions of the Social Security Act are therefore applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">That is the situation which existed when Congress, in 1939, undertook to define the term \u201cagricultural labor\u201d and enacted the statute in controversy. Concededly, Congress was concerned with relieving agriculture of the social security tax burden by including in the term \u201cagricultural labor\u201d certain services which had been held not to be exempt, but which were considered to be in reality an integral part of farming activities. See House Rep. No. 728, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939-2 Internal Revenue Cum. Bull., p. 538) and Senate Rep. No. 734, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. (1939-2 Internal Revenue Cum. Bull., p. 565).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>It seems clear that Congress, in defining \u201cagricultural labor,\u201d used the broad language \u201cservices performed * * * in connection with the hatching of poultry\u201d advisedly<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in the realization that the burden of taxes imposed upon hatcheries which procured their eggs from farmers and sold their chicks to farmers would have to be borne by agriculture. If Congress had intended that agriculture should be relieved of this tax burden only to the extent of the taxes upon wages paid to those rendering services in the incubation of eggs, it would, we think,, have selected appropriate language to express that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">' The appellant invokes the rule of strict construction to support the Bureau\u2019s interpretation of the statute. The rule requiring that a statute be strictly construed is not violated by allowing the statutory language to have its full meaning when that supports the policy and purposes of the statute. Donnelley v. United States, 276 U.S. 505, 512, 48 S.Ct. 400, 72 L.Ed. 676; Wilson v. United States, 8 Cir., 77 F.2d 236, 239, 240. In Danciger v. Cooley, 248 U.S. 319, 327, 39 S.Ct. 119, 122, 63 L. Ed. 266, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">\u201cTo be within the statute it is essential that the act of collecting the purchase price be done \u2018in connection with the\u00bb transportation of\u2019 the liquor. The statute does not say \u2018in the transportation,\u2019 but \u2018in connection with\u2019 it. * * * What Cooley did, while not part of the transportation, was closely connected with it.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">This language was used with respect to a penal statute calling for a strict construction. In the case at bar, it seems obvious that services essential to the operation of the hatchery, although not performed in the incubation of the eggs, were so essential to and so closely connected with the hatching of poultry as to. constitute \u201cservices performed * * * in connection with the hatching of poultry.\u201d See and compare Walling v. Rocklin, 8 Cir., 132 F.2d 3, 6, and Miller Hatcheries, Inc. v. Boyer, 8 Cir., 131 F.2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">This is not a case in which the plain language of a statute produces absurd or futile- results or is clearly at variance with the policy of the legislation. The statutory language is therefore the most persuasive evidence of the legislative intent. United States v. American Truck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ing Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, 543, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345. Statutes are not to be nullified where unambiguous language calls for a logical and sensible result. Armstrong Paint &amp; Varnish Works v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 333, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">We have not overlooked the contentions of the appellant that the District Court\u2019s construction of the statutory language is out of line with the Bureau of Internal Revenue\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of the words \u201cservices performed * * * in connection with the ginning of cotton,\u201d and with the opinion of the State District Court of Wapello County, Iowa, holding that executives and office employees of the taxpayer were not performing \u201cagricultural labor\u201d within the meaning of the Iowa Unemployment Compensation Act, which contains the same definition of \u201cagricultural labor\u201d as is here involved. Since we arc of the opinion that the construction placed upon the statute by the trial court is in harmony with the intent of Congress and the plain meaning of the statutory language, it is unnecessary to discuss these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-17\"> \u201cSec. 1420.

Agricultural labor. \u2014 The present Act excludes 'agricultural labor\u2019 from coverage. The bill [H.R. 6635] continues the exemption of agricultural labor and defines the term so as to clarify its meaning and to extend the meaning to certain services which are an integral part of farming activities. These provisions are explained in detail in a subsequent part of this report, in connection with the definition of \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 as defined in section 209(1) of the bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">In House Rep. No. 728, under the heading \u201cDe,finitions\u201d appears the following explanation (1939-2 Internal Revenue Cum. Bull., pages 552-553):</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">\u201cDefinition of \u2018agricultural labor.\u2019 \u2014 Section 209 (1): The present law exempts \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 without defining the term. It has been difficult to delimit the application of the term with the certainty required for administration and for general understanding by employers and employees affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">\u201cYour committee believes that greater exactness should be given-to the exception and that it should be broadened to include as \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 certain services not at present exempt, as such services are an integral part of farming activities. In the case of many of such services, it has been found that the incidence of the taxes falls exclusively upon the farmer, a factor which, in numerous instances, has resulted in the establishment of competitive advantages on the part of large farm operators to the detriment of the smaller ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">\u201cParagraph (1) of this subsection exempts service performed on a farm, in the employ of any person, in connection with cultivating the soil, or in connection with raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity, including the raising, feeding, and management of live stock,- bees, poultry, and fur-bearing animals. Such services are exempt under existing law only if performed in the employ of the owner or tenant of the farm on which they are rendered. Services performed on a farm in connection with the raising, feeding, and management of fur-bearing animals, such as foxes, not now exempted, will be exempt under paragraph (1). This paragraph also continues the existing exclusion of services performed on a farm in the raising or harvesting of horticultural commodities, including flowers and nursery products, such a-s young fruit trees, ornamental plants, and shrubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">\u201cParagraph (2) of the subsection excepts services in the employ of the owner (whether or not such owner is in possession) or tenant of a farm in connection with the operation, management, or maintenance of such farm, if the major part of those services are performed on a fai-m. Under this language certain services are to be regarded as agricultural even though they are not performed in conducting any of the operations referred to in paragraph (1). Services performed in connection with the \u2018operation, management, or maintenance\u2019 of a farm may include, for example, services performed by carpenters, painters, farm supervisors, irrigation engineers, bookkeepers, and other skilled or semiskilled workers whose servieesi contribute in any way to the proper conduct of the farm or farms operated by their employer. Some of these services at present constitute covered employment under some circumstances but not under other circumstances. It is stipur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>lated that the services referred to in this paragraph must be performed in the employ of the owner or tenant of the farm so that the exemption will not extend to services'performed by such persons as employees of a commercial painting concern, for example, which contracts with a farmer to renovate his farm properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\u201cParagraph (3) extends the exception to services performed in connection with certain specified products and operations. Ordinarily these services are performed on a farm or are of such a character as to warrant no different treatment than is accorded services performed in connection with farming activities. In order that a uniform rule may be applied in the case of these services, they will be excepted whether or not performed on a farm or in the employ of the owner or tenant of a farm. In the case of maple sap, the exemption will extend to services in connection with the processing of the sap into maple sugar or maple sirup, but not in the subsequent blending or other processing of such -sugar or sirup with other products. Under the present exception services performed in connection with the production of maple sirup or maple sugar do not constitute \u2018agricultural labor.\u2019 * * * Services performed in connection with any hatching of poultry and in connection</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">witb the ginning of cotton will also be excepted. Services performed in connection with the raising or harvesting of mushrooms constitute \u2018agricultural labor\u2019 under existing law, only when performed on a farm. The fact that mushrooms are not usually grown under ordinary field conditions but are grown in cellars, caves, barns, or in sheds specially constructed for the purpose has resulted in the employees of some growers being covered while employees of others are not. Under this paragraph all such services will be excepted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\"> That Congress understood the effect of using the words \u201cin connection with\u201d is indicated by the following excerpt from the report of the House Committee of conference on H.R. 6635 (House Report No. 1461, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.; Internal Revenue Cum.
