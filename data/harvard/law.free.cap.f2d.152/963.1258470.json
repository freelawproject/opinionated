Plaintiff duly filed with defendant a proof of loss stating that plaintiff had been informed that the loss of the insured jewelry occurred when an employee of plaintiff\u2019s consignee was assaulted on a Texas highway. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint similarly alleged. After a pre-trial conference, plaintiff, more than three months before the trial, notified defendant that plaintiff at the trial intended to rest after proving delivery of the jewelry to the consignee and the latter\u2019s failure to return the jewelry. At the trial, plaintiff made such proof. The trial judge granted a motion at the trial amending the pleading to conform to the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">The statements as to plaintiff\u2019s information about the theft from the consignee\u2019s employee in the complaint were surplusage. The burden of proving that the loss came within the exception rested on defendant. Agricultural Insurance Co. v. Rothblum, 147 Misc. 865, 265 N.Y.S. 7. The trial judge, because he was unable to determine from the evidence whether or not such a theft occurred, found that defendant had not borne this burden. The trial judge saw and heard the witnesses. We cannot possibly say that his finding was \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Nor can we agree with defendant\u2019s argument that, in the circumstances, there was a variance between plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and the proof at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
