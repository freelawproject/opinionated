The pre-trial order directed the Price Administrator to deliver to appellant a transcript prepared by investigators of the Office of Price Administration from invoices and records of the appellant. This transcript, hereinafter referred to as Exhibit 1 or the exhibit, not only sets forth the facts of each sale as appeared on each invoice, but also the ceiling price and the amount of overcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-18\">Appellant was permitted to specify in writing any objections to this exhibit where appellant deemed true facts were not stated or the proper maximum price was not given. If the objections furnished by appellant could not be reconciled by the parties, the issues raised by these objections would be in issue at the trial. The issues, according to the order, would be limited to those set forth in the pre-trial order. The exhibit and the specification of objections thereto would constitute the complete statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-19\">If no objections were furnished by the appellant, the order provided that the Court would consider the items in the exhibit to be true, correct and accurate as to the description of item sold, the price charged, the maximum price and the amount of overcharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">The appellant made no objections to the exhibit. The cause was submitted to a jury, and the jury found for the Price Administrator assessing damages in the amount of $4,634.07. A judgment was entered on the verdict for the specified damages and costs. Another judgment was entered enjoining the appellant, officers, agents, employees, agents, etc. from selling merchandise above the maximum price set by regulations, and directing the appellant to keep accurate records of sales, and furnish the purchaser with a written statement as required by the Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">The purpose of the pre-trial conference <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is to simplify the issues, amend the pleadings where necessary, and to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>unnecessary proof of facts at the trial. The pre-trial order in this case directed appellant to make obj ections to the exhibit so that the objections as well as the exhibit would comprise the statement of facts in dispute. Appellant was in the position to dispute the facts as considered at the pre-trial conference and as appeared in the exhibit but refused to do so. The jury found the facts to be as submitted in the exhibit, and those facts are conclusive as far as this court is concerned.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We can only affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-12\"> \u201cRule 16.
