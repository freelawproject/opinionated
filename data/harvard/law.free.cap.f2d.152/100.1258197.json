Plaintiffs had been buying skins from defendant for some time, but all of the rebates here claimed arpse in connection with six purchases made between October 30, 1930, and August 30, 1932. Five of the purchases were made pursuant to written contracts, each executed on defendant\u2019s printed form; and plaintiffs base their claim on a printed clause appearing on the back to the effect that any change in the rate or form of import duty is \u201cfor Buyers\u2019 Account.\u201d They then assert that such a provision must be implied in law as to the sixth or oral contract. Defendant, denying any such implication, relies on typewritten statements on the face of the form contracts which, as to three of the purchases, say that the duty is \u201cfor seller\u2019s account,\u201d and, as to two, that it is \u201cincluded in sale price.\u201d The District Court did not, however, pass' upon this issue or upon certain other defenses asserted by defendant, since it gave summary \u25a0 judgment to defendant solely on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by a general release executed by them in March, 1937. This appeal is taken by plaintiffs from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Plaintiffs particularly urge that no right of action accrued to them until 1941 when defendant actually received the rebates, and that therefore the present claims, being contingent at the time of the release, could not have been covered by it. Assuming that the claims were contingent, as plaintiffs assert, it does not follow that the release is ineffective here. For <em>although a </em>general release usually includes only claims in existence at the time it is executed, it may bar contingent and future claims when the intent of the parties to that effect is clear. Nahtel Corporation v. West Virginia Pulp &amp; Paper Co., 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 1; Altman v. Curtiss-Wright Corporation, 2 Cir., 124 F.2d 177. The general release here executed was in the usual broad terms, reciting the receipt by plaintiffs of $2,-066.11 and releasing defendant from \u201call manner\u201d of \u201cactions,\u201d \u201cvariances,\u201d \u201cextents,\u201d and \u201cdemands\u201d (with some twenty other variant expressions) by reason of \u201cany matter, cause or thing whatsoever from the beginning of the world\u201d (cf. Frank, J., in In re Monza Mills, 2 Cir., 146 F.2d 161) to the day of \u201cthe date of these presents.\u201d And while the instrument itself makes no mention of any specific claims, the circumstances surrounding its execution point to an intent of the parties to preclude demands of the sort now made.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In September, 1934, defendant, having received rebates on duties improperly collected under the 1922 Tariff Act and after, as it claims, protesting liability for any refund, paid plaintiffs $8,407.46 by a check which it endorsed, \u201cIn full settlement of all rebates of duty due by us to you on dog-skins.\u201d The accompanying letter also stated, \u201cThis is in full settlement of all rebates due by us to you.\u201d A year later, plaintiffs, being dissatisfied with the amount thus received, sued defendant for an additional rebate. This suit was settled by the additional payment noted in the release and upon execution of the release. This background supports defendant\u2019s contention that the release was required as its final attempt to protect itself against future claims. In view of the existing disputes between dog-skin importers and the government as to (he applicability of the 1930 act, 19 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1001 ct seq., there is no doubt of plaintiffs\u2019 awareness at the time of signing the release that defendant might obtain future rebates. Indeed, it appears from defendant\u2019s statement below, not challenged in the record, that plaintiffs were litigating this very question and had at that time a judgment in their favor which was affirmed very shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> Finally, the intent is made clear by the affidavit of defendant\u2019s attorney which, after reciting this background, states that he explicitly told plaintiffs\u2019 attorney that he would require a general release so as to terminate all possible claims by plaintiffs in the future, as well as in the present. Plaintiffs insist that this statement cannot be considered under the parol evidence rule. But that rule does not exclude evidence to interpret, explain, or clarify (rather than contradict) the written document. Thorington v. Smith, 75 U.S. 1, 19 L.Ed. 361; West v. Smith, 101 U.S. 263, 25 L. Ed. 809; Graham v. National Surety Co., 8 Cir., 244 F. 914; Miller v. Spring Garden Ins. Co., 9 Cir., 202 F. 442; Ryan v. Becker, 136 Iowa 273, 111 N.W. 426, 14 L.R.A., N.S., 329; Fayter v. North, 30 Utah 156, 83 P. 742, 6 L.R.A.,N.S., 410; Jones v. Holland Furnace Co., 188 Wis. 394, 206 N. W. 57. The evidence of the statements of defendant\u2019s attorney does not change or modify the release, but only defines the subject matter to which it was meant to apply. We think it clearly admissible to clarify the effect of the release. Corbin, The Parol Evidence Rule, 53 Yale L.J. 603, 622, 623, and cases cited at n. 44; 9 Wig-more on Evidence, 3d Ed. 1940, \u00a7 2465, and cases cited at nn. 3 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 objection of a lack of notice of the hearing on the summary judgment is not well taken. The hearing took place as the opening step at the trial; and the District Court at an earlier time, when denying motions for summary judgments from both sides, had said that the trial judge would be in a better position to determine the issues, and the motions were denied \u201cwithout prejudice to renewal at the trial.\u201d Further, it was open to the judge to develop the issues either at a pre-trial hearing under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 16, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, or at the beginning of trial and to act on the basis of the showing then made. Plaintiffs made no suggestion of further evidence available or request for adjournment, and are not in a position to object now to the disposition of the case on a construction of the release.
