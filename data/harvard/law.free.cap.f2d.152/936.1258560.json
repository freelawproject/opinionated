He computed his 1940 net income for taxation on the cash basis and took a deduction of the above amount as taxes paid during that year. This deduction was disallowed by the Commissioner on the ground that the taxes \u201chad been assessed against the property prior to his acquisition on September 30, 1930\u201d and were part of his capital investment. The Commissioner determined a deficiency based on the inclusion in respondent\u2019s taxable income of the amount so paid but the Tax Court expunged it. The Commissioner has brought this petition to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">We think the Tax Court was right. Whether the purchaser who pays taxes assessed on property before its purchase may deduct them, as taxes paid, in computing the amount of his taxable income or must capiralize them as part of his investment in the property depends, so far as present issues are concerned, upon whether the former owner was personally liable for the taxes, or the property was subject to a tax lien when the purchaser took title. Magruder v. Supplee, 316 U.S. 394, 62 S.Ct. 1162, 86 L.Ed. 1555. Cf. Commissioner v. Coward, 3 Cir., 110 F.2d 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Just what is the nature of the tax liability of an owner of New York real estate is not always easily to be determined as is shown by the opinion of Judge L. Hand in McGregor v. Johnson, 2 Cir., 39 F.2d 574. We need not decide that vexed question now for it is well settled that an owner who is a non-resident of the tax district in which the property is located is never personally liable. McGregor v. Johnson, supra. As the respondent\u2019s vendor was a resident of Nassau County and this real estate was in the Borough of Manhattan he was not personally liable for the taxes when he transferred the title to the respondent. Unless there was a lien on the property for the taxes when the title passed the taxes became those of the respondent when the tax lien did attach during his ownership. Both of these conditions upon the respondent\u2019s subsequent payment of the taxes as his own are shown to have been met by the undisputed fact that the first half of the taxes previously assessed upon the property for the fiscal year involved became a lien on October 1, 1940, and not until then. The respondent, therefore, discharged a lien which had become effective upon his own property after he took title to it and the payment he made when so doing was a payment of his own taxes which he was entitled to deduct in his return of income. Magruder v. Supplee, supra. Bern-heimer Co. v. Commissioner, 41 B.T.A. 249, affirmed 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 454 upon which the petitioner relies is distinguishable. The issue there involved the right of the owner of property who reported its income on the accrual basis to accrue and deduct taxes after they had been assessed but before they were due, where ownership remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">In the brief for the petitioner we are told that inasmuch as the \u201ctransactions in New York City real estate are so numerous that the question is one of great importance,\u201d the Commissioner has brought this petition \u201cin order to establish a clear, definite and workable rule for the federal administration of its income tax laws with respect to when New York City real estate taxes become a liability, are accruable, are deductible and by whom, when real property is sold or transferred.\u201d The idea seems to be that there should be a federal rule establishing a uniform date determinative of the enumerated questions. Cf. Estate of Rogers v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 410. 64 S.Ct. 172, 88 L.Ed. 134; Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 59 S.Ct. 155, 83 L.Ed. 119, 119 A.L.R. 410; Burnet v. Harmel, 287 U.S. 103, 53 S.Ct. 74, 77 L.Ed. 199. These cases deal with instances in which the federal law and not the state law controls as to what is taxed. But the present issue concerns the right to a deduction and taxes which may be deducted under \u00a7 23(c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7 23(c) (1), are often, as in this instance, laid by taxing authorities other than the federal government. Then what are taxes and who is the taxpayer depends upon local law. We see no escape from the resulting difficulties in administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b995-9\">FRANK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">In S. E. &amp; M. E. Bernheimer Co. v. Commissioner, 41 B.T.A. 249, affirmed Hel-vering v. S. E. &amp; M. E. Bernheimer Co., 2 Cir., 121 F.2d 454, the record was silent as to whether the taxpayer was a resident of the taxing district and (as shown by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s brief therein) the case was argued in this court on the assumption- that it was a resident. As here vendor was a non-resident, we need not consider (and I understand do not) whether decision- would have been in taxpayer\u2019s favor had the vendor been a resident.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
