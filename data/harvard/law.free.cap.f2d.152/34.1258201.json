Logs are brought to his boomsite where appellee unloads them onto the river and assembles them into log rafts taken away by others. He charges for this unloading and assembling service on the basis of a log scale agreed upon between the purchaser and seller of the logs or under a log scale of a Scaling Bureau. His contention throughout this case is that the \u201cservice\u201d he performs is not a \u201ccommodity\u201d coming under the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 et seq., and therefore not subject to price control.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The complaint alleges that appellee sold his said services at prices exceeding maximum prices permissible under the applicable price regulations. Regulations relied on and asserted as applying are the General Maximum Price Regulation, effective May 1, 1942; Maximum Price Regulation No. 165 and amendment No. 23 to the latter regulation, which amendment became effective June 23, 1943.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These regulations provide generally that the basis of charges was the highest price charged during the month of March, 1942, for the same or similar services. The overcharges are alleged to have been exacted between February 1, 1943 and October 1, 1943. After trial, the lower court dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Both here and below, appellee challenges without qualification the application of the Act and the regulations to his business operations. If by the clear and unmistakable language of the statute, they are excluded from the scope of price control legislation, his position is sound. But we cannot read such a Congressional purpose in the plain and simple provisions of the Act. Clearly, it was intended to accomplish its announced purpose. (Section 1(a) of the Act.) The price stabilization program made necessary by the exigent demands of total war was well nigh all-inclusive. It was frankly designed to prevent the inflationary spiral so characteristic of war periods. That Congress had no illusions concerning such a danger is apparent. Cf. Senate Report No. 931, 77th Congress, 2d Session, p. 25. This contemplation of the pressing problem is emphasized in numerous impressive court pronouncements. We do not doubt that the business operations of appellee fall within the broad terms of the Act. (See-Section 302 of Act for types of business excluded.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">With respect to the regulations issued pursuant to the broad powers granted the Price Administrator to issue \u201csuch regulations and orders as he may deem necessary or proper in order to carry out the purposes and provisions of the Act\u201d (section 201(d) we find conclusive evidence of the clear intent of Congress to make anti-inflation controls as effective as legislative ingenuity could devise. We are specifically forbidden by the Act to \u201cconsider\u201d the validity and legality of the regulations (section 204(d). Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834; Bowles v. Willingham, 321 U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 641, 88 L.Ed. 892; Rosensweig v. United States, 9 Cir., 144 F.2d 30; Bowles v. Nu Way Laundry, 10 Cir., 144 F.2d 741, 746, certiorari denied 323 U.S. 791, 65 S.Ct. 431. It is, of course, the province and the duty of the court to determine for itself whether a defendant is within the coverage of the Act or regulation, but in the determination of that question it is not competent for the court to consider the fairness or the equity of any regulation or price schedule established thereby. Such consideration is reserved for the Emergency Court. Bowles v. Nu Way Laundry, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">As noted, the Act itself does not, eo nomine, exclude the services here considered. From the record it appears that the Administrator construes the regulations to cover such services and the regulations at no time excluded them by name. The construction given the regulations even prior to the adoption of an amendment (No. 23) to the Maximum Price Regulation 165, would bring booming and rafting ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>vices within the orbit of price control. Since the Act itself is void of language definitely excluding such services from the scope of the Act, we therefore hold such services to be within its terms. See Bowles v. American Brewery, 4 Cir., 146 F.2d 842, 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">It would appear that the Administrator in the exercise of the undoubted power to promulgate regulations, elected later to remove any possible doubt concerning the coverage and applicability of the general regulations by specifically naming 'booming and rafting in the amendment (No. 23). His interpretation of the Act and the applicability of the regulations issued under \u2022 authority of the Act are entitled to great weight and serious consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also where the regulations purport to apply, the issue of applicability of the Act is a question for the Emergency Court only. See United States v. Pepper Bros., 3 Cir., 142 F.2d 340, 343; Bowles v. Cullen, 2 Cir., 148 F.2d 621; Bowles v. American Brewery, supra; Bowles v. Texas Liquor Board, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">To sustain the district court\u2019s judgment, appellee maintains that the Act does not apply to log booms, but this argument, if sustained, would require us to determine whether the Act empowers the regulations to which we have referred. Only the Emergency Court may consider such questions. Nor may we question the validity of a regulation by the process of construing the statute. , Bowles v. Case, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Appellee questions the authority of the Price Administrator to delegate the function of instituting treble-damage actions. Sec. 205(e) of Emergency Price Control Act. The Act (Sec. 201(a) authorizes the appointment of employees \u201cto carry out [the] <em>functions and duties\u201d </em>of the Administrator. Other provisions of this Section empower his authorized representatives to exercise any or all of his powers in any place, and the Administrator is authorized to issue such regulations and orders as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes and provisions of the Act. This language is sufficient to' give the Administrator power to delegate the suit-bringing function to any \u201cauthorized representative\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The legislative history of the price control bill gives persuasive weight to this view. The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in reporting out the Price Control Bill (1942), described Section 201(a) and (b) as follows (Sen.Rept. No. 931, 77th Cong. 2nd Session pp. 20, 21):</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\u201cSection 201(a) authorizes the Administrator to hire such employees, utilize and to establish such regional, local, or other agencies, and to accept such voluntary and uncompensated services as he deems to be necessary. He may perform his duties through such employees or agencies <em>by delegating to them any of the powers given to him by the bill. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">\u201cSection 201(b) provides that the principal office of the Administrator shall be in the District of Columbia but authorizes the Administrator, or any representative or other agency <em>to whom he may delegate any or all of his </em>powers, <em>to exercise such powers in- any place. * * * </em>\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">In the 1944 House Hearings on the proposed extension of the 1942 Act, the Deputy Administrator for Enforcement, OPA, frankly told the Committee having charge of the bill that the national office did not institute litigation, \u201cthat is done in the field offices * * * each district office has authority * * * to institute litigation * * * we cannot review all of the activities which go on in the field. As a matter of morale, if we have given them the job to do, we cannot substitute our judgment for theirs.\u201d With this frank and illuminating explanation and interpretation of departmental procedure before it, Congress extended the life of the Act. When re-enactment of the statute occurs, legislative ratification of the administrative interpretation may well be inferred. See Green Valley Creamery v. United States, 1 Cir., 108 F.2d 342; Brewster v. Gage, 280 U.S. 327, 50 S.Ct. 115, 74 L.Ed. 457; McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., 283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>U.S. 488, 51 S.Ct. 510, 75 L.Ed. 1183. If Congress was averse to this type of enforcement operations, it could have amended the enforcement provisions but it did not. Courts are not barred from the use of such legislative history which are pertinent aids to statutory construction and legislative intent. See United States v. Dickerson, 310 U.S. 554, 562, 60 S.Ct. 1034, 84 L.Ed. 1356; United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, 310 U.S. 534, 539, 549, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345. Administrative construction of an act is always entitled to weight and serious consideration. See United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, supra; White v. Winchester Country Club, 315 U.S. 32, 41, 62 S.Ct. 425, 86 L.Ed. 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">General Order No. 3 of the OPA, as amended October 6, 1942 (7 F.R. 7910) empowered Regional Enforcement Attorneys, among other high OPA officials, to authorize <em>any OPA attorney </em>to institute <em>any designated </em>civil action. On June 4, 1943, pursuant to a new policy of decentralization the restriction as to \u201cdesignated\u201d cases was removed by the Regional Enforcement Attorney at San Francisco by telegram to the Chief Enforcement Attorney at Portland, Oregon (who instituted this suit). On June 10, 1943, Revised General Order No. 3 was issued (8 F.R. 8027) which empowered Regional Enforcement Attorneys to authorize any attorney employed by OPA to institute civil actions in the name of the Price Administrator. The Portland attorney for appellant was an employee of the OPA. The Regional Litigation Attorney from San Francisco participated in the final argument below. We consider both of these official employees to be \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d, and the delegation to be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We do not view the holding in Cudahy Packing Co. v. Holland, 315 U.S. 357, 62 S.Ct. 651, 86 L.Ed. 895, as militating against the contention of appellant that under the statute the Price Administrator could and did delegate the suit-bringing function. Under the Price Control Act every administrative function is referred to as a function of the Administrator. These functions are delegable and under Section 201(a) of the Price Control Act the Administrator may appoint \u201csuch employees as he deems necessary <em>in order to carry out his functions and duties under this Act.\u201d </em>The Act authorizes the appointed attorneys (Section 201) to appear for and represent the Administrator <em>in any case in any co-utrt. </em>Language conferring broader powers of representation would be hard to formulate. The attorneys for the Administrator in this case were duly authorized to institute the litigation. In this connection, it may be noted that authority to delegate powers has also been implied from statutory rale making powers (see Section 201(d) of the Price Control Act). Plapao Laboratories v. Farley, 67 App.D.C. 304, 92 F.2d 228, 229; Lewis Pub. Co. v. Wyman, C.C., 152 F. 787; United States v. Bareno, D.C. 50 F.Supp. 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The legislative history in the Cudahy Packing Co. case demonstrated a Congressional intent <em>not </em>to delegate the subpoena power; the legislative history in the present case affirmatively shows that the power to delegate the suit-bringing function <em>was intended. </em>Moreover, the suit-bringing function may well not be as oppressive as the power to issue a subpoena which is not returnable before a judicial officer. Courts have upheld the delegation of functions at least as suggestively oppressive as the one in the case at bar. Compare Shreveport Engraving Co. v. United States, 5 Cir., 143 F.2d 222; La Porte v. Bitker, 7 Cir., 145 F.2d 445; Lew Shee v. Nagle, 9 Cir., 22 F.2d 107; Lloyd Royal Beige Societe Anonyme v. Elting, 2 Cir., 61 F.2d 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Independently of such administrative delegation under the statute, there was promulgated a general order, dated September 7, 1944, (Second Revised General Order No. 3, 9 F.R. 11137) which effectively ratified the bringing of the suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Delegation of the suit-bringing function has been upheld by several district courts. Bowles v. James Henry Packing Co., D.C. W.D.Wash., 62 F.Supp. 306, before Leavy, J.; Bowles v. Krause Milling Co., D.C.E.D. Wis., 62 F.Supp. 244; Bowles v. Slater, D.C.E.D.Mich., 1945, <em>64 </em>F.Supp. 387. If ratification be deemed necessary to sustain the action, it appears here.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Furthermore it appears settled law that \u201cthe unauthorized bringing of an action may * * * be ratified by the person in whose name and on whose account it was brought <em>so </em>as <em>to </em>sustain the action from the beginning\u201d. Mechem on Agency \u00a7 529 (1914). See Robb v. Vos, 155 U.S. 13, 39, 15 S.Ct. 4, 39 L.Ed. <em>52; </em>Rodgers v. Bromberg, 5 Cir., 53 F.2d 723, 724, certiorari denied 285 U.S. 542, 52 S.Ct. 314, 76 L.Ed. 934; Couch et al. v. Central Bank and Trust Corp., 5 Cir., 297 F. 216; Massachusetts Construction Co. v. Kidd, C.C.Mass., 142 F. 285. With authority in the Administrator to delegate the suit-bringing function, the use of such power must be determined, not when suit was brought, but when judgment is rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Giving the fullest weight to appellee\u2019s argument on delegation, it does not follow that appellee has a vested right in a mistake of administrative officials. See Wright &amp; Taylor v. Lucas, 6 Cir., 45 F.2d 75, 78; Swayne &amp; Hoyt v. United States, 300 U.S. 297, 301, 302, 57 S.Ct. 478, 81 L.Ed. 659; Graham v. Goodcell, 282 U.S. 409, 429, 51 S.Ct. 186, 75 L.Ed. 415; Charlotte Harbor Ry. v. Welles, 260 U.S. 8, 43 S.Ct. 3, 67 L.Ed. 100; United States v. Heinszen, 206 U.S. 370, 27 S.Ct. 742, 51 L.Ed. 1098, 11 Ann.Cas. 688. Although some of these cases involve legislative ratification, we think them applicable here where the suit-bringing function is clearly delegable under the statute. Being delegable, ratification may follow institution of an action by counsel to. whom such authority <em>could </em>be delegated under the -statute. This is particularly true where the defect in administration could be corrected without violating any substantial equity. The Supreme Court has also held that such ratification is valid' though it occurs after judgment by the lower court and pending appeal. Rafferty v. Smith Bell Co., 257 U.S. 226, 42 S.Ct. 71, 66 L.Ed. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"AzK\">It is objected that the ratification here is too general; that it is necessary for the Administrator to consider each case before he may ratify it. But such a rule of law is for the benefit and protection of the principal and not for third parties to claim. Compare also United States v. Hall, 9 Cir., 145 F.2d 781, as to delegations broad in their language.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Applying the regulations to the facts disclosed by the record, we are convinced that appellee\u2019s customers, as of March, 1942, and subsequent thereto, were not purchasers of the same class, but were set in different price classes according to economic conditions and appellee\u2019s own need for business at the time they became his customers. His own testimony shows this.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">The Administrator\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>of the Maximum Price <em>Regulation No. 165 </em>as <em>to </em>\u201cpurchasers of the same class\u201d was upheld in Bowles v. Nu Way Laundry, supra. The court found that under applicable regulations (General Maximum Price Regulations, Section 20(k), applicable from February 1, 1943 to June 23, 1943) and Maximum Price Regulation 165 (applicable June 23, 1943 to September 30, 1943) all of appellee\u2019s customers during March, 1942, and during February 1, 1943-September 30, 1943, were purchasers of the same class, and therefore, since the price range for appellee\u2019s customers as of March, 1942, was 600 to 800, any change of rates by appellee within the limits of these figures would not violate the regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 20 (k) of the General Maximum Price Regulation defines \u201cpurchaser of the same class\u201d by reference to \u201cthe practice adopted by the seller in setting forth prices for commodities or services for sales to different purchasers aor kinds of purchasers.\u201d A similar definition occurs in Maximum Price Regulation 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Both of the above regulations were clearly interpreted by the Administrator as to the meaning of the phrase \u201cpurchasers of the same class.\u201d See for G.M.P.R., Pike and Fischer, O.P.A. Service, pp. 11:968,9; for M.P.R. 165, \u201cManual No. 2 under Maximum Price Regulation 165 \u2014 .Services\u201d, p. 21, Pike and Fischer, O.P.A. Service, p. 15:819. Illustrative of the Administrator\u2019s interpretation is this sentence taken from the \u201cmanual\u201d: \u201cWhether one class of customer is or is not the same as another class depends principally <em>on your own </em>business practice. If you customarily recognized one class as differing from another by charging different prices, you will be required to continue treating them as different classes.\u201d The regulations seem clear, but if ambiguous, the Administrator\u2019s interpretation, as indicated above, is entitled to great weight. Compare Consolidated Water Power &amp; Paper Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1944, 146 F.2d 492; Bowles v. Seminole Rock <em>&amp; </em>Sand Co., 65 S.Ct. 1215; Bowles v. Nu Way Laundry, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Appellant next objects to the district court\u2019s conclusion that the fact that a rate increase was allowed to Scott Rafting Co. justifies defendant\u2019s rate increase and demonstrates that defendant s increases did not affect the cost of living and were consistent with Executive Order 9328, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 901 note. What the Administrator did in the case of Scott would not seem pertinent here. See Brown v. Mars, 8 Cir., 135 F.2d 843. In any case, we are here solely concerned with the question of whether the defendant violated the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">There appears to be no power under the Act for the district court to adjust defendant\u2019s rates. Denials by the Administrator of rate adjustments are subject to protest, and such denials are made reviewable by the Act only in the Emergency Court which is the exclusive tribunal for. review of allegedly discriminatory or invalid administrative action. Yakus v. United States, supra; Bowles v. Willingham, supra; see also Capitol Foundry Co. v. Bowles, Em.App.1944, 146 F.2d 855; Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., supra. (It appears from the record that defendant is now seeking adjustment of its rates with the National Office.) Nor would it be a defense to defendant that other alleged violators were not subject to enforcement suits. See Moskovitz v. City of St. Paul, 318 Minn. 543, 16 N.W.2d <em>745.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Appellee maintains that plaintiff\u2019s complaint is insufficient for uncertainty and failure to negative exceptions in the Act. This court has said: \u201cIndefiniteness of the complaint is not a ground for dismissal. If a defendant needs additional information to enable him to answer or prepare for trial the procedure provided by the Federal Rules is a motion for a more definite statement or for a bill of particulars [Rule 12(e)].\u201d Bowles v. Glick Bros. Lumber Co., <em>9 Cir., 146 F.2d 566, 568 </em>certiorari denied 65 S.Ct. 1554. Nor was appellant \u201crequired to anticipate or negative a defense,\u201d which may have been set out as an exception or proviso in the Act. McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353, 43 S.Ct. 132, <em>67 </em>L.Ed. 301; Evans v. United States, 153 U.S. 584, 14 S.Ct. 934, 38 L.Ed. 830; United States v. Pepper Bros., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">Appellant objects to the court finding as a fact that the defendant\u2019s increases during February 1, 1943-September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>30, 1943 were made in good faith and in the. reasonable belief that the Act and regulations did not apply, and were not the result of wilfulness or failure to take practicable precautions; and in failing to hold that even if these facts were true they would not constitute a <em>complete </em>defense to the action. Under section 205(e) as amended by \u00a7 108(b) of Stabilization Extension Act of 1944, Public Law 383, 78th Congress, 2d Session, \u201cif the defendant proves that the violation * * * was neither wilful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the occurrence of [violations],\u201d the court may mitigate the treble damages provided for in the Act for violations. In Bowles v. Glick Bros. Lumber Co., supra, this court said: \u201csuch partial defenses as are afforded by the amendments must be pleaded and proved by the defendants.\u201d It appears that although the amendment to the Price Control Act relating to the mitigation of damages became effective June 30, 1944 nevertheless the amendment applies to this case. See Section 108(c) of the Stabilization Extension Act of 1944, see 50 U.S.C.A. War Appendix, Section 925, Historical Note. The facts disclosed, and the testimony of ap-pellee, did not meet these defense requirements in a treble damage suit. There was a failure of proof on the part of appellee in this particular and the finding of the court thereon is without support in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Counsel for appellant, in their brief, urge us to send the case back in order that appellee may be required \u201cto plead and prove the taking of practicable precautions and freedom from wilfulness.\u201d In light of the unsupported finding of the court on this issue, we see no valid reason for rejecting this request since in any event the case must be remanded to permit amendment of the pr\u00e9-trial order and the issue of wilfulness . and the taking of practicable precautions may well be settled by further proceedings in the case at that time. We think the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to amend the pre-trial order in the respects mentioned in the motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Certain material statements in the pre-trial order are clearly erroneous as appear from facts disclosed at the trial. The order should, and properly so, be made to conform to the facts, some of which appear in the transcriptions made from records of appellee, both parties at pretrial agreeing that they correctly recited the facts as to dates and charges. Other portions of the pre-trial order should be amended to conform to appellant\u2019s motion, which is sustained by the record. Since the pre-trial order was not settled until after the trial, we cannot agree with, appellee that he will be prejudiced by these changes which only amend the order to conform to the evidence and regulations before the court. We are of the view, and so hold, that on the issue of damages, appellant must prevail in this action. However, the further issue of whether treble damages should be recovered presents a question of fact which may only be determined by the trial court on the submission of additional proof on that issue, conformable to the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The judgment of the lower court is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to amend the pre-trial order in conformity to the views herein expressed, and to permit amendment of appellee\u2019s amended answer to present the issue of wilfulness and failure to take practicable precautions against occurrence of the violations charged in appellant\u2019s complaint. Ap-pellee is entitled to present other and further evidence and testimony on this issue to supplement the record.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\"> In the General Maximum Price Regulation (7 F.R. 3153), see especially sections 1499.1(a); 1499.2(a), (b), and explanations \u201cHighest Price Charged During March 1942,\u201d and \u201cSimilar Services\u201d; 1499.10; 1499.20(k), (t); 1499.21.

(by Mr. Wheeler) * * * We had a difference in rates. It has been a historical difference. It had existed for some period of time. * * * You want to know why there was' a difference in rates? * * * As of, say, January 1st, 1942?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">\u201cQ. Yes. A. Well, that came about by different circumstances. For instance,, the Standard Logging Company came to us right at the absolute bottom of the depression. * * * In order to get the total volume of business up we gave them a very <em>good </em>price and the \u2014 it is of record\u2014 whenever a man got a price it didn\u2019t change him out of that class. Later we needed some business from the Mist Logging Company and we gave them a price comparable to the Standard. At that time we needed some more business. And when, for instance, when Mill City came along that boom didn\u2019t need any more business and we gave them a price that fit the condition. So that was our price structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">It sounds rather ridiculous but we have never lost a customer. We kept them satisfied. That is the proof of the thing. The competitive conditions prevailing at the time that we made the deal governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>the price, and whenever I wanted more revenue I increased them all horizontally.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\"> In its motion to amend the pre-trial order appellant maintains these figures should bo from 600 to 750.
