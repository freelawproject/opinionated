The defendant moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint, which the district judge granted after a consideration of the merits. Although the New Rules have abolished the writ of mandamus (Rule 81(b), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c), the same relief may be had \u201cby appropriate action or by appropriate motion\u201d; and we disregard the error, which was only one of form. The difficulty goes deeper, for it is abundantly settled, as appears from the decisions cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>in the margin,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that district courts have no jurisdiction to grant such relief except as ancillary to the exercise of some independently conferred jurisdiction. Therefore, whatever may be the relator\u2019s grievance, it is not justiciable before the courts, or at least it is not remediable by an order of reinstatement. The judgment was wrong in dismissing the complaint upon the merits; it should have done so for the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed for the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-17\"> McIntire v.
