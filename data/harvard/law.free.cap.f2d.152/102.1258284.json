Taxpayer agrees that, had there been no new trust, the Commissioner\u2019s determination would have been correct. As there is ample evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s inference that the change was merely formal, the new trust being a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tinuation of the old, we cannot disturb that Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2. The Tax Court did <em>not </em>discuss the transfers made by the daughter to the trustee after 1933. Although she filed gift tax returns with respect to these transfers, it is unlikely that these were gifts of her property since, had they been, she would have been increasing the life income of her wealthy father. As he, having his gift tax exemptions in mind, may have made these gifts to the trust in his daughter\u2019s name, taxpayer, to overcome the presumption in favor of the Commissioner\u2019s determination, should have offered proof \u2014 easily available to her \u2014 that she had been the real owner of the property added to the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
