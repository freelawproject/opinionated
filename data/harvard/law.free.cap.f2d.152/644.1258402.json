At least as early as 1931, he was afflicted with a mental disease known as paranoid schizophrenia and was treated by a New York neurologist during 1929 and 1930. In January of 1931, upon 'the \u25a0 advice of this doctor that the change would probably be beneficial, Cerutti returned to Italy where he has ever since lived with relatives or at the Villa Turro Sanitarium near Milan as an occasional patient. In 1937, Cerutti inherited a substantial amount of cash and securities in New York. Relatives in Italy instituted \u201cinterdiction\u201d proceedings; and in April of that year Ce-rutti was adjudged an incompetent by the Italian court and a temporary administrator and guardian was appointed. In February. of the same year, similar proceedings had been instituted by appellants in the Supreme Court of New York; and a trial by a jury resulted in an adjudication of incompetency. The Italian guardian appeared and sought appointment as ancillary committee of Cerutti\u2019s New York property; but, adopting the report of an official referee, the court found Cerutti domiciled and resident, within the meaning of the New York statute, in New York, and by final decree of March, 1939, appointed the appellants as a resident committee of his property. After the vesting order became effective, the appellants duly filed with the defendant a notice of claim for the return of the property but made no application therefor to the President and then brought this suit to recover the property under \u00a7 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, supra. The District Court dismissed the complaint on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">Determination on this appeal, both as to the propriety of the seizure and of the standing of the plaintiffs to sue under \u00a7 9(a) of the Act, depends upon whether Cerutti is an \u201cenemy\u201d or a \u201cnational of a designated enemy country.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the definitions as set out, this turns on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Cerutti was a \u201cresident\u201d of Italy at the time of the vesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Appellants first contend that we are foreclosed by the finding in the commitment proceedings of the New York Supreme Court from again investigating the residence of Cerutti. But commitment proceedings are in rem to determine status. See Hughes v. Jones, 116 N.Y. 67, 22 N.E. 446, 5 L.R.A. 632, 15 Am.St.Rep. 386. And as such they bind non-parties only as to the status found. See Restatement, Judgments (1942), \u00a7 74(1), and comment a. The decree is \u201cnot conclusive [upon non-parties] as to a fact upon which the judgment is based * * Id. at \u00a7 74 (2), and comment c.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In argument we are presented with contrary definitions of the word \u201cresident.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellants argue first that it means domicile, and alternatively, that if it doesn\u2019t, it means some conception of legal residence as opposed to actual residence or happenstance physical presence in an enemy country. They then point to many facts to show that Cerutti remained \u201cresident\u201d in the United States: being mentally incompetent, he was never capable of forming the requisite intent to change his domicile or legal residence; that he was in Italy only for the specific purpose of his health ;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that his remaining in Italy after declaration of war was involuntary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">The appellee to the contrary contends that \u201cresident\u201d, as used in the presently pertinent statute, is to be taken to refer to physical presence alone; and further points out that in any event Cerutti, while in this country, had always intended to return to Italy; that when he went there he stayed with relatives; that he was only occasionally, and then voluntarily, an inmate of Villa Turro; that when he was, he was a \u201cfree incompetent\u201d; that he tried to purchase a new villa in Italy; that he paid taxes, contributed to local charities, was a sympathizer with the Fascist regime, and voted in the general election of 1934 after having previously ascertained that he was properly enrolled as an Italian citizen and subject.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district judge found that Cerutti had be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>come an \u201cactual resident\u201d of Italy and entered judgment for the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In determining whether Cerutti falls within the provisions of the statute authorizing the seizure of the property of a citizen of the United States, his physical presence, or to use the phrase of the trial court his \u201cactual residence\u201d there at the time the vesting order took effect, is not decisive. Stadtmuller v. Miller, 2 Cir., 11 F.2d <em>732, 45 A.L.R. </em>895; Vowinckel v. First Federal Trust Co., 9 Cir., 10 F.2d 19; Miller v. Sinjen, 8 Cir., 289 F. 388. Cerutti\u2019s property in New York was in no way threatened with subjection to enemy uses by reason of his presence in Italy. He had' no control over it himself since it was being administered by a committee appointed by the New York court; and, consequently, Italy could exercise no control over it through the control of him. Furthermore, \u2022 the New York court would not have .permitted its use for the benefit of an enemy. See Petition of Bernheimer, 3 Cir., 130 F.2d 396. Such use could also have been prevented by a freezing order issued by the Treasury. See Executive Orders Nos. 8389 and 8785, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The property being in cash and securities its confiscation was not required, as, for instance, is the case of assets consisting of, or controlling, manufacturing facilities usable to secure production of materials to aid this government in the prosecution of the war; and, as a means for the purchase of such materials, it was comparatively negligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The purpose of confiscation under the Trading with the Enemy Act is either to lessen the ability of the enemy government to make war upon the United States by depriving it of the means so to do which would otherwise be within its reach or to enhance the ability of this country to prosecute the war. Prize Cases, 2 Black 635, 17 L.Ed. 459; Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 18 L.Ed. 939; Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 20 L.Ed. 135, 155; United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 9-11, 47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131. To prevent advantage to an enemy by trading with a citizen residing in the enemy\u2019s country the property of the citizen may be seized and confiscated. The Venus, 8 Cranch. 253, 3 L.Ed. 553; Miller v. United States; supra; Kahn v. Garvan, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 263 F. 909. Residence by a citizen in the enemy\u2019s country for the purpose of trade stamps the property of the citizen with an enemy character sufficient to support the seizure and confiscation of his property. The Frances, 8 Cranch. 363, 3 L.Ed. 590. \u201c* * * any property which the enemy can use, either by actual appropriation or by the exercise of control over its owner, or which the adherents of the enemy have the power of devoting to the enemy\u2019s use, is a proper subject of confiscation.\u201d Miller v. United States, supra, 11 Wall. 268, at pages 305, 306, 20 L.Ed. 135. The powers given the Custodian are phrased broadly so as to make for flexibility of administration enabling effectuation of the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">When this significance is, as it should be, given to term \u201cresident\u201d in the Trading with the Enemy Act as amended by the First War Powers Act of 1941 and in the Executive Orders promulgated thereunder, it does not include a citizen in Cerutti\u2019s situation. He went to Italy on a temporary visit to attempt to regain his lost mental health. He remained there for that purpose until the war broke out and after that was unable to return. No presumption arose under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 804 from his continuous stay in Italy for three years that his citizenship acquired by naturalization had been lost since, by \u00a7 806(a) of Title 8 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 804 thereof is made inapplicable to a person residing abroad on account of ill health.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Although one with his mental incapacity may not have lived abroad involuntarily, by the same token it is impossible to say that he has voluntarily remained there except in the status he had when he went there for a temporary visit. We think \u201cresident\u201d in the statute and orders imports something more than mere physical presence in a designated enemy country. It would be inconceivable, for instance, that Congress intended to provide for the confiscation of the property of a member of the American armed forces who was captured and held as a prisoner of war within a designated enemy country. Yet in the sense that he was physically present in the enemy country he would be a resident thereof. No such absurd construction of the term is, of course, admissible. Nor does such an extreme case need to be used for illustration. Cerutti\u2019s case is a fair example.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>His physical presence in Italy at the time his property was seized was a condition not attributable as a matter of law to his volition; his property could not be used to aid the enemy; he was not engaged in trade with the enemy and he could engage in no commercial activities of any kind whatever. He was an American citizen whose presence in Italy for reasons beyond his control did not subject his property to any control or use by an enemy government and so did not make him a \u201cresident\u201d of Italy within the meaning of the statute and executive orders under which his property in this country was seized. Stadtmuller v. Miller, supra; Vowinckel v. First Federal Trust Co., supra; Miller v. Sinjen, supra. Consequently he was neither an \u201cenemy\u201d nor \u201ca foreign national\u201d nor \u201ca national of a designated enemy country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Though a vesting order may not necessarily be condemnation nor confiscation, it does, when it lawfully becomes effective, prevent any suit for the recovery of the property except in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act, Draeger Shipping Co., Inc., v. Crowley, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 49 F. Supp. 215, and leaves the ultimate disposition of property subject to action by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We are bound to construe the term \u201cresident\u201d in so far as reasonably possible in a way to avoid either invalidating the statute and orders on constitutional grounds or raising a serious doubt as to their constitutionality. Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co., 264 U.S. 298, 307, 44 S.Ct. 336, 68 L.Ed. 696, 32 A.L.R. 786; Ex parte Mitsuye Endo, 323 U.S. 283, 299, 65 S.Ct. 208; United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; El. Co., 287 U.S. 77, 82, 53 S.Ct. 42, 77 L.Ed. 175. If the term \u201cresident\u201d is held to include a United States citizen in the situation of Cerutti and the statute and orders are construed to provide for the seizure and withholding of his property in this country, held here as it is, the failure to provide any remedy for its return or for just compensation to the owner for its seizure, other than what \u00a7 9(a) affords, would create such a doubt. Becker Co. v. Cummings, 296 U.S. 74, 79, 56 S.Ct. 15, 80 L.Ed. 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">CLARK, Circuit Judge, dissents with memo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-10\"> The Custodian purported to act under the powers given the President by \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) and 5(b) of the Trading with the Enemy Act of October 6, 1917, as amended by \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 302 of Title III of the First War Powers Act of 1941. 40 Stat. 412, 415, 50 U.S.C.A.

Indeed, I cannot avoid the feeling that the present result seems rather absurd as a practical matter. For it views as still a resident of New York for war-defense purposes a man who returned to his old homeland (lately an enemy country) a decade and a half ago, of his own volition and by himself, and stayed there, trying to purchase a villa, paying taxes, contributing to local charities, being \u201ca sympathizer with the Fascist regime,\u201d voting there \u201cin the general election of 1934 after having previously ascertained that he was properly enrolled as an Italian citizen and subject,\u201d and being \u201conly occasionally, and then voluntarily,\u201d an inmate of a sanitarium. Not until six years after his return was he adjudged an incompetent, and then only as to his property. This holding opens distinct possibilities as to means of retaining not merely American citizenship, but American residence for many years after actual\" residence in a country now our enemy. For example, consider a person caught abroad by the depression without means to return; does he not come within the ruling? I do not think this case is like that of \u201ctransients,\u201d such as prisoners of war or other quite temporary visitors. Stadtmuller v. Miller, 2 Cir., 11 F.2d 732, 45 A.L.R. 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">The result here appears to flow from two premises, neither of which should be accepted in my judgment. The first is the effectiveness of the adjudication of incompetency (not of commitment) in the New York courts. Had this adjudication not existed, I doubt if Cerutti\u2019s Italian actual residence would have been questioned. But as properly pointed out, this adjudication is not legally binding. It should not be made so practically, having in mind the obvious different setting and purpose of the state proceeding. The second is that under the circumstances Cerutti\u2019s New York property could not be subjected to enemy uses or enhance the ability of this country to prosecute the war. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Passing the point that we cannot know this by any direct evidence of record, I think the whole purpose of the legislation may be frustrated if courts attempt to decide the validity of seizure upon the equities of individual cases. If we are unwilling to declare the invalidity of this war statute as a whole, we are not at liberty to set it aside in particular cases. This is a stern measure, so much so that probably Congress, as before, will be induced to take action for a return in part, if not in whole, of the seized property. But we should not try to anticipate such general legislation by special action in particular instances. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
