The District Court held the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d to be solely at fault. From this decree the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d has appealed, while the owner of the scow has' appealed from that portion of the decree which absolved the tug \u201cFairwill\u201d from blame.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-12\">As is so frequent in cases of maritime collisions, there are serious conflicts in the evidence as to almost every material feature of these cases. We are here bound by the findings of the District Judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, unless these findings are deemed by us to be clearly erroneous. We cannot so deem the material findings here, so we must affirm the decision below. Hodges v. Standard Oil Co., 4 Cir., 123 F.2d 362; The E. Luckenbach, 4 Cir., 93 F. 841, 842, 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d is a motor vessel of 141.5 feet length, 27.1 feet beam, 10.3 feet depth, and a burden of 330 gross tons. The \u201cFairwill\u201d is a Diesel motor tug of 58.6 feet length, 17.4 feet beam, 8.3 feet depth, a burden of 51 gross tons, with a full Diesel Eairbanks-Morse engine of 210 horsepower. The scow 72-H (light at the time of the collision) is a wooden, flat deck, square end dump scow of 120 feet length, 35.3 feet width and 13.5 feet depth, with a two-foot coaming across each end and down both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">The collision occurred about 6:40 A. M. on November 5, 1942. The weather and visibility were then good, the tide was the first of the ebb. The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d had left the Norfolk Navy Yard, on the Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River, bound for Solomons, Maryland, with 263 officers and enlisted men aboard. Her starting course was almost due North. The \u201cFair-will,\u201d lashed to the scow, left the Craney Island dumping ground bound for a dredge then operating in the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River. Her course was generally South, with the necessity of a turn to the East in order to enter the Eastern Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Before the collision, the \u201cLillian Anne,\u201d proceeding under a full speed ahead order, though her engines had not warmed up, was making a speed of at least 4% miles per hour; Martin, on the \u201cLillian Anne,\u201d admitted a speed of 5 or 6 miles an hour, while the neutral witnesses, Whitehurst and Jones, estimated her speed, the former around 10 or 12 knots, and the latter at 8 miles an hour. Not unimportant here are the force of the impact and the effects of the collision on the scow. The \u201cFairwill,\u201d under one bell, was making about 2 miles per hour. The vessels, we think, were on meeting, not on crossing, courses. Pilot Martin, of the \u201cLillian Anne,\u201d when asked: \u201cWhat lights did you see on the tugboat when you first saw her?\u201d replied: \u201cTow lights and red and green.\u201d The \u201cFairwill\u201d appears to have first sighted the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d off the \u201cFairwill\u2019s\u201d starboard bow, about 400 yards away. The \u201cFairwill\u201d was seen by the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d at a much greater distance; pilot Martin estimated the distance at 750 yards.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-17\">The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d gave a one-whistle signal for a port to port passage, to which an assenting signal was given by the \u201cFairwill.\u201d We think this procedure was proper. If, as Captain Gatewood testified, he heard no assenting signal from the \u201cFairwill,\u201d the question immediately arises: Should he have continued at full speed in a crowded harbor? See The City of Chester, 4 Cir., 78 F. 186; Construction Aggregates Co. v. Long Island Railroad Co., 2 Cir., 105 F.2d 1009, 1012. Captain Gate-wood admitted that the enlisted men on his boat were \u201chollerin\u2019 and carrying on.\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>This may well have prevented Captain Gatewood from hearing the assenting signal given by the \u201cFairwill.\u201d We find no merit in the contention that the \u201cFairwill\u201d should have refused assent to the proposed port to port passage and should have immediately given a danger signal. See The Manhasset, D.C., 34 F. 408; The George L. Garlick, D.C., 91 F. 920, 927. We uphold, too, the finding that the \u201cFairwill\u201d carried proper lights, both on the tug indicating a tow and also on the scow. The testimony of the neutral witnesses, Whitehurst and Jones, was quite clear on this point. Of course, the \u201cFairwill,\u201d with the tow as the encumbered vessel, was much more difficult to maneuver quickly than the \u201cLillian Anne,\u201d of which fact Pilot Martin of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d was duly apprised when he saw the tow lights on the tug over 700 yards distant. See The Georgetown, D.C., 135 F. 854, 858; The Howard Reeder, 4 Cir. 207 F. 929, 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">It was conceded that neither the \"Lillian Anne\u201d nor the \u201cFairwill\u201d had a lookout. There was violent conflict in the testimony as to the place of the collision and the course of these two vessels just before the collision. The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d contended that the \u201cFairwill\u201d was then making her turn to port, which would bring the tug across the \u201cLillian Anne\u2019s\u201d course; while the \u201cFairwill\u201d contended that this turn had already been made and that Mate Hudgins (navigator of the \u201cFairwill\u201d), upon receiving the \u201cLillian Anne\u2019s\u201d signal for a port to port passage, immediately, and properly, changed her course to starboard. We cannot disturb the District Court\u2019s finding which upheld the contention of the \u201cFair-will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Shortly before the collision, the \u201cFair-will,\u201d observing that the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d was heading in dangerously close to the scow, repeated the one-blast signal in an effort, as the District Judge found, \u201cto get the \u2018Lillian Anne\u2019 to turn further to her starboard, which she had the time and room to do.\u201d But the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d blew a three-whistle signal and put her engines full speed astern; the \u201cFairwill\u201d did likewise. The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d had left-handed engines, so the effect of this procedure was to cant the bow of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d to port into the course of the scow, while the \u201cFairwill\u2019s\u201d bow swung to starboard away from the \u201cLillian Anne.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The steel bow of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d struck' the front end of the scow a short distance from the scow\u2019s forward port corner, so that a very slight alteration of the \u201cLillian Anne\u2019s\u201d course would have avoided the collision. Indeed, the District Court found that but for the \u201cLillian Anne\u2019s\u201d cant to port upon the reversal of her engines, \u201cshe would probably have cleared the scow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The impact of the collision caused the crushing of timbers on the scow of a size of 16 inches by 16 inches, while the bow of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d penetrated the hull of the scow to a distance of about 4 feet. The crew of the tug cast off the lines between the tug and the rapidly sinking scow to keep the tug from being pulled under and attempted to tow the scow to shallow water; yet the scow sank after being thus towed for about 100 yards. The \u201cLillian Anne\u201d played her searchlight upon the tug and scow, and then (in spite of the provisions of the Stand-by Act, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 367) proceeded on her way without speaking to those on the tug and scow and without any offer of, or attempt at, assistance. See The Lizzie Crawford, D.C., 170 F. 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The conclusion of the District Judge that the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d was solely at fault for the collision was based on several factors. One was her excessive speed in a busy harbor abnormally crowded under war-time conditions. Another was her failure to keep a lookout. The District Judge made a finding that the failure of the \u201cFairwill\u201d to keep a lookout did not contribute to the collision, in view of the course taken by the \u201cFairwill\u201d after the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d was sighted, and this finding, we think, finds ample support in the record. A third was the failure of the navigators of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d to see the tow, though it was adequately lighted. See The Transfer No. 8, D.C., 14 F.2d 448; Id., 2 Cir., 25 F. 2d 628. Also the District Judge adverted to the reversal of the \u201cLillian Anne\u2019s\u201d engines just before the collision causing her bow to cant to port; and discussed the general navigation of the \u201cLillian Anne\u201d after she initiated the port to port passage and failed to take proper steps to effectuate this maneuver safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">There were, at the time of the collision, no adverse conditions of tide, wind, or weather. The unencumbered \u201cLillian Anne\u201d could maneuver freely, The Georgetown, D.C., 135 F. 854,858; there was plenty of water for a boat of her draft outside the channel; nor was there any interference with her movements by the close proximity of wharves or other shore installations.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>For these reasons we see no ground for \u2022disturbing the findings of the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The decree of the District Court is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
