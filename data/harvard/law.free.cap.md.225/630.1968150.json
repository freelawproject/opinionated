He did not allege any fraud, bad faith or collusion by his trial counsel with a state official. It was for these reasons that Shure, J., denied relief. The denial was proper. Failure of counsel to advise a defendant of his right to an appeal is not the equivalent of a denial of that right and is not a ground for post conviction relief. <em>Scott v.
