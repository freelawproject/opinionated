Code (1960 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (b); <em>Barbee v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 647, 151 A. 2d 167 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">With respect to the contention that his counsel prevented him from testifying, we have often held that such an allegation, without more, is without merit. See <em>Rayne v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 688, 165 A. 2d 474 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">Likewise, the claim of perjury, absent a showing that the State knowingly used perjured testimony, is also without merit. <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, 155 A. 2d 643 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">Finally, the request for a reduction of sentence or probation was a matter which should have been seasonably ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>dressed to the trial court. In any event, the sentence of three years was within the statutory limits. See <em>Rahe, Jr. v.
