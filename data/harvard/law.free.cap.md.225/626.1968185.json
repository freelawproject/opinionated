The record forwarded with his application for leave to appeal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>tains a transcript of the proceedings at his Post Conviction hearing before Judge Duer. A careful examination of the transcript reveals no evidence whatever of prejudice and nothing which would serve any useful purpose to the applicant so that his request that this Court issue an order to the lower court to supply him with a (copy of the) transcript of the Post Conviction hearing is denied, and his brief in rebuttal will be merely included in the record of this proceeding. There is no provision in the Post Conviction Procedure Act requiring the furnishing of the transcript of the proceedings in any case. <em>Gamble v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 633; <em>Ingram v.
