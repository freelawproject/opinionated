The contract was entered into on September 30, 1958, and certain engraving equipment covered thereby was delivered to the vendee. The vendee being in default, the appellant filed a replevin suit on October 28, 1959, but on September 4, 1959, the landlord had filed a distraint for rent in arrears, and the sheriff on the same day seized the equipment. On November 9, 1959, the sheriff turned over the equipment to the appellant under the replevin suit, in which bond had been furnished, and on December 1, 1959, the landlord filed as third party plaintiff against the surety on said bond. The trial court entered a judgment for the third party plaintiff, and the vendor and his surety appeal here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The appellant contends that it is protected by the terms of Code (1957), Art. 21, sec. 66, which in broad terms protects the rights of conditional vendors. The difficulty is however, that Code (1957), Art. 53, sec. 18, expressly protects the rights of conditional vendors under Art. 21, sec. 66, against a landlord\u2019s distraint, but the proviso contains the language \u201cexcept in Prince George\u2019s County\u201d. The cases make it clear that a distraining landlord may seize and sell any and all chattels not exempt under a statute, found upon demised premises, for payment of rent, whether they belong to others or not. <em>Wilhem v. Boyd, </em>172 Md. 79; <em>Mears v. Perine, </em>156 Md. 56, 62, and cases cited. We must read the two statutes together. We cannot assume that the whole proviso was unnecessary. The exception as to Prince George\u2019s County subordinates the rights of conditional vendors there to a landlord\u2019s distraint. We find no merit in the appellants\u2019 contention that the language of Art. 53, sec. 18, just prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>proviso, which contains an exemption in the case of distraint for ground rent, in any way limits the effect of the proviso, which refers to a distraint \u201cupon any goods, chattels or other personal property on the premises not exempt under this section\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
