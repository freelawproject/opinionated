That order passed on March 22, 1961, and the application to appeal therefrom dated June 5, 1961, was not filed with this Court until June 6, 1961. (See Code (1960 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645-1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-14\">However, even if the application had been filed within the requisite time, it is clear that the questions raised therein, though they could properly have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial or on appeal from his conviction, can avail him nothing in this Post Conviction Procedure Act proceeding.
