P. C. P. A., and (2) that he was entitled to be present at the hearing on his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The first of the applicant\u2019s new contentions is not properly before us. If it were, it would be without merit. There is nothing to show that a transcript of the original trial would have been of any use to the applicant in supporting his present application. It is hardly possible that it would disclose the suppression of evidence, which the applicant alleges as his first ground for relief. None of the other grounds, even if true, affords any basis for Post Conviction relief. Hence, any support which the transcript might lend to these allegations would be of no avail in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">As to the second new contention, the applicant\u2019s presence at the Post Conviction hearing was discretionary with the trial court, Code (1960 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645G; <em>Shifflett v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 667; <em>Plump v. Warden, </em>220 Md. 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">For the above reasons the application for leave to appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
