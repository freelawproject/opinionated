Moyer, who was one of the alleged co-conspirators and had been called by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The appellant was indicted for having conspired with Alton R. Moyer and Albert R. Moyer (the two Moyers being twin brothers) to burglarize a certain pharmacy. Prior to Hyson\u2019s trial, both Moyers had pleaded guilty to the burglary of the pharmacy. Hyson denied the conspiracy accusation and pleaded not guilty. Albert R. Moyer had given a signed statement to the police, in which he admitted his guilt and directly implicated Hyson.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">At Hyson\u2019s trial, Alton R. Moyer was called by the State. He confessed his guilt and gave testimony, which, if true, also established the guilt of Hyson as well as the other Moyer. Then Albert R. Moyer was called by the State and he repudiated much of his former written statement, testifying that neither he nor Hyson was guilty. The State claimed surprise. The defense denied the surprise, claiming that the witness had notified both the police and the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney of such repudiation before he had been called as a witness. The court believed the State had been surprised and admitted, \u201csuch parts of the statement as the State used in cross examining this witness, not the complete statement.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>And this is the ruling of the court, made over his objection, that the appellant contends constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We have set forth the facts somewhat cursorily and without too much detail; because, as we shall soon see, we do not reach the questions as to whether the State made out a proper case of \u201csurprise,\u201d or, assuming the State did establish surprise, should the State have been confined to a showing that the witness had made a prior inconsistent statement, without introducing any portion of the statement, itself, into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">After the above ruling by the court, two police officers, Chief Deyle and Inspector Ensor, were permitted to testify, without objection, that Albert R. Moyer had verbally made the same statement which had been previously objected to by the appellant. If we assume, without deciding, there were errors in the original admission of certain \u201cparts of the statement\u201d made by Albert R. Moyer, the subsequent receipt, without objection, of the officers\u2019 testimony as to contents of the statement, waived any such error. <em>Journigan v.

We have dealt with these questions in two recent cases: Bruce v. State, 218 Md. 87, 145 A. 2d 428; Gray v. State, 219 Md. 557, 150 A. 2d 221.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
