Appellant was tried alone prior to the trial of his co-defendants, he having selected a jury trial and the others a trial by the court. At his trial, the appellant\u2019s accomplices testified against him. Briefly stated, their testimony was that a few days before the homicide the accomplices had stolen some articles of wearing apparel and desired to sell them. The deceased said be knew someone who would purchase the clothing. The deceased and the accomplices (using appellant\u2019s automobile for which he was to receive one-half of the money realized from the sale of the clothing) drove to an address suggested by the deceased. The deceased took the clothes and entered a private home, where he, presumptively, sold them, and (disregarding the time-honored adage that there should be a reasonable amount of \u201chonesty among thieves\u201d) left the house by the back door. Several days later, the appellant and the accomplices found the deceased in a poolroom shooting pool with one Lester Bryant. The deceased immediately stopped the pool game, walked down the street with the appellant and the accomplices, and got into appellant\u2019s car with them. They drove across a viaduct, and proceeded up an alley. The appellant and deceased were \u201carguing about money.\u201d The car was stopped in the alley and a fight, in which all four participated, ensued. The victim managed to break away and ran up the alley, with the others in pursuit. One of the accomplices struck the deceased and he cried out, \u201cHelp, Police,\u201d whereupon the accomplices returned to the car. Shortly thereafter, the appellant returned and said that he had stabbed the victim in the back. They then went to the appellant\u2019s home, and proceeded from there to 1121 Darley Ave., where three women were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>The appellant denied having participated in any manner in the killing. The deceased made a dying declaration in which he said that one of the accomplices had done the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The State called Lester Bryant and he testified that the accomplices were looking for a \u201cfence\u201d on October 19, 1959 (the homicide occurred on October 22, 1959), that the victim told the accomplices that he thought he knew one, and the accomplices and the deceased \u201cwent off\u201d together. He further testified that he was shooting pool with the deceased shortly before he met his death. The appellant and the accomplices came into the poolroom. The deceased stopped playing pool, and the witness watched the four men walk down the street together (apparently in the direction of the appellant\u2019s car).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The State also called the three women who were living at 1121 Darley Ave. Two of them testified on direct examination that the appellant and the accomplices came to 1121 Darley Ave. on the night of the homicide. On cross-examination, they stated that they were not certain of the date. The third woman, after testifying that the appellant and one of the accomplices came to 1121 Darley Ave., said she was not certain of the date, but thought it was on Thursday (the date of the killing).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The State also produced a witness who testified that he had overheard a conversation between the appellant and the accomplices, in which the story of the fatal stabbing was detailed substantially as it had been testified to by the accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Medical testimony disclosed that the deceased had met his death as the result of a massive hemorrhage caused by a stab wound in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">It would serve no useful purpose to restate the rule in regard to the <em>quantum </em>of corroboration of an accomplice\u2019s testimony that is necessary to support a finding of guilt in a criminal case, as we have quite frequently, and very recently, done so. See <em>Campbell v. State, </em>221 Md. 80, 156 A. 2d 217. Other Maryland cases are collected in 7 M.L.E., <em>Criminal Law, </em>Section 275. We think it sufficient to say that the corroboration of the accomplices\u2019 testimony, as it has been set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>forth above, was, if believed by the jury, ample to support a finding of guilt on the part of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The second question is not properly before us, because no objection was made to the court\u2019s advisory instruction to the jury. Maryland Rule 739 (g); <em>Kain v. State, 222 </em>Md. 511, 161 A. 2d 454. At the time of trial, the accused was represented by counsel other than his lawyer on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We are requested, however, to invoke the discretion vested in us by said Rule \u201cto take cognizance of and correct any plain error material to the rights of the accused,\u201d even though not included in the assignment of errors. We do not deem the situation presented here a proper one to call for such an invocation. Counsel representing the accused at the trial neither requested an instruction from the court as to the weight, or consideration, to be given an accomplice\u2019s testimony, nor did he object to the court\u2019s not having done so. This did not prevent counsel from arguing to the jury the proper import to be given an accomplice\u2019s testimony, and it is very probable that he did so. We find nothing in the record that indicates \u201cany plain error material to the rights of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
