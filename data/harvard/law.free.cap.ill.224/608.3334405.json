Harris, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-5\" pgmap=\"609\">This is an appeal from a decree dismissing at appellant\u2019s cost his bill in chancery, filed in the McLean county circuit court, to restrain appellee, the county clerk of said county, from extending against him on the tax collector\u2019s books for the year 1906 any tax assessments or penalties under the order of the board of review assessing against the appellant certain alleged omitted credits for the years 1893 to 1903, inclusive. The credits alleged to have been omitted consisted of certain indebtedness payable to appellant and secured by mortgages to him.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFF\" pgmap=\"609(204) 610(123)\">The bill alleges, (paragraph 8,) among other things, that for each of the years 1893 t\u00b0 1903, inclusive, the personal property and credits of appellant were legally assessed by the assessor of the township of Anchor, in said county; \u201cthat at the time of each of said assessments your orator stated to the assessor of said township the amount and items of all indebtedness, including said mortgages, owing to your orator on the day your orator\u2019s property was required by law to be valued, and the amount and items of the bona fide debts owing by your orator on said day; that said items * * * were considered by the said assessor and the debts then owing by your orator deducted from the indebtedness, including said mortgages then owing to your orator; that the said assessor then and there, at each of said times, adjudged and determined that your orator was entitled to have the debts then owing by him deducted from the amount of such of each of said mortgages as was then owing to your orator, and adjudged and determined that your orator was not the owner of any credits for which he should or was by law liable to be assessed for said year; that the said assessor then and there, at each of the said times, set down or entered the description and value of each and every item of personal \u25a0 property owned by your orator and for which he was, by law, liable to be assessed for said year, on lists or schedules, which, when completed, were handed by said assessor to your orator and then and there signed by him and returned to the said assessor; that the assessment so made, as aforesaid, against your orator for each and every of said years was made by the assessor upon the same basis adopted and used by him in assessing like property of other persons,\u201d etc.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-3\" pgmap=\"610\">The bill further alleges (paragraph 9) that the taxes so assessed against him during the years 1893 to 1903, inclusive, wefe paid by him. It further alleges (paragraph 10) that the board of review for McLean county for the year 1904 notified appellant, in writing, to appear before the board and show cause why he should not be assessed on omitted personal property for each of said years, and that appellant appeared, and said board, \u201cafter hearing the evidence, find no case.\u201d It is further alleged (paragraph 11) that the board of review for said county for the year 1905 notified appellant to appear and show cause why he should not be assessed for omitted personal property for said years, and, after hearing, pretended to assess him upon the full amount of mortgages alleged to have been omitted for said years, and made and entered said assessments of said mortgages upon said assessor\u2019s books for said Anchor township for the year 1905 against appellant for the years 1893 to 1903, inclusive. This is the substance of the allegations of the bill upon which appellant relies in his brief and argument.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\" pgmap=\"610(61) 611(161)\">Appellee demurred to said paragraphs 8, 11 and others, and answered paragraph 10, stating, in substance, that the board of review of McLean county for the year 1904, on September 13,1904, made a report of its work and proceedings to the county clerk of said county and turned over to the county clerk the assessor\u2019s books for the several townships for that year, and that there was attached to said books the usual oath required by statute of boards of review, which said oath was signed but not sworn to; that after said date of making the report to the county clerk said board of review rq-organized, and continued to act as such board of review until February ir, 1905; that after such re-organization said board of review notified the said J. B. Peirce, appellant, and the said J. B. Peirce appeared before said board of review, and the said board of review entered the finding, stating that after hearing the evidence it found no case. And the answer further avers that said board of review, after its report to the county clerk, on September 13, 1904, ceased to be a legal body, and was without power thereafter to consider a review or make assessments, and that said act of said board of review was void and of no effect.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-3\" pgmap=\"611\">Exceptions were filed to this answer, claiming that the defense attempted to be set up was a collateral attack upon the judgment of the board of review, which the defendant was estopped and precluded from making. The court, on hearing, sustained the demurrer of appellee to paragraph 8 of the bill and overruled the exceptions of appellant to the answer. Exceptions were taken to these rulings of the court, and appellant elected to stand by his bill and his exceptions to the answer. The court thereupon dismissed the bill for want of equity, and an appeal was taken to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-4\" pgmap=\"611\">Peirce &amp; Peirce, for appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-5\" pgmap=\"611\">Credits, in the meaning of the Revenue law, is the balance owing to a person over and above what he owes, and unless there is a balance he has no credits.

The extraordinary power of injunction will be exercised very sparingly where important public interests are involved. (Martin v. Barnett, 188 Ill. 288.) An injunction will not lie unless it is clearly made to appear that the party has been wrongfully assessed. (Correll v. Smith, 221 Ill. 149.) Has appellant shown in his bill that he is entitled to the relief prayed for?</p> <p id=\"b613-11\" pgmap=\"613(31) 614(232)\">Paragraph 27 of the Revenue act of 1872 (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1905, P- 1646,) provides: \u201cIn making up the amount of credits which any person is required to list for himself, or for any other person, company or corporation, he shall be entitled to deduct from the gross amount of credits the amount of all bona fide debts owing by such person, company or corporation, to any other person, company or corporation, for a consideration received; * * * and so much only of any liability, as surety for others, shall be deducted as the person making out .the statement believes he is legally and equitably bound, and will be compelled to pay on,\u201d etc. Paragraph 29 of the same statute provides: \u201cIn all cases where deductions are claimed from credits, the assessor shall require that such deductions be verified by the oath of the person, officer or agent claiming the same; and any such person, officer or agent, knowingly or willfully making a fraudulent statement of such deductions claimed, so verified by affidavit, shall be liable to a. fine. * * *\u2022 The assessor shall preserve the statement of deductions thus claimed, so verified by affidavit, and when he returns the assessment books shall file the same with the county clerk, to be kept on file in his office for two years, and at the expiration of such time said statement of deductions shall be destroyed by said clerk, but, in the meantime, shall be subject only to the inspection of the officers charged with the execution of this law.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b614-4\" pgmap=\"614(144) 615(70)\">The bill does not state that for the years from 1893 to 1903, inclusive, or any or all of these years, the debtor, for himself or by any other person, made a statement of his credits and the deductions he claimed therefrom. Appellant contends that the law does not place upon property owners .the duty of making a statement of their credits and the deductions that they claim therefrom. We think this is not in accordance with the law. This court held in People v. Atkinson, 103 Ill. 45, that if the assessor misleads a property owner and has property assessed in the wrong township, such statement of the assessor does not make the assessment fraudulent, as the property owner is bound to know the law. In Coxe Bros. &amp; Co. v. Salomon, 188 Ill. 571, we held that the failure or refusal of .the board of assessors or board of review to consider a tax-payer\u2019s complaint of over-valuation was not, of itself, a sufficient ground to give a court of equity jurisdiction to restrain the collection of the tax; .that the tax-payer must insist upon the hearing of his complaint of over-valuation in time to protect his interests, and, if necessary, by mandamus compel the board to act.</p> <p id=\"b615-5\" pgmap=\"615(315) 616(13)\">Appellant contends that under the authority of Allwood v. Cowen, 111 Ill. 481, a court of equity should interfere in the collection of this tax. In considering the right of the board of review to assess credits omitted from the assessment of previous years, this court in Sellers v. Barrett, 185 Ill. 466, reviewed and applied Allwood v. Cowen, supra, holding that the board of review had the power to assess credits which had been omitted from former assessments, and stating (p. 475) : \u201cCounsel for appellees say that the assessor for the years mentioned might have found the credits equal to the deductions allowed for the bona fide debts owing by the tax-payer, arid that in such case there would be no balance to be assessed. There is, however, no averment to this effect in the bill in this case. If such a fact existed, it was the duty of appellees to have averred it in their bill. Section 29 of the Revenue act provides that in all cases where deductions are made for credits the assessor shall require such deductions to be verified by the oath of the person claiming the same, and the statement of the deduction so claimed is required to be preserved by the assessor for a certain period of time.\u201d The same opinion quotes with approval from Morris v. Jones, 150 Ill. 542, as follows: \u201cWe are also of the opinion that if the item added to the schedule had been credits, instead of money, this bill would not lie, for even if the appellants had the right to deduct indebtedness, they must have done it in the manner provided by section 29, supra. If they were entitled to any such deductions it was the fault of their agent that they did not get the benefit of them. It was not for him to say the indebtedness equaled or exceeded the credits, and therefore refuse to list the credits.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b616-5\" pgmap=\"616\">In Siegfried v. Raymond, 190 Ill. 424, this court, after reviewing many authorities, stated that if persons desired to avail themselves of certain deductions they should have filed with the assessor a schedule of their property, including credits and indebtedness, as provided by section 29 of the Revenue law of 1872 and section 19 of the act of 1898, which they failed to do; \u201cby such failure they not only subjected themselves to the penalty of having an amount equal to fifty per cent of the valuation of their property, as fixed by the board of assessors, added to their assessment, but deprived themselves of the right to deduct from their credits their indebtedness.\u201d In Cummins v. Webber, 218 Ill. 521, we held that the law required the property owner to sign and make oath to his assessment schedule. .</p> <p id=\"b616-6\" pgmap=\"616\">The right to have debts deducted from taxable property is not absolute, but is in the nature of a favor to the taxpayer, and no one can claim this deduction unless he takes the steps required by law to establish his right thereto. (1 Cooley on Taxation,\u20143d ed.\u2014p. 273.) Manifestly, from said paragraphs 27 and 29 it was intended that the property owner must make out this statement, giving a list of his credits and the deductions claimed therefrom. This statement is not a part of the regular schedule, but is a distinct and independent document. The bill, on its face, shows that appellant had not complied with the law, and therefore he cannot ask that the collection of his taxes be restrained. On the pleadings the bill was properly dismissed for want of equity.</p> <p id=\"b616-7\" pgmap=\"616\">We find no reversible error in the record. The decree of the circuit court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b616-8\" pgmap=\"616\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
