On January 15, 1999, the district court held a hearing to determine the drug quantities involved and sentenced Mann to 252 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, plus five years of supervised release for each count, also to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">On May 27, 2008, Mann moved for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (2006) and the crack cocaine amendment to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d). U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 711. On July 14, 2008, the district court denied the motion, finding Mann \u201cineligible for an adjustment of sentence, as [his] drug weight exceeds 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">On July 22, Mann moved pro se to alter or amend the July 14 order, pursuant to Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court construed this motion as one for reconsideration and appointed counsel to represent Mann. On January 26, 2009, the district court granted the motion, explaining that \u201cafter further review, ... the record of the sentencing hearing does not sufficiently establish that Petitioner was explicitly held responsible for 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.\u201d The Government noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">We heard oral argument in this case on the same day as we heard argument in <em>United States v. Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d 233 (4th Cir.2010). In <em>Goodwyn, </em>the Government asserted that a district court does not have jurisdiction to reconsider a months-old order granting or denying a \u00a7 3582 motion for sentence reduction. We agreed, holding that the district court in that case lacked the authority to further reduce Goodwyn\u2019s sentence after initially granting his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">Although represented by the same attorney, the Government did not take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>same approach in its brief in this case as it had in <em>Goodwyn. </em>On brief in the case at hand, the Government made no jurisdictional argument. Failure to challenge jurisdiction, however, does not eliminate the need for this court \u201cto satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>531 F.3d 263, 270 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Accordingly, after issuing our opinion in <em>Goodtvyn, </em>we requested supplemental briefing in this case, affording Mann the opportunity to show a basis for jurisdiction here. Mann offers no legal authority for the sentence reduction other than \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Rather, in addition to simply protesting the result in <em>Goodwyn, </em>Mann only argues that the district court in his case had the authority to reduce his sentence because \u201c[ujnlike in <em>Goodwyn, </em>here, the trial court did not grant a reduction in sentence twice.\u201d Supp. Br. of Appellee at 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Our holding in <em>Goodwyn </em>forecloses this argument, for we there explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">When the Sentencing Commission reduces the Guidelines range applicable to a prisoner\u2019s sentence, the prisoner has an opportunity pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to persuade the district court to modify his sentence. If the result does not satisfy him, he may timely appeal it. But he may not, almost eight months later, ask the district court to reconsider its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\"><em>Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction to grant Mann\u2019s second request for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We therefore vacate the January 26, 2009 order granting Mann\u2019s motion for reconsideration and reducing his sentence to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. We remand the case for reinstatement of the 252-month concurrent sentences pronounced on January 15, 1999 and affirmed in the July 14, 2008 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> Mann also contends that the Government waived any arguments challenging the district court's jurisdiction, but, of course, \"subject-matter jurisdiction can never be forfeited or waived\u201d because \u201cit involves a court's power to hear a case.\u201d <em>United States v. Hartwell, </em>448 F.3d 707, 715 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
