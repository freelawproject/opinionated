On appeal, he argues that his sentence, which is one year longer than the recommended sentence at the top-end of the applicable advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) sentencing factors. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">We review the district court\u2019s ultimate sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, whether the sentence falls \u201cinside, just outside, or significantly outside\u201d the applicable advisory guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may [ ] take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47,128 S.Ct. 586. Generally, \u201ca major departure[, <em>ie., </em>variance,] should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Nevertheless, no \u201cpresumption of unreasonableness\u201d attaches to a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 47,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause of its institutional advantage in making sentence determinations, a district court has considerable discretion in deciding whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance and the extent of one that is appropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.) (quotations and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009). Stated differently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaP\">[w]e may vacate a sentence because of the variance only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiy\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">With regard to revocation, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), <em>after </em>considering the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (\u0430)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7), the district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a sentence of imprisonment if it \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u201d Those \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for deterrence; <em>(3) </em>the need to protect the public; (4) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (5) the advisory guidelines range; (\u0431) the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (8) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4)(A), (a)(4)(B), (a)(5); (a)(6), and (a)(7). In addition, a sentence must be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">On the record here, Rodriguez-Garcia has not satisfied his burden of establishing the substantive unreasonableness of his above-guidelines-range sentence. To begin with, the district court here justified its imposition of an upward variance by emphasizing Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s extensive criminal history, the nature of his original offense and the offenses underlying the instant violations, the possibility that he would not be punished for the substantive offense of illegal re-entry that constituted one of his violations, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>the fact that he had abused the court\u2019s previous leniency toward him. This explanation by the court touched upon several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including those contained in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), and (a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Moreover, the district court varied upward from the top-end of the guidelines range by only one year. As a result, the upward variance was not a major variance requiring a significant justification, especially given that Rodriguez-Garcia had received a ten-year sentence for one of the substantive offenses underlying his violations, and given that the other substantive offense, for which he had not been punished, carried a statutory maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(1) (authorizing a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years for illegal re-entry into the United States by an alien previously deported as a non-aggravated felon).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Further, none of Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s specific arguments on appeal regarding the substantive unreasonableness of his sentence have merit. First, quantifying the district court\u2019s upward variance as a certain percentage of the various points in the guidelines range is unhelpful since the guidelines range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment was relatively low compared to the seriousness of the substantive offenses underlying his violations. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 48,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Second, the fact that Rodriguez-Garcia already had been punished in state court for the substantive offense underlying one of his violations did not warrant a lighter sentence because his revocation sentence was not imposed as punishment for his state crime, but rather because he violated the conditions of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Woods, </em>127 F.3d 990, 991-92 (11th Cir.1997) (holding\u2014 where the defendant argued he was placed in double jeopardy since the same conduct formed the basis both for his conviction and the revocation of his probation \u2014 that \u201c[a] parole revocation proceeding is ... designed to determine whether a parolee has violated the conditions of his parole, not a proceeding designed to punish a criminal defendant for violation of a criminal law\u201d). Moreover, Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s argument cuts both ways because he had not been punished for the substantive offense underlying his other violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Third, Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s criminal history category did not account for his numerous arrests or the illegal re-entry that was the basis for one of his violations. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 (assigning criminal history points only for prior convictions). Fourth, neither the conditions of a defendant\u2019s pretrial confinement nor the government\u2019s recommendation as to what sentence the defendant should receive are sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Fifth, nothing compelled the district court to credit the fact that Rodriguez-Garcia had admitted his guilt, was remorseful, and pledged not to return to the United States illegally in the future, especially given that this was not the first time the court had sentenced him. Sixth, the district court did note that he had earned the reduced sentence that he received for his original conviction. Finally, the district court did not state that he had illegally re-entered the United States on more than one occasion, but rather emphasized the need for deterrence given his continuing history of illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Because none of Rodriguez-Garcia\u2019s arguments on appeal have merit, he has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
