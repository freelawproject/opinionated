On appeal, he contends that his seventy-two month sentence is greater than needed to satisfy federal sentencing goals. We disagree and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-23\">A district court may impose three types of sentences: \u201c(1) a sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range; (2) a sentence that includes an upward or downward departure as allowed by the Guidelines, which sentence is also a Guideline sentence; or (3) a non-Guideline sentence which is either higher or lower than the relevant Guideline sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525 (5th Cir.2006). Sentencing decisions are ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Rowan, </em>530 F.3d 379, 381 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-24\">The district court did not classify Oiivo-Salazar\u2019s above-Guidelines sentence as either a departure or a variance. However, the district court\u2019s statement that the advi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sory range was inadequate in view of Oli-vo-Salazar\u2019s history of progressively more serious crimes indicates that the court was departing pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a), which authorizes a departure if the court finds an \u201caggravating circumstance, of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Com<em>mission.Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>553 F.3d 380, 396 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The first step in reasonableness review is ensuring that the district court did not commit significant procedural error. <em>Rowan, </em>530 F.3d at 381. If the sentence is procedurally sound, the appellate court must then consider the sentence\u2019s \u201csubstantive reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given that Olivo-Salazar does not question the procedural soundness of his sentence, however, we need only consider the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Because Olivo-Salazar did not specify why he objected to the sentence imposed, there may be some basis to debate whether he is entitled to review for abuse of discretion or merely for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). But as Olivo-Sala-zar is unable to show that his sentence is infirm even under an abuse of discretion standard, it is unnecessary to decide which standard applies. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">If a district court determines \u201cthat a sentence within the Guidelines range is not lengthy enough to serve the objectives of sentencing\u201d in a particular case, it may sentence above that range. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 809 (5th Cir.2008). For a sentence that departs pursuant to the Guidelines, this court infers that the district court considered all the factors necessary under the Guidelines for a fair sentence and will rarely conclude that such a sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 249 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>479 F.3d 904 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">In light of the escalating seriousness of Olivo-Salazar\u2019s criminal behavior, and giving \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s\u201d weighing of the Section 3553(a) factors when sentencing Olivo-Salazar above his Guidelines range, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), neither the fact of the departure from that range nor the extent of it is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that both the decision to depart and the extent of a departure must be reviewed). Olivo-Salazar\u2019s seventy-two month sentence is well within the ten year statutory maximum term. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). We have approved far greater upward departures than the additional nine months \u2014 which is less than fifteen percent greater than the top of his Guidelines range \u2014 that Olivo-Salazar received. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Davenport, </em>286 F.3d 217, 221 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b536-25\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir.
