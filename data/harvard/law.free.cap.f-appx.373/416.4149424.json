In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(1)(A);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-20\">The district court entered its order denying the motion for reduction of sentence on August 14, 2009. Butts filed the notice of appeal on September 11, 2009,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after the ten-day period expired but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because the notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Butts has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-18\">. Rule 4(b)(1)(A) was amended effective December 1, 2009, to provide a period of fourteen calendar days to file a notice of appeal. This amendment does not affect the timeliness of Butts\u2019s notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-23\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Cl. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
