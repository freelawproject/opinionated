Casseus argues that his sentence of nine months of imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-25\">In September 2004, Casseus pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 286, 287. The district court sentenced Casseus to 15 months of imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release. The district court also required Casseus to pay to the United States restitution of $124,037 and a special assessment of $100. Casseus began serving his term of supervised release on March 14, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-26\">Casseus failed to comply with the conditions of his first term of supervised release. In July 2007, Miami-Dade police arrested Casseus for driving with a suspended license. As a result, the district court modified the terms of Casseus\u2019s release to include 90 days in a residential reentry center. The police again arrested Casseus for driving with a suspended license in September 2007, but the district court took no action. In January 2008, the district court summoned Casseus to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>pear for violations of his supervised release that were unrelated to his driver\u2019s license: Casseus was in arrears on his restitution payments and he had failed to submit monthly written reports to his probation officer in August and September 2007. The district court revoked Cas-seus\u2019s term of supervised release and sentenced Casseus to three months of imprisonment to be followed by a new three-year term of supervised release. The district court continued the original terms of Cas-seus\u2019s supervised release, including the requirement that he pay $119,036.80 in restitution at the rate of 10 percent of his monthly gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Casseus began serving his second term of supervised release on June 16, 2008, but again failed to comply with the conditions of his release. In April 2009, the district court summoned Casseus to appear because police had arrested Casseus for again driving with a suspended license in violation of the Florida habitual traffic offender statute, and Casseus had failed to notify his probation officer of his arrest. In July 2009, the district court held a revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">At the hearing, Casseus admitted to the charged violations and the district court invited the parties to address the matter of sentencing. The United States stated that the advisory guidelines range for the offense to which Casseus had admitted was three to nine months (it was actually four to ten months) and asked for a sentence at the high end of the range. The United States explained that \u201cthis is not the first time Mr. Casseus has appeared before you on a violation of his supervised release.\u201d It asked for a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range because \u201c[i]t appears that Mr. Casseus has not learned from this Court\u2019s previous attempted correction of action.\u201d The district court agreed that \u201c[i]t sounds like [Casseus] doesn\u2019t think the rules apply to him.\u201d The United States urged the district court \u201cto send a very clear message to Mr. Casseus that he cannot continue to do what he\u2019s doing and especially putting the public at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Casseus\u2019s attorney recommended that the district court \u201csentence [Casseus] to no more than six months in jail,\u201d but stated that his primary concern was ensuring that the \u201cCourt will not restore [Casseus] in any means to supervised release at the end of his term of imprisonment.\u201d The district court answered that some term of supervised release seemed appropriate because Casseus \u201chas really not done an awfully very good job at restitution\u201d and \u201cthere is a responsibility for restitution, and the only way that we can get any headway is by keeping some sort of ... control over [Casseus].\u201d Casseus\u2019s attorney argued that the cost to taxpayers of any term of supervised release likely exceeded any recovery that the United States would be able to secure from Cas-seus, but the district court again explained that \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re saying and I think you\u2019re right but I\u2019m just not going to [terminate Casseus\u2019s supervised release] as long as he has a restitution obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">The district court concluded that \u201ca sentence within the guideline range is appropriate.\u201d The district court imposed a sentence of nine months of imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release. The district court asked for objections and Casseus\u2019s attorney stated only that \u201cthe defendant objects to the reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe review the reasonableness of a sentence through a two-step process using a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>1219 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cFirst, we look at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines range as mandatory, or failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cBecause we review the \u2018totality of the circumstances,\u2019 a district court need not discuss each section 3553(a) factor.... \u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 n. 8 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cSecond, we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable.\u201d Surras, 575 F.3d at 1219. \u201c[W]e will only reverse a proceclurally reasonable sentence if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors....\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Ordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.... [T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.... \u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Casseus argues that his sentence is unreasonable for two reasons. He argues that it is procedurally unreasonable for the reason that the district court \u201cnever specifically indicated that it had considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the \u201cdistrict court based a substantial part of its sentencing on conduct regarding restitution that Mr. Casseus had previously been violated for and for which there was no allegation of wrongdoing.\u201d Casseus argues that \u201cit is apparent from the district court\u2019s comments that previous restitution issues were the sole reason that the court imposed ... supervised release.\u201d The United States describes Casseus\u2019s second argument as an argument about the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. No matter how we describe Casseus\u2019s second argument, both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">When we consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 n. 8 (quotation marks omitted), it is clear that the district court adequately considered the factors of section 3553(a). The district court considered Casseus\u2019s history and characteristics and the need to deter future violations of the law and concluded that \u201c[i]t sounds like he doesn\u2019t think the rules apply to him.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (2)(C). The district court considered the guidelines range and \u201cdetermined that a sentence within the guidelines range is appropriate.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(4), 3583(e). The district court also concluded that a term of supervised release was necessary to ensure that Cas-seus provided restitution. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(7), 3583(e). The district court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy [us] that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Casseus\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
