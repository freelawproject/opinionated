Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that after a review of the record, he has found no meritorious issues for appeal. The <em>Anders </em>brief nonetheless suggests that the district court committed plain error when it sentenced Moore. Moore has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>not filed a pro se supplemental brief despite receiving notice that he may do so, and the Government declined to file a responsive brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In the absence of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review the adequacy of the guilty plea pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). A review of Moore\u2019s Rule 11 hearing reveals that the district court complied with Rule ll\u2019s requirements. Moore\u2019s plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, with full knowledge of the consequences attendant to his guilty plea. We therefore find that no plain error occurred and affirm Moore\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We also affirm Moore\u2019s sentence. Moore\u2019s presentence investigation report properly placed him in a category VI criminal history and attributed him with a total offense level of thirty-one, yielding a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. Moreover, at sentencing, the district court appropriately heard counsel\u2019s argument regarding the weight that should be afforded the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, allowed Moore an opportunity to allocute, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing Moore\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Although the district court procedurally erred when it imposed Moore\u2019s sentence with only a cursory reference to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Guidelines, <em>see United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328-29 (4th Cir.2009), because Moore argued only for a sentence at the bottom of his Guidelines range, Moore did not adequately preserve an objection to the district court\u2019s error. <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 579-80 (4th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we need only review the sentencing error for plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">To establish plain error, Moore has to show that an error: (i) was made; (ii) is plain (i.e., clear or obvious); and (iii) affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Massenburg, </em>564 F.3d 337, 342-43 (4th Cir.2009). Even if we assumed that the district court\u2019s brief explanation constituted an obvious error in violation of <em>Carter, </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) requires Moore to also show that the district court\u2019s lack of explanation had a prejudicial effect on the sentence imposed. <em>See Puckett v. United </em>States,-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1433 n. 4, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Having only summarily raised the reasonableness of his 188-month sentence in an <em>Anders </em>brief to this court, Moore has made no such showing. We thus affirm Moore\u2019s within-Guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (recognizing that this court applies an appellate presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Moore, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Moore requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Moore. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
