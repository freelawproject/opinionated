Williams pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Williams had an initial guideline range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment based on his offense level and criminal history, but he was subject to a statutory minimum term of 240 months in prison under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Prior to sentencing, the Government filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) for a departure below the statutory minimum based on Williams\u2019 substantial assistance. The district court granted the motion and sentenced Williams to 132 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Williams appeals the district court\u2019s ruling denying him a reduction in sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He asserts that he was eligible for a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) notwithstanding that his original sentence was a departure below the mandatory minimum pursuant to \u00a7 3553(e). He also asserts that it is unclear from the record whether the district court knew that it had authority to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of the Government\u2019s arguments to the contrary. Williams also contends that the district court could have reduced his sentence below the amended guideline range pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), but he correctly recognizes that his <em>Booker </em>argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\">Although Williams argues that he was eligible for such a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction, this court recently held that, when a defendant is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guideline range, even if the district court departs downwardly from that minimum under a statutory exception, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010). Consequently, the district court committed no error in denying Williams relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
