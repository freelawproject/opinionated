In his petition, Dudley asks this court to: (i) order the district court to \u201cadjudicate the matters currently stalled on its docket;\u201d (ii) recall its mandate affirming the district court\u2019s judgment; or (iii) give sua sponte consideration to whether the district court had authority to accept his guilty plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) (requiring a district court to determine whether there is a factual basis for a guilty plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-20\">To obtain mandamus relief, a petitioner must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-21\">(1) he has a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought; (2) the responding party has a clear duty to do the specific act requested; (3) the act requested is an official act or duty; (4) there are no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires; and (5) the issuance of the writ will effect right and justice in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-22\"><em>In re Braxton, </em>258 F.3d 250, 261 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have considered Dudley\u2019s petition and the district court docket sheet and find that the district court has recently disposed of Dudley\u2019s \u201cstalled\u201d motions. We further conclude that Dudley\u2019s remaining requests for relief do not meet the exacting requirements necessary for the issuance of a writ of mandamus. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis and grant Dudley\u2019s motion to supplement his mandamus petition, we deny the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
