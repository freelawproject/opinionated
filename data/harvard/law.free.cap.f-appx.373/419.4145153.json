Carden, </em>599 F.2d 1320 (4th Cir.1979)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to defendant?s case,\u201d \u201cmotion for resentenc-ing based on the Fifth Amendment?s prohibition against multiple punishments for the exact same offense,\u201d and \u201cmotion for resentencing based on the retroactive holding in <em>Bailey v. [United States], </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concerning the use\u2019 prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Miller has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-23\">We also deny Miller\u2019s motions to address counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>appeal, to accept apology, and for clarification. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-18\">.
