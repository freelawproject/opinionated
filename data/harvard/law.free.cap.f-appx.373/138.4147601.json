For the following reasons, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">On August 26, 2009, Semulka initiated this action by filing a complaint and a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. The District Court ordered that before it would rule on the IFP motion, Semulka must file an amended complaint in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a). Semulka requested, and was granted, two separate extensions of time to file an amended complaint. Sem-ulka did not amend his complaint by the extended deadline of November 16, 2009. On December 3, 2009, the District Court deemed the action abandoned and dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b) for failure to comply with a court order. Semulka filed a timely notice of appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s dismissal for abuse of discretion. <em>Guyer v. Beard, </em>907 F.2d 1424, 1429 (3d Cir.1990). We may take summary action if the appeal presents no substantial questioned Cir. LAR 24.7; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The District Court erred by failing to rule on Semulka\u2019s IFP motion before proceeding to the complaint. There is a two-step process in evaluating motions to proceed IFP under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915. \u201cFirst, the district court evaluates a litigant\u2019s financial status and determines whether (s)he is eligible to proceed in for-ma pauperis under \u00a7 1915(a). Second, the court assesses the complaint under \u00a7 1915(d) to determine whether it is frivolous.\u201d <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir.1990); <em>see also Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1085 n. 5 (3d Cir.1995) (holding that the decision of whether to grant IFP should precede dismissal of a complaint). Thus, the District Court should have addressed Semulka\u2019s IFP motion in the first instance instead of holding it in abeyance pending amendment of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">The District Court also erred in dismissing Semulka\u2019s complaint sua sponte without addressing the factors set forth in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b), a district court may dismiss an action sua sponte if a litigant fails to prosecute his case or to comply with a court order. Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>see also Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 630-31, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). Before doing so, however, courts are required to consider all six of the <em>Poulis </em>factors: \u201c(1) the extent of the party\u2019s personal responsibility; (2) the prejudice to the adversary caused by the failure to meet scheduling orders and respond to discovery; (3) a history of dilatoriness; (4) whether the conduct of the party or the attorney was willful or in bad faith; (5) the effectiveness of sanctions other than dismissal, which entails an analysis of alternative sanctions; and (6) the meritoriousness of the claim or defense.\u201d 747 F.2d at 868. We have repeatedly emphasized that sua sponte dismissal is \u201cextreme\u201d and therefore \u201cmust be a sanction of last, not first, resort.\u201d <em>Poulis, </em>747 F.2d at 867-69; <em>United States v. $8,221,877.16 in U.S. Currency, </em>330 F.3d 141, 161 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cWe have opined that [the <em>Poulis </em>factors] must be weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>by a district court in determining whether the harsh sanction of dismissal is justified\u201d). Only in the rarest of circumstances, those demonstrating the most \u201ccontumacious\u201d of conduct, may a district court dispense with the <em>Poulis </em>factors altogether. <em>Guyer, </em>907 F.2d at 1429-30; <em>see also Spain v. Gallegos, </em>26 F.3d 439, 454-55 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Here, the District Court dismissed Sem-ulka\u2019s complaint without balancing any of the <em>Poulis </em>factors or considering whether a lesser sanction would better serve the interests of justice. <em>See Guyer, </em>907 F.2d at 1429-30. Nor did the court offer Sem-ulka an opportunity to justify his inaction. <em>See Ali v. Sims, </em>788 F.2d 954, 958 (3d Cir.1986) (holding that the District Court\u2019s statement that a party had \u201cbrazenly ignored\u201d its order was insufficient to justify dismissal).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s December 3, 2009, order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
