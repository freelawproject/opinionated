Williams argues that the district court should have imposed his sentence to run concurrently to, rather than consecutively to, his current 480-month sentence. He contends the district court erred by sentencing him as if U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) were mandatory and by failing to justify the imposition of a consecutive sentence using the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-21\">Because Williams did not adequately object in the district court on the grounds he now raises on appeal, we review Williams\u2019s claims of procedural error for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). A plain error is a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 371, 175 L.Ed.2d 124 (2009). If these conditions are met, this Court has the discretion to correct the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-25\">It is not clear or obvious from the record that the district court felt constrained by the Guidelines to select a consecutive sentence. Rather, the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court was aware of its discretion to impose a non-Guidelines sentence and considered the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in selecting Williams\u2019s sentence. Under these circumstances, Williams has not shown that the district court plainly erred by imposing the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 320 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-26\">Further, the district court adopted the facts as stated in the presentence report, articulated specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors that weighed heavily in its decision-making, and found that the Guidelines met the requisite sentencing objectives. The reasons given by the district court were sufficient to satisfy us that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and that it had a reasoned basis for imposing the 45-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>consecutive sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-58, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 441 (5th Cir.2000). Further, because Williams\u2019s challenge to the insufficiency of the district court\u2019s stated reasons is lodged against a within-guidelines sentence and is under review for plain error, Williams\u2019s claims fail under this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>Mondragonr-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 365. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
