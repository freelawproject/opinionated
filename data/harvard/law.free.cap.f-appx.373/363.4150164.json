On appeal, Tolbert alleges that the district court erred in allowing him to proceed pro se and that his sentence is plainly unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Tol-bert\u2019s supervised release, but vacate Tol-bert\u2019s sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s supervised release cannot be revoked without a full hearing unless the defendant knowingly and voluntarily admits to the allegations against [him] and waives [his] rights under Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrell, </em>393 F.3d 498, 500 (4th Cir.2005). The right to counsel at a revocation hearing is established by Rule 32.1(b)(2)(D). Waiver of the rights provided in Rule 32.1 must be knowing and voluntary, as assessed under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.] see also United States v. Hodges, </em>460 F.3d 646, 651 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that a waiver of counsel in revocation proceedings \u201cmust be knowing and voluntary as demonstrated either through a colloquy with the district court, or by the totality of circumstances, or both.\u201d). After a thorough review of the record, we find that the totality of the circumstances indicate that Tolbert\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel and his decision to proceed pro se were knowing and voluntary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">We find merit, however, in Tolbert\u2019s challenge to his sentence. This court will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). When reviewing whether a revocation sentence is plainly unreasonable, we must first look to whether it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007); Cru<em>dup, </em>461 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">A supervised release revocation sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court considered the Chapter Seven advisory policy statement range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors applicable to supervised release revocation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (2006); <em>Cmdup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Because the district court here did not state that it considered the Guidelines\u2019 policy statements, and did not even discuss, calculate, or adopt the probation officer\u2019s actual advisory Guidelines range, we find that Tolbert\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">Having found the sentence unreasonable, we must next assess whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d To decide whether a sentence is plainly unreasonable, we look to the definition of \u201cplain\u201d as used in plain-error analysis. <em>Cmdup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. A plainly unreasonable sentence runs afoul of clearly established law. Bee <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">Because Tolbert did not preserve this claim for appellate review, we review for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 343 (4th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 943, 173 L.Ed.2d 142 (2009). To receive relief under the plain error stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>dard of review, Tolbert must show (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). As stated above, we recognize a sentencing error and find it to be plainly unreasonable because it runs afoul of clearly established law. <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Because the sentence imposed by the district court was double the maximum of the advisory Guideline range as calculated by the probation officer, we find that the error affects Tolbert\u2019s substantial rights. And we choose to exercise our \u201cremedial discretion,\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 because the district court\u2019s failure to calculate and consider the Chapter Seven advisory sentencing range affected the fairness of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Accordingly, although we affirm the district court\u2019s decision revoking Tolbert\u2019s supervised release, we vacate his sentence for a procedural sentencing error and remand for resentencing. By this disposition, we indicate no view as to the appropriate sentence to be imposed by the district court on remand. We emphasize in this regard that we have not evaluated the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed by the district court; we have concluded only that the sentencing procedure followed by the district court was in error. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
