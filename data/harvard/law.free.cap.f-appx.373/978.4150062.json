While on probation, his probation officer and other law enforcement officials twice arrested Ellis for violating the conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>of his probation and searched his residence. Each time, the state court revoked Ellis\u2019s probation and imposed a prison term. Ellis is currently serving his sentence for the second probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">Ellis filed this <em>pro se </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, alleging constitutional violations against a variety of parties involved in the arrests and searches or in Ellis\u2019s subsequent probation revocations. The district court dismissed the majority of these claims pursuant to a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A preliminary screening after Ellis did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Later, the two remaining claims \u2014 that Laurens County Probation Officer Danny Powell arrested Ellis on two occasions without a warrant and that Laurens County Deputy Chris Brace-well obtained false arrest warrants against Ellis \u2014 were dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In addition to entering these two dismissal orders, the district court ruled on numerous motions filed by Ellis throughout the district court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">On appeal, Ellis states that he is appealing \u201call rulings made in the case from day one.\u201d Ellis argues generally that his constitutional rights have been violated and that the district court \u201cresponded wrong in, \u2018denied,\u2019 \u2018dismissed,\u2019 \u2018moot\u2019 or not ruled upon.\u201d However, Ellis does not provide substantive argument or identify particular errors as to any of the district court\u2019s rulings, including, most importantly, the district court\u2019s two dismissal orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">To preserve an issue for appellate review, appellants must \u201cnot only state their contentions to us, but also to give \u2018the reasons for them,\u2019 \u201d with citations to legal authority and the record. <em>Doe v. </em>Moore, 410 F.3d 1337, 1349 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A)). A \u201ccursory restatement of the issues fails to raise the issue sufficiently for discussion\u201d and thus the issues are deemed abandoned. <em>Id.; see also Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (refusing to reach an issue mentioned in passing in the plaintiff\u2019s brief because the issue had no supporting argument or discussion). This rule also applies to <em>pro se </em>appellants. <em>See, e.g., Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">Here, Ellis\u2019s appeal brief states that he is appealing all the district court\u2019s rulings and that all of those rulings are wrong, but, even construed liberally, does not identify any particular error for us to review. Thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
