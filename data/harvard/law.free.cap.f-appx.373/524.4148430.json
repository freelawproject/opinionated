He asserts that the district court abused its discretion in denying the reduction solely because his original sentence was within the revised guidelines range, arguing that this was a legally insufficient reason for denying the sentencing reduction and that the district court should have given case-specific reasons for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">This court reviews the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Reasonableness review, as outlined in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is not applicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Stevenson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or in providing a legally insufficient reason for its decision. The district court had the discretion to decide whether to grant Stevenson\u2019s motion and was not required to reduce his sentence. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) &amp; comment. (n.3). The district court noted that the original sentence was within the amended guidelines range and determined that the original sentence was \u201cappropriate under the circumstances.\u201d The district court was not required to state findings of fact and conclusions of law when denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674. Stevenson has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
