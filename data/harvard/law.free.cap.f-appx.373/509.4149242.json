He contends that the sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and was therefore substantively unreasonable. Specifically, Garcia-Montano argues that the guidelines range was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was not empirically based and gave excessive weight to his prior drug conspiracy conviction by double-counting the prior conviction to establish his guidelines range. He contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his nonviolent reentry offense and failed to account for his motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">This court reviews the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. deified, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">This court has consistently rejected Garcia-Montano\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). The Sentencing Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6). Additionally, this court has rejected the argument that double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The district court considered Garcia-Montano\u2019s request for a downward variance, and it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Garcia-Montano\u2019s assertions regarding \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack of an empirical basis, the weight given his prior drug conspiracy conviction, the nonviolent nature of his offense, and his motive for reentering the United States are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). As Garcia-Montano has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was an abuse of discretion, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
