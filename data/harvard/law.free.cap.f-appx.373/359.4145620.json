Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that after a review of the record, he has found no meritorious issues for appeal. The <em>Anders </em>brief nonetheless suggests that the district court erred when it classified Oxendine as a career offender based on his prior North Carolina convictions for felony robbery with a dangerous weapon. Oxendine filed a pro se supplemental brief raising the same issue, and the Government declined to file a responsive brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">In the absence of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, we review the adequacy of the guilty plea pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). A review of Oxendine\u2019s Rule 11 hearing reveals that the district court complied with Rule ll\u2019s requirements. Oxen-dine\u2019s plea was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made, with full knowledge of the consequences attendant to his guilty plea. We therefore find that no plain error occurred and affirm Oxendine\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">We also affirm Oxendine\u2019s sentence. Based on his career offender status, Oxendine\u2019s presentence investigation report properly placed him in criminal history category VI and attributed him with a total offense level of thirty-four, yielding a Guidelines range of 262-327 months. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>sentencing, the district court granted the Government\u2019s <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 (2008) motion, appropriately heard counsel\u2019s argument regarding the weight that should be afforded the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors, allowed Oxendine an opportunity to allocute, and thoroughly considered the Guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing Oxendine\u2019s 180-month variant sentence. We find that the district court adequately explained its rationale for imposing Oxendine\u2019s variant sentence, the sentence was selected pursuant to a reasoned process in accordance with law, and the reasons relied upon by the district court are plausible and justify the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-76 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir.2009) (recognizing that the district court must \u201cplace on the record an individualized assessment based on the particular facts of the case before it\u201d and that the \u201cindividualized assessment ... must provide a rationale tailored to the particular case at hand and [be] adequate to permit meaningful appellate review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We reject Oxendine\u2019s argument that he should not have been classified as a career offender because his two North Carolina felony robbery with a dangerous weapon convictions were consolidated for judgment. When Oxendine was arrested in 2000 for felony robbery with a dangerous weapon, charges were already pending against him for his 1998 felony robbery with a dangerous weapon offense. Although the state court consolidated the cases for judgment and sentencing in 2001, we find that the district court properly considered Oxendine\u2019s previous convictions to be \u201ctwo prior felony convictions,\u201d as defined by USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(c) (2008). <em>See United States v. Huggins, </em>191 F.3d 532, 539 (4th Cir.1999) (holding that despite consolidated sentences, \u201c[b]ecause there was an intervening arrest, Huggins cannot avoid classification as a career offender by arguing that his offenses were related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Oxendine, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Oxen-dine requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Oxendine. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
