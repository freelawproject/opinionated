Perez contends that the district court erred in giving a jury instruction on deliberate ignorance and improperly applied a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-23\">Perez contends that the district court erred in giving a jury instruction on deliberate ignorance because no evidence showed that he purposefully avoided learning that he was committing health care fraud. \u201cBecause a challenge to a jury instruction presents a question of law, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934, 938 (11th Cir.1993). As we have held before, \u201cWe need not decide whether the evidence justified the deliberate ignorance instruction, because our decision in <em>United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934 (11th Cir.1993), says that it does not matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 858 (11th Cir.2006). It does not matter because the error of giving a deliberate ignorance instruction with no basis in the evidence will always be harmless. <em>Id.; Stone, </em>9 F.3d at 937-38. Thus, Perez\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-25\">Perez also contends that the district court erred in imposing a two-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>obstruction of justice enhancement to his sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. He argues that his statements to the.FBI did not significantly impair its investigation and therefore the obstruction of justice enhancement was improper. Again, Perez\u2019s argument lacks merit. We have held that when a district court expressly states that it would have imposed the same sentence even without the sentencing enhancement, it is unnecessary for us to review the enhancement issue. <em>See United States v. </em>Keene, 470 F.3d 1347, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that this is because \u201ca decision either way will not affect the outcome of this case. We know it will not because the district court told us that the enhancement made no difference to the sentence imposed.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 775-76 (11th Cir.2005) (Carnes, J., concurring). After sentencing Perez to 97-months imprisonment, the district court stated, \u201cI do want to make it clear that I think a 97 month sentence would have been a reasonable sentence ... and an appropriate sentence under consideration of the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors regardless of application of the guidelines.\u201d The district court\u2019s statement makes it clear that the obstruction of justice enhancement made no difference to Perez\u2019s sentence, and therefore we do not need to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">When a district court gives us this kind of guidance, we review only the reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>Keene, \u25a0 </em>470 F.3d at 1349. In determining whether the sentence was reasonable, we \u201cassume that there was a guidelines <em>error </em>\u2014 that <em>the </em>guidelines issue should have been decided in the way the defendant argued and the advisory range reduced 'accordingly \u2014 and then ask whether the final sentence resulting from consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors would still be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">If the district court had decided the obstruction of justice enhancement issue in Perez\u2019s favor, the advisory guidelines range would have been 63 to 78 months, instead of the 78 to 97 months range that the court arrived at by applying the two-level enhancement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question is whether the 97-month sentence imposed is reasonable, assuming exactly the same conduct and other factors in the case, but using an advisory range of 63 to 78 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">\u201cOur post <em>-Booker </em>reasonableness review takes into account the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as the advisory guidelines range. It is a \u2018deferential\u2019 review, and the burden is on the defendant to prove that his sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1350 (internal citations omitted). Perez cannot carry his burden of showing that his 97-month sentence was unreasonable even with an assumed advisory guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. Although the district court imposed a sentence above the lower advisory guidelines range, Perez used stolen patient information to fraudulently bill Medicare for equipment never actually purchased by those patients. The scheme resulted in substantial losses to the government. We cannot say that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>court\u2019s decision to impose a 97-month sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-5\">. Using the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines, Perez\u2019s base offense level was 6 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1 (a)(2). He received an 18-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B1.1 (b)(l)(J) because the amount of the loss was more than $2.5 million but less than $7 million. Perez also received a 2 level sophisticated means enhancement, <em>see </em>\u00a7 281.1(b)(9)(C), and a 2 level obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. With a total offense level of 28 and a criminal histoiy category of I, his advisory guidelines range was 78-97 months imprisonment. Without the obstruction of justice enhancement, his advisory guidelines range would have been 63-78 months based on a total offense level of 26 and a criminal history category of I.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
