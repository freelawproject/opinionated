Wright, </em>No. 4:95-cr-00039-TEM-TEM-1 (E.D.Va. July 15, 2009). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s denial of Wright\u2019s motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See United States v. Goodwyn, </em>596 F.3d 233, 234-36 (4th Cir.2010) (holding that district court lacked authority to grant defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider, filed eight months after the district court\u2019s order ruling on original \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
