Employing our authority we have examined the complaint and position of the appellant, Paul Benjamin Chuka Ayika, and find there no injury or harm prohibited by these laws. He has no standing to complain, if any harm is suggested. And no relief is set forth that this court has power to provide. No cause of action is stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">Consequently, this court has no choice but to affirm the judgment of Judge Mon-talvo signed on November 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
