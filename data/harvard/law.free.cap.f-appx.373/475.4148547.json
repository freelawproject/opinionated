Molina argues that his sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) of reflecting the seriousness of his offense, deterring him from future offenses, protecting the public, and providing needed training or treatment. He asserts that the district court erred in weighing these fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>tors and that application of the career offender enhancement resulted in an advisory guidelines range that overstated the seriousness of his offense, as well as his prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Molina does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the advisory guidelines range. Rather, he challenges the reasonableness of the sentence imposed. Where the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), cert <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Here, the district court considered and rejected Molina\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence. In light of his extensive criminal history and the court\u2019s findings that the sentence was necessary to help dissuade Molina from repeating his criminal conduct and that he should receive drug and mental health treatment, anger management counseling, and should participate in parenting classes, Molina has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness of the within guidelines sentence imposed by the district court. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Thus, he has not shown error, plain or otherwise, with respect to the 77-month sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360-61 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
