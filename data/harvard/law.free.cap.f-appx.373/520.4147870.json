He argues that the reduced sentence imposed by the district court was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because his offense of conviction was relatively minor, his sentence would have been much lower if his offense had involved powder cocaine rather than cocaine base, his prior conviction for aggravated battery occurred a very long time ago, he has been rehabilitated while in prison, and he will be employed and have family support upon his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). The district court explicitly considered Meridyth\u2019s arguments presented at resentencing and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before it imposed the reduced sentence, which was within the lowered guidelines range. The district court did not abuse its discretion in this case. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
