He argues that the district court procedurally erred in failing to consider his nonfrivolous argument that the nature and circumstances of his aggravated assault and kidnapping convictions warranted a non-guidelines sentence. Because he failed to raise this procedural objection below, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-21\">\u201c[WJhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The sentencing judge, however, should say more \u201c \u2018[wjhere the defendant ... presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 261 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456). Morales-Espinoza\u2019s contention that he presented the district court with a nonfrivolous reason in favor of a non-guidelines sentence is refuted by the presentence report\u2019s description of the violent nature of his aggravated assault and kidnapping offenses. Moreover, the record supports a determination that the district court did indeed consider Morales-Espinoza\u2019s downward departure argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Having imposed a within guidelines sentence, the district court was not required to provide extensive reasons for the sentence under these circumstances. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356,127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b534-22\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cut.
