During sentencing, the government established that the Varela Drug Ring\u2014 the conspiracy in which Gutierrez was a member \u2014 routinely carried guns to protect against a home invasion, and its operations included taking drugs from others by force. Additionally, Gutierrez personally participated, in some form, in a drive-by shooting and an attempted robbery against another drug dealer. Moreover, after members of the Varela Drug Ring murdered Jose Escobedo, a cocaine supplier, and his family, Gutierrez helped ransack the Escobedo home looking for money and drugs, and attempted to conceal evidence. Based on these facts, the district court applied a base offense level of 43, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l)\u2019s cross-reference to the first-degree murder guideline (\u00a7 2A1.1), for the Escobedo murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">On appeal, Gutierrez argues that the district court erred in applying the murder cross-reference guideline. Gutierrez asserts that, under the guidelines, the evidence failed to demonstrate that he reasonably could have foreseen the Escobedo murders, or that they <em>were </em>within the scope of the activity he agreed to undertake as a member of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">We review the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its underlying factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Foley, </em>508 F.3d 627, 632 (11th Cir.2007). Under the clear error standard, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s findings \u201cunless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Clarke, </em>562 F.3d 1158, 1165 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 809, - L.Ed.2d -(2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005)). We may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court. <em>United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 288, 172 L.Ed.2d 150 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, \u201c[i]f a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111 had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the United States, [a sentencing court should] apply \u00a7 2A1.1 (First Degree Murder).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l) (2008). First degree murder receives a base offense level of 43. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.1. That offense level applies to both premeditated killings, and to felony murder such as bank robbery. <em>Id. </em>comment, (nn.1-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">When attributing the actions of co-conspirators for sentencing purposes \u2014 including the application of cross-references\u2014 the guidelines provide for consideration, \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activityf,] ... [of] all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The guidelines go on to state that \u201c[i]n order to determine the defendant\u2019s accountability for the conduct of others under subsection (a)(1)(B), the court must first determine ... [ ] the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant\u2019s agreement ]\u201d. <em>Id. </em>comment, (n.2). Furthermore, \u201cconduct of others that was not in furtherance of the criminal activity jointly undertaken by the defendant, or was not reasonably foreseeable in connection with that criminal activity, is not relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Reasonable foreseeability and conduct within the scope of the agreement are two separate elements that the government must prove in order to hold a defendant accountable for co-conspirator actions. <em>United States v. Reese, </em>67 F.3d 902, 907-09 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that the district court erred in attributing certain quantities of cocaine to the defendants based only on their basic knowledge of the organization).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Although Gutierrez did not personally participate in the Escobedo murders, and there was no evidence that he had direct knowledge the murders would occur, the record demonstrates that he willingly associated himself with an organization that he knew both carried guns and used guns on others. Furthermore, Gutierrez\u2019s actions after the Escobedo murders took place indicated his complicity in a conspiracy whose acts were becoming increasingly violent. These actions indicate that the possibility that a murder \u2014 or murders \u2014 would occur in furtherance of the Varela Drug Ring\u2019s activities was something that was both reasonably foreseeable to Gutierrez and within the scope of his participation in the conspiracy. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(d)(1) cross-reference guideline against Gutierrez for the murder of the Escobedo family, and we affirm Gutierrez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
