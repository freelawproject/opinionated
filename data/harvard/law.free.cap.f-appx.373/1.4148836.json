On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on its finding that he was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. He asserts that, at his original sentencing hearing, the court found only that he was responsible for 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, and did not specify a greater drug quantity. Elrod also argues that, even if he were responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, he was still eligible for a sentence reduction because the Sentencing Guidelines should be treated as advisory in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-23\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-25\">In June 2007, Elrod pled guilty to: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>tribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and a detectable quantity of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and (b)(1)(C) (\u201cCount 1\u201d); and (2) using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1 )(A)(ii) and 2 (\u201cCount 3\u201d). Count 1 of the indictment alleged that the conspiracy to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine involved Elrod and nine other defendants, including Trinidad Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">In September 2007, the district court held a sentencing hearing regarding code-fendant Hamilton. The court and the parties agreed that Hamilton was responsible for eight kilograms of crack cocaine. Specifically, the court stated, \u201c[The] [c]ourt will make a finding of eight kilograms in this defendant\u2019s case. And you can refer to that in other sentencings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">According to Elrod\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), he and his cocon-spirators operated a drug trafficking scheme in which they converted powder cocaine into crack cocaine, and then delivered the crack cocaine to customers. El-rod was responsible for taking and delivering drug orders. The officer determined that each co-conspirator should be responsible for the entire amount of crack cocaine distributed by the group because they were all part of a joint scheme to sell crack cocaine. The probation officer found that Elrod was responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine, which rendered a base offense level of 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). After reducing Elrod\u2019s base offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), the officer reached a total offense level of 35 which, when combined with Elrod\u2019s criminal history category of III, produced a guideline range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">At his sentencing hearing in October 2007, Elrod stated that he had no objections to the PSI, and the court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and guideline applications. After reducing Elrod\u2019s offense level for his substantial assistance to the government, the court sentenced him to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 1, and to a mandatory consecutive term of 7 years\u2019 imprisonment as to Count 3, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Accordingly, Elrod was sentenced to a total term of 181 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">In March 2009, the district court <em>sua aponte </em>entered an order noting that Elrod could be eligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. Both the U.S. Probation Office and the government responded that Elrod was not eligible for a sentence reduction because he was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. The Probation Office and the government, however, cited different facts and arguments in support of their contentions that Elrod\u2019s case involved 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">The court entered an order finding that Elrod was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706. The court explained that it found the responses filed by the government and probation to be persuasive, and incorporated these responses into its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough, </em>a district court\u2019s discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is limited by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-94 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Where a defendant\u2019s guideline range remains unchanged by Amendment 706 because his offense involved 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine, a district court is not authorized to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>U.S. v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008). In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, a district court may rely on the undisputed factual findings set forth in the PSI used at the defendant\u2019s original sentencing. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). We may affirm a district court\u2019s decision based on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1342 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Here, the district court\u2019s reason for finding that Elrod was not eligible for a sentence reduction is not clear. While the court incorporated the government\u2019s and the U.S. Probation Office\u2019s responses into its order denying relief, the government and the U.S. Probation Office relied on different facts and arguments in their responses, and the court\u2019s order does not indicate which of these arguments it found to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">We, however, may still affirm the district court\u2019s order based on the record. During Hamilton\u2019s sentencing, the court found that the conspiracy involved eight kilograms of crack cocaine. In addition, at Elrod\u2019s original sentencing, he did not object to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation that each co-conspirator be held responsible for the entire amount of crack cocaine involved in the conspiracy. As a result, the record shows that Elrod was responsible for at least 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Finally, Elrod\u2019s argument that the district court had authority to reduce his sentence under an advisory Guideline system and <em>Kimbrough </em>is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Melvin. </em>AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
