The district court found that the state habeas court\u2019s adjudication of Roach\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was neither based on an unreasonable determination of fact, nor based on an unreasonable application of federal law. We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-12\">Whether the district court erred in denying the following ineffective assistance of counsel claim: that counsel was ineffective for misadvising Roach that he would be eligible for parole if he pled guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-13\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe two-part <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1551 (11th Cir.1989) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). \u201cTo satisfy this test, petitioner must show not only that counsel\u2019s representations fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, but also that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). In order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement in the context of a guilty plea, \u201cthe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. at 370. The petitioner has the burden of establishing that he was prejudiced by his lawyer\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. at 2069. A reviewing court need not address the performance prong of the test if the defendant cannot meet the prejudice prong, or vice-versa. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">Because Roach is appearing <em>pro se, </em>we liberally construe his pleadings. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). On appeal, Roach argues that the evidence presented to the state court showed that the only reason he accepted a guilty plea was based on his expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>that he would be eligible for parole, when in fact he was statutorily ineligible for parole as a serious violent offender under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-6.1. The state habeas court concluded that, although Roach sufficiently established that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, he failed to satisfy his burden of showing that his decision to plead guilty was based solely on the state\u2019s decision to drop a \u201cno parole\u201d stipulation from the plea deal. Therefore, he failed to satisfy the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. Roach argues that this finding was \u201can unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, he contends that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s misrepresentation regarding parole because had he known about \u00a7 17-10-6.1 he would have insisted on proceeding to trial. In sum, Roach argues that the erroneous advice by his attorney constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel which warrants this court to set aside the plea and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">We disagree. Roach did not make the requisite showing before the state habeas court of a reasonable probability that, but for his lawyers\u2019 errors, he would have rejected the plea deal and insisted on proceeding to trial. Furthermore, he has not satisfied his heavy burden under the AED-PA to show that the state court\u2019s decision amounted to an unreasonable determination of the facts presented at the state habeas hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact, and findings of fact for clear error. <em>Nyland v. Moore, </em>216 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2000). Habeas petitions based on ineffective assistance of counsel present \u201ca mixed question of fact and law requiring application of legal principles to the historical facts of the case.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1503 (11th Cir.1995) (internal quotation and citation omitted). Thus, although the state court\u2019s findings of historical fact underlying an ineffective assistance of counsel claim are entitled to a presumption of correctness, the court\u2019s conclusion on the claim itself is not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Viewing the record as a whole, there is ample evidence that illustrates the reasonableness of the state habeas court\u2019s findings. First, although Roach argued in his colloquy with the state habeas court that the \u201cno parole\u201d stipulation was the determinative factor in his decision to accept the plea deal, he did not testify to that effect or elicit any testimony in support of this position from his trial counsel. We have stated that a petitioner\u2019s bare allegation that he would not have pleaded guilty is insufficient to establish prejudice under <em>Strickland. United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764, 768 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">Second, the transcript of the plea colloquy does not contain any evidence that the initial plea deal Roach rejected contained a \u201cno parole\u201d stipulation or that a new stipulation of parole eligibility influenced his final decision to enter his guilty plea. Even accepting as true Roach\u2019s statements in his state habeas hearing that his attorney used his parole eligibility to persuade him to accept the modified plea deal, the record as a whole casts significant doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>on the centrality of parole eligibility to Roach\u2019s final decision to plea. The transcript reflects that Roach wavered significantly on whether or not to accept a plea deal throughout negotiations with his counsel and the state. It appears that he rejected the terms of the initial plea deal due to the stipulation that he would not have the right to appeal. Neither the state nor the court made any mention of Roach\u2019s parole eligibility or ineligibility at this time. Moreover, the transcript demonstrates that other factors influenced his ultimate decision to plea as well. Roach expressed ambivalence about proceeding to trial due to concern over his attorney\u2019s preparedness and momentarily rescinded his agreement to the modified plea deal when he was required to admit guilt to certain acts of molestation. Significantly, when Roach finally acquiesced to the plea deal, he stated: \u201cI want this over with. I can\u2019t take it no more. I\u2019m going to have a heart attack over this, they saying I did this and that. I\u2019m guilty of this, please just do it please.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Finally, Roach correctly points out that he only agreed to accept a plea deal in which he retained his right to parole. However, that plea deal departed from the initial offer in another significant way: Roach only pled guilty to 5 counts, where previously he was prepared to plead guilty to all 22 counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">In sum, although the parole eligibility stipulation was part of the modified plea deal\u2019s terms, there is no evidence in the record, other than Roach\u2019s own assertion in argument (not in testimony), that without this provision he would have proceeded to trial. We conclude that the state habe-as court\u2019s determination of facts was based on a reasonable interpretation of the evidence presented during those proceedings. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Accordingly, Roach failed to meet his burden under <em>Strickland </em>of establishing prejudice, and the state court decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Because Roach failed to establish the prejudice prong, we need not address the performance prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>See Holladay, </em>209 F.3d at 1248. The district court correctly denied Roach\u2019s petition and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">. Under the AEDPA, we may only grant an application for a writ of habeas corpus if the adjudication of the claim in state court either (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the Slate court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
