Maddox pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (2006), and possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006). The district court sentenced Maddox to eighty-four months of imprisonment and Maddox now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising several issues but stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Maddox filed a pro se supplemental brief raising additional issues.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The Government has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal based on Maddox\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal of Maddox\u2019s sentence and affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">A defendant may, in a valid plea agreement, waive the right to appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2006). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). This court reviews the validity of an appellate waiver de novo, and will enforce the waiver if it is valid and the issue appealed is within the scope thereof. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">An appeal waiver is valid if the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 169. To determine whether a waiver is knowing and intelligent, this court examines \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the accused\u2019s educational background and familiarity with the terms of the plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 400 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of Jiis right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Maddox knowingly and intelligently entered into the plea agreement and understood the appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Accordingly, Maddox waived the right to appeal his sentence and the manner in which it was determined and we thus grant in part the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. The appellate waiver does not, however, preclude us from considering Maddox\u2019s remaining claims. Therefore, we deny the motion to dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel questions whether the Government made a promise not contained in the plea agreement regarding the sentence Maddox would receive. This claim, however, is unsupported by the record. Counsel also questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>whether the plea should be set aside as unknowing and involuntary based on alleged clerical errors in the record, on Maddox\u2019s misunderstanding of the charges against him, and on the manner in which the factual basis was established at the Rule 11 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Because Maddox did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2002). Furthermore, there is a strong presumption that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is binding and voluntary if he has received an adequate Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995); <em>see Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct, 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977) (finding that statements made during a plea hearing \u201ccarry a strong presumption of verity\u201d). Our review of the record discloses that the district court fully complied with Rule 11. We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not err in accepting Maddox\u2019s guilty plea as knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Counsel next questions whether the Government retaliated against Maddox for filing a motion to dismiss and a suppression motion by seeking a superseding indictment. This claim, however, is based on a flawed factual premise and is therefore without merit. Counsel also questions the validity of the search warrant obtained to search Maddox\u2019s residence. However, Maddox waived the right to appeal this issue by pleading guilty. <em>See Menna v. New York, </em>423 U.S. 61, 62-63, 96 S.Ct. 241, 46 L.Ed.2d 195 (1975); <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (when defendant pleads guilty voluntarily, he waives challenges to deprivations of constitutional rights occurring prior to guilty plea).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Finally, counsel questions whether Maddox\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective. To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). With respect to the first prong, \u201cthe defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688,104 S.Ct. 2052. In addition, \u201c[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under the second prong of the test in the context of a conviction following a guilty plea, a defendant can show prejudice only by demonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">This court may address a claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears on the record. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that it does not conclusively demonstrate that Maddox\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. We accordingly decline to consider this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">We have examined the entire record in accordance with the requirements of <em>An-ders </em>and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Maddox\u2019s sentence, deny the motion as to Maddox\u2019s convictions, and affirm Maddox\u2019s convictions. This court requires that counsel inform Maddox, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Mad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>dox requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Maddox.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\"> We have considered the claims raised in Maddox's pro se brief and conclude that the claims lack merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
