Allen argues that the district court\u2019s decision to reduce his sentence by only 12 months was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-18\">Reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory and are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In Allen\u2019s case, the district court did not base its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 237; <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 486-87 (5th Cir.2005); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(B)(i)-(iii)). Also, the district court\u2019s failure to provide case-specific reasons for its decision does not constitute reversible error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672-74 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
