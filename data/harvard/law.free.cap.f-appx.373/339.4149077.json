Accordingly, because Shoetan had no other applications for relief pending before the immigration judge, the order of removal stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">We have reviewed the record and the amended regulations pertinent to Shoe-tan\u2019s claim and deny the petition for review. <em>See Brito v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 160, 167-68 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 450 (5th Cir.2008). We also deny the motion to place the petition for review in abeyance. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
