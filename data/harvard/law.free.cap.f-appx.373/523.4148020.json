California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Lopez has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Lopez\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Similarly, the record is insufficiently developed to permit consideration of Lopez\u2019s claim that his guilty plea was made under coercion and duress. <em>See United States v. Corbett, </em>742 F.2d 173, 176-78 (5th Cir.1984). He may urge such a claim in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>at 178 n.ll. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Lopez\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
