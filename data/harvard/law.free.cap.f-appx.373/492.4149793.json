He also moves for the appointment of counsel and to expedite his appeal or, in the alternative, for bail pending appeal. Moore argues that he is entitled to a new trial based on the recently obtained affidavit testimony and alleged confession of Sophian Blanc. We review the district court\u2019s ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 359 (5th Cir.2005). To be entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly-discovered evidence, Moore must show: \u201c(1) the evidence is newly discovered and was unknown to him at the time of trial; (2) the failure to discover the evidence was not due to his lack of diligence; (3) the evidence is not merely cumulative or impeaching, but is material; and (4) the evidence would probably produce an acquittal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">For the first time on appeal, Moore has adduced a letter purportedly written by Blanc, which Moore construes as a confession to the offense for which Moore was convicted. However, we \u201cmay not consider new evidence furnished for the first time on appeal and may not consider facts which were not before the [court below] at the time of the challenged ruling.\u201d <em>Theri-ot v. Parish of Jefferson, </em>185 F.3d 477, 491 n. 26 (5th Cir.1999). That evidence is therefore not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">The only \u201cnew evidence\u201d properly before this court is Blanc\u2019s affidavit, in which Blanc states that another foreign exchange student, Holger Setzer, viewed and downloaded the images of child pornography on Moore\u2019s computer. Our review of the trial record reveals that Blanc\u2019s affidavit testimony is cumulative of defense witness testimony suggesting that the images on Moore\u2019s computer were viewed and downloaded by Setzer. Justin Peters, a friend of Blanc and Set-zer, testified that he witnessed Setzer access pornographic websites featuring images of \u201cunderage girls\u201d on Moore\u2019s computer. Peters further testified that Setzer digitally created one of the images of child pornography introduced at trial by the Government. Another defense witness, Elbert Hudson, testified that he witnessed Setzer visit pornographic websites of all types: \u201cgirls, guys, young, old.\u201d Moore points to nothing unique about Blanc\u2019s knowledge that might be different from the eyewitnesses to Setzer\u2019s conduct who did testify. In short, Blanc\u2019s affidavit testimony duplicates testimony already introduced to- and rejected by \u2014 the jury. As such, Moore has not shown that he was entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly-discovered evidence. <em>See Holmes, </em>406 F.3d at 359. Consequently, the district court\u2019s ruling was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND FOR EXPEDITED APPEAL OR, ALTERNA<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>TIVELY, BAIL PENDING APPEAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
