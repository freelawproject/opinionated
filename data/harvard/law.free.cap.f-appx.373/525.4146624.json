He raises three challenges to his sentence. All three challenges were raised at sentencing and are preserved for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Portillo-Hernandez first contends that he should have received a four-level reduction in his offense level as compensation for an unwarranted sentencing disparity between him and defendants who are convicted in districts with early disposition or fast-track sentencing programs as provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1. As he recognizes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 563 (5th Cir.2008), where we held that the disparity caused by fast-track programs is not \u201cunwarranted\u201d and does not provide grounds for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Next, Portillo-Hernandez contends that using his 1994 manslaughter conviction to increase both his offense level and his criminal history score constitutes unlawful double-counting of the offense under the Sentencing Guidelines. He concedes that this argument also is foreclosed because double-counting is improper only when it is prohibited by a specific Guideline, and the Guidelines expressly allow consideration of a prior conviction in calculating both the offense level and the criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.6) (Nov. 2008); <em>see also United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Finally, Portillo-Hernandez contends that his right to confront witnesses, as recognized by <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), was violated when the court relied on hearsay contained in the presen-tence report. He concedes that this argument too is foreclosed because <em>Crawford </em>does not extend a defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights to sentencing proceedings. <em>See United States v. Beydoun, </em>469 F.3d 102, 108 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
