Finding substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the record does not compel a different result, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a), (b) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds.... \u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">An alien \u201cbear[s] the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,\u201d <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir.2006); see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2009), and can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2009). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngaruryih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>A well-founded fear of persecution in the absence of past persecution has both subjective and objective components, meaning that the applicant is subjectively afraid and that the fear is objectively well-founded. A claim based on past persecution, however, does not require the applicant to show he or she subjectively fears persecution in the country of origin. <em>Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F,3d 182, 188 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">\u201cWithholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) if the alien shows that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Gomis v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 353, 359 (4th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1048, - L.Ed.2d - (2010). \u201cThis is a more stringent standard than that for asylum .... [and], while asylum is discretionary, if an alien establishes eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>bility for withholding of removal, the grant is mandatory.\u201d <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353-54 (4th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer a \u201cspecific, cogent reason\u201d for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cExamples of specific and cogent reasons include inconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony[.]\u201d <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Likewise, \u201cthe immigration judge cannot reject documentary evidence without specific, cogent reasons why the documents are not credible.\u201d Kou<em>rouma v. Holder, </em>588 F.3d 234, 241 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). If the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and conjecture rather than specific and cogent reasoning, however, it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tew-abe, </em>446 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). Because the Board added its own reasoning when it adopted the immigration judge\u2019s decision, this court will review both decisions. <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 511 n. 8 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We find substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding as it related to the subjective component of Wu\u2019s claim that she had a well-founded fear of persecution. In addition, we find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Wu did not show any likelihood that she or similarly situated Chinese will be persecuted in Fujian Province as a result of the birth of children in the United States. We will not review Wu\u2019s claim that the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her statements made during the 2001 credible fear interview were not made under duress or under an immediate fear was without support in the record because she did not raise this claim on appeal to the Board. <em>See Massis v. Mukasey, </em>549 F.3d 631, 638, 640 (4th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 736, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2009). We also note Wu does not challenge the denial of relief under the CAT, which was determined notwithstanding the adverse credibility finding. Therefore, the claim is abandoned. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
