On appeal, Spinks argues that the district court erred in using the applicable statutory mandatory minimum of 240 months as the starting point for determining Spinks\u2019s sentence reduction for providing substantial assistance. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-24\">Spinks asserts that the district court improperly relied on both <em>United States v. Pillow, </em>191 F.3d 403 (4th Cir.1999), and <em>United States v. Hood, </em>556 F.3d 226 (4th Cir.2009), to determine his starting sentence. According to Spinks, the decisions in those cases reflect this court\u2019s alleged continued treatment of \u201cthe guidelines, or at least [USSG] \u00a7 5G1.1(b)(2), as mandatory, in direct contradiction to the holdings\u201d in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Spinks argues that the district court applied \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) in a mandatory fashion, because the court explained it would start with \u201cthe guideline sentence in this case, which is the mandatory minimum, and [the court] can depart under 5K1.1 to whatever degree the [c]ourt determines is appropriate.\u201d According to Spinks, \u201c[o]nce the government moved for reduction of sentence ..., the [district] [e]ourt was no longer obligated to sentence Defendant to the statutory minimum sentence of 240 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">To the extent that Spinks challenges this court\u2019s holding in <em>Hood, </em>it is well-settled that a panel of this court cannot \u201coverrule the decision of another panel; only the en banc court may overrule a prior panel decision.\u201d <em>Jones v. Angelone, </em>94 F.3d 900, 905 (4th Cir.1996). Moreover, Spinks\u2019s argument is contrary to the holding in <em>Booker. </em>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court struck the provision in the federal sentencing guidelines that made the guidelines mandatory. 543 U.S. at 249-50, 125 S.Ct. 738. Nonetheless, the excision of that provision and <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding that the guidelines must be applied in a discretionary manner did not alter the applicability of statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums. As this court explained in <em>Hood, </em>in a post-<em>Booker </em>case, where a statutory mandatory minimum is applicable to a defendant, \u201cthe district court [is] not authorized to reduce [the] statutory minimum sentence.\u201d 556 F.3d at 233. \u201cOnly Congress could authorize a departure from the statutorily mandated minimum sentence, and it did so in [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(e) for the <em>limited </em>purpose stated there \u2014 \u2018to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Here, Spinks does not argue, nor does the record reflect, that the statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2006) is inapplicable to his conduct. The Government filed an Information regarding Spinks\u2019s prior felony conviction, which made the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum applicable to Spinks\u2019s underlying conviction. Accordingly, because the guidelines range as initially calculated by the presentence report was less than the statutory mandatory minimum, the district court did not err in relying on the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum as the starting point for calculating Spinks\u2019s USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 departure and resulting sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
