Park appeals the sentence imposed following her guilty jalea to conspira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>cy to traffic in counterfeit goods and trafficking in counterfeit goods. She argues that (1) the district court misapplied U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B5.3 and (2) her within-guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Yi, </em>460 F.3d 623, 635 (5th Cir.2006). Based on expert testimony that the infringing items would have appeared to a reasonably informed purchaser to be identical or substantially equivalent to the infringed items, the record supports a conclusion that the district court did not clearly err in using the retail value of the infringed items to calculate Park\u2019s offense level. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B5.3, cmt. (n.2(A)(i)); <em>see United States v. Jackson, </em>453 F.3d 302, 308 n. 11 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We review the substantive reasonableness of Park\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court refused to consider a downward variance from the advisory range because Park had failed to heed repeated warnings by law enforcement regarding her trafficking in counterfeit goods. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008). Park\u2019s disagreement with the propriety of the sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-30\"> Pursuant to 5tu Cut.
