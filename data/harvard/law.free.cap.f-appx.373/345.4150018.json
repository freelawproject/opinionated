Salazar appeals the denial of his motion for a new trial. In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The district court entered its order on June 29, 2009. The ten-day appeal period expired on July 14. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (providing \u201cintermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d are excluded when time period is less than eleven days). The thirty-day excusable neglect period expired on August 13. On July 24, Salazar filed a document entitled \u201cMotion to Appeal and Request for Extension to File Appeal.\u201d He stated that he did not receive the court\u2019s order until July 8, 2009, and that legal services were not available. His certif\u00edcate of service stated that he mailed his notice of appeal on July 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Thus, while Salazar\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within the ten-day appeal period, it was filed during the thirty-day extension period. In addition, in Salazar\u2019s notice of appeal, he explicitly requested an extension of time. The district court did not rule on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Because Salazar filed his notice of appeal within the excusable neglect period and requested an extension of time, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Salazar has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-29\"> Because Salazar\u2019s notice of appeal was filed before the December 2009 Amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>evaluate the timeliness of his appeal under the rules in effect when he filed his notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
