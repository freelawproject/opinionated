We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a, b) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds[.]\u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Persecution is \u201cthe infliction of harm or suffering by the government, or persons the government is unwilling or unable to control, to overcome a characteristic of the victim.\u201d <em>Khalili v. Holder, </em>557 F.3d 429, 436 (6th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">An alien \u201cbear[s] the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,\u201d <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2009), and can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2009). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u201cWithholding of removal is available under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) if the alien shows that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Gomis v. </em>Holder; 571 F.3d 353, 359 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1048, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2010). \u201cThis is a more stringent standard than that for asylum .... [and], while asylum is discretionary, if an alien establishes eligibility for withholding of removal, the grant is mandatory.\u201d <em>Gandziami-Miekhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 353-54 (4th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002). Because the Board added its own reasoning when it adopted the immigration judge\u2019s decision, this court will review both decisions. <em>Niang v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 505, 511 n. 8 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">We find substantial evidence finding that Solim\u00e1n failed to show his claim of past persecution was as a result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Egyptian government directing such persecution or because the government was unable or unwilling to control those persons Solim\u00e1n claimed had persecuted him. We also find substantial evidence supports the finding that Solim\u00e1n did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. We further find Solim\u00e1n did not challenge the finding that he could escape the persecution by relocating within Egypt.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Because the record does not compel a different result, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b414-13\"> Solim\u00e1n does nol challenge the denial of relief under the CAT. As such, the claim is aban-doncd. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
