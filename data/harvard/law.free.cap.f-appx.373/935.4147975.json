On appeal, Fitzgerald: (1) concedes that he was originally sentenced as a career offender, but asserts that career offenders are not precluded from receiving sentence reductions under Amendment 706, and that our decision in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), was wrongly decided; and (2) argues for the first time on appeal that Congress\u2019s failure to amend the Sentencing Guidelines to reduce the dispai'ity between crack and powder cocaine offenses violates the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Section 3582(c)(2) gives federal courts the authority to consider reducing the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that defendants sentenced under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), are ineligible for sentence reductions under Amendment 706 because that amendment did not have the effect of reducing their guideline range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Fitzgerald was originally sentenced under the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). Therefore, in light of our decision in <em>Moore, </em>he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. Although Fitzgerald asserts that <em>Moore </em>was wrongly decided, we are bound by our prior holding until it is overruled by the Supreme Court or by a panel of this Court sitting <em>en banc. See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). Because Fitzgerald was sentenced as a career offender, the district court correctly concluded that he was not eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">As for Fitzgerald\u2019s equal protection argument, we have explained that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201cdoes not constitute a <em>de novo </em>resentencing\u201d and does not permit the district court to address \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d such as constitutional claims. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781-82 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that the district court properly declined to consider defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding). Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>grant a sentence reduction on equal protection grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
