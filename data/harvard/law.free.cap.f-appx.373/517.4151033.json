Vereen\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>this appeal. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009). The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Vereen argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was authorized to reduce her sentence based on the new advisory guidelines range and after consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. She also contends that her career offender status did not preclude the court from reducing her sentence. These issues are foreclosed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir. 2009), and <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
