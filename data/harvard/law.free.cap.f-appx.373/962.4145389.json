We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Zavala Nunez pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). In calculating the guideline range, the probation officer assigned a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), with a 16-level increase under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(a)(i), and a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total adjusted offense level of 21.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The probation officer determined Zavala Nunez\u2019s criminal history to be a category II based on a 1994 conviction for possession of heroin for sale. This yielded a guideline range of 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment. The statutory maximum term was 20 years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Zavala Nunez requested a sentence below the guideline range because his prior conviction occurred fifteen years earlier, he had no other convictions since then, he had a wife and children, he was employed and paid taxes, and he had cooperated with federal agents. The district court considered that Zavala Nunez had committed a drug crime involving a \u201cvery serious narcotic,\u201d was arrested, gave a false name, was convicted under that false name and ultimately deported, and that he re-entered the United States using a green card he was no longer entitled to have. The court thus determined that a sentence below the guideline range was not warranted and imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. In doing so, the court cited the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we then must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). Our review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Here, Zavala Nunez challenges only the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Upon review, we conclude that Zavala Nunez\u2019s 41-month sentence is reasonable. The district court listened to the parties\u2019 arguments and gave consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court expressed concern over Zavala Nunez\u2019s criminal record and determined that a sentence below the guideline range would not serve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). The court did, however, sentence Zavala Nunez to the low end of the guideline range, which was well below the statutory maximum term of imprisonment. Zavala Nunez has not shown that this sentence is unreasonable. Accordingly, Zavala Nunez\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-13\">. The probation officer listed a 2-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a). Upon a motion by the government, the court al sentencing applied a 3-level reduction under \u00a7 3El. 1(a) and (b), which resulted in a total adjusted offense level of 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just pun-ishmenl for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
