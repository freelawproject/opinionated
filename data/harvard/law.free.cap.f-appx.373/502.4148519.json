He further contends that he was entitled to a greater reduction in his sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-23\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). \u201c[TJhere are clear and significant differences between original sentencing proceedings and sentence modification proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238), <em>petition for\u2022 cert filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Whereas original sentencing proceedings are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, sentencing modification proceedings are governed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which requires only that the district court consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 673. Lynch submitted a sentencing brief in which he \u201cdescribed in detail why the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weighed in favor of a sentence at the bottom of, or below, the sentencing range.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 673. This court \u201ccan assume that [the district court] considered\u201d Lynch\u2019s arguments regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cthat it concluded that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors weigh in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Evan.s, </em>587 F.3d at 673 (internal quotations and citations omitted). The district court is \u201cnot required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law\u201d when granting or denying a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 674 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Moreover, a defendant cannot successfully challenge a district court\u2019s failure to provide reasons \u201cfor <em>granting </em>his [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] motion but not providing a satisfactorily low enough sentence within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-15\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-16\">. Lynch received a substantial assistance reduction upon motion of the Government. Therefore, Lynch was ineligible for Section 3582 relief under the law of this Circuit. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam). The Government does not appeal the grant of the Section 3582 motion, however, so we address only Lynch's appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
