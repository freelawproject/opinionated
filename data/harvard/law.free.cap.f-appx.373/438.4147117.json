He struck out on his own in 2001 to develop a physician-owned surgical facility, but continued seeing patients at Lane. In 2002, Lane summarily suspended Knatt from medical staff privileges for twenty-one days. These privileges were later reinstated, and the summary suspension was removed from his record.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">In 2003, Knatt filed the first of two lawsuits against Lane and several of its agents and employees in state court, asserting eleven claims that arose out of the events leading up to his suspension, including claims under the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act (LUTPA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants removed the case to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(c), which allows removal of an \u201centire case\u201d when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Knatt later attempted to amend his complaint to allege a conspiracy to destroy his business by constructively evicting him from office space that he leased from Lane. The district court denied the motion to amend and Knatt instead filed a second lawsuit in state court, alleging breach of contract, wrongful eviction, unfair trade practices, and discrimination. The defendants removed this action, too, and the district court consolidated Knatt\u2019s lawsuits into one. Then, in a series of decisions, the district court dismissed all of Knatt\u2019s claims except three state-law contract and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tortious interference claims, which it remanded to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In two opinions \u2014 in 2008 and 2009<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 we affirmed these dismissals save for Knatt\u2019s LUTPA claims, which we sent back to the district court for consideration along with the other remaining state-law claims. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">The application of LUTPA to all of the defendants ... presents difficult issues of state law. As we uphold summary judgment on all of Knatt\u2019s federal claims, only state law claims remain. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Knatt\u2019s LUTPA claims and remand for reconsideration to determine if, in comity, the district court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over these claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">And, though we found \u201cno error or abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s remand\u201d of the remaining state-law claims to state court, we vacated that remand order and instructed the district court to take up the issue again. This time the district court was to \u201cconsider all of the. state law claims together, including the ... LUTPA claim.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">So, left without a single federal claim despite several years in the federal system, Knatt moved for remand to state court. The district court, disagreeing with a magistrate\u2019s recommendation, granted the motion and the defendants now appeal that order, seeking to keep Knatt\u2019s lawsuit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">At the start, Knatt contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider the defendants\u2019 appeal altogether. He argues that the district court was obliged to remand the state-law claims to state court because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over them and that we accordingly lack appellate jurisdiction to review the remand order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Knatt is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">It is undisputed that when this case was removed to federal court, the district court had original jurisdiction over Knatt\u2019s federal claims, as well as supplemental jurisdiction over his state-law claims because they were \u201cso related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form[ed] part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The subsequent dismissal of all federal claims from Knatt\u2019s suit did not divest the district court of supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over those claims and \u201c[i]ts decision declining to exercise that statutory authority was not based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary choice not to hear the claims <em>despite its subject-matter jurisdiction over </em>them.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Our prior instructions in this case plainly contemplate that the district court would employ discretion in making a remand determination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And on its face the district court\u2019s order is an exercise of discretion. Because the district court had jurisdiction and retained discretion to adjudicate the state-law claims, we have appellate jurisdiction to review its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Our review is for abuse of discretion <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and is guided by the statutory factors set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) as well as the common law factors of judicial economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 1367 authorizes a court to decline supplemental jurisdiction over a state-law claim if: \u201c(1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law, (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction, (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction, or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These interests are to be considered on a case-by-case basis and no single factor is dispositive.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">In this case, section 1367\u2019s first and third factors weigh in favor of declining jurisdiction. In fact, when a district court eliminates all federal claims before trial\u2014 as the district court did in this case \u2014 the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d is that it should then decline to exercise jurisdiction over any remaining state-law claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> That said, \u201cthis rule is neither mandatory nor absolute,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and here there are other relevant concerns that we must address.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-17\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">Most compelling in favor of remand to state court is the presence of a \u201cnovel and complex issue of state law\u201d involving LUT-PA.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As we noted, a previous panel of this court has already explained that LUT-PA\u2019s application to the facts of this case \u201cpresents difficult issues of state law\u201d because it continues to divide Louisiana appellate panels, without resolution from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>state\u2019s high court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> More specifically, although \u201cKnatt argues that all of the other defendants were co-conspirators with [the hospital], and that he has standing to sue them,\u201d Louisiana courts \u201care split over whether co-conspirators may be sued under LUTPA.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendants have put forth no convincing argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Without support from section 1367, then, the defendants turn to the common law, urging that adjudication of the remaining state claims in federal court will best serve the interests of judicial economy, convenience, and fairness. In support, they point to the fact that the parties have produced \u201cover 7000 pages of discovery\u201d and deposed twenty-nine witnesses. It is true that \u201cthe amount of judicial resources that the case has consumed\u201d is relevant to our analysis, but that accounting is \u201cmost important ... as an indication of the familiarity of the forum with the case and its ability to resolve the dispute efficiently.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And here, despite the magistrate judge\u2019s involvement in overseeing discovery, \u201cthere is no indication that the <em>district judge </em>ha[s] substantial familiarity with the merits of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The parties have not yet filed motions <em>in limine, </em>the district court has not ruled on the admissibility of any significant amount of evidence, the parties have yet to brief the remaining state law issues on the merits, and no trial date has been set.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As the district court put it, the case \u2014 whittled to the few remaining state claims \u2014 has \u201conly recently \u2018re-started\u2019 \u201d and \u201ctrial is not imminent.\u201d Nor do the defendants contend that the discovery conducted in federal court will be unusable in subsequent state proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Finally, the defendants argue that maintenance in federal court is appropriate because they may benefit from a federal defense. In particular, the defendants contend that they are each entitled to qualified immunity under the federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because the willingness of medical professionals to review the performance of their peers is essential to policing the quality of health care in this country, HCQIA grants \u201climited immunity from suits for money damages to participants in professional peer review actions.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Like the other claims remaining in this case, the parties did not brief the HCQIA issue in the district court, although the defendants now attempt to persuade us on appeal that the defense does indeed apply. It might, but without the benefit of a district court decision and briefing on the subject, we cannot be sure. For one, Knatt\u2019s remaining claims, though centered on the hospital\u2019s peer review that resulted in his summary dismissal, stretch beyond that review action \u2014 albeit somewhat marginally. It remains a possibility, then, that at least some of Knatt\u2019s factual allegations and claims fall outside the protection of the federal defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">And, even if HCQIA could provide total resolution in this case, it would be odd to allow the mere potential for a federal defense to defeat the discretionary remand of state-law claims to a state court. The defendants do not contend that the Act falls under the complete preemption exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule and thus do not urge that it would have allowed them to remove the case to federal court in the first instance \u2014 rather than contest remand from federal court.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Although not a dispositive observation in this case, it is telling nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">All of this is to say that the district court will be no more familiar with the arguments associated with the defense than any given state court. For a court to decide the issue, more briefing and argument is required, regardless of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">After dismissing the claims that originally provided federal jurisdiction, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding no compelling reason to maintain the dispute in the federal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
