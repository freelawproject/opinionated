Goodman Obot appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of his supervised release and imposition of a sentence for four months of imprisonment and twelve months of supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Obot argues that even though he did eventually allocute at sentencing, the district court pronounced and imposed his sentence before affording him that opportunity in violation of the Due Process clause and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(b)(2)(E). Specifically, Obot asserts that the district court erred for failure to personally invite him to speak. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">We review \u201cquestions involving the legality of a criminal sentence <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Taylor, </em>11 F.3d 149, 151 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We also review <em>\u201cde novo </em>legal questions concerning the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1361 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">\u201cAllocution is the right of the defendant to make a final plea on his own behalf to the sentencing judge before his sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Carruth, </em>528 F.3d 845, 846 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted). \u201cIn any probation or supervised release revocation hearing, \u2018a defendant must be afforded an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(E)). Therefore, a district court\u2019s failure to afford to the defendant the right of allocution warrants reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 847; <em>United States v. Eads, </em>480 F.2d 131, 133 (5th Cir.1973) (per curiam) (holding that, in a revocation hearing, \u201csentences imposed upon those convictions are vacated and the cause remanded to the district court for resentencing after affording the appellant his right to allocute\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Phillips, </em>936 F.2d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-15\">We hold that, consistent with the requirements of Rule 32.1(b)(2)(E), the district court did not abridge Obot\u2019s right to allocute. The transcript from the revocation hearing indicates that the district court specifically asked if Obot \u201cwish[ed] to make a statement.\u201d Doc. 48 at 6. While the district court suggested that the recommended sentence was appropriate, the record shows that the district court did not impose the sentence until Obot had completed his allocution at length. Doc. 49 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>8, 9-13. Therefore, the district court did not prematurely announce Obot\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-11\">. The record shows that Obot was released on February 5, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
