Lemons contends that his \u00a7 2254 petition was timely in light of <em>Jimenez v. Quarterman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 681, 172 L.Ed.2d 475 (2008). The respondent concedes that Lemons\u2019s petition is timely under <em>Jimenez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">A one-year limitations period applies to state prisoners filing federal habeas petitions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). In most cases, the limitations period runs from the date that the conviction being challenged became final through \u201cthe conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Under <em>Jimenez, </em>when a habeas petitioner is granted the right to file an out-of-time appeal, \u201c \u2018the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review1 must reflect the conclusion of the out-of-time direct appeal, or the expiration of the time for seeking review of that appeal.\u201d <em>Jimenez, </em>129 S.Ct. at 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Applying the <em>Jimenez </em>rule to the instant case, Lemons\u2019s one-year limitation period began to run on or about January 27, 2005, upon expiration of the 90-day period for seeking a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court following the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial, on direct review, of his writ application. <em>See </em>Sup.Ct. R. 13.1. On October 28, 2005, approximately 273 days into the limitation period, Lemons filed a state application for post-conviction relief, thereby tolling the limitations period until August 15, 2007, when the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Lemons\u2019s writ application. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Lemons\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, which was filed on August 28, 2007, was timely. In view of the foregoing, we will reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">Lemons also argues the merits of certain constitutional claims. Because a COA was not granted as to these issues, we will not consider them in this appeal. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cut. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
