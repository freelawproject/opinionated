Johnson pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), but he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>The court has the discretion to reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cThe crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United Stated v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Johnson asserts that, although he was designated as a career offender, the district court downwardly departed so that he was \u201cultimately\u201d sentenced based on the crack cocaine guidelines and, thus, he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. This assertion is wholly unsupported by the record. The district court did not downwardly depart to a sentence within the crack cocaine guidelines range, and there is no indication in the record that the district court based its departure sentence on this otherwise applicable range.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Although the district court departed from the career offender guidelines range, Johnson\u2019s guidelines range was derived from his career offender status and not from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense. Accordingly, he was not sentenced \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See Anderson, </em>591 F.3d at 791. The district court did not err or otherwise abuse its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. \u2014\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">To the extent Johnson argues that the application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 is not mandatory, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 238. Because the district court simply denied the motion and did not consider any sentence reduction, we do not address Johnson\u2019s arguments that the district court erred in not considering the full panoply of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining his new, reduced sentence in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-16\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
