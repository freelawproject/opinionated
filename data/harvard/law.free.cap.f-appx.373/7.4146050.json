After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">A. Jackson\u2019s Original 248-Month Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In 1998, Jackson was convicted of a crack cocaine offense in federal court, which ordinarily has a ten year statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b)(l)(A)(iii). Because Jackson had a prior 1998 Georgia drug trafficking conviction, however, Jackson\u2019s statutory, mandatory minimum sentence was twenty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) &amp; 851.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although Jackson\u2019s initial guidelines range was 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment, his guidelines range became 240 to 293 months because of the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2) (stating that a sentence may be imposed at any point within the applicable guidelines range so long as it is not less than any statutory mandatory minimum). Jackson received a 248-month sentence. This Court affirmed Jackson\u2019s conviction and sentence on March 14, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In 2002, Jackson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was denied. In 2004, a Georgia court vacated Jackson\u2019s Georgia drug trafficking conviction. Consequently, in 2005, Jackson filed a second <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion, arguing that the district court should resentence him without the twenty-year mandatory minimum. The district court denied Jackson\u2019s motion as an unauthorized second \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court cited <em>In re Dean, </em>341 F.3d 1247 (11th Cir.2003), in which this Court concluded that a sentencing error claim based on a vacated prior state court conviction did not fall within \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence exception\u201d to the bar on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. 341 F.3d at 1248-49. This Court dismissed Jackson\u2019s appeal of the \u00a7 2255 ruling because Jackson failed to pay the filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">B. Section 3582(c)(2) Motion Based on Amendment 706</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">In 2008, Jackson, acting <em>pro se, </em>wrote a letter to the district court stating that he had heard about Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713. Jackson\u2019s letter asked whether he needed to file a motion to have his sentence reduced based on Amendment 706 and, if he did not, asked the court to consider certain post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct and his family\u2019s hardship in resentencing him. Jackson\u2019s letter did not mention that his prior Georgia drug trafficking conviction had been vacated in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">On December 15, 2008, the district court construed Jackson\u2019s letter as a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction and granted the motion. The district court concluded that Jackson was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because Amendment 706 had lowered Jackson\u2019s applicable guidelines range. The district court explained that (1) Amendment 706 lowered Jackson\u2019s initial range from 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment to 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment, and (2) therefore, because of the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence, Jackson\u2019s amended applicable guidelines range was simply 240 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (stating that when the statutory mandatory mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>mum is greater than the high end of the applicable guidelines range, the mandatory minimum \u201cshall be the guideline sentence\u201d). As a result, the district court imposed a 240-month sentence on December 15, 2008 (which was eight months lower than his original sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">C. Motion for Reconsideration Based on Vacated Prior Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On December 20, 2008, Jackson <em>pro se </em>filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s December 15, 2008 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jackson\u2019s motion contended that he no longer was subject to the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence because his Georgia drug trafficking conviction had been vacated. Jackson attached a copy of a-Judgment of Nolle Prosequi dated May 2006 that nol prossed Jackson\u2019s indictment and indicated that Jackson was given state habeas relief in 2004. Jackson argued that, without the Georgia drug trafficking conviction, his criminal history category was II rather than III and his amended applicable guidelines range was 168 to 210 months. The government conceded that Jackson\u2019s Georgia drug conviction used to support the increased statutory mandatory minimum had been vacated, but argued that the district court was not permitted to reduce his sentence on that ground in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">On July 25, 2009, the district court entered an order denying Jackson\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The district court acknowledged that Jackson\u2019s sentence reduction was \u201cmore limited than it would otherwise have been\u201d because of the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, but concluded that it could not \u201crely on Amendment 706 to revisit the minimum mandatory, even though it was based on a now-vacated conviction.\u201d The district court explained that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l), it could consider only Amendment 706\u2019s change to the base offense level and that all other original sentencing determinations were \u201cleft unaffected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">On August 3, 2009, Jackson filed a notice of appeal challenging the district court\u2019s July 25, 2009 order denying his motion for reconsideration. Jackson did not challenge the district court\u2019s underlying December 15, 2008 order granting his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and reducing his sentence to 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-15\">On appeal, Jackson argues that the district court should have granted his motion for reconsideration and, in light of his vacated Georgia drug trafficking conviction, should have resentenced him without regard to the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Jackson\u2019s motion for reconsideration for three reasons, any one of which is sufficient alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-16\">First, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction on July 25, 2009 to modify Jackson\u2019s 240-month sentence imposed on December 15, 2008. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir.2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under <em>Phillips </em>and Rule 35(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the district court had the power to correct any clear error in Jackson\u2019s new sentence within seven days of imposing that sentence on December 15, 2008, i.e., on or before December 22, 2008. The district court did not act upon Jackson\u2019s motion for reconsideration until July 25, 2009. Once the seven-day time limit in Rule 35(a) expired, the district court could not have granted Jackson\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Second, in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, Jackson may not attack his increased statutory mandatory minimum within the narrowly prescribed confines of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Thii'd, Jackson\u2019s initial \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion (filed in 2008) did not seek a reduced sentence based on his vacated prior drug conviction (vacated in 2004), but sought a reduction under Amendment 706. Thus, the district court did not err in denying a motion for reconsideration based on an entirely different claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">. Section 841(b)(1)(A) states that a defendant who commits a \u00a7 841(a) offense after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense becomes final is subject to a term of imprisonment \"which may not be less than 20 years and not more than life imprisonment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Section 851 requires the government to file an information with the court stating the prior convictions it will rely upon in seeking a sentence that has an \"increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\">. \"Under the \u2018prison mailbox rule,' a <em>pro se </em>prisoner's court filing is deemed filed on the date it is delivered to prison authorities for mailing.\u201d <em>Williams v. McNeil, </em>557 F.3d 1287, 1290 n. 2 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2747, 174 L.Ed.2d 249 (2009). Jackson averred that he delivered his motion for reconsideration to prison officials for mailing on December 20, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b37-17\">. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court had jurisdiction to modify Jackson's reduced 240-month sentence upon Jackson's motion for reconsideration. <em>See Phillips, </em>597 F.3d at 1194-95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b38-20\">. The CourL appointed Jackson counsel and asked for supplemental briefing on the jurisdictional issue under <em>Phillips. </em>Jackson's letter brief raises substantive due process and other issues that were not raised in the district court or in his initial brief and do not fall within the limited scope of the supplemental briefing. Thus, we decline to address these issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
