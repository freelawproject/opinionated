We will vacate the order dismissing his complaint and remand for further proceedings. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 (2008); 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">Reeves is a federal prisoner. He filed <em>pro se </em>a complaint alleging that one of his former case managers forged his signature on a report purporting to memorialize a program review that did not occur, though he did not allege any adverse consequences as a result. He also alleged that defendants have wrongfully assigned him a security classification of \u201cgreatest severity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">By order entered May 13, 2009, 2009 WL 1346648, the District Court dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(2) for failure to state a claim. The District Court did not allow Reeves leave to amend. Reeves then filed a motion for the appointment of counsel, apparently before receiving a copy of the Dis-' triet Court\u2019s order. He later filed a timely motion for reconsideration, which we construe as a motion under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. He also filed a number of other motions, including a motion to \u201cfurther develop evidence,\u201d purportedly under Rule 15. In that motion, Reeves alleged that a 2006 revision of Bureau of Prisons Policy 5100.08 had discontinued the \u201chigh drugs\u201d category that led to his \u201cgreatest severity\u201d classification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-16\">A Magistrate Judge construed that motion as one for leave to file an amended complaint. The Magistrate Judge denied it without prejudice, but granted Reeves until January 15, 2010, to file another motion attaching a proposed amended complaint. Then, by order entered December 17, 2009, 2009 WL 5103221, the District Court denied Reeves\u2019s motion for reconsideration and other pending motions, though it did not address Reeves\u2019s motion for counsel. That same day, and before receiving the District Court\u2019s order, Reeves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>mailed another motion for the appointment of counsel. His motion referenced the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order and asserted that he required counsel in order to amend his complaint. The District Court did not rule on that motion. Finally, Reeves filed a timely notice of appeal after receiving a copy of the District Court\u2019s December 17 order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Reeves\u2019s appeal from the denial of his Rule 59(e) motion brings up for review the underlying order dismissing his complaint. <em>See Jones v. Pittsburgh Nat\u2019l Corp., </em>899 F.2d 1350, 1352-53 (3d Cir.1990). We agree that Reeves\u2019s existing complaint fails to state a claim for the reasons explained by the District Court. In particular, the District Court explained that prisoners generally do not have a protected liberty interest in their security classifications and that Reeves did not allege any facts that might warrant relief in that regard. <em>See Moody v. Daggett, </em>429 U.S. 78, 88 n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 274, 50 L.Ed.2d 236 (1976). The District Court further explained that Reeves asserted no injury as a result of the allegedly forged report.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Procedural irregularities in the District Court, however, require that we remand for further proceedings. District courts must permit a curative amendment before dismissing a complaint unless amendment would be inequitable or futile. <em>See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </em>515 F.3d 224, 245-46 (3d Cir.2008); <em>Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 110-11 (3d Cir.2002). In its initial opinion and order dismissing Reeves\u2019s complaint, the District Court neither granted Reeves leave to amend nor explained whether amendment would be inequitable or futile. The Magistrate Judge later granted Reeves leave to file a motion for leave to amend his complaint. Under our precedent, however, Reeves did not require leave to amend his complaint. <em>See Phillips, </em>515 F.3d at 245-46. Given Reeves\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, allowing him leave to seek such leave was not an adequate substitute for the unambiguous allowance of amendment as a matter of course, or an explanation why amendment would be inequitable or futile, that our precedent requires. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In addition, the District Court did not address Reeves\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel. Of particular concern is Reeves\u2019s second motion, which he filed within the time the Magistrate Judge allowed him to seek leave to amend and which made specific reference to that ruling. The appointment of counsel is committed to the sound discretion of the District Court. <em>See Tabron v. Grace, </em>6 F.3d 147, 157-58 (3d Cir.1993). Thus, we will remand for the District Court to exercise that discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Accordingly, we will vacate the order of the District Court dismissing Reeves\u2019s complaint without leave to amend and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the District Court should rule on Reeves\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel. It should then permit Reeves to file an amended complaint within a particular time and conduct such further pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>ceedings as may be necessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-13\">. The policy is available at <em>hltp://www.bop. gov/policy/progstat/5100J308.pdf </em>The District Court did not address the merits of Reeves's assertion, and we decline to do so in the first instance under the circumstances presented here. We note, however, that the current policy appears to permit a classification of \u201cgreatest severity\u201d on the basis, <em>inter alia, </em>of the amount of drugs involved in Reeves\u2019s initial offense. <em>See </em>Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement No. P5100.08, Appendix A (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although Reeves retained the ability to file a motion for leave to amend his complaint at the time the District Court denied his Rule 59(e) motion, that order has since become final because Reeves did not file such a motion within the time permitted. <em>See Bren</em>nan v. <em>Kulick, </em>407 F.3d 603, 606 (3d Cir.2005). We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion, though we review any attendant issues of law <em>de novo. See Max\u2019s Seafood Caf\u00e9 ex rel. Lou-Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros, </em>176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-17\">. Reeves's request for the appointment of counsel in this Court is denied. We express no opinion on the merits of Reeves's request for counsel in the District Court, and our denial of his request for counsel in this Court should not be construed as such an opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
