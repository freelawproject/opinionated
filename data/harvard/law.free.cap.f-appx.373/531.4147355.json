We deny Borja\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-26\">We generally review only the BIA\u2019s decision except to the extent that the immi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>gration judge\u2019s (IJ) decision influences the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007). With respect to the determination that Borja\u2019s prior conviction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 for transporting an illegal alien made him inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i); that such offense constituted a bar to good moral character under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3); and that, in the absence of good moral character, he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l), Borja has not shown that the BIA\u2019s decision was either unconstitutional or based upon an incorrect interpretation of \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i). <em>See Soriano v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 318, 320-21 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">To the extent that Borja challenges our holding in <em>Soriano, </em>which foreclosed all of the arguments he raised before the BIA, his argument is unavailing. We have held that \u201cin the absence of intervening Supreme Court precedent,\u201d one panel cannot overrule another panel even if it disagrees with the prior panel\u2019s holding. <em>See Montesano v. Seafirst Commercial Corp., </em>818 F.2d 423, 425-26 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, Borja\u2019s argument that the Government did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that he had been convicted of an alien smuggling scheme is without merit. The Government provided both a criminal complaint and a judgment of conviction that demonstrated that Borja did not innocently offer a ride to an illegal alien, but aided and abetted an alien\u2019s further entry into the United States with \u201cknowledge and reckless disregard\u201d that the alien had entered the country in violation of the law. Accordingly, we deny his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
