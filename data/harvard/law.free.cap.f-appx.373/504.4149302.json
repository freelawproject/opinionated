The district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denied Schneider\u2019s, and dismissed the suit. This appeal ensued. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">This court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Xtreme Lashes, LLC v. Xtended Beauty, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir.2009). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Schneider argues that the defendant is legally responsible for the arresting officers\u2019 acts under the theory of municipal liability, and he maintains that excessive force was used in connection with his arrest. He also maintains that the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by failing to promptly and adequately treat the injuries that he suffered to his teeth when he was arrested. Under Schneider\u2019s view, the defendant violated his Due Process rights with respect to the manner in which it defended the instant suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Additionally, Schneider contends that the district court erred with respect to its rulings on his requests to amend his complaint, for discovery, for appointed counsel, and for an investigator. According to Schneider, he was denied access to the courts. Finally, Schneider moves this court for appointed counsel, to stay the proceedings, and for leave to conduct depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">These arguments are all unavailing. The record does not show that Schneider\u2019s constitutional rights were infringed pursuant to an official policy or custom of the defendant. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>McKinney v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>309 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2002). The record also does not establish that any official was aware of and ignored a substantial risk of serious harm to Schneider\u2019s health. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Consequently, Schneider failed to raise a meritorious claim of excessive force or deliberate indifference to serious medical needs, and he concomitantly has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s grant of the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment. His argument concerning the alleged Due Process violation that resulted from the defendant\u2019s litigation practices lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Similarly, Schneider has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in connection with its rulings on his numerous motions. Because there is nothing exceptional about the instant case, there is no error in connection with the district court\u2019s denial of his request for appointed counsel. <em>See Baranowski v. Hart, </em>486 F.3d 112, 126 (5th Cir.2007). Our review of the record likewise shows no error in connection with the district court\u2019s rulings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>on Schneider\u2019s requests for an appointed investigator, discovery, and to amend his complaint. <em>See Ackerson v. Bean Dredging LLC, </em>589 F.3d 196, 208 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Scott v. Monsanto Co., </em>868 F.2d 786, 793 (5th Cir.1989). We decline to consider Schneider\u2019s access to courts claim because it is raised for the first time in this appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
