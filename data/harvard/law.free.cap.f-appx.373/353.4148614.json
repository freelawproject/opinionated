Smith appeals, contending that his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Smith\u2019s base offense level was 20. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2B3.1(a) (2008). Two levels were added because the property of a financial institution was taken, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l), and three levels wei'e subtracted for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1. Smith\u2019s total offense level was 19. He had eleven criminal history points, placing him in criminal history category V. His advisory Guidelines range was 57-71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">At sentencing, argument focused on the Government\u2019s motion for upward departure, in which the Goveimment asked that Smith be sentenced as a de facto career offender. The Government observed that many of Smith\u2019s offenses were too remote to have been assigned criminal history points or were not counted for other reasons. Those eximes included common law robbery, assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injui'y, misdemeanor assault, passiixg worthless checks (over twenty counts), communicating threats, and possession of drag paraphernalia. The Government contended that criminal history category V failed to adequately i\u2019eflect the seiiousness of Smith\u2019s past criminal conduct or the likelihood that he would commit future crimes. Smith, through counsel, i*eplied that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range would be sufficient to satisfy sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">After hearing from counsel and inviting Smith to speak, the district coui't concluded that a sentence outside the advisory Guidelines range was appropriate, and sentenced Smith to ninety-five months in pi'ison. In pi-onouncing sentence, the court specifically mentioned many of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) sentencing factors, including: the nature and circumstances of the offense; the need to pi'otect the public from further crimes; the need to promote respect for the law; and the need to deter further criminal conduct. The court commented especially about Smith\u2019s criminal history, which included engaging in larceny over a twenty-four-year period. These factors, the coui't found, warranted a sentence above the advisory Guidelines l'ange, but lower than the sentence advocated by the Government. The coui't added that it had considered imposing a sentence greater than ninety-five months. However, mitigating circumstances, including Smith\u2019s physical and mental health, dissuaded the court from imposing a more severe sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">The court commented that it could arrive at a ninety-five-month sentence another way: by granting the Government\u2019s departure motion. The court explained that, by following the methodology set forth in the Guidelines, it would reach a Guidelines range of 77-96 months and sentence Smith to ninety-five months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying an abuse-of-cliscretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Seay, </em>553 F.3d 732, 742 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 127, 175 L.Ed.2d 82 (2009). Our initial review is for \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d including \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">We next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At this stage, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the district court decides to impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range, it must ensure that its justification supports \u2018the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 161 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 476, 172 L.Ed.2d 341 (2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Our review of the record convinces us that Smith\u2019s ninety-five-month variant sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable. First, there were no significant procedural errors in the sentence: the district court properly calculated Smith\u2019s advisory Guidelines range; considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and explained that it was varying from the Guidelines range because that range did not adequately account for the nature and circumstances of the offense, Smith\u2019s criminal history, and the need to protect the public from further financial crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">Additionally, the sentence is substantively reasonable. The district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and supported the twenty-four-month upward variance with a thoughtful analysis of relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Notably, the court discussed Smith\u2019s extensive history of larceny, the harm his crimes had caused, and his demonstrated lack of respect for the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">Smith contends that his sentence was the result of an upward departure under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 4A1.3. He takes issue with the methodology used by the district court in calculating his departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">The district court offered two separate rationales for imposing a sentence above Smith\u2019s advisory Guidelines range: (1) the \u00a7 3553(a) statutory factors; and (2) the Guidelines departure provisions. In <em>Evans, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-18\">[Ajfter calculating the correct Guidelines range, if the district court determines that a sentence outside that range is appropriate, it may base its sentence on the Guidelines departure provisions <em>or </em>on other factors so long as it provides adequate justification for the deviation ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-19\">When ... a district court offers two or more independent rationales for its deviation, an appellate court cannot hold the sentence unreasonable if the appellate court finds fault with just <em>one </em>of these rationales.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-20\"><em>Id. </em>at 164-65. Under <em>Evans, </em>because we have found Smith\u2019s variant sentence \u2014 imposed using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 to be procedurally and substantively reasonable, there is no need to address the reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ness of the same sentence under the alternative rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We accordingly affirm. We dispense - with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
