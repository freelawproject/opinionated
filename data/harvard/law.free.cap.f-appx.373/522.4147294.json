Jones, federal prisoner # 09940-035, appeals the denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on the amendments to the crack cocaine Guideline. Although the district court reduced Jones\u2019s sentence, the court denied Jones\u2019s request to reduce his sentence below the amended guidelines range. Jones argues that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court had the discretion to depart from the amended guidelines range. He further argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u) does not grant the Sentencing Commission the authority to bind the district court\u2019s discretion in \u00a7 3582 cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-22\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and a district court cannot reduce a sentence below the minimum provided in the amended guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 238. Insofar as Jones challenges the reasonableness of his sentence at the bottom of the recalculated guidelines range, his argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Evans, 587 </em>F.3d 667, 670-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). \u201cThe <em>Booker </em>reasonableness standard does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-20\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
