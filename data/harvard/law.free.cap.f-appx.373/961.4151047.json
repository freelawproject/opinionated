On appeal, Cooper argues that the finding of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>had the ability to perform past relevant work and work in the national economy was not supported by substantial evidence because the ALJ improperly discounted the opinions of his treating physicians, incorrectly assessed the available evidence, and failed to recontact his physicians before ordering a consultative examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles underlying the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). However, the Commissioner\u2019s final decision regarding disability is reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires that the administrative decision be based on \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence is \u201cless than a preponderance, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Errors may be harmless if they do not prejudice the claimant. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">In this case, the ALJ finding that, despite severe impairments, Cooper retained the ability to perform light work and, consequently, was not disabled was supported by substantial evidence in this record. The ALJ did not totally discount the findings and opinions of Cooper\u2019s treating physicians, and, to the extent that he did, his reasons were proper and supported by the record. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the ALJ erred by ordering a consultative exam before recontacting treating physicians, any error was harmless, because Cooper suffered no prejudice as a result. In particular, the RFC findings made after the consultative exam found more limitations, not less, than were documented prior to the exam, so the exam benefitted him, as these additional limitations were incorporated into the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-21\">The task of determining a claimant\u2019s ability to work is within the province of the ALJ, not a doctor, and substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Cooper was not disabled. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
