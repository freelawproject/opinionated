On appeal, Diaz argues that the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVCCR\u201d) confers private enforceable rights on individuals, and that we should overrule our contrary holding in <em>Gandara v. Bennett, </em>528 F.3d 823 (11th Cir.2008). Diaz also argues that the district court erroneously dismissed his allegations of constitutional deprivations stemming from mistreatment he received in the Georgia state prison system. He contends that he stated a cause of action for the mistreatment under both 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and the Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-26\">We review <em>de novo </em>a decision to dismiss a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, taking the allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006). We apply the same standard of review for dismissals under \u00a7 1915A as we do for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X, </em>437 F.3d at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-27\">Section 1915A of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall review, ... a complaint in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a). Upon review, the court is to dismiss the complaint or portions thereof, if the complaint \u201cfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1915A(b). In addition, the PLRA requires inmates to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Leal, </em>254 F.3d at 1279 <em>(quoting </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)). \u201cThis means that until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted, a prisoner is precluded from filing suit in federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In <em>Gandara, </em>we held that Article 36 of the VCCR does not confer judicially enforceable individual rights. 528 F.3d at 829. Our holding applies irrespective of whether an individual petitioner attempts to enforce Article 36 pursuant to \u00a7 1983 or the ATCA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350. <em>See id. </em>at 830 n. 1 (Rodgers, J., specially concurring) (noting that the petitioner had filed his VCCR claim pursuant to both \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1350).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">The ATCA is not only a jurisdictional statute, but it also \u201cprovides a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time of its enactment.\u201d <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., Inc., </em>416 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). To state a claim for relief under the ATCA, a plaintiff must prove a <em>prima facie </em>case that he is \u201c(1) an alien, (2) suing for a tort, which was (3) committed in violation of international law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have previously held that non-torture claims of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment ai*e not cognizable under the ATCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">Because we are bound by our prior precedent unless and until it is overturned by this Court <em>en banc </em>or by the U.S. Supreme Court, <em>see United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009), we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Diaz\u2019s claims in relation to the VCCR, whether brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or the ATCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Diaz\u2019s remaining claims allege violations of the U.S. Constitution for the mistreatment he received in jail. If Diaz brought the claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he fails to challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that he did not exhaust his administrative remedies and, therefore, abandons this issue. <em>See Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[w]hen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned\u201d). Instead, if Diaz brought the claims under the ATCA, he is basing his prison mistreatment claims on a violation of the U.S. Constitution, not international law, and the mistreatment Diaz alleges is not cognizable under the ATCA. Aldana, 416 F.3d at 1247. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
