First, Carson argues that he is entitled to remand under sentence six of \u00a7 405(g) because the Appeals Council\u2019s order remanding his case to the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) was not included in the record before the Appeals Council. Second, Carson argues that the ALJ failed to set forth good cause for giving less than significant weight to the opinions of Dr. Guillermo Suarez and Dr. Eduardo N. Ra-heb and erred by failing to consider, or give great weight to, the opinion of Dr. Harry B. Sperber or the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) concerning his gastroeso-phageal reflux disease (\u201cGERD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-19\">In the social security context, we review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles underlying the ALJ\u2019s decision, but \u201cwe review the resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cmore than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). We may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment for that of the ALJ, even if we find that the evidence preponderates against the ALJ\u2019s decision. Martin <em>v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination whether remand for consideration of new evidence is appropriate. <em>Vega v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1218 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>The first issue is whether we should remand under sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) because the Appeals Council\u2019s April 20, 2007, order that remanded Carson\u2019s case back to the ALJ was not included in the record before the Appeals Council. Sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) permits the district court to remand a cause to the Commissioner for consideration of new evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1267 (11th Cir.2007). To be entitled to remand to the Commissioner, the claimant must show that (1) new, non-cumulative evidence exists; (2) the evidence is material such that a reasonable possibility exists that the new evidence would change the administrative result; and (3) good cause exists for the claimant\u2019s failure to submit the evidence at the appropriate administrative level. <em>Caulder v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 872, 877 (11th Cir.1986). However, \u201cnot every discovery of new evidence, even if relevant and probative, will justify a remand to the Secretary, for some evidence is of limited value and insufficient to justify the administrative costs and delay of a new hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 876 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, sentence six encompasses only those instances in which \u201cthe district court learns of evidence not in existence or available to the claimant at the time of the administrative proceeding that might have changed the outcome of that proceeding.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1267 (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Finkelstein, </em>496 U.S. 617, 626, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 2664, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">Because we conclude from the record that the Appeals Council\u2019s April 20 order is not new evidence, and its inclusion in the record before the Appeals Council would not reasonably change the administrative outcome, we deny Carson\u2019s request for remand under sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The second issue is whether the ALJ set forth good cause in rejecting the opinions of Dr. Suarez and Dr. Raheb as to Carson\u2019s back condition, and Dr. Sperber and the VA as to Carson\u2019s GERD. Controlling weight generally should be given to a treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding the nature and severity of a claimant\u2019s impairments if the opinion is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The ALJ must give the opinion of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cGood cause\u201d exists when the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the ALJ may reject the opinion of any physician when the evidence supports a contrary conclusion. <em>Sryock v. Heckler, </em>764 F.2d 834, 835 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">\u201cThe ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so is reversible error.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. However, where an ALJ articulates specific reasons for failing to accord the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">We hold that the ALJ articulated particular reasons for giving less than significant weight to the opinions of Dr. Suarez and Dr. Raheb and those reasons were supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>the ALJ\u2019s finding that Carson failed to show that his GERD began prior to the date of last insured, which was an implicit rejection of the opinions of Dr. Sperber and the VA, was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of Carson\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
