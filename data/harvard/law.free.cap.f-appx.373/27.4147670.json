Williams\u2019 motion was based on Amendment 709 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and therefore cannot serve as the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b55-25\">Maurice Lawrence Williams pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and using and carrying a firearm during a drag trafficking crime, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Rl-34. The presentence investigation report determined that Williams\u2019s total offense level was 17 and his criminal history category was IV. The district court imposed a total sentence of 100 months: 40 months of imprisonment for the cocaine offense, followed by 60 months of imprisonment for the firearm offense. Rl-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Subsequently, Williams filed a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), contending that he was entitled to a sentence reduction in light of recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines. Rl-54. Specifically, his motion was based on Amendments 706 and 709. <em>Id. </em>The court determined that Williams\u2019 amended offense level was 15 and that his criminal history categoiy remained IV. Rl-55. The court granted his motion and reduced his total sentence to 97 months: 37 months of imprisonment for the cocaine offense, followed by 60 months of imprisonment for the firearm offense. <em>Id. </em>Williams appealed the district court\u2019s \u201cdenial of full relief.\u201d Rl-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On appeal, we vacated Williams\u2019s sentence because the district court did not demonstrate that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 sentencing factors. Rl-62. On remand, the district court imposed the same sentence and clarified that it did so after considering the relevant factors. Rl-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Williams then filed the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, arguing that, in resolving his earlier motion, the court erroneously failed to consider the effect of Amendment 709. Rl-63 at 2. He contended that Amendment 709, which concerns counting offenses to determine a defendant\u2019s criminal history score, is a clarifying amendment that must be applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. The district court denied Williams\u2019s motion, concluding that Amendment 709 is not retroactive. Rl-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">On appeal, Williams argues, <em>pro se, </em>that the district court abused its authority by denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He contends that the court erroneously assigned him a criminal history category of IV, and that his true criminal history category was II. Accordingly, his guideline range was calculated incorrectly, and his sentence is unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">Williams\u2019 <em>pro se </em>argument may be liberally construed as a contention that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 709 did not entitle him to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. See <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding that <em>pro se </em>pleadings will be liberally construed). We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s sentence that was based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Any reduction, however, must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The applicable policy statement states that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless an amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) is applicable to the defendant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(A), p. s. (Nov.2009). Amendment 709 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Where an amendment is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), it cannot serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that, although the amendment at issue was a \u201cclarifying amendment\u201d and therefore applied retroactively in the context of direct appeals and habeas petitions, it could not serve as the basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because it was not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Here, the district court correctly concluded that Williams was not eligible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 709, because Amendment 709 is not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
