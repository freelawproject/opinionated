He argues that the 21-month sentence imposed is unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the sentence is greater than necessary to address the sentencing factors set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The district court determined that the advisory guidelines range was not adequate and that a greater sentence was warranted based on Cortez\u2019s prior criminal history, characteristics, the need to protect the public, and to deter future criminal behavior. Cortez has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709-10 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
