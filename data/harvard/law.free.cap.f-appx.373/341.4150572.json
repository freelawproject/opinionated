The district court found Jones was not eligible for a reduction because he was found responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. We affirm. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Jones\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 200 (4th Cir.2010) (stating standard of review). A review of the sentencing transcript shows that the sentencing court noted Jones was responsible for moi\u2019e than 5.1 kilograms of crack cocaine. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order finding Jones was not eligible for a sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>No. 2:02-cr-00019-1 (S.D.W.Va. Nov. 2, 2009) (citing United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, 2Dl.l(c)(l)). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
