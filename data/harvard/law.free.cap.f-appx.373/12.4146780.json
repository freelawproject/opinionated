On appeal, Grandison argues the district court erred in determining the extent of his sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Grandi-son contends the court\u2019s failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors indicates it might not have appreciated the extent of its discretion to impose a lower sentence in light of the relevant factors. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Here, the district court granted Grandi-son\u00e9 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and sentenced him to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment, the lowest end of the amended guideline range of 324-365 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court failed to explicitly state it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201c[I]f it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must vacate and remand the case to the district court.\u201d). Even if the court erred by not considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such error was harmless because the district court lacked the authority to sentence Grandison below the amended guideline range sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A) (stating that, generally, the court \u201cshall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d); <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1193-94 (11th Cir.2009) (holding the district court erred in sentencing the defendant below the amended guideline range in violation of the guidelines policy statements), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\">.
