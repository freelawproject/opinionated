Clark appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in finding that he was a career offender within the meaning of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">A defendant must be sentenced as a career offender if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">(1)the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-15\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-16\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">USSG \u00a7 4Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">On appeal, Clark argues that the district court erred in finding that his prior New Jersey conviction for theft from a person was a crime of violence within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4B 1.2(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment over one year, that \u2014 \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-19\">Clark had prior New Jersey felony convictions for theft from a person and for felony robbery. In the district court, Clark conceded that his prior conviction for felony robbery was a crime of violence, but argued that his theft from a person conviction was not a crime of violence because the New Jersey court in that case found two mitigating circumstances: (1) Clark\u2019s conduct did not cause or threaten serious harm; and (2) Clark did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm. Clark contended that under these circumstances, the district court could not find that his prior conviction for theft from a person involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The district court, relying on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), found that Clark\u2019s pri- or New Jersey conviction for felony theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>from a person was similar in kind and in degree of risk posed to burglary from a dwelling. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Whether Clark\u2019s prior New Jersey conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is a legal issue we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Dickerson, </em>77 F.3d 774, 775 (4th Cir.1996). Because the language defining a crime of violence in \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is nearly identical to the language defining a violent felony in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2006), this court looks to its case law interpreting both sections when examining whether a prior crime involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. <em>United States v. Roseboro, </em>551 F.3d 226, 229 n. 2 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">This court recently held that theft from a person under North Carolina law is a crime of violence within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4B.1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Jarmon, </em>596 F.3d 228 (4th Cir.2010). Like the North Carolina statute under which Jarmon was convicted, the New Jersey statute provides that one of the elements of theft in the third degree includes property taken \u201cfrom the person of a victim.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:20-2(b)(2)(D) (West 2005 &amp; Supp.2009). The \u201ctaking of property from the person of another from an area within his immediate custody and control ... raises the danger of confrontation [between thief and victim] and involves an invasion of the victim\u2019s person and privacy.\u201d <em>State v. Harrison, </em>149 N.J.Super. 220, 373 A.2d 680, 684 (1977) (interpreting New Jersey larceny from the person statute); <em>State v. Blow, </em>132 N.J.Super. 487, 334 A.2d 341, 343 (1975) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In comparing this crime with the enumerated offenses, the district court correctly applied the <em>Begay </em>analysis to find that the offense is a crime of violence. <em>See Jarmon, </em>596 F.3d at 230-32 (applying <em>Be-gay </em>analysis to North Carolina theft from a person statute and finding it to be crime of violence). Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
