We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, p.s. (\u201cThe authorization of such a discretionary reduction ... does not entitle a defendant to a reduced term of imprisonment as a matter of right.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Stewart, </em>595 F.3d 197, 204 (4th Cir.2010) (declining to determine that defendant was automatically entitled to a specific sentence reduction and noting that discretion to evaluate the policy and circumstances is vested in the district court). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
