The action is brought to recover for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, alleged to have been caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence in the state of Florida. The plaintiff is a brother of the deceased, resides in this state, and was appointed administrator by the Surrogate\u2019s Court of the county of New York. The only averment with regard to the Florida statute (Gen. St. 1906, \u00a7\u00a7 3145, 3146) is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-16\">\u201cThat tbe statutes and laws of he state of Florida provide, and at the times hereinbefore referred to did provide, that where a person is injured and died within said state by reason of the carelessness or negligence of another, and no action for damage is brought by the person so injured during his lifetime, an action for damages sustained by such injury and death might and could be brought by his widow or minor children, or, if none survived him, by any person dependent upon his support; and if neither widow, minor child, or person dependent upon his support survived him, then by the executor or administrator of his estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">It is averred that the decedent did not leave him surviving any widow, child, or person dependent upon his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It appears to be regarded by the courts of this state as settled law that an action like this can only be maintained in this state upon proof that the statute of the state, in which the injury occurred, gives the right of action and is similar to our own statute. Leonard v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Columbia Steam Navigation Co., 84 N. Y. 48, 38 Am. Rep. 491; Wooden v. W. N. Y. &amp; P. R. R. Co., 126 N. Y. 10, 26 N. E. 1050, 13 L. R. A. 458, 22 Am. St. Rep. 803; Strauss v. N. Y., N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 91 App. Div. 583, 87 N. Y. Supp. 67; Howlan v. N. Y. &amp; N. J. Tel. Co., 131 App. Div. 443, 115 N. Y. Supp. 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The demurrer was sustained by the learned justice at Special Term, on the ground that the Florida statute as pleaded is unlike the statute of this state, and in that view we concur. Our statute gives a cause of action to the executor or administrator of the decedent for the benefit of a surviving husband, wife, or next of kin, and the plaintiff in such an action must allege and prove that the decedent left him or her surviving a husband, wife, or next of kin. Section 1902, Code of Civil Procedure. The damages are measured by the pecuniary loss sustained by the person or persons for whose benefit the action is prosecuted. The Florida statute as pleaded gives the cause of action to the executor or administrator, the decedent not having left him surviving a widow, minor child, or a person dependent upon his support; but there is nothing in the complaint to show for whose benefit the action is being prosecuted. The Florida statute of distribution is not pleaded, and we are not informed who the distributees under it are, or where they reside. It may be that the decedent left creditors, who will be entitled to any recovery. The suit therefore is not for the benefit of persons who would have a cause of action under our statute, and of course the rule of damages is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">While section 1780 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that an action may be maintained by a resident of this state against a foreign corporation for any cause of action, it has not been held that the section requires the courts of this state to take jurisdiction in this class of actions, simply because an administrator has been appointed in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The appellant claims that the statute as pleaded is similar to the statute of Connecticut, which was involved in Leonard v. Columbia Steam Navigation Company, and Strauss v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Company, supra. But it will be seen, by reference to the Connecticut statute, that the damages recovered in such an action inure to the benefit of the husband, widow, and heirs of the deceased person. Gen. Stat. Conn. (Revision of 1887) c. 73, tit. 18, \u00a7 1008. If this action were being prosecuted by or for the benefit of the widow, or next of kin, residents of this state, an entirely different question would be presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Of course, the construction of the Florida statutes must be gov- ' erned by the decisions of the courts of that state. What rule of damages shall be applied in an action prosecuted for the benefit of an estate? In case of a recovery shall it be distributed here? If so, according to what statute of distribution ? Would the pendency of this suit be a bar to a suit in Florida by an administrator appointed there, at the instance, for example, of Florida creditors? Queries which suggest practical reasons for- remitting the parties, in a case like this, to the courts familiar with the administration of the laws involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">It does not appear upon what grounds the surrogate acquired jurisdiction to grant letters of administration, and no question of fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>or collusion arises, as in Hoes v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 173 N. Y. 435, 66 N. E. 119; Pietraroia v. N. J. &amp; H. R. R. &amp; F. Co., 131 App. Div. 829, 116 N. Y. Supp. 249; Id., 197 N. Y. 434, 91 N. E. 120. In the -latter case, Judge Gray, writing for the majority of the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-5\">\u201cAs a question of policy, it is intolerable that our courts should be impeded in the administration of justice, and that the people of this state should be burdened with expense, in redressing wrongs committed in another state, for the benefit, solely, of its citizens, and where the remedy is in the enforcement of its statutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-6\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It seems to me that it is within the discretion of the Supreme Court to decline jurisdiction in a case like \u2022 this, and that that discretion should be exercised, unless it appears that the action is being prosecuted for the benefit of citizens of this state, or, if by a resident' administrator properly appointed, for the benefit of nonresidents, that the latter would at least have a cause of action in this state, if the injury had occurred here. The Special Term was plainly justified in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
