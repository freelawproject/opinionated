Then follow allegations as to pain, suffering, medical attendance, loss of time, and other elements of his damage; that said injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant and her agents and employ\u00e9s; that the inspection required by law would have shown the defect, and prevented said injury; upon information and belief, that no such inspection, and no proper inspection, was made, as required by law; and the usual allegation of lack of contributory negligence. The defendant demurred to the complaint' for insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">There is no fact stated to show the defendant to have been negligent. Allegations of conclusions cannot supply this deficiency. There is no duty cast upon the owner of an automobile, by the statutes of this state, to have the same inspected. But if there were a duty, which the master owed to the servant, to make or cause to be made an inspection, it would be necessary to allege facts showing that the neglect to inspect the car was the proximate cause of the injury. In this case the complaint alleges that \u201cowing to some latent defect, not discernible by plaintiff\u2019s examination, the handle or lever flew back.\u201d The plaintiff was an expert, having driven automobiles for four years,, and if he could not discover the defect, on an examination of the-machine, it would appear that he had properly described the defect, as \u201clatent\u201d\u2014that is, not visible or discernible by observation\u2014and. hence would not have been discovered by the defendant\u2019s inspection. But, further, the complaint fails to state sufficiently the facts in relation to the occurrence. Did any portion of the machine break, through a defect in the material? Had any portion of the machine become defective through lack of repair?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">If we were allowed to speculate as to the reason of the flying back of the lever, the supposition that it happened through the plaintiff\u2019s careless operation would be more in accord with the probabilities than that it happened by reason of some hidden or unexplained defect in the machine itself. No liability can be predicated on the allegation, that defendant\u2019s agent stated that the automobile was in good order,\u2019 for the reason that the plaintiff did not rely on the statement, but made his own examination, and no facts are alleged which tend to, show that this statement was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The judgment and order should therefore be reversed, with costs to appellant, and the demurrer sustained, with costs to defendant, with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint, upon payment of such costs, within six days, if he is so advised. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
