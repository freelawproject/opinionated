It also is averred that the plaintiff intends to use the testimony thus elicited upon the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Defendant resists this examination for the reason, among others, that he has made certain admissions in his answer, because of which no examination should be had. But we are of opinion that plaintiff is not bound to accept the statement of defendant\u2019s knowledge or lack of knowledge as therein contained, but is entitled to the examination\u2019 having in all respects set forth the facts necessary to entitle him thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The order vacating and setting aside the order for defendant\u2019s 'examination must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate denied, with $10 costs, and the examination reinstated; time of examination to be fixed on settlement of order. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
