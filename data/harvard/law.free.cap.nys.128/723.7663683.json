Suit is brought against the defendant as the actual or discovered principal; but it seems quite apparent that exclusive credit in this case was given to the \u00bfEtna Company, and that, under such circumstances, the principal, whether known or unknown at the time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>cannot be held.
