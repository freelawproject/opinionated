Affidavits for service by publication, made by persons other than plaintiff, alleged that defendant had left the state, and that plaintiff had been unable with due diligence to make personal service of summons upon him, but contained no averment that defendant was not a resident of the state, or that plaintiff had made inquiry to ascertain where defendant resided, or that plaintiff did not know, and could not ascertain by inquiry; whether he was a resident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the state. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavits were insufficient to give the justice jurisdiction, and a recital of jurisdictional facts in the order of publication, based alone on the affidavits, did not cure the defect.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-5\">[Ed.

The mere statement of these things in the language of the statute was not proof of them, nor evidence. They were conclusions for the judge tq find.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">The order was sustained by the court at Special Term, upon the ground that the affidavits were sufficient to make out a case within that provision of section 438 of the Code of Civil Procedure which declares that an order directing the service of a summons upon a defendant, by publication, may be made where after diligent inquiry the plaintiff is unable to ascertain whether the defendant is or is not a resident of the state. There was no affidavit by the plaintiff, \u25a0 and no reason was stated why he did not make one. There was no proof by affidavit of any inquiry by the plaintiff to ascertain where the defendant resided. No fact was stated tending to show that the plaintiff did not know where the defendant resided, or was unable to ascertain by inquiry whether the defendant was or was not a resident of the state. The affidavits disclosed no effort to ascertain the residence of the defendant by the plaintiff or any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">It is also to be observed that there was nothing in the order to indicate that the justice passed upon the question whether the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>after diligent inquiry, was unable to ascertain whether the defendant was or was not a resident of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We are, therefore, brought to the conclusion that the facts sworn to were insufficient to give the justice jurisdiction, and that- the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and-the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
