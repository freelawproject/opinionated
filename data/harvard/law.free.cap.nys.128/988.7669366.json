The plaintiffs sue as trustees for the benefit of the creditors of H. Leonard Simmons, upon a policy of fire insurance issued by defendant. The complaint is in the form commonly used in such actions, and the-answer, besides certain denials, contains two affirmative defenses, one that the insured made false and fraudulent proofs of loss, and the other that he swore falsely and produced fraudulent proofs upon an examination had pursuant to the terms of the policy. It is apparent from the affidavit upon which the order was granted that the plaintiffs\u2019 purpose is not to obtain evidence to support their case, or even to controvert the case which may be made by defendant, but is tO' gather such information as to the proofs in defendant\u2019s possession, as will enable them, in the language of the affidavit, \u201cto avoid the defenses.\u201d The courts are at present disposed to grant orders for the examination of adverse parties with great liberality, even to the extent, in some cases, of permitting a plaintiff to examine the defendant as to an affirmative defense; but it still remains necessary that the evidence to be elicited is of such a character that it may be necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>and material to the moving party, and that he intends to use it upon the trial, but it is only in rare and exceptional cases, if at all, that the court will permit a plaintiff to pry into his opponent\u2019s defense merely for the purpose of \u201cavoiding\u201d it on the trial. Tuthill v. Schinasi, 141 App. Div. 520, 126 N. Y. Supp. 409. Upon this ground the motion to vacate should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is also objected that it does not appear from the affidavit on which the order was granted that the person to be examined was an officer of defendant, for a corporation can be examined only through an officer or director. Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7 872, subd. 7. The party to be examined is described as a \"managing agent,\u201d which does not import, as language is ordinarily used, that he is an officer. There is no magic in names, however, and it may be in some cases, and especially with reference to foreign corporations doing business in this state, that the relation to the corporation and the duties of a person called a managing agent are such as to indicate that he is in fact an officer. But, if this be so, it is incumbent upon the party, applying for the order, to cause the fact affirmatively to appear, for there is no presumption that an agent, managing or otherwise, is an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
