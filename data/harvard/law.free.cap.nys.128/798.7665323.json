Defendant was sued upon a guaranty of payment in the following form.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-24\">\u201cPhiladelphia, Pa., 2/19/1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-25\">\u201cThe Strobel &amp; Wilken Co., New York City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-26\">\u201cGentlemen: In consideration of your shipping to Mess. Milgraum &amp; Ost, of Philadelphia, the goods ordered by them amounting to about four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), we hereby guarantee to you the payment of same when due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-27\">\u201cYours truly, Weisen Bros., per Max Weisen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-28\">\u201cWitness: E. C. Mueller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-29\">The complaint alleges the defendant was a member of the firm of Weisen Bros.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-30\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It was urged on the trial, and is now urged on appeal, that this action will not lie against defendant because the guaranty did not purport to be his individual guaranty, but that of the firm, and that there was therefore a nonjoinder of parties defendant, in that all the members of the firm should have been sued. The objection would not be without force if it had been taken in time. But it was not. It is one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>which should have been taken by answer or demurrer, and, not having, been so taken, is deemed to have been waived. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 488, 498, 499; Seligman v. Friedlander, 199 N. Y. 373, 92 N. E. 1047; Jones v. Gould, 200 N. Y. 18, 92 N. E. 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> A more serious objection to the judgment relates to the nature of the evidence permitted -to be introduced by plaintiff. The action was for a balance claimed to be due for goods sold to the firm whose account was guaranteed after the deduction of certain payments. In addition to some not very precise evidence as to the delivery of the goods and the partial payments, an employ\u00e9 of the plaintiff was permitted to testify to certain statements and admissions made to him by the principal, in the absence of defendant, respecting the amount due from the firm whose payments were guaranteed. The reception of this evidence was duly objected to, and it was received under defendant\u2019s exception. A subsequent motion to strike it out was denied and an exception taken. There can be no doubt that the reception of this evidence constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The statements made by Milgraum and Ost were not part of the res gestee, having been made after the conclusion of the business between plaintiffs and the principal debtors. Under such circumstances, admissions and statements by the principal, however formally or specifically made, are not competent proof against the surety. Hatch v. Elkins, 65 N. Y. 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It cannot be said that this proof did not influence the verdict, for without it there was no evidence of the amount due.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The respondent urges that appellant waived his exception by moving at the close of the case for the direction of a verdict. This is clearly untenable. By moving for a direction the appellant conceded that upon the evidence, as it stood, there was no question of fact for the jury, but this did not preclude him from insisting upon appeal that the evidence to which he had objected had been improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">It follows that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
