The affidavit upon which the order was based did not give the name of any officer of defendant whose examination was sought, nor did the order name such person. Section 872, subdivision 7, Code of Civil Procedure, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-19\">\u201cAnd if the party sought to be examined is a .corporation, the affidavit shall state the name of the officers or directors thereof, or any of them whose testimony is necessary and material, and the order to be made in respect thereto shall direct the examination of such persons. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-20\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Both the affidavit and order in question failed to comply with this requirement. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Furthermore, the order directed that service thereof should be made upon the attorneys for defendant, or upon E. J. Koehler, on or before a specified date. Section 875, Code of Civil Procedure, requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-21\">\u201cA copy of the order, and of the affidavit upon which it was granted, must De served upon the attorney for each party to the action, in like manner as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>a paper In the action; or, if a party has not appeared in the action, they must be served upon him as directed by the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-3\">Defendant herein having appeared, its attorney should have been served with a copy of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for examination granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
