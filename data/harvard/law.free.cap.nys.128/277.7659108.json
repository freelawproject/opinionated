It alleges that on or about the 12th day of October, 1905, the plaintiff sold and delivered to the Staso Company a stone crusher known as a \u201cKent mill,\u201d with other parts, for which the company paid the plaintiff the sum of $500, \u201cand agreed to return said mill and accessories to plaintiff within ten days after the same should be set up, or, in case of failure so to return the same, to pay him the further sum of two thousand dollars ($2,000) therefor.\u201d The complaint further states that the Staso Company transferred and conveyed to the defendant, the Staso Mills, all its assets, \u201cand in consideration thereof defendant assumed and agreed to pay all the liabilities of the said the Staso Company, including the liability of said the Staso Company to this plaintiff hereinabove set forth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">1 The complaint does not state, either that the Staso Company had set up the mill, or had unreasonably failed or neglected to do so, and, while it states that the defendant had assumed to pay the obligations of the Staso Company, there is no allegation that it has failed to do so or that it has failed or neglected to pay the $2,000 to the plaintiff. The learned counsel for the respondent claims in his brief that it was the intention of the plaintiff to allege that no part of the $2,000 has been paid, and in effect that the failure to set up the mill is a reasonable inference; but the requirements of the Code of Civil Procedure necessitate a <em>\u201cstatement </em>of the facts\u201d constituting a cause of action, so they cannot be deduced by mere inference. Section 481, subd. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">It follows that the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs,, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, but with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint on payment within 20 days. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
