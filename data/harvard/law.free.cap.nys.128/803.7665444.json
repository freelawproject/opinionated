The prayer for relief is that it be decreed that the said defendant held the property in trust for the said Max Moskiewitz and that she still holds it in trust for his heirs at law. The respondents do not contend that a trust resulted to the said Max Moskiewitz from the mere fact of the payment of the consideration by him. See Real Property Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 50) \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Even assuming that the person paying the consideration is not chargeable with an intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors when he takes a conveyance in the name of a third party for the purpose of placing the property beyond the reach of future creditors (see McCartney v. Titsworth, 119 App. Div. 547, 104 N. Y. Supp. 45), still such a purpose does not of itself afford ground for invoking the reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>dial jurisdiction of equity. No fact is alleged in the complaint to bring this case within the line of cases in which equity has constructed trusts for the purpose of preventing the consummation of a fraud by one occupying a position of peculiar trust and confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The fact that the grantee named in the deed was the wife of 'the person paying the consideration does not alone justify the plaintiffs in invoking the doctrine of constructive trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">It is claimed, however, that the complaint is broad enough to justify the inference That the said defendant agreed to receive and hold the legal title in trust for her said husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Of course, such an agreement would be void unless in writing and the breach of a void agreement is not the kind of fraud which will justify resort to equity, but that question is not presented by the pleadings. We do not think, however, that such an agreement is pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is to be found if at all in the eighth paragraph, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-9\">\u201cThat the defendant Regina Moskiewitz had full knowledge of all of the facts connected with the purchase of the said property and consented and did receive the title thereto, and held the same in trust for the said Max Moskiewitz, deceased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">From that it is to be inferred that the said defendant had knowledge of her husband\u2019s purpose in taking the conveyance in her name, and that she consented to and did receive the legal title with that knowledge. It does not follow from that, that she agreed to hold the legal title in trust for her husband. The statement that she \u201cheld the same in trust for the said Max Moskiewitz, deceased,\u201d is but the statement of a legal conclusion, and does not justify the inference that she agreed thus to hold the legal title. We have then the bare fact that the said defendant\u2019s husband, with\" her knowledge and consent, paid the consideration and procured the title to be taken in her name, for the purpose of placing the property beyond the reach of future creditors. No trust results from such a transaction, and certainly equity will not construct one. See Fagan v. McDonnell, 115 App. Div. 90, 100 N. Y. Supp. 641, affirmed 191 N. Y. 515, 84 N. E. 1112, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">The order should be reversed, with $10 cost and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
