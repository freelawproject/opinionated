This order continued :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-18\">\u201cAnd it is further ordered, that the plaintiff pay to the defendant\u2019s attorney within ten (10) days after the service upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney of a copy of this\u2019order with notice of entry thereof, and at least at or before the service of the bill of particulars, ten ($10.00) dollars costs of this motion.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">Plaintiff did not pay the costs, but on December 2d served a bill of particulars, which was promptly returned. Defendant claims that the. order made the service of the bill of particulars conditional upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s first paying costs. In this construction of the order I cannot concur. It would be aif.extraordinary form of order in any event to direct a plaintiff to serve '\u00e1\\ bill of particulars, and at the same tiihe to treat it as a privilege accorded to him by requiring him to pay $10 before carrying out the order of the court. I prefer to adopt the simpler and more reasonable interpretation that the provisions as to the payment of costs merely fixed the time of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In this view the bill of particulars was improperly returned by defendant, because it had been duly served, from which it follows that the order to preclude plaintiff from giving testimony thereunder, from which this appeal is taken, was improperly granted, and should be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
