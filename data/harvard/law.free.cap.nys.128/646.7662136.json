The trial of the indictment was transferred to the County Court, and after a verdict of guilty the court, upon motion of the defendant, granted an order in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the County Court did not have jurisdiction over the subject of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-13\">Section 30 of the liquor tax law prohibits \u201cany person,\u201d whether he has paid the prescribed tax or not, from doing certain acts specifically set forth in separate subdivisions of the section. Among these is subdivision \u201cg,\u201d which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-14\">\u201cTo have opened or unlocked any door or entrance from the street, alley, yard, hallway, room or adjoining premises to the room or rooms where any liquors are sold or kept for sale during the hours when the sale of liquors is forbidden, except when necessary for the egress or ingress of the person holding the liquor tax certificate authorizing the traffic in liquors at such place, or members of his family, or his servants, for purposes not forbidden by this chapter; or to admit to such room or rooms any other persons during hours when the sale of liquor is forbidden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">There are two counts in the indictment against the respondent. The first charges him on a Sunday, at the time and place specified, with having \u201cunlawfully opened and caused to be opened,\u201d following the language of the subdivision quoted, the door, which was the entrance from the street, to a room where liquors were sold and kept \u201cby said defendant and one Antonino Graceffo.\u201d The second count accuses the defendant with having \u201cadmitted\u201d at the same time certain named persons into said room, \u201cnot being members of the family of Antonino Graceffo, who held the liquor tax certificate for said place,\u201d and who were not of the family of the defendant, or the servants of either him or the holder of the tax certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-16\">As will be noted, the violation of the statute is made when \u201cany person\u201d commits the acts constituting the offense, and he may not be the holder of the tax certificate or in his service. The question is: What court has jurisdiction of the offense? If the defendant is a stranger to the certificate holder, he may come within the condemna<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tian of subdivision <em>\u201cg\u201d </em>of section 30, and be guilty of a misdemeanor, only the offense may not be indictable. On the other hand, if he is interested in the business, or in the service of the holder of the tax certificate, a severer punishment may be imposed, and he may be indicted.'</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In the first count of the indictment the charge is that the defendant caused the entrance door to the saloon described to be opened and unlocked, \u201cand at the place aforesaid were certain strong and spirituous liquors, which were then and there sold and kept for sale prior to and on said day <em>by said defendant </em>and one Antonino Graceffo.\u201d Keeping in mind that the sufficiency of\" the. indictment is challenged as on a demurrer to it, we have the distinct averment that the-defendant, with Antonino Graceffo, at the time and place the offense was alleged to have been committed, was keeping and selling liquors. To be sure, it does not allege whether as an agent of or as a principal with Antonino. It is of no importance in which capacity. The charge is distinct that he sold and kept the liquors, and that is a sufficient averment of his pecuniary interest in the business. Within the scope of that allegation, proof would have been competent to establish that he was in fact part owner of the.liquors sold and kept in the saloon at that time. It is not claimed that, if he was part owner of this business, or pecuniarily interested in it, he would not be chargeable as principal, and would not be liable to indictment for the offense of which he was convicted-.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The counsel for the respondent seems to be of the opinion that the defendant was the employ\u00e9 or agent of the certificate holder. There is no allegation of that import in-the indictment. Section 35, however, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">\u25a0 \u201cAny clerk, agent, employ\u00ae or servant shall be equally liable as principal for any violations of the provisions of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">We are not passing upon the offense of a person who is not interested in the business or in the employ of the certificate holder. We simply hold that, as the charge in the indictment is against the defendant as principal, the offense was an indictable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The motion in arrest of judgment was made and granted only on the ground that the court did \u201cnot have jurisdiction over the subject of the indictment.\u201d The only other ground upon which such a remedy can be taken is that the facts stated in the indictment do not constitute a crime. Code of Criminal Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 331 and 467; People v. Jackson, 191 N. Y. 293, 297, 84 N. E. 65, 15 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Neither the evidence nor the charge of the court is contained in the record. It may be that the case was submitted to the jury only on the second count of the indictment, \"or .that the evidence without objection showed facts covering the exception in subdivision \u201cg\u201d of section 30, so that the alleged vice in the indictment may have been cured. In view of these circumstances, we do not feel justified in considering the-sufficiency of the indictment'on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Order reversed, and case-remitted to the County Court. \" All' concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
