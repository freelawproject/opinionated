The defendant, by way of affirmative defenses, sets forth certain acts, alleged to have been committed by plaintiff, which, if proven, will probably constitute at least a partial defense to her cause of action. These acts defendant will be entitled to prove upon the trial, and the plaintiff is certainly a competent witness to prove them. We think that defendant was entitled to examine her before trial, to establish the facts which he alleges in defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">The order appealed from must be reversed, and the motion denied. The date for the examination to proceed will be inserted in the order, which must be settled on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
