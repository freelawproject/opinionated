We adopt this course, rather than that of relegating the contestants to their action under section 2653a of the Code of Civil Procedure, for two reasons: First, because an affirmance of the decree would establish prima facie the validity of the contested will; and, secondly, because the decree contains an adjudication that the will, if valid, constitutes an effective exercise of the power of appointment given to the testatrix by the will of her deceased husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> With this view we are not now prepared to agree, and, while we do not pass upon the question definitively at this time, because, if the testatrix should be found to have been incompetent, the question will never arise, yet we prefer to so deal with the decree that it cannot be argued, even by inference, that we intended to leave that question as it was decided by the surrogate. For this reason we have concluded to reverse the decree appealed from, and direct a trial by jury of the material questions of fact arising upon the issues between the parties, with costs to the contestants in this court and the Surrogate\u2019s Court, ,to be paid out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Settle order on notice.
