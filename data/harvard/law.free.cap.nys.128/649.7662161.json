After examining several, she selected about a dozen in the general show room. These were carried by a saleslady, an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, to a small fitting room, into which she was followed by the plaintiff and her friend. As they entered the fitting room, the plaintiff removed her watch, which was attached to her coat by a gold pin. She then removed her coat, and laid it, together with the watch, upon a small table standing in the room. This was done in the presence and full view of the saleslady, who told the plaintiff to place her things upon this table while she removed her waist for the purpose of being fitted. After a waist had been selected and fitted, by a fitter who subsequently entered the room, the plaintiff put on her coat, but could not find her watch, and a diligent search failed to disclose it. This action was brought to recover its value.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-16\">Upon the facts proved, it is evident that the defendant was under the duty of exercising some degree of care in reference to the plaintiff\u2019s coat and watch. The court was justified, upon the evidence, in finding that the defendant exercised no care whatever in the premises. In Bunnell v. Stern, 122 N. Y. 539, 25 N. E. 910, 10 L. R. A. 481, 19 Am. St. Rep. 519, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">\u201cUnder these circumstances we think that it became their (defendants\u2019) duty to exercise some care for the plaintiff\u2019s cloak, because she had laid it aside on their invitation and with their knowledge, and without question or notice from them had put it in the only place that she could. The considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>tian for the Implied contract imposing that duty resided in the situation of the plaintiff and her property, for which the defendants were responsible, and in the chance of selling the garment which she had selected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In Wamser v. Browning, King &amp; Co., 187 N. Y. 87, 79 N. E. 861, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 314, it was clearly intimated that the defendant would have been held liable if the clerk had been attending the customer\u2014\u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">\u201cand the clothing had been laid aside by his invitation before his eyes, so that he had an opportunity to watch and care for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">I think that the evidence in this case presented merely a question of fact, and that the decision of the learned trial justice is sustained by the evidence. The evidence as to the value of the watch and pin was sufficient to sustain the award which the court below matie.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs,</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">PAGE, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b674-10\">BIJUR, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aah\">(dissenting). Defendant is a corporation. Plaintiff, accompanied by a lady friend, visited defendant\u2019s shop to purchase a shirt waist. After looking over a number of waists, she selected about a dozen in the general show room. These were carried by the saleslady, who had waited on her, into a small fitting room, into which she was followed by plaintiff and her friend. The fitting room was formed by partitions which separated it from the main room. While the fitting room had in it hooks and a closet, I lay no stress on that point. The fitting room contained also two chairs and a small table.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">Before the plaintiff, her friend, and the saleslady entered the fitting room, plaintiff removed her coat, to which was attached by a gold pin a gold watch. Plaintiff had also removed the watch from her coat, and held it in her hand, when the saleslady ushered her into the fitting-room. She had no conversation about the watch in the fitting room with the saleslady. Nothing was said about it until it was missed. In the fitting room the saleslady told her to place her \u201cthings\u201d on the table while she removed her waist. Plaintiff thereupon laid on the table her watch and coat. I recite these circumstances in full, because to a large extent they seem to me to be determinative of the issue. Plaintiff was asked by her counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-12\">\u201cQ. Was there anything said by the lady who waited upon you after you found the watch was missing? A. Yes. The saleslady had noticed the watch on the table, and gave a description of it. Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I object to that; it is a conclusion. Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Q. What did she say?, A. She said it was a pretty watch, etc. Q. Did she describe it? A. Yes. fc). When was this? A. Just after I missed my watch. * * * Q. She said she had seen the watch, and described it? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">While it may be that technically plaintiff\u2019s statement that the saleslady had seen the watch <em>on the table </em>was not actually stricken out, still, it seems to me to be\u25a0 only fair to treat that statement as having been eliminated. There is no other evidence indicating when the saleslady had noticed plaintiff\u2019s watch, except, perhaps, at the tim\u00e9 when the saleslady first waited on her, when plaintiff testifies that she wore this watch pinned to the outside of her coat. There is not even any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>indication that the watch was laid on the table in such a way as to make it visible to the saleslady in the fitting room; and if any inference is to be drawn, it is rather to the contrary, since the table was a small one, and-plaintiff laid her coat down, and immediately thereafter it was covered by the pile of waists.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After a waist had been selected and fitted by a fitter, who subsequently entered the room, plaintiff put on her coat, but could not find her watch,-and a diligent search made by defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s failed to disclose it. The action is brought for its value, on the theory that defendant, from the nature of its business, invited the plaintiff to remove part of her clothing and to leave it in defendant\u2019s custody, who thus became \u201ca voluntary custodian for profit to itself\u201d (see Bunnell v. Stern, infra), and that it was guilty of negligence in not either providing a safe place or in not otherwise properly guarding the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Plaintiff respondent\u2019s chief reliance is on the case of Bunnell v. Stern, 122 N. Y. 539, 25 N. E. 910, 10 L. R. A. 481, 19 Am. St. Rep. 519. In that case, however, plaintiff\u2019s loss was of her cloak, necessarily removed in trying on cloaks. Had plaintiff\u2019s loss in the case at bar been of her coat, necessarily removed and laid aside in order to try on waists, an entirely different question would be presented. Defendant\u2019s invitation cannot be held to extend to placing into its custody a watch, entirely separated from clothing, and certainly not without special notice, on the facts disclosed in this case. Indeed, plaintiff testified that she handed her bag, containing rings and money, to her friend. It would seem to be altogether reasonable that she should have made the same disposition of her watch. This case is more nearly governed by the reasoning in Powers v. O\u2019Neill, 89 Hun, 129, 34 N. Y. Supp. 1007, where plaintiff laid her purse on a counter in order to try on a hat. For the loss of the purse, defendant was held not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In the case at bar, also, plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in placing a small article of jewelry on a little table covered by her own coat and a pile of shirtwaists. See Powers v. O\u2019Neill, supra. In the case of Wamser v. Browning, King &amp; Co., 187 N. Y. 87, 79 N. E. 861, 10 L. R. A. (N. S.) 314, the defendant was held not liable for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s watch and chain, <em>which remained in his vest; </em>he having laid the vest on a counter, in the absence of defendant\u2019s clerk, in order to try on a new vest. Although it is true that the court there says that, had the vest been laid aside at the invitation of a clerk and in his presence, <em>a different question would have been presenied, </em>the court does not definitely indicate what the answer to the question in that event would have been. But, apart from that, the case is easily distinguishable from the one at bar by an important practical consideration, which I regard as determinative, namely, that, in the Wamser Case, the plaintiff left his watch and chain in the vest. Had the plaintiff in the case at bar left the watch pinned to her coat, it may also be said that a different question would have been presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Had I not reached this conclusion on the main issue, I should be disposed to reverse for insufficient proof of the value of the watch, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the reasons stated by the learned trial judge, who accepted the testimony with the greatest reluctance and doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
