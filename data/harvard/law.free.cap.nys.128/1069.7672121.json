The objection is raised that the court has directed that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue in place of an ordinary order of the court, and that the costs of $50 are burdensome upon the city. Section 1001 of the Greater New York charter provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-5\">\u201cAll damages awarded by the commissioners of estimate and assessment with interest thereon from the date of said report, and all costs and expenses which may be taxed, shall be paid by the city of New York,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">And then it is provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-7\">\u201cThe person or persons to whom awards shall be made in such proceedings, and the person or persons in whose favor costs and expenses may be taxed, shall not have an action at law against the city of New York for such awards, costs, or expenses, but the court in which such proceedings have' been had, upon the application of any such person or persons, in case of the failure of the comptroller of said city to pay the same within thirty days after demand therefor, shall require and direct the comptroller to pay said awards, costs, and expenses from the said fund, and enforce said order or mandate in the same manner as other orders and mandates of said court are enforced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-8\">:[1] There can be no doubt, if there was no other adequate remedy at law, the court would be justified in issuing its writ of peremptory mandamus to compel the comptroller of the city of New York to pay an award out of a fund which had been provided for that particular purpose, without any statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The statute in this case takes away the right to an action at law, and makes it the duty of the court to \u201crequire and direct the comptroller to pay said awards,\u201d without prescribing the form in which the comptroller is to be required or directed to act, except that upon \u201cthe application of any such person or persons\u201d the court is to \u201crequire and direct the comptroller to pay,\u201d and that the court shall \u201cenforce such order or mandate in the same manner as other orders and mandates of said court are enforced.\u201d Subdivision 2 of section 3343 of the Code of Civil Procedure defines a \u201cmandate\u201d as including\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-10\">\u201ca writ, process, or other written direction, issued pursuant to law, out of a court, or made pursuant to law, by a court, or a judge, or a person acting as a judicial officer and commanding a court, board, or other body, or an officer, or other person, named or otherwise designated therein, to do, or to. refrain from doing, an act therein specified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1094-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> And a mandamus is* defined as\u2014.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1094-12\">\u201ca command issuing from a court of law of competent jurisdiction, in the name of the state or sovereign, directed to some inferior court, officer, corporation, or person, requiring them to do some particular thing therein speci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>fled, which appertains to their office or duty.\u201d 19 Am. &amp; Bug. Ency. of Law, 716.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Obviously the duty of the court to \u201crequire and direct the comptroller to pay\u201d is broad enough to authorize the issuing of a mandate, and this is clearly provided for by the statute, and a \u201cmandate,\u201d as defined by the Code of Civil Procedure, is comprehensive enough to include a writ of mandamus; and as the court is set in motion \u201cupon the application of any such person or persons,\u201d and the court is authorized to issue a mandate requiring and directing the comptroller to pay, we know of no good reason why the court should not, upon the application of a person whose money is unlawfully withheld, issue its mandate in the form of a writ of mandamus. The respondent has an absolute lawful right to his money. He has a right to make the application to the court in any form which pleases him, and the court has the right to grant the relief asked for by the issuance of its mandate requiring and directing the comptroller to pay the award. If the costs are more than they would be if the respondent had been content with an order, that is a matter which might have been taken into consideration when the respondent was denied his money, and we are not disposed to put him to further trouble and expense in securing that which belongs to him as a matter of right, because it may be more expensive to the plaintiff than some other method would have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
