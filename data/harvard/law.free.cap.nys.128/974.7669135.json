The evidence shows that the accident occurred at a place remote from the machine upon which plaintiff was employed, and upon an entirely different machine. <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> There is no proof in the case of the time of the service of the notice; but, if we waive that, since that does not seem to have been stated as a ground of objection to its reception in evidence, we think that it is not sufficiently definite as to the place and cause of the injury to entitle plaintiff to the benefits of the employer\u2019s liability act. Welch v. Waterbury &amp; Co., 136 App. Div. 315, 120 N. Y. Supp. 1059; Valentine v. Garvin Machine Co., 139 App. Div. 140, 123 N. Y. Supp. 959. When this case was before this court upon a previous appeal (136 App. Div. 315, 120 N. Y. Supp. 1059), plaintiff\u2019s counsel then asked that the action be treated as one at common law. Thus considered, it was determined that a judgment for plaintiff could not be sustained, because the evidence established that the greasy and slippery condition of the floor of the passageway where plaintiff fell was an obvious risk which he had assumed. So far as the condition of the floor is concerned, and plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the same, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>evidence does not materially differ from that given upon the former trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\">In only two respects does plaintiff\u2019s counsel contend that any difference exists. He claims now, first, that there is evidence in the case, which was not in the case on the former trial, to the effect that the point of the accident was extremely dark, that the gas jet was turned low, and that the skylight above was broken, the window panes having been broken out, and that bagging and burlap had been placed in the skylight windows at least a month before, in order to exclude the elements ; second, that there was evidence offered to show that in other factories, prior to the time of the happening of the' accident, where strand machines, or machines similar to the one in which the plaintiff was caught, were used, a drip pan or oil cup was used to catch the oil, and thus prevent it from flowing out on the floor near the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to \"the latter, if we concede that the evidence establishes all that counsel claims that it does, it does not meet the principal difficulty which was considered fatal upon the former appeal. Plaintiff knew of the absence of these drip pans and oil cups, and that by reason thereof oil spurted out from the machines during all of the time that he was employed in defendant\u2019s factory and working on these machines, which was for a period of mor\u00e9 than a year. If the omission to have these cups or pans was a defect in the machine, it was one patent and obvious to. plaintiff, the effect of the omission was perfectly well known to him, and he must be deemed to have assumed the risk consequent upon the use of the machines and the passageways adjoining them in that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> So with regard to the claim that the passageway down which he was passing when he was hurt was dimly lighted. It appeared that this passageway was lighted in part by gas jets and in part by a skylight. About a month before the accident, as testified to by one of the witnesses for plaintiff, one or more panes of glass had been broken out from the skylight, and he had placed tar paper there. Plaintiff had passed through this passageway at least twice a day during all the time that he was employed in defendant\u2019s factory. As it was open to the observation of every one, he must have observed it, or be chargeable with the consequences of his omission to observe the same. With regard to the artificial light, there is no claim that the gas was burning less brightly on the day of the accident than was usually the case. As the principal witness for plaintiff said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cThe light was always turned down there, so that it was about the same light for two months before the accident as it was at the time of the accident. * * * That was the condition the gas was each day\u2014it had to be \u2014during all the time that I worked there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Following, therefore, the rule laid down when this case was previously before this court, we must hold that whatever risks there were arising out of this condition were obvious and known to the plaintiff, that he assumed the same, and for that reason is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">JENKS, P. and THOMAS and CARR, JJ\u201e concur.
