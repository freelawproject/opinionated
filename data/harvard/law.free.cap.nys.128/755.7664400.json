We are also of opinion that the affidavits show that the appellant was in effect peddling lager beer and whisky in the town of Olive, which had voted no license, and that upon the merits the order should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">The injunction order is too broad, however, and might be construed to prohibit the appellant from selling to any person who resided in the town of Olive any intoxicating liquors at his place of business in the city of Kingston and delivering the same to such person. What subdivision \u201ck,\u201d \u00a7 30, of the liquor tax law (Consol. Laws, c. 34) prohibits is the soliciting, accepting, or procuring, in a town in which a liquor tax certificate is prohibited, an order to deliver intoxicating liquors. It does not prohibit the selling of liquor to a person who chances to reside in such a town, if the transaction is had outside the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">The injunction order should be modified, by inserting after the words \u201csoliciting, procuring, or accepting\u201d the words \u201cin the town of Olive, Ulster county, N. Y.,\u201d and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
