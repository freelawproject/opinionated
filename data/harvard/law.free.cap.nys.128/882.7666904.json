The testimony adduced by the petitioner was that of several special agents of the excise department and of some-policemen. The former testified to occurrences which they had observed on divers occasions during the months of February, March, and April, 1910, and the policemen testified to the character of certain women whom they had seen on the premises. The learned justice at Special Term, before whom the application was heard, accepted the testimony of the petitioner\u2019s witnesses as \u201csubstantially true,\u201d but considered that their evidence fell \u201cfar short of establishing that acts of disorder were so general as to warrant a finding that the premises were disorderly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">We agree with him in accepting the evidence of the petitioner\u2019s witnesses, for there is nothing in the case to discredit them; but we cannot concur in his conclusion that such evidence is insufficient to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>tablish the allegations of the petition. The evidence is of such a character that decency forbids any attempt even to summarize it. It is sufficient to say that it shows that the premises, which were under the management of an ex-prize fighter, were the resort of professed prostitutes, who plied their arts of invitation and seduction, in the frankest and most disgusting manner, under the very eyes of the employ\u00e9s of the place, who made no attempt to interpose restraint or reproof. A portion of the premises was filled up with partly inclosed booths or cubicles, well designed to lend themselves to the disorderly practices of the habitu\u00e9s of the place, and which were apparently freely used for such purposes. In the face of such evidence as this, it is of little moment that some apparently respectable people also, at times, resorted to the premises, or that some policemen who had occasion to visit the place never happened to see anything disorderly, or that the manager and his employ\u00e9s testified that, they had never observed any indelicate or improper actions on the part of any patrons. If the latter did not see, it could only have been because they would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Of course, we are not influenced by the absurd suggestion, so often made in cases like the present, that this place was no worse than any other hotel, restaurant, or other place of public resort, because the best of such places, no matter how carefully managed, may at times be visited by immoral persons. That is true, of course; but it is not true that such places would permit avowed prostitutes to openly ply their trade therein, which is precisely what was allowed in the present case. If such practices as were permitted in this place were permitted in any other, the liquor tax license of that other ought equally to be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the prayer of the petitioner granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
