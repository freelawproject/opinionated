The action is brought under section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiff alleged and proved that one Grow was an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-23\">\u201cPursuant to an order duly made and entered by a justice of the Supreme Court, New York county, on the 12th day of March, 1910, an execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>* * * was duly issued out of the Supreme Court, New York county, in favor of the plaintiffs, * * * and * * * on the 21st day of March, 1910, said sheriff duly presented said execution to the Harlem Construction Company, the defendant herein:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The plaintiff also proved that the defendant failed to pay the prescribed percentage of the wages of its employ\u00e9 to the officer presenting said execution to it. No proof was offered to show that a judgment had been recovered against the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9, or that an execution upon said judgment had been returned wholly or partly unsatisfied. The appellant contends that, in the absence of such proof, the plaintiff failed to establish a cause of action under the statute referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It was necessary, before such an execution as is contemplated by the statute could be \u201cpresented\u201d to the defendant, that judgment against the employ\u00e9 should have been recovered, and that execution thereon should have issued and been returned wholly or partly unsatisfied. That these steps are essential prerequisites to the making of an order providing that execution shall issue against the wages or salary, etc., of the judgment debtor,' is evident from the provision of section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The answer of the defendant admits the fact that, pursuant to an order duly made and entered, the execution against the wages of said Grow was \u201cduly\u201d issued out of the Supreme Court, and that the sheriff \u201cduly\u201d presented said execution to the defendant. <bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The word \u201cduly\u201d has frequently been defined as meaning according to law\u2014\u201cthat is, according to the statute governing the subject\u2014and implies the existence of every fact essential to perfect regularity of procedure.\u201d Brownell v. Town of Greenwich, 114 N. Y. 518, 527, 22 N. E. 24, <em>26, 4 L. </em>R. A. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Interpreting the word \u201cduly\u201d in the sense in which it has been judicially defined, we think that the complaint stated a cause of action against the defendant, and that the admissions by the defendant that the execution was \u201cduly\u201d issued and \u201cduly\u201d presented left it without any defense to this action, and that the learned court below properly granted judgment in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
