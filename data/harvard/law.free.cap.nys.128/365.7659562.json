In other words, did he plead disobedience, and justify it upon the ground that another more urgent duty compelled refusal? The consequences to the relator are so serious that the doubt should be resolved in his favor. It should appear with reasonable clearness whether the conflict of duties actually existed, if so, how long the relator was constrained to disobey, whether thereafter an. opportunity to obey occurred, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>whether the relator then showed by his actions a disposition to obey the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The determination should be annulled, with $50 costs and disbursements, and relator reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">JENKS, P.
