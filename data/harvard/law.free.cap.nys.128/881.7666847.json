He had left his horses standing by the curb in one of the defendant\u2019s streets, and in undertaking to get upon the seat on his return, he had started up the team just as, or before, he had succeeded in doing so. The horses had taken but a few steps, when the wagon wheels passed over an uneven surface, and he fell, or was thrown off, presumably because of the jolt of the wagon. The defect complained of is described as an uneven, convex surface, three feet wide, six or seven feet long across the street, and six or seven inches at the highest point above the natural level of the street. An opening had evidently been made in the pavement and carelessly filled up; the paving blocks being thrown back indiscriminately and not put back in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">It may be assumed that the defendant was negligent, but the evidence falls short of proving freedom from contributory negligence on the part of the said intestate. Any uneven surface might cause a jolt sufficient to throw a person from the high seat of a brewery wagon such as is commonly observed on the streets, and a person in that posi-tian needs to be attentive and firmly in his seat. According to the evidence of the only witness for the plaintiff who saw the accident, it is doubtful whether the deceased was securely seated before he started the team. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-16\">\u201cThe man was seated; partly seated. * * * He had fully gotten into the seat, and was leaning forward.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">According to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, he fell off while attempting to gain the seat. At any rate, it is not likely that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>would have fallen if securely in his seat and attentive to where he was driving, and it cannot be assumed, in the absence of proof, that he was exercising proper care.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
