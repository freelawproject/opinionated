Wellington and Benjamin W. Wellington, to recover the sum of $764.26, the money represented by a certificate of deposit dated June 6, 1906, issued by Q. W. Wellington &amp; Co.\u2019s Bank, of Corning, N. Y. The defendant claiming the money, he was substituted as defendant, and the money was brought into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Johanna Cronin died September 12, 1906, leaving a will wherein she gave all of her personal property to the plaintiff, her sister, subject to the payment of the income to the defendant during life, and appointed her the executrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">It appeared upon the trial that on the 25th day of April, 1900, the defendant deposited $300 in Q. W. Wellington <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s Bank, to the credit of Johanna Cronin, his wife, and received a certificate of deposit for that sum, which recited that Johanna Cronin had deposited three hundred dollars, payable on return of the certificate properly indorsed; that each year, thereafter down to the year 1906, the wife indorsed the certificate taken the year before, and the defendant surrendered it to the bank and took out a new certificate for the amount and the interest and other like deposits, to the credit of his wife, so that, the certificate issued on the 6th day of June, 1906, was for the sum of $764.26.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">The.defendant testified that each year he took the certificate home and put it in a drawer, of which he had a key, and where he kept all his other papers \u25a0 and accounts, and that it remained there until he took it back at the end of the year to exchange it for another; that when he put the certificate of June 6, 1906, in the drawer he put the key in his pocket and did not take the certificate out of the drawer until after the death of his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">It also appeared that the defendant had done considerable business at the bank, that he had made several other deposits, and the certificates of deposit had been issued to him in his own name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">The plaintiff, the executrix and principal legatee, was called as a witness on the trial in her own behalf and gave evidence concerning a transaction between the deceased and the defendant. The defendant gave evidence in his own behalf, under section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure, concerning the same transaction testified to by the plaintiff. His narrative of the transaction is substantially that he told his wife that the note was due in Wellington\u2019s Bank and he wanted to get it renewed to keep it up to date and that he did not find the key where he kept it; that the deceased said \u201cIf you will put it in my name, if you will I will give you the key and you can have that note if you will put it in my name, but I know\u201d she says \u201cthe money is yours\u201d she said \u201cand your earnings.\u201d He also testified that she said that she would feel more satisfied and better and it would make her mind easy if he would put it in her name, \u201cBut I know the money is yours\u201d ; that he said that he knew she was sick and \u201cI don\u2019t want your mind to be uneasy,\u201d I said, \u201cbut you know the money is mine; I will fix it that way to please you.\u201d He said that he then went to the drawer and took out the certificate, asked the plaintiff to sign his wife\u2019s name to it and went up to the bank with it, and that before he surrendered it and received the certificate in question, he had a conversation with Mr. Baton, the cashier. The defendant was then asked \u201cWhat was the conversation?\u201d This was objected to by' plaintiff\u2019s counsel, excluded by the court and the defendant excepted. The defendant was also asked: \u201cWhen you deposited this money ip the bank in your wife's name and took the certificate home and put it in the drawer where you kept your papers, did you intend that as a gift to anybody?\u201d This was objected to by the plaintiff and excluded by the court, and an exception was taken to the ruling. The court also refused to permit the defendant to testify to the talk had with the people at the bank in April, 1900, when he deposited the $300 to the credit of his wife and received the first certificate of deposit.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b448-9\">Argued before SMITH, P.

This evidence was clearly competent upon the question whether the sum deposited became an accomplished gift. In considering this issue of fact, the jury also had the right to know what the defendant said at the time he made the last as well as the first deposit, for the purpose and intention attending the original transaction followed all the subsequent deposits. What the defendant said at the time of making the deposit if it bore on the character of the deposit made was one of the attending circumstances by which the jury could determine whether he intended at that time, and by th,e act of deposit, to give the money to her. In the case of Mabie v. Bailey, 95 N. Y. 206, Judge Andrews, in discussing the question whether surrounding circumstances may not be shown to vary or explain the character of a deposit and the intent with which it was made, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u201cIf it was now necessary to decide that point, I should incline to the opinion that the character of such a transaction, as creating a trust, is not conclusively established by the mere fact oE the deposit so as to preclude evidence of contemporaneous facts and circumstances constituting res gestas to show that the real motive of the depositor was not to create a trust, but to accomplish some independent and different purpose inconsistent with an intention to divest himself of the beneficial ownership of the fund.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In Cunningham v. Davenport, 147 N. Y. 43, 41 N. E. 412, 33 L.R. A. 373, 49 Am. St. Rep. 641, the scope of this decision was that evidence of contemporaneous facts and circumstances is admissible to explain the depositor\u2019s intent, and I have found no decision in conflict with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We also think that the court erred in excluding the testimony of the defendant as to whether he intended to make a gift when he deposited the money in the bank in his wife\u2019s name. We see no reason why he was precluded from testifying to that fact. It cannot be doubted that this testimony bears directly upon this issue in the case. It was an important, if not the controlling, factor in rebutting the presumption arising from the form of the deposit. If the defendant intended by the act of depositing the money to make a gift, it then becomes complete. But, if the deposit was to the credit of the wife for reasons connected with taxation, the rules of the bank limiting the amount which any one individual may keep on deposit, a desire to conceal from others knowledge of his pecuniary condition, the gift was not an accomplished fact. Beaver v. Beaver, 117 N. Y. 421, 22 N. E. 940, 6 L. R. A. 403, 15 Am. St. Rep. 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Our conclusion, therefore, is that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, except SMITH, P. J., dissenting in memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b449-9\">SMITH, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM_\">(dissenting). I agree if the gift be claimed from the simple fact of the form of the deposit that it would be competent to show what was said at the time that the deposit was made. Inasmuch, however, as the deposit was made in pursuance of an agreement theretofore made with his wife to put the certificate in her name, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>it does not seem to me right that this man after having made that agreement can alter its effect by any declarations made at the time that he made the deposit not in the presence of his wife. Suppose in pursuance of a contract between a man and his wife the man had deposited in her name in the bank $1,000, could he after her death claim that the $1,000 was his because when he deposited the moneys he had told the cashier that the moneys were put in his wife\u2019s name to avoid taxation for instance, or for any other specific purpose? It seems to me rank hearsay. For whatever purpose he made the agreement to take the certificate in her name, he made it for the purpose of getting possession of another certificate which was already in her name, and she had the right to assume when the new certificate was brought back in her name that her title was not impaired by some declaration her husband might have made at the time he deposited the money and took out the certificate not in her presence. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
