J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abte\">I am unable to find any legal contract by the defendant to deliver to the plaintiff the cider press under the terms stated in the paper of the 28th of August. It seems to me clear that that paper was simply an order for the press, subject to acceptance by the defendant at Syracuse, and does not purport to be a contract by which the defendant agreed to deliver the press upon the terms therein written. The paper is addressed to the defendant at Syracuse. It \u201cauthorizes and requests\u201d the defendant to ship to the plaintiff this cider press upon the terms named. So far the paper does not purport to state any contract, but is an unequivocal order, which is subject to acceptance thereafter by the defendant. Defendant claims, however, that the whole purport of the paper \u2022 is changed from an order into a contract by the words in the lower left-hand corner, \u201cSold by Geo. H. Schlegel.\u201d The words \u201cSold by\u201d as there used are part of the printed form. It is inconceivable that the defendant intended by this single line to change the whole legal import of the paper from what without it would be a distinctive order into a binding contract. It seems to me the undoubted significance of that phrase is simply to designate the salesman who negotiated the order for the defendant\u2019s purposes only. The paper does not purport to be signed by the. defendant, nor by any one in their behalf, and whatever significance would otherwise be attached to the words \u201cSold by,\u201d as there used, is completely controlled by the rest of the paper, which constitutes simply an order, without any binding obligation on the defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">And this construction accords with commercial usage. Ordinary salesmen are not usually given authority to make binding contracts. Tbe contract in question illustrates the danger of such authority. The cider press was not to be paid for until the press was set up and making cider. If an ordinary salesman were allowed to make a binding contract of such a nature with a plaintiff of doubtful responsibility, no manufacturing corporation could long survive such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Plaintiff further contends that, even if the paper of August 28th did not constitute a contract, the defendant\u2019s reply of August 30th constitutes an acceptance of the order. In the postal card of August 30th the defendant notified the plaintiff that the order was received \u201cand will have our best attention.\u201d It would hardly seem to need authority for the proposition that this communication did not constitute an acceptance of the order. The acceptance of an order requires consideration, not only of the terms of the order, but of the responsibility of the party to whom credit is given. The only obligation expressed in that communication was the obligation to give prompt consideration, for the purpose.of ultimately determining whether or not the order should be accepted. A precisely parallel question arose in the case of Manier v. Appling, 112 Ala. <em>663, </em>20 South 978. In that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>case the defendants had received an order, to which it was responded: \u201cThe same shall have prompt attention.\u201d It was there held that this response could in no sense be deemed an acceptance of the order, and the conclusion is there sustained with convincing reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">If these conclusions be correct, it is unnecessary to consider the claimed error on the part of the trial court in refusing to allow evidence to show that the agent, Schlegel, had no authority to make a binding contract, or the claim of the plaintiff that the form of the card which the agent presented was a representation by the company that he had such authority. Nor is it necessary to consider whether the damages proved were properly allowed by the trial court over the objection of the defendant that they had not been pleaded. Those questions are immaterial, if, as we view it, the defendant has never obligated itself to furnish the cider press to the plaintiff under any conditions. The judgment and order must therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
