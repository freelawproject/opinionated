The affidavit was made in the alternative, and did not allege that either of said facts existed. Collins v. Beebe, 54 Hun, 318, 7 N. Y. Supp. 442; Tifft v. Tifft, 4 Denio, 175, 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-16\">This question was not, perhaps, fully raised by the motion of the defendant to vacate the order; but we are of the opinion that, a receiver having been appointed in the action, a judgment creditor could not properly be permitted to go into an examination of a third party, for the reason that upon the appointment of the receiver the title to all of the judgment debtor\u2019s personal property vested in the receiver, as well that which he possessed as that which might be in the hands of third persons. Moore v. Taylor, 40 Hun, 56, 57. If there is property in the hands of third persons belonging to the judgment debtor, that can now be reduced to possession only by the receiver, and to continue an order for the examination of a third party under such circumstances would be entirely futile. If property was found, it would belong to the receiver, to be paid out upon the order of the court, and could only go to the judgment creditor under such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-17\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the original order vacated, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
