There was concededly a violation on record against the premises for lack of a water tank on the roof called for by the contract, to meet which plaintiff offered a letter from the department stating that an inspector had reported that the water supply was sufficient without a roof tank, and that the department would \u201capprove the amendment of June 20, 1910, to omit the tank.\u201d <em>Held </em>insufficient to show satisfaction- of the department; there being no showing that the amendment referred to did not require a substitute for the tank, or that it had ever been complied with.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b761-15\">[Ed.

The defendants claim that under plaintiff\u2019s pleading he cannot show substantial performance, but must be held to proof of strict performance. This contention is not tenable. The plaintiff is claiming under a contract. The contract itself provides that the plaintiff shall perform \u201call work according to plans and specifications; it being agreed by the owners that substantial performance of the contract shall be satisfactory to them if satisfactory to departments and architects.\u201d The plaintiff is therefore entitled to payment under the contract itself upon proof that he has substantially performed to the satisfaction of the municipal departments and the architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In my opinion the plaintiff has failed to furnish such proof. The plaintiff has apparently failed to perform the contract in several minor details, but the omission of these details is perhaps insufficient to prevent a recovery under the contract. He has, however, omitted totally to furnish and set a 1,400-gallon tank on the roof as required by the specifications. The cost of this tank is $94, and apparently the cost of setting it in place would be $149. The plaintiff claims that he originally offered to do the work for $2,100, and the owners asked him whether it could not' be done cheaper. Plaintiff then suggested that the tank be omitted, and one of the defendants said: \u201cIf the department is satisfied, I will be satisfied.\u201d If this evidence was admitted to show that the parties intended to strike out the provision for a tank in the specifications, it is, of course, incompetent. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If competent for any purpose, it can be considered only for the purpose of aiding the court in construing the words \u201csubstantial performance,\" and enabling the court to hold that these words covered a performance of the work, even though this item of the specifications were omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The plaintiff must still, however, prove as part of his case that the architect and the building department were satisfied as required by the contract in case of substantial performance. He has proven that the architect, who is confessedly unfriendly to the defendants, is satisfied, but there is.no dispute that there is a violation on record against the premises on account of the omission. To meet this proof, the plaintiff has introduced in evidence a letter purporting to be from the tenement house department, which states \u201cthat the inspector reports that the water supply is adequate without a roof tank and the department will therefore approve the amendment of June 20th, 1910, to omit the tank.\u201d Aside from the technical objection that the signature of the commissioner is unproven, the letter is valueless, since it does not show that the amendment of June 20, 1910, required no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>substitute for the tank, nor that the amendment has been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Without first showing that he was acquainted with the rules and regulations of the building department, the architect was permitted to testify that it was contrary to the custom of the building^ department to remove a violation until all the specifications of the violation have been complied with, and that the violation against these premises contains other specifications besides the omission of the tank. This testimony, even if the proper foundation had been laid, is entirely nugatory in view of the fact that defendants\u2019 attorney thereafter stated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201cI have the witness from the building department. I could probably get a concession that that violation that I have offered in evidence is still open, and that the case has been sent to the corporation counsel for attention. The building violation as to there being no tank. That there is a violation against these premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">After some discussion between the attorneys, the defendants\u2019 attorney then stated without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\">\u201cIt is conceded that the violation is still a record in the building department, and it has been referred to the corporation counsel. I want to show that the case is in the hands of the corporation counsel to enforce the penalty against our clients because that has been omitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The court thereupon said: \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> The plaintiff\u2019s attorney claims that in any event the defendants have admitted that the job is complete and accepted by making a payment of $500 which under the terms of the contract was to become due only \u201cwhen the job is complete and accepted.\u201d The defendants, however, claim that this payment was made under protest, and upon plaintiff\u2019s promise to remedy all the defects. In any event, however, the contract itself provides that for all payments the certificate shall be obtained from and signed by the architect\" to the effect that under the terms of the contract the payments are properly due; \u201csaid certificate in no way lessening the full and final responsibility of the contractor.\u201d Even if the payment of the $500 is to be regarded in some sense as an admission that the work was completed, the admission was not conclusive and is overcome by the proof that the plaintiff had not in fact completed his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">It follows that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
