The only witness called for plaintiff was Fanny Kowal, his wife, who testified that at the request \u00f3f defendants 'she loaned them money which belonged to her husband, the plaintiff, in this action. Although there was no evidence of ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>press authority on his part to make such loan, if the act was unauthorized, he might ratify it; and the bringing of this action may be deemed some evidence of ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">It appeared that, some three months before this action was brought, another action was brought in the name of the witness Fanny Kowal to recover the same money, and in that action, after a trial upon the merits, judgment was rendered dismissing the complaint. The witness was asked on cross-examination whether in that suit she did not' testify that the money which was loaned belonged to her. She denied it, and asserted that she then testified that it belonged to her husband, as she did upon this occasion. At the close of her evidence the trial judge dismissed the complaint, upon the ground that the judgment in the former action was res ad judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In this we think he erred. A judgment is not conclusive in a second action merely because the same question was at issue in a former action before a court of competent jurisdiction. The subsequent action must be between the same parties or their privies. Reynolds v. \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co., 160 N. Y. 635, 55 N. E. 305; Collins v. Hydorn, 135 N. Y. 320, 32 N. E. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> This action was not between the same parties as the former one, nor does the .plaintiff in this action claim under the plaintiff in the former action. It is quite possible that judgment was rendered for the defendant in the former action because it appeared that the plaintiff therein was not the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">In any event, as the evidence stands, that judgment was not conclusive, and the judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
