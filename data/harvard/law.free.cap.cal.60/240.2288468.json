D. 1880, the defendant appearing by its attorneys, T. W. W. Davies and Frank Owen, and the plaintiff by his attorneys, Messrs. Reddy, Gorham, and Parker, (a jury having been regularly impaneled to try the above entitled cause on the afternoon of the previous day,) the defendant, by its counsel, moved the Court for leave to file an additional pleading, averring and alleging that since the last trial of this cause there had been a full and final settlement of all matters embraced in this cause, and set forth in plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint; and that a full release and satisfaction had been made and delivered by said plaintiff to this defendant. Counsel for defendant also stated to the Court that he should have been in attendance on the Court on the previous day, but was unavoidably prevented by reason of interruption of travel; that no one of defendant\u2019s counsel who had actively participated in the former trials of this cause was present, having been notified by defendant that said cause was settled, and that they would not be required further; that Frank Owen, attorney for defendant, having been but slightly connected with the former trials, and knowing that John R. Kittrell and T. W. W. Davies, leading attorneys of the defendant, would be present on the morning of the seventh April, had not felt it his duty to assume the responsibility of pleading said release, and that said Owen, attorney for defendant, was fully advised, before the impaneling of the jury, of the existence of said alleged release, and the Court was not advised of any alleged settlement until now, the second day of trial and after the impaneling of the jury; and that said release had been obtained, and all the negotiations concerning the same had been had, without any participation or knowledge of the same by any attorney of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">Said additional pleading, which defendant moved for leave to make, was in writing, and submitted to the inspection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the Court, and a copy of the same was furnished to plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, and is in words and figures as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">\u201cExhibit \u2018B.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">\u201cNow comes the above named defendant, by its attorneys, T.

By mutual agreement of parties the cause was set down for trial on the sixth day of April, 1880, and a venire of sixty jurors ordered by the Court. On said sixth day of April the plaintiff appeared by his attorneys, and the defendant by one of its attorneys, Frank Owen, Esq. The case being called, the parties proceeded to impanel a jury of twelve men; the jury was duly sworn to try the cause. The hour being late, the Court adjourned until the next morning at ten o\u2019clock. On the assembling of the Court the jury answered to their names and took their seats in the jury box, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney opened his case to the jury, after which and for the first time defendant\u2019s attorneys, and without any previous notice thereof, asked leave of the Court to file an amended answer, setting forth full accord and satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s demand. At this point of the proceedings, all the attorneys for the defendant present disclaimed all knowledge or participation in the settlement purported to have been had between plaintiff and defendant, and that such knowledge came to them after said settlement. Frank Owen, Esq., one of the attorneys for the defendant, stated that he had knowledge of the settlement before the impaneling of the jury; that is, that he had been informed that such settlement had been made, but after the making of such settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-9\">It further appears that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys were ignorant of the settlement until the second day after impaneling the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>jury, and claim that they were taken completely by surprise up to the motion to file said amended answer. The Court had no knowledge that any settlement had taken place between plaintiff and defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-4\">After argument <em>pro </em>and <em>con, </em>the Court overruled the motion to file said amended answer, to which ruling counsel for defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">On presenting the motion to amend the answer and on statement of the facts that said settlement had been made without the knowledge of the attorneys for plaintiff and defendants, General Kittrell, one of the principal attorneys for defendant, addressed the Court, and said that the course pm-sued by the parties in making the settlement without the knowledge of the attorneys was not warranted in the honorable practice of law; denounced in strong language the alleged settlement, and the manner in which it was brought before the Court; asked leave to withdraw as an attorney from the case, and that his name no longer appear as an attorney therein, which was granted. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney then proceeded to introduce his evidence in support of plaintiff\u2019s action. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony defendant\u2019s attorney stated his case to the jury, and that he relied upon contributory negligence as a defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">That before proceeding to examine the witnesses for defendant, defendant\u2019s attorney moved the Court for leave to file a supplemental answer, setting forth a payment by defendant to plaintiff, of a certain sum of money, in full satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s demand against defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-7\">This motion the Court refused, for the following reasons, to wit: Because it appears that the pretended settlement was made on- the 29th day of March, 1880, and that the same was kept a profound secret from the Court and from plaintiff s attorneys. That jury was permitted to be impaneled before any such settlement was made known to the Court. That said pretended settlement does not come before the Court with that fairness and honesty that should characterize proceedings in Courts of justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">This Court is of the opinion that such practice is reprehensible, and not to be tolerated. That the manner in which said pretended settlement was brought before the Court can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>not be regarded in any other light than that of trifling with the Court. The plaintiff in the case having disappeared from the country, the Court has no knowledge in what manner or by what means, whether just or unjust, said pretended settlement was brought about.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-4\">The fact that said pretended settlement was kept a secret from the attorneys for both parties, at the time of the making thereof, and from the knowledge of the Court, until after the impaneling of the jury, taints said settlement with grave suspicions of the fairness and integrity of said pretended settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">R M.

Even if the affidavits strongly preponderate against the truth of the pleading, the Court leaves the fact to be tried as an issue in the case, and will not determine the matter by the unsatisfactory method of <em>ex parte </em>affidavits.\u201d <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Peer, </em>4 Conn. 418.) \" <em>When the foots sought to be pleaded in a supplemental answer amount to an entire satisfaction of the cause of action, a/nd if established, would utterly extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s right to prosecute it, it is the duty of the Court to allow the motion, (the word may, in such a case, means </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>must,) and it will make no difference whether the application be made at the earliest day or not.\u201d (Draught </em>v. <em>Curtiss &amp; Park, </em>8 How.

J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The plaintiff brought this action in the late District Court of Mono County to recover damages for injuries sustained by him through the alleged carelessness of an employee of the defendant. The case was set down for trial on the sixth day of April, 1880, and on that day the plaintiff appeared by his attorneys and the defendant by Frank Owens, one of its attorneys, and the parties proceeded to impanel a jury to try the case. The Court then adjourned until the following day. At the opening of the Court on the morning of the seventh day of April, the defendant, by its counsel, moved- the Court \u201c for leave to file an additional pleading,\u201d averring and alleging \u201c that since the last trial of this cause there had been a full and final settlement of all matters embraced in this cause, and set forth in plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint; and that a full release and satisfaction had been made and delivered by said plaintiff to this defendant. Counsel for the defendant also stated to the Court that he should have been in attendance on the Court on the previous day, but was unavoidably prevented by interruption in travel; that no one of the defendant\u2019s counsel who had actually participated in the former trials of this cause was present, having been notified by the defendant that said cause was settled, and that they would not be required further; that Frank Owens, attorney for defendant, having been but slightly connected with the former trials, and knowing that John R. Kittrell and T. W. W. Davies, leading attorneys of the defendant, would be present on the morning of the seventh of April, had not felt it his duty to assume the responsibility of pleading said release, and that said Owens, attorney for defendant, was fully advised before the impaneling of the jury of said release; and the Court was not advised of any alleged settlement until now, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>second day of trial and after the impaneling of the jury; and that said release had been obtained, and all the negotiations concerning the same had been had, without any participation or knowledge of the same by any attorney of defendant. That after argument the Court overruled and denied defendant\u2019s motion, said motion being objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, to which ruling of the Court the defendant, by its counsel, then and there duly excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">On the following day after the plaintiff\u2019s case was closed the defendant\u2019s counsel renewed his motion for leave to file a supplemental answer, which motion was again denied by the Court. The supplemental answer was submitted to the Court, a copy thereof was served upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys and profert was made of the release. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the following reasons were given therefor by the Court: \u201cBecause it appears that the pretended settlement was made on the twenty-ninth day of March, 1880, and that the same was kept a profound secret from the Court and from plaintiff\u2019s attorneys. That a jury was permitted to be impaneled before any such settlement was made known to the Court. That said pretended settlement does not come before the Court with that fairness and honesty that should characterize proceedings in courts of justice. This Court is of the opinion that such practice is reprehensible, and not to be tolerated. That the manner in which said pretended settlement was brought before the Court cannot be regarded in any other light than that of trifling with the Court. The plaintiff in the case having disappeared from, the country, the Court has no knowledge in what manner or by what means, whether just or unjust, said pretended settlement was brought about. The fact that said pretended settlement was kept a secret from the attorneys for both parties, at the time of the making thereof, and, from the knowledge of the Court, until after the impaneling of the jury, taints said settlement with grave suspicions of the fairness and integrity of said pretended settlement.\u201d The defendant offered in evidence the release, and proof of the execution thereof, together with the proceedings of the Board of Trustees of the defendant, all of which papers were objected to and excluded by the Court. On this appeal, the action of the Court in refusing to allow the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>file a supplemental answer, is assigned as error, and we are asked to reverse the judgment because there was an abuse of judicial discretion in the ruling of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">By Section 464 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that \u201cthe plaintiff and defendant, respectively, may be allowed, on motion, to make a supplemental complaint or answer, alleging facts material to the case, occurring after the former complaint or answer.\u201d In the case of <em>Hoarding </em>v. <em>Minear, </em>54 Cal., 502, Department One of this Court held that \u201cthe right to file a supplemental answer is not an absolute and positive right, but is made to depend on the leave of the Court in the exercise of a legal discretion. And, say the Appellate Court of New York, the Court must grant leave unless the motion papers show a case in which the Court may exercise a discretion as to granting or withholding leave. * * The application may be refused, if the new defense, although legal, is inequitable.\u201d <em>(Medbury </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>46 N. Y.,200; <em>Holyoke </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>59 Id. 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In the case of <em>Medbury </em>v. <em>Swan, supra, </em>there was a delay of more than a year in the application to set up a discharge by supplemental answer, and the Court of Appeals held that such application was addressed to the discretion of the Court below. It was further held in that case, that no appeal would lie from the action of the Court on such a motion. But in the latter case of <em>Holyoke </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>59 N. Y., 233? the language of the case in 46 N. Y. is explained, and it is there stated \u201cthat generally, a defendant has a right to set up by supplemental answer matter of defense which has occurred or come to his knowledge subsequently to the putting in of his first answer, but that he must apply to the Court by motion for leave so to do, so that the opposite party may be heard, and the Court may determine whether there has been inexcusable <em>laches, </em>or whether any of the reasons appear which are recognized as giving authority for denying the exercise of the general right in this particular instance. And the Court must grant leave unless the motion papers show a case in which the Court may exercise a discretion as to granting or withholding leave. It is claimed that <em>Med-bury </em>v. <em>Swan, </em>46 N. Y., 200, is in conflict with this. There may be expressions there which, if separated from the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>text and from the facts of the case, are susceptible of such interpretation. It is said that \u2018the right to allege new matter by supplemental pleading is not an absolute and positive right, but is made to depend upon the leave of the Court in the exercise of a legal discretion.\u2019 This statement alone would be in conflict with what is now said. But the next sentence in that case explains and limits that which has just been quoted, to wit: \u2018The application may be refused, if the new defense, although strictly legal, is inequitable, or if the application is not made with reasonable diligence. A party may waive his right altogether, or lose it by <em>laches.\u2019 </em>What is meant in <em>Medbury </em>v. <em>Swan\u2014and, </em>I think, what is there expressed, when the case is taken altogether\u2014is that there is no such absolute, unrestrainable right to plead by a supplemental answer matter newly arisen as that the Court may not control the exercise of the right within the limits which have been long established, by refusing leave thus to answer when long delay has intervened, or fraud is shown, or injustice will be wrought by allowing the new defense. That was a case presenting the question of <em>laches. </em>The motion there was denied below upon the ground that <em>laches </em>existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">In the case of <em>Drought </em>v. <em>Curtiss &amp; Park, </em>8 How. Pr. 56, the Supreme Court of Hew York held, \u201cWhen the facts asked to be incorporated and pleaded in a supplemental answer, go to divest the plaintiff of the right to maintain the action, and transfer the cause of action to another, who has received satisfaction for the demand involved in it, it is the duty of the Court to grant the motion. The word <em>may, </em>in such a case, means <em>must; </em>and it will make no difference whether the motion be made at the earliest day or not. The facts amount to an entire <em>satisfaction </em>of the cause of action, and whenever pleaded and established, they utterly extinguish the plaintiff\u2019s right to prosecute it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The above case is a very strong one, and it is not necessary for us to hold that the word <em>may </em>means <em>must, </em>as was held by the Supreme Court of Hew York. We have no decision in this State which covers the case now in hand; but under the section of the Code (473) relating to amendments of pleadings, it is provided that \u201c the Court <em>may, </em>in furtherance of justice, and on such terms as may be just allow a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>amend any pleading,\u201d etc. The case of <em>Kirstein </em>v. <em>Madden, </em>38 Cal. 158, presented for review the action of the District Court in denying a motion for leave to amend an answer pending a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and it was there held that the Court below erred in denying leave to amend. The judgment was for that reason reversed. The above case illustrates the proposition that an abuse of <em>legal (discretion, </em>vested by the Code in the Court below, is a proper matter of review in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">This brings us to a consideration of the facts presented in the case now before us. The trial of the case commenced on the sixth of April, and a jury was impaneled on that day. The defendant was represented by Mr. Owens, a junior counsel in the case, and Mr. Davies, the senior and leading counsel for defendant, was on his way from Carson City, his place of residence, to Bridgeport, the county seat of Mono County, to attend the trial and take charge of the defense. He started in time to reach Bridgeport before the trial commenced, but was prevented from reaching his destination until the following morning by reason of interruption in the travel. As it was, he traveled all night, and was present at the opening of the Court on the following day. At that time and before any evidence was taken in the case, Mr. Davies moved for leave to file a supplemental pleading, with a view to bring before the Court, and put in issue in the case, the release, which it was claimed, had been executed by the plaintiff to the defendant. The Court refused to allow the supplemental answer to be filed, and proceeded to the trial of the case, upon pleadings which did not allow such defense to be made. The release, it is said, was executed without the knowledge of the attorneys, but the <em>bona fides </em>of the transaction was not attacked; and there was no circumstance before the Court, save and except the fact that the attorneys were not consulted in the matter, to cast suspicion upon the settlement of the case, claimed to have been made by the parties thereto. We think there were no laches, and the Court should have permitted the defendant to plead the release. (See <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Branded, </em>59 Cal. 105). The Court might have imposed terms upon the defendant, such as the payment of costs, and should have continued the case, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>continuance had been asked for by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not present at the trial, \u201cbut had disappeared from the country,\u201d as the record shows, being satisfied with the amount of two thousand dollars, which it appeared had been paid him, and for which no allowance was made by the jury in fixing the damages awarded by their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The judgment and order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Myrick, Sharpstein, and Thornton,.JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b274-6\">McKee, J., concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">I concur in the judgment, for the reason that the denial of the Court below of the motion made by the defendant to file the supplemental answer presented to the Court was, under the circumstances on which the motion was made, an abuse of judicial discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b274-8\">McKinstry and Ross, JJ., dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">We do not understand the facts to be exactly as stated in the foregoing opinion. We adhere to the views expressed when the case was before Department One, and therefore dissent from the judgment now given.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">The following is the opinion of Department One referred to:</p>\n<author id=\"b274-11\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">Upon the case as presented in the transcript we can not say that the evidence was insufficient to show negligence on the part of the employee of defendant in the transaction of the business of his agency. Nor can we declare that there was not evidence to sustain the finding that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">It is urged by respondent that the action of the Court below in refusing to allow the supplemental answer was either correct or it was more than error\u2014was an abuse of discretion, and that an abuse of discretion can only be presented by affidavit. (C. C. P. 657, sub. 1.) But by Section 647 of the Code of Civil Procedure, an order refusing to allow an amendment to a pleading is \u201cdeemed to have been excepted to.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The ruling of Court deemed to have been excepted to, can be incorporated in a bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The circumstances under which defendant applied to file an amended or supplemental answer, in the nature of a plea <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>were such as justified the Court in denying it. Section 473 of the Code of Civil Procedure, after authorizing an amendment by adding or striking out the name of a party, provides: \u201cThe Court may likewise, <em>in its discretion, </em>after notice to the adverse party, allow, upon such terms as may be just, an amendment to any pleading or proceeding in other particulars.\u201d It would seem that whether a party should be allowed to plead a matter arising <em>puis darrein continuance </em>was always a matter of discretion. <em>(Harding </em>v. <em>Minear, </em>54 Cal. 502, and cases cited.) The refusal to permit the amended or supplemental answer was not, upon the facts as they appear in the transcript, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">An application for leave to file a supplemental answer, setting forth facts which have occurred since the last continuance, will ordinarily, if made promptly, be allowed almost of course. But the application should be made promptly and as soon as its necessity is ascertained. (2 Wait\u2019s Pr. 470.) Here the facts were known to one of defendant\u2019s attorneys before the action was called for trial. The application was not made, however, until the day after the jury was impaneled, and after counsel for plaintiff had opened his case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">In this State an attorney has, perhaps, no lien for his costs. But may not the Court\u2014in deciding, in its discretion, whether a party shall be allowed, pending the trial, to plead a release, executed on a settlement of the cause of action which was made prior to the trial\u2014consider the circumstances that the settlement was made behind the back of the attorney of one of the parties; perhaps in fraud of his rights, certainly when the party was deprived of the supervision and protecting care of his chosen legal adviser? Such settlements ought not to be encouraged, and if they are to be enforced at all, should be enforced only through the medium of a plea proffered at the earliest practicable moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
