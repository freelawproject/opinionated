(Sickles Min. L. &amp; Dec. 24,32.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-10\">The Court below held, that there is no conflict between these Acts of Congress and the local rules and regulations then in force in the district where the mine is located. But their provisions plainly appear to us irreconcilable. That the Acts of Congress are the paramount law, is too plain for argument. Under the Acts of Congress above cited, appellants had until the first day of January, 1875, in which to make the first annual expenditure. <em>(Belk </em>v. <em>Meagher et al., </em>3 Morrison\u2019s Trans. 243; <em>Du Prat </em>v. <em>James et al., </em>9 P.

Under this provision, the local law can not contradict, but may add to the Act of Congress, in all matters not inconsistent with the Act. (Skidmore\u2019s Mining Statutes, 59; Weeks on Mineral Lands, 189.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-5\">Sharpstein, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We think that the Court erred in charging the jury that a locator of a mining claim must not only observe the law of Congress which requires that \u201cten dollars\u2019 worth of labor shall be performed or improvements made each year for each one hundred feet in length along the vein, until a patent shall have been issued therefor,\u201d but also the local regulations of the miners of the district, which require \u201cthat work shall be done every sixty days on the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">According to the law of Congress, a locator- would forfeit his claim if he did not each year perform work or make improvements of the value of ten dollars for each hundred feet of the vein. But by the local regulations, he would forfeit it if he did not perform some work on it every sixty days. It seems to us that there is a clear conflict between the law and the regulations. And if there is, it is conceded that the law must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Order denying motion for new trial reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Myrick, J., Morrison, C.
