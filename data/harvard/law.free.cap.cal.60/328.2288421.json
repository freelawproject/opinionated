Oh, yes, up to the present time, we have paid our taxes regularly every year; that is, on the three blocks, at least our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>proportion, other parties claiming it may have paid it on their portion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">*******</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">Q. You said that the property you were put in possession of by the Sheriff was known as the Elsessor Tract ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\">A. Yes, sir; it was purchased by John Treat (defendant); he kept a milk ranch there before; that is, Treat and I together purchased; I had an interest in it and he had one. Treat made the purchase of this property in 1868. He and I were joint purchasers of the tract. He owned, say two thirds of it.. I was interested with him and furnished the money, and the tract was deeded to me. It never stood in his name, but he owned two thirds of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\">I wish to make an explanation of my testimony where I stated I had tenants there in common with other property under this lease. What I meant by that is, it was held in one tract. When I passed the deed to Roper I did not have any control over that portion of the.land at all; did not have any interest whatever in it. What I meant by in common is that the parties holding for Roper had charge of my three blocks when I made the remark \u201c common.\u201d I meant the parties holding for Roper were keeping possession of my three blocks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-9\">CROSS-EXAMUTATIOET.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-10\">Q.

Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-12\">Q. That is, the whole of the property was to be in a common enclosure ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-13\">A. That is the possession as far as the possession is concerned ; the parties holding possession for them were to hold possession of my three blocks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-14\">Q. That land was, as you stated, held in common ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-15\">A. What I meant by that was, held under one fence; there was no separate enclosure, is what I meant by that. I never had anything to do with the rest of that property since that deed; I made no claim to it, none whatever, except the three blocks. I state now, under oath, that is all the interest I had in it; those three blocks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered and read in evidence a lease from Edward Roper to William McGrath, dated December 31,1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-5\"># 3C- &amp; &amp; S *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-6\">Peter McGrath, called for defendants, sworn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">Mr. Seawell.\u2014Please look at that [handing witness the lease from Samuel Grim to Peter McGrath and Thomas Mallory] and see whether you executed it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">A.

It recites that plaintiff filed his petition November 23, 1869, and that all the proceedings were had under and by virtue of Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>No. 866 of the Board of Supervisors. Order No. 866 was an order of the Board of Supervisors, passed April 29,1869, providing the means of acquiring deeds from the city. It was never authorized by the Legislature,- and it was never ratified by the Legislature. Without such ratification the Board of Supervisors had no power to legislate upon the subject. By the Act of Congress of March 8,1866, the land was granted to the city in trust to convey the same to the parties then in possession, in such quantities and upon such terms and conditions as the Legislature should prescribe. It was, therefore, not for the Supervisors, but the Legislature, to give directions upon the subject. Accordingly, by the Act of March 24, 1870 (Statutes 1869-70, 353), power was for the first time conferred by the Legislature upon the Mayor and Board of Supervisors to determine who were the beneficiaries under the Act of Congress, and to execute a deed to them. Section 6 of that Act provides that proceedings instituted under Order No. 748 of the Board of Supervisors may he continued under the provisions of said Order No. 866, and that when the proceedings have been completed and the Committee on Outside Lands of the Board of Supervisors have executed a deed, the grantee may obtain a deed from the Mayor, without further petition or proof; but the section cited does not apply to proceedings wholly begun, continued, and ended under Order No. 866.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">The deeds from the Mayor having been executed without authority of law, their validity may be impeached collaterally in an action of ejectment. <em>(MeGarrahan </em>v. <em>New Idria Mining Go. </em>49 Cal. 335; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Duff, </em>47 Cal. 562, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">Neither of the appellants were in possession of any part of the premises sued for at the time of the commencement of the action. The following is the history of the occupation of said premises as shown by the evidence:</p>\n<p data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">On the eighteenth of May, 1870, Samuel Grim was put in possession by the Sheriff of a tract of land called the Elsessor Tract, containing between 90 and 100 acres.- The demanded premises are a part of this tract. The next day, May 19, 1870, Crim made a lease of the premises to Peter McGrath and one Mallory for the term of six months. These lessees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>were at the time in possession of the property. The following day, May 20,1870, Grim executed a deed to the appellant Roper of the entire tract, except Blocks 757, 684 and 780. Mallory does not appear to have remained on the premises. Peter McGrath, the other tenant, remained there until the beginning of the year 1872, when he went to Pope Valley, in Mapa County, to live. He remained there until some time in September, 1873. This action was commenced June 5, 1873. On the thirty-first of December, 1872, Edward Roper executed a lease of the premises to William McGrath, a son of Peter. At that time Peter was superintendent of a quicksilver mine in Pope Valley. William McGrath has, ever since the execution of the lease to him, continued in possession of the premises. He, and not Peter, was in possession at the time when this action was commenced, in June, 1873. It is not pretended by counsel for respondent that Peter McGrath was on the premises when this action was commenced, or that he was not living in Pope Valley, or that he was not superintendent of the quicksilver mines for nearly two years, from the beginning of 1872 to September 1873; but it is claimed by them that, notwithstanding Peter\u2019s absence from the premises\u2014notwithstanding the fact that his son, William, then in the twenty-sixth year of his age, was occupying the premises under a lease from Edward Roper, he, Peter McGrath, was still in possession, ousting the plaintiff and preventing him from taking possession of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">There is no evidence that Roper was ever in possession of the premises. His only connection with the property is that he received a deed from Grim of the premises, except blocks 757, 684, and 780, and executed the lease to William McGrath in December, 1872. On the eighth of March, 1873, and three months before the commencement of this suit, Roper conveyed his interest in the premises to Alfred W. Reay.</p>\n<p data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">If the deed to Roper was sufficient to put him in the constructive possession of the premises, the deed from him to A. W. Reay was sufficient to put him out again. As landlord of William McGrath he is not sued. Section 379, 0. 0. P., provides that \u201cin an action to determine the title or right of possession to real property, which at the time of the commencement of the action is in the possession of a tenant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the landlord may be joined as a party defendant.\u201d In such a case the allegation should be that the tenant-defendant is in possession, and that the other defendant is his landlord. An allegation that the landlord is in possession is not enough, for it is not he, but the tenant, who is in possession. Besides, when Roper conveyed to Reay on the eighth of March, 1873, he ceased to be landlord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-5\">The judgment should be reversed for the failure of the Court below to find upon the issue raised by the plea of the statute of limitations. The only finding tending to cover that issue is the fourteenth, \"and the said defendants had, prior to the commencement of this action, been in the possession of the said pieces and parcels of land at no time prior to the nineteenth day of May, 1870.\u201d This is no finding upon the issue. It does not find that the grantors of defendant had not been in possession prior to May 19, 1870, or that plaintiff or his grantors had been in possession within five years before the commencement of the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-6\"><em>J. H. Smyth, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">The first error assigned is the admission of the deed from the city to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-8\">After the Act of March 8, 1866, various orders were adopted by the municipal authorities of San Francisco for carrying its purposes into effect, among others Order No. 800, which was ratified by the Legislature, (Stat. 1867-8, p. 379) and Order No. 866, which was reenacted by the Legislature (Stat. 1869-70, p. 353). By the former of these orders it was provided (Sec. 11) that upon certain events the title (without any conveyance) was released to the person named in the Act of Congress, and it was further enacted by the Legislature that \u201call proceedings heretofore had and which have taken place, or shall hereafter take place, under its provisions are ratified and confirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-9\">And by the Act of March 14, 1870, all orders conflicting with Order No. 866 are repealed, but it was expressly declared (Sec. 6) that \u201csuch repeal shall not invalidate any of the proceedings instituted under the Order of which No. 866 is amendatory;\u201d and also (See. 5), \u201cthat a conveyance exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>cuted in pursuance of the provisions of this Act shall operate as an acknowledgment that the title to the land has passed under and by virtue of the Order No. 800.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">The recitals in the deed in question show that it was a portion of the \u201cproceedings instituted under \u201d Order No. 866, and also that it was executed \u201cin confirmation of \u201d the provisions of Order No. 800, and consequently is within the operation of both of the aforesaid Acts of the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-6\">The motion for a nonsuit was properly denied by the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-7\">The motion was made upon the ground that \u201cnone of the defendants were in possession or shown to have been in possession at the time of the commencement of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-8\">It was not necessary to show an actual personal occupancy of the land in order to entitle the plaintiff to recover. A constructive possession is sufficient. And if a person asserts that he is in possession, or does such acts as imply that he is in possession, or claims to be in possession, or such acts as are inconsistent with a denial of such possession, he is said to have constructive possession, in the same manner that a denial of plaintiff\u2019s title is regarded as equivalent to proof of an ouster. <em>(Grane </em>v. <em>Ghirardelli, </em>45 Cal. 235.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-9\">Kindred to the foregoing point is the specification in the statement that the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendants were in possession of any portion of the premises at the commencement of the action. They endeavored to show that because McGrath happened to be in Napa on the day the complaint was filed therefore he was not then in possession of the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-10\">The Court, however, was satisfied from the evidence on that subject that the pretended change of possession from McGrath to his son was a fraudulent and similated one, and that, in fact, his possession was continuous from the date of his entry under the lease, in May, 1870, to the time of the trial. The finding of the Court upon the conflict of evidence on this issue is conclusive on the point. <em>(Ellis </em>v. <em>White, </em>47 Cal. 75.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-11\">As was said by this Court, upon a similar attempt by a father to abandon his possession in favor of his son who was living with him, \u201cCourts would cease to be courts of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>if such proceedings were countenanced.\u201d <em>(Keller </em>v. Berry, 6 P. O. L. J. 864.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-5\">The finding that the plaintiffs have been seised in fee and the owners of the premises since the sixth day of April, 1870\u2014the action having been brought in 1873\u2014is a sufficient finding on the issues of the statute of limitations. (O. 0. P. \u00a7 321; <em>8. F. </em>v. <em>Fulde, </em>37 Cal. 349.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">It will be noticed that the answer only pleads the provisions of Sections 318 and 319 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which in no way refer to any possession by the defendants; and in the absence of any allegation on that point, it was unnecessary to find thereon.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-7\">Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The lands in controversy in this action, and in a number of other actions now pending before us, form a part of what was known as the <em>\u201c </em>outside lands\u201d of the City and County of San Francisco. After the passage of the Act of Congress of March 8, 1866, in relation to those lands, the Board of Supervisors passed, among other orders, Order Mo. 866, by which provision was made for the presentation of petitions by the respective claimants, the making of proofs, the making and publication of awards of the land, to be followed by deeds by the Mayor. It is contended on behalf of the appellants that this Order\u2014Mo. 866\u2014was never authorized or ratified by the Legislature, and that, as a result, the deeds issued by the Mayor pursuant to its provisions were unauthorized and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In effect Order 866 was ratified and re-enacted by the Act of the Legislature approved March 14, 1870. (Statutes 1869-70, p. 353.) By the first, second, third, fourth and fifth sections of that Act the order was substantially re-enacted, and by the sixth section the Legislature repealed all Orders and parts of Orders of the Board of Supervisors conflicting with Order 866, accompanying the repeal, however, with the proviso that such repeal should not invalidate any of the proceedings instituted under the Order of which Order 866 was amendatory, and expressly authorized such proceedings to be continued under the provisions of said Order 866. This was in effect a legislative ratification of the provis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ions of Order 866, for it can not be held that the Legislature intended to authorize any proceedings to be conducted under an unauthorized or invalid Order. Besides the whole scope of the Act of March 14,1870, manifests the intent on the part of the Legislature to ratify and continue the provisions of Order 866. The intent is manifested, in the first place, by the repeal of all Orders and parts of Orders in conflict with it, with the saving clause that all proceedings instituted under the Order of which it was amendatory should be unaffected by the repeal and be <em>continued under its provisions ; </em>and, in the second place, by the <em>re-enactment </em>in statutory form of the provisions of the said Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Our conclusion is, that the deeds under which the plaintiff claims were not unauthorized, and that they were properly admitted in evidence. <em>(McCreery </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>52 Cal. 257; <em>Le Roy </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>44 id. 609; <em>Kraft </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>1 P. O. L. J. 24.) We have looked into the evidence, and cannot say the findings of the Court of possession of the premises by the appellants at the time of the commencement of the action, was not justified. As respects the finding in relation to the statute of limitations, it is sufficient to say that if there was a plea of the statute, the finding covered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">McKinstry and McKee, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\"><em>Paul Rousset et al. </em>v. <em>J.
