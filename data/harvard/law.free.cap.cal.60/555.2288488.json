Marshall, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">That the interpretation placed by the Court below upon the words used in the contract between plaintiff and defendant, that the plaintiff should \u201ceffect a sale\u201d before being entitled to payment for his services, is forced, strained, altogether inadmissible, and not warranted by law. The plaintiff did \u201ceffect a sale,\u201d as far as it was physically possible for an agent to effect one, who had not his principal\u2019s power of attorney to execute a deed. <em>(Phelan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>43 Cal. 310; <em>Middleton </em>v. <em>Findla, </em>25 id. 82; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>29 id. 395; <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Broad, </em>Pacific Coast Law Journal, vol. 7, p. 288; <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Mannot, </em>3 Keyes\u2019 N. Y. 204; <em>Kock </em>v. <em>Emmerling, </em>22 How. U. S. 69.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">An agent may be entitled to his compensation though he has not accomplished the thing he was employed to do, if he was prevented from doing it by the act, or failure to act, of his principal. (See Story on Agency, 392, and notes; Parsons on Contracts, 89, 90.) An agent has the undoubted right to require his principal to perform any reasonable act within his power necessary to or in furtherance of a consummation of the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-7\"><em>Baggett &amp; Platt, </em>also for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">A sale was effected. A broker need be only a procuring cause; he can not conclude a sale; his power is limited to the bringing of seller and purchaser together. When he has done this he has effected a sale, within the meaning and intent of his contract. <em>(McCreery </em>v. <em>Green, </em>38 Mich. 184; <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>43 Cal. 310; <em>Glentworth </em>v. <em>Lather, </em>21 Barb. 145; 4 Daly, 143; <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Monnot, </em>3 Keyes, 204; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Mayo, </em>107 Mass. 552; <em>Love </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>53 Ind. 300.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">If Neilson had authority to execute the Hedger-Neilson agreement (and he had such authority, <em>Rutenberg </em>v. <em>Main, </em>47 Cal. 214), his acts were the acts of Lee, and no new condition was imposed by Hedger in requiring Lee\u2019s ratification of these acts. Lee was not asked to do a single thing not already done by him through 1STeilson. That said sale failed to be completed through the fault of Lee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-10\">\u201c It is a well-settled and sound principle of law, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>who prevents a .thing being done shall not avail himself, to his own benefit, of the non-performance which he has occasioned.\u201d <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>12 Gray, 491; <em>Rice </em>v. Mayo, 107 Mass. 550; <em>Delaplaine </em>v. <em>Turnley, </em>44 Wis. 31; <em>Coleman\u2019s Ex\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>13 Bush, [Ky.], 363; <em>Mooney </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>56 N.

[U. S.] 69; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Bierling, </em>31 N. Y. 463.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-6\">Lee cannot plead his want of absolute title as an excuse for not paying Neilson\u2019s commission. By his written contract with Neilson he had given notice to Neilson and all the world that he was \u201c seised at law and in equity.\u201d <em>(Budd </em>v. <em>Zoller, 52 </em>Mo. 242, 246.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b584-7\"><em>Robinson, Olney &amp; Byrne, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-8\">The third point made by the appellant is that an agent may be entitled to his compensation, although he has not accomplished the thing he was employed to do, if he was prevented from doing it by the act or failure to act, of his principal. The facts in this case do not show that the plaintiff was prevented by his principal from accomplishing the proposed sale. The finding of the Court below upon this point that \u201c the plaintiff did not effect any sale of said property, nor did he procure a purchaser able and willing to purchase the same, is fully sustained by the evidence.\u201d <em>(Phelan </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>43 Cal. 310.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-9\">Under the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, the plaintiff had no authority to enter into the contract made by him with Hedger. The contract should have expressly provided that time was of the essence of the contract; that Hedger should purchase if the title was a good possessory title, and should have contained other provisions necessary for defendant\u2019s protection. Time is not of the essence of a contract to convey real property unless expressly so stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>the written agreement. <em>(Brown </em>v. Covillaud, 6 Cal. 566; <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Branch, </em>40 id. 3-11-13; <em>Vassault </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>43 id. 458; <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Masterton, </em>39 N. Y. Sup. Ct. 133.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">The Hedger-Neilson contract substantially provides :</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">1. That Lee, without any consideration whatever, should bind himself to sell and convey the property at a future time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">2. That he should bind himself to give \u201c a good and sufficient deed and transfer conveying the absolute title \u201d of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">3. That Lee should bind himself positively to sell, while Hedger was under no obligation whatever (as we, with due respect, contend,) to purchase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">4. That Lee should sign and ratify a contract prepared by Hedger\u2019s attorneys, and so framed as to omit provisions materially necessary for the protection of his interests, and which imposed no responsibility upon Hedger. Neilson clearly had no authority under Lee\u2019s contract with him to impose such a burden upon Lee\u2019s property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\">\u25a0 The testimony shows that the defendant was ready and willing, at all times, to sign or to ratify an agreement of sale by which his rights would be properly protected. No such agreement was ever offered to him by plaintiff for signature or ratification. But no such ratification was necessary, nor was it contemplated by the parties, or demanded by the terms of the contract. <em>\u201c </em>In an action on a contract involving a condition precedent, the proofs must show performance of the condition, or else a waiver thereof.\u201d <em>{Livesey </em>v. <em>Omaha Hotel Co., </em>5 Neb. 50; Story on Agency, \u00a7 329; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>35 Cal. 656; <em>Englander </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>41 id. 420; <em>Bohall </em>v. <em>Diller, </em>id. 532; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Mach, </em>45 id. 303; C.

By the terms of said contract, if plaintiff effected a sale of said mining claim within the time specified, for more than $50,000, he was to receive as compensation for his services as agent in effecting said sale one half of the amount realized thereby, over and above said sum of $50,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201c3. Plaintiff was not to receive any compensation for his services, nor were any expenses incurred in the transaction to be chargeable against defendant, unless a sale was effected by plaintiff under said written contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\"><em>\u201c4. </em>About the twentieth of August, 1878, plaintiff entered into negotiations with one H. A. Hedger for the sale to him of said property for the sum of $75,000 in United States gold coin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201c5. These negotiations were carried on between the said parties until about the twenty-seventh day of August, 1878, when they were terminated by a notification to plaintiff from Hedger, that he declined to purchase the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c6. The plaintiff did not effect any sale of said property, nor did he procure a purchaser able and willing to purchase the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">It is claimed by the appellant that the last finding and the last clause of the finding next preceding the last are contrary to the evidence. There is positive evidence of the pecuniary ability of Hedger to purchase the property, which is not contradicted, so that there is no conflict of evidence upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">His willingness to purchase the property is evidenced by an instrument in writing between him and the plaintiff, in which he agrees to purchase it at the price and on the terms upon which the plaintiff was authorized by the defendant to sell it. In that agreement there is a stipulation that Hedger might have twenty days from its date in which to examine and pass upon the title to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">The agreement between the plaintiff and defendant was, by its terms, to remain in force for a period of sixty days from its date, and had, at the date of the agreement between the plaintiff and Hedger, more than twenty days to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">How it appears further by. the evidence that Hedger insisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>upon a ratification of the agreement between him and the plaintiff by the defendant within a specified period, and that the defendant refused to ratify it within that period, and that Hedger at the expiration thereof notified the plaintiff that he, Hedger, considered himself released from any further obligation to purchase the property. By refusing to ratify said agreement the defendant, we think, refused to sell the property to Hedger, at the price and on the terms which the defendant had agreed with the plaintiff to sell it. And if that be so, the finding that the plaintiff did not procure a purchaser able and willing to purchase said property, is against the evidence. The evidence shows that the sale was defeated by the refusal of the defendant to ratify the agreement made by his agent, the plaintiff, with Hedger, and we are unable to find anything in the evidence which tends to show that Hedger was not both able and willing to purchase at the price and upon the terms fixed by the defendant in his agreement with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Judgment and order denying a new trial reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Mobbison,. 0. J., McKiktstby, Boss, Thobjsttok, JJ.. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Hybick, J. dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b587-8\">McKee, J., dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">It is familiar law that a real estate broker is not entitled to commissions for making a sale of real estate for his principal, unless he strictly performs the services required of him according to the authority conferred upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">In the case in hand, the defendant, claiming to have been <em>\u201c </em>seised at law and in equity\u201d of a mining claim in the State of Nevada, authorized the plaintiff by an instrument in writing, to sell the claim at any time within sixty days from the first day of July, 1878, for such a sum of money as would net him sixty-five thousand dollars; and any surplus which might be realized from the sale, he agreed to divide equally between the plaintiff and himself, and to pay out of his share of the surplus whatever expenses might -be.incurred in making the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>No other terms were prescribed. Under this authority the plaintiff, as agent and attorney in fact of the defendant, on August 21,1878, entered into an agreement in writing with one Hedger to sell and convey to him \u201c the absolute title to the property,\u201d within twenty days from the date of the agreement, for the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars, payable on condition that Hedger would be satisfied with the title and that the defendant would sign, ratify and approve the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Hedger was able to pay. Negatively it'appears that there was no fault in the title to the property; that Hedger took no steps to satisfy himself about it, and that he never demanded of the defendant to consummate the alleged purchase by a conveyance of the title. It also appears, affirmatively, that the defendant refused to sign the agreement in writing between Hedger and the plaintiff, and that the former, on August 27, 1878, notified the latter, that he considered himself released from all obligation to purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">There was, therefore, no actual sale of the property. Hedger was not a purchaser ready and willing to buy, nor did the defendant refuse to consummate a purchase by the conveyance of his title; he did refuse to sign the agreement in writing between Hedger and the plaintiff: but he was not bound by his contract with the plaintiff to sign any agreement in writing which the latter might make with a person to whom he offered the property for sale; and in refusing to do what he was not bound by his contract to do, the defendant was not at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">As an agent, the plaintiff could only bind his principal within the scope of his authority. It was not within the scope of his authority to make a conditional or contingent sale. Such a purchase, the defendant was not bound to accept. He had the right to determine for himself whether the offer to purchase upon such a contingency, as was agreed to by his agent, was made in good faith, and to refuse or accept the offer. And Hedger was not bound to purchase if the contingency which he presented, did not happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">As, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s claim to compensation was, by his own unauthorized act, made dependent upon an act which his principal was not bound to perform, no recovery can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>had upon it. A real estate broker is not entitled to recover commissions for a conditional sale of real estate which fails of actual consummation by no fault or fraud of the owner of the property. <em>(Hinds </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>36 N. J. L. 333; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Tirrell, </em>101 Mass. 257.) Therefore I think the judgment and order of the Court below was correct, and should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
