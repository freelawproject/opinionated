And it must appear also that the person killed was the assailant, or that the slayer had really and in good faith endeavored to decline any further struggle before the mortal blow was given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">\u201c To justify the defendant in killing the deceased it is not absolutely necessary that the defendant should have believed his own life in danger. But it will be sufficient if the circumstances were such as to justify the defendant, as a reasonable man, in believing that the deceased was about to commit any felony, and that it was necessary to take his life to prevent the commission of such felony, and that if the defendant did so believe and acted under such belief solely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">That these instructions are contradictory is apparent, and the first does not differ materially from that given in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flahave, </em>58 Cal. 249, which was held to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">Only one of the instructions requested by the defendant was refused by the Court.
