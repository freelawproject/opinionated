The complaint does not contain any allegation that the defendant Ann Dougherty acknowledged the execution of the mortgage, nor is any copy of the mortgage annexed to the complaint. An allegation of the fact of acknowledgment is essential to the cause of action against her, inasmuch as upon the existence of that fact the validity of the mortgage depends. (C. C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1093, 1181,1186, 1187; <em>. Dubois, </em>12 Pet. 374; <em>Jordans. </em>Corey,2Ind. 385; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>16 Johns. 110.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b380-16\">If the plaintiff relies on special circumstances to remove the disability of a married woman to make the contract sued upon, they must appear in his pleadings. <em>{Hardin s. Pelan, </em>41 Miss. 112; <em>Hash s. Mitchell, </em>71 N. Y. 199; <em>Leonis s. Lazzarovich, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>55 Cal. 55.) There is no finding that she acknowledged the execution of the mortgage, either in the manner prescribed for married women or at all. Taking the facts found by tho Court together with the material facts alleged in the complaint, and not controverted by the answer of the defendant Ann Dougherty, there is still wanting the essential and vital fact of the acknowledgment of the execution of the mortgage by her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b381-5\"><em>Jarboe &amp; Harrison, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b381-6\">The allegation and finding that she \u201cmade and executed\u201d the mortgage includes all that is requisite to the creation of a perfect instrument.

Pro. we find: \u201cThe execution of an instrument is the subscribing and delivering it.\u201d That is the meaning which must prevail. <em>(Hoag </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>55 Cal. 564.) To use the word \u201cexecute\u201d in pleading as including the fact of acknowledgment would be to plead a conclusion of law. <em>(Dutch Flat Water Co. </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>12 Cal. 534.) As to the interpretation of pleadings we cite <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>1 How. 104; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>41 N. H. 493; <em>Winter v. Balcer, </em>50 Barb. 432; <em>Moore v.

The complaint alleged that the defendants \u201c made, executed and delivered\u201d to the plaintiff a certain indenture of mortgage, by which they granted, bargained and sold, conveyed and confirmed, unto the plaintiff, the lot of land described in the complaint, as security for the payment of a certain promissory note. The defendant, Ann Dougherty, who is the appellant, answered the complaint and denied that she ever \u201cmade, executed or delivered\u201d the instrument. After trial, the Court below found that appellant \u201cmade, executed and delivered\u201d the mortgage to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The sole point relied on by appellant for a reversal of the judgment is, that inasmuch as she is a married woman the complaint should have alleged, and the findings should have shown, that she \u201cacknowledged\u201d the execution of the mortgage, in order to have constituted a cause of action against her. But in the case of a married woman the acknowledgment is a part of the execution of the instrument. (Civil Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1186 and 1187; <em>Wedel </em>v. <em>Hermann, </em>59 Cal. 507; <em>Leonis </em>v. <em>Lazzarovich, </em>55 id. 55.) Until acknowledged it is not executed, but when executed it is acknowledged; for when it is said that an instrument is \u201cexecuted,\u201d every act is imported which was requisite to make it operative and effective. In this case, acknowledgment being necessary, the averment of the complaint and the finding of the Court, that the mortgage was \u201cexecuted,\u201d imports that it was \u201cacknowledged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">McKinstry and McKee, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
