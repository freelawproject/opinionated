Subsequently, on the fourteenth day of May, 1881, the Court below made an order reciting that the original bill of exceptions was erroneous, and that the certificate was inadvertently made, and ordering that the same be canceled and set aside; and at the same time settled and certified to a new bill of exceptions, which was filed in the Supreme Court on the seventeenth day of May, 1881.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-12\"><em>A.

Moresi had a certain sum of money, to wit, eight twenty-dollar pieces, five five-dollar pieces, and two two-and-a-half dollar pieces, and a silver watch of the value of twenty dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">Q. <em>Where did this take place?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">A. At Hayes Valley.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">Q. Where is Hayes Valley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-10\">Q. Do you know whether it is in the city and county of San Francisco ? .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-11\">A. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-12\">\u201cThe defendant, <em>L. M. Oliver, </em>being duly sworn on his own behalf, testified that at the time of the alleged offense defendant was in Italy, and not in the city and county of San Francisco, and that he had not taken the money or watch of S. Moresi.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-13\">\u201cIn rebuttal the prosecution examined H. H. Bodie and A. Galley, who testified that at the time of the alleged offense, to wit, on or about March 31, 1879, they were acquainted with <em>L. M. Oliver, </em>and at that time said <em>Oliver </em>was in the city and county of San Francisco. <em>This was all the evidence offered.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The bill of exceptions simply shows that in <em>March, </em>1870, S. Moresi had a certain amount of money and a silver watch; but there is not a particle of evidence in the case showing that either the money or the watch ever passed out of his possession by the act of the defendant. In other words, there is a total failure to prove the <em>corpus delicti. </em>It was bad enough to fix the time in 1870, instead of 1879, thereby attempting to prove and punish an act long since barred by the statute of limitations; but it was worse, if possible, to omit all evidence of the commission of any crime. If District Attorneys, as well as the judges who try cases, would examine with greater care transcripts that are prepared for this Court, arrange and see that the facts established by the evidence are properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>brought before us on appeal, the ends of justice would be greatly promoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We are obliged to reverse the judgment and remand the caw. for a new trial. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
