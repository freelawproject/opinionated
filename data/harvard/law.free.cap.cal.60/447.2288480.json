G. Newlands, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s special privilege is,in the extent and scope claimed, a monopoly. This privilege, if conceded to be as extensive in its application as claimed in the Court below, deprives the owners of their property in dead animals, without due process of law, and imposes a burden without a corresponding benefit. It is in restraint of trade; it is unreasonable and oppressive. The contract, and ordinances passed in aid of it, are, therefore, void. (Dillon on Munic. Corpor. \u00a7\u00a7 55, 258-255, 257-259, 262; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Gas Co., </em>12 Penn. St. 323; <em>Norwich Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Norwich City Gas Co., </em>25 Conn. 19; <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>7 Paige, 263.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-9\">The contract and ordinances referred to must be limited in their application to animals actually requiring removal\u2014that is, animals in such a condition of putrefaction as to constitute a nuisance. They were not intended to take away from the owner the possession and the control of his property, or the power to dispose of it as he saw fit. The owner could remove it, or he could direct his servant to do so, or he could employ the defendants to do so. The act of the agent is the act of the principal. More than this, by the very terms of their contracts, the defendants became the owners of the carcasses immediately upon their death, and under the ordinances the owners had the right to remove such carcasses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Even the strictest construction of Order No. 838 would only hold that the rights of plaintiffs attach at the expiration of twenty-four hours after the death of an animal. During this time the owner or his agent could remove\u2014and it nowhere appears that the defendants did remove after the expiration of the twenty-four hours. For the construction of similar ordinances, see <em>Underwood </em>v. <em>Green, </em>42 N. T. 140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-5\"><em>James Mee, </em>also for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-6\">The contract is in direct violation of Article i, Section 8, of our then existing State Constitution (as borrowed from a leading provision of Magna Charta,) which declares that life, liberty and property shall not be taken from the citizen without due process of law. We find the contract and the ordinance at war with each other, the contract giving to G. Wetzlar alone the exclusive right to remove all dead animals in said city, and the ordinance permitting the owner or party in possession to remove the same. And the legislature ratified both. (Statute 1873-4, 886.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-7\">The plaintiffs, no doubt, will contend in this Court, as I understand they did in the lower one, \u201cthat if the ordinance prevail instead of the contract, then, and in that event, that said ordinance must he strictly construed in this, that the owners or party in possession of such dead animals shall remove the same in person, not by agent or servant.\u201d Such a rule of construction would be to handicap the weak against th,e strong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-8\"><em>George Turner, Severance &amp; Naphtaly, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-9\">As a sanitary measure, it is competent and legal for the city to provide, by ordinances and contract, for the removal of dead animals which may be found within the city limits. That they did make such contract with Gustave Wetzlar, and the contract was fully legalized by the legislature of this State, and this is the act of the sovereign power in the premises. It is plain, therefore, that all animals that die in said city \u201cand require to be removed,\u201d \u201cor may become nuisances,\u201d are to be removed first by owner or possessor, or next by Wetzlar or his assigns, and if Wetzlar or his assigns do not remove within twenty-four hours, any one can. It is a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and proper sanitary regulation and applies to all carcasses, whether on public or private grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-5\"><em>J. B. </em>Crockett, also for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b474-6\">It is claimed that, under Ordinance 838, the owner of the dead animal had the right, within twenty-four hours after its death, to so dispose of the carcass as to prevent it from becoming a nuisance; and it is said that, within the twenty-four hours the owner could either remove the carcass himself or authorize another to do it, and that there is no finding to the effect that any of the carcasses removed by the defendants under their contract, had become nuisances or were not 'removed within the twenty-four hours allowed the owner for that purpose. But the contract between the defendants and the owners of dead animals, as found by the Court, does not provide for the. removal of the carcass, within twenty-four hours after death, or within any other definite period. Nor does it appear that any of the carcasses removed by the defendants were, in fact, removed within the twenty-four hours, or before they had become nuisances. If they relied upon this as a defense, it was incumbent on them to prove it as an affirmative fact; and to enable them to prove it, they should have averred it in the answer; but there is no such allegation. They seek to avail themselves of a special privilege \u25a0reserved to the owner to remove the carcass within twenty-four hours after death, but have wholly failed to bring themselves within the terms of the privilege by averment or proof.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-7\">Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The plaintiffs claim the exclusive right to remove dead animals from the city and county of San Francisco, by virtue of a contract entered into between the city and county and one Wetzlar in the year 1866. The ordinance on which the asserted right is founded declares, in its first section, that \u201c whenever any horse, ass, swine, sheep or goat, or cattle of any kind shall die within the limits of the city and county of San Francisco, the owner thereof, or the person in whose possession the same may be at the time of its death shall dispose of the carcass in such a manner that the same shall not become a nuisance, or shall notify G. Wetzlar, or his associates or as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>signs, within twenty-four hours, where such carcass may he found,\u201d etc.: and a failure in this respect is declared to he a misdemeanor and punishable accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The second section declares, that \u201c no person other than said G. Wetzlar, or his associates or assigns, or the person owning or having possession of any animal mentioned in the preceding section, at the time of its death, shall remove or dispose of the carcass of such animal, unless the said Wetzlar, his associates and assigns, shall fail to remove the same within twenty-four hours after receiving notice thereof, as herein before provided. And no person shall obstruct, hinder or in any manner interfere with the said Wetzlar, or his associates or assigns, in the removal or disposition of any such carcass.\u201d A violation of this section is also declared to be a misdemeanor and punishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">By the provisions of this ordinance the owner, or the person in whose possession the animals should be when death occurred, was given the right to dispose of the carcass in such a manner as not to become a nuisance, at any time within twenty-four hours after death; and Wetzlar\u2019s right to remove them did not attach until the expiration of the said period of twenty-four hours or until he should receive notice of the death and where the carcass could be found, from the owner or the person in possession. In the present case neither the findings nor the complaint show that the defendants have ever removed any dead animal from the City and County of San Francisco at any time when the plaintiffs had that right, or that the defendants threatened to do so. The findings do show that defendants have contracted for the period of one year with certain street railroad companies, livery stable keepers, and other persons, for the removal of such animals belonging to such companies and persons as should die within the City and County of San Francisco, and for the disposition of the same in such manner as not to create a nuisance in the city and county or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">But since by the ordinance the owner was given the right, up to the expiration of twenty-four hours after death, to dispose of the carcass in such a manner that the same should not become a nuisance, it was competent for him to exercise that right in any way he should see fit\u2014by contract or other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>wise. And since by the terms of the ordinance the rights of the plaintiffs as assignees of Wetzlar do not arise until the expiration of twenty-four hours after the death of the animals, or until the receipt of notice as aforesaid, it was incumbent upon them to show, in order to maintain the action, an interference with those rights on the part of the defendants. The fact that the latter removed certain dead animals of the character mentioned in the ordinance, from the city and county, in such a way as to prevent the creation of nuisance, under a contract with the owners, does not show such interference. <em>Non constat </em>but that they were so removed within the twenty-four hours allowed the owners by the ordinance for that purpose. It could hardly have been contemplated by the Board of Supervisors that the owners of such animals as should die should exercise the privilege granted of removing them within the time stated <em>with their own hands. </em>At all events, there can be no doubt of their right to exercise that privilege through others.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">McKinstry and McKee, JJ. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
