The plaintiff derived title from the assignee of Curtis in bankruptcy. Curtis remained in possession after the purchase as agent of the plaintiffs until January 25,1871; at which time the parties entered into a contract, the material parts of which are as follows : Memorandum of agreement * * * this twenty-fifth day of January, A. <em>D. </em>1877, between the firm doing business at said city and county under the name and style of Eedington &amp;

J. Tilden, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-5\">The Court erred in allowing three hundred dollars for expenses in pursuing the property; there is no evidence of any money having been expended in pursuit of the property, and if there had been, it could not be recovered in a replevin suit. <em>(Kelly </em>v. <em>McKibben, </em>54 Cal. 192; Civil Code, Section 3336.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-6\">The indebtedness of Curtis to Ballard was created in January and September, 1876, and the plaintiff\u2019s testimony shows, without any conflict, that Curtis continued to carry on the store in his own name, buying goods of Redington &amp; Co. and other persons, and selling them to the public\u2014in fact, that he dealt with the property as his own right, along after the bankruptcy proceedings in 1875 the same as before, up to the agreement of January 25,1877, and thereafter until June or July, 1877, and even after that and until the attachment. From which it seems to me the claim of ownership of Redington &amp; Co. must be conclusively presumed to be fraudulent and void as against the creditors of Curtis while he remained in possession. (Civil Code, Section 3440; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>53 Cal. 401; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Bugbey, </em>29 id. 466; <em>Hesthal </em>v. <em>Myles, </em>53 id. 624; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Sonoma Valley Bank, </em>8 P. C. L. J. 705.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-7\">The Judge who tried the case below seemed to think because the property was purchased at the assignees\u2019 sale, the rule above does not apply, but the Civil Code makes no exception, and I can find no decisions where it has been held, that if a purchaser at such sale, or a sale on execution, leaves the property in possession of the debtor and allows him to deal with it as his own, the same as before (as shown by the facts in this case), the presumption of fraud does not apply as to the vendors or creditors of such debtor, but on the contrary, the decisions are that the presumption of fraud does apply. <em>(Betz </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>7 Daly, 550; <em>Fonda </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>15 Wend. 628; <em>Gardenier </em>v. <em>Tubbs, </em>21 id. 169; 4 Wait\u2019s Practice, 74; <em>Stimson </em>v. <em>Wrigley, </em>86 N. Y. 336.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b659-8\">The authorities, I believe, are uniform, that when it is agreed that a party shall take possession of property, such as merchandise, in a store, and buy and sell the goods in the ordinary manner, that the transaction will be decreed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>fraudulent and void as to the creditors and purchasers. <em>(Edgell </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>9 N. Y. 213; <em>Hostler </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>3 Cal. 303; Wells on Replevin, Sec. 329; <em>Devlin </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>6 Daly, 305.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-5\"><em>A. N. Drown, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-6\">Whatever in the prayer relates to a return of the property was made surplusage by the answer, or will be regarded as surplusage, for the purpose of upholding the judgment. (Code Civ. Pro. \u00a7 580; Pomeroy\u2019s Rem. &amp; Rem. Rights. \u00a7 580: <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>20 N. Y. 64; <em>Rollins </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>10 Cal. 299: <em>Stringer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>35 id. 29; Bliss on Code Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 161, 167, 437.) Such being the case, we are clearly within the purview of Section 3336 of the Civil Code as amended January 22, 1878. <em>(Tulley </em>v. <em>Tranor, </em>53 Cal. 274; <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Holbrook, </em>54 id. 145.) It is not pretended that Curtis had paid for this property, or had at any time after January 25,1877, anything more than a conditional right of purchase. Redington &amp; Co. expressly provided that until the full payment of the purchase money and the execution of the bill of sale and the complete performance * * * of the covenants and agreements aforesaid, the said drug-store, and all and singular the property aforesaid, shall he and continue solely and entirely the property of said party of the first part. <em>(Buck-master </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>22 Vt. 203; <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Long, </em>8 Pick. 542; S. C., 19 Am. Dec. 345; <em>McFarland </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>42 N. H. 389; Drake on Attachment (5th ed.), \u00a7 246; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Lamphier, </em>36 Cal. 151; <em>Kohler </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>41 id. 455; <em>Truman </em>v. <em>Hardin, </em>5 Saw. C. C. 117, 118.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b660-7\">Indeed, the transaction did not even amount to a conditional sale. There are no present words of sale or transfer in the paper; it is merely an executory contract, a conditional agreement to sell, enforceable by Curtis only upon strict compliance with the conditions as to time, payments, etc. <em>(Sumner </em>v. <em>McFarlan, </em>15 Kan. 600; <em>Enlow </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>79 Pa. St. 490.) The assignment related back to the commencement of the proceedings, and by operation of law, vested the title to all property, real and personal, in the assignee. (U. S. Rev. Stat. 5044; Bump\u2019s Bankruptcy, 10 ed. 485.) The assignee succeeds to the rights of all the creditors, as well as of the bankrupt. (Bump on Bank. 503.) For these reasons, if for no others,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the statute of frauds could have no application to the transfer to the assignee. Moreover, transfers are of two kinds: (1) an act of the parties, (2) or of the law (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1039). The transfer contemplated by Section 3440 is of the first kind; the transfer by reason of the bankruptcy is of the second. <em>(Mays </em>v. <em>Manuf. Nat. Bank, </em>64 Penn. St. 77; <em>In re Lake, </em>3 Biss. 204; S. C., 6 Bank Beg. 543; <em>In re Gregg, </em>3 Bank Reg. 535, 536.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b661-4\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The transfer of the property sued for in this action, if made at all, was made by the assignee of the estate of Curtis in bankruptcy, and not by Curtis, so that at the time of the transfer it was the assignee who was in possession and had control of said property, and there is no evidence which tends to prove that he did not immediately deliver it to the purchaser, or that said sale was not followed by an actual and continued change of possession. Therefore, the transfer can not be conclusively presumed to be fraudulent, as against creditors of the bankrupt. Whether the property, at the time of the seizure of it by the defendant, was the property of the plaintiff, was a question for the jury, or for the Court sitting in place of the jury, to determine; and as we think that the evidence is conflicting, we can not disturb the finding upon that point. It was an inference of fact, and not a presumption of law, that had to be drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">But we think that the Court erred in including in the judgment the sum of three hundred dollars for money expended by the plaintiff in the pursuit of said property. The action is for the recovery of the possession of personal property, and not for the conversion of it. This distinction was pointed out in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>McKibben, </em>54 Cal. 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The judgment must, therefore, be modified by deducting from it said sum of three hundred dollars, and with that modification it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
