Cunningham <em>et al. </em>The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs Daley on the sixth day of June, 1874, executed a mortgage upon certain premises to the Savings and Loan Society to secure a promissory note, etc.; that on the tenth day of June, 1874, the defendant Cunningham entered into a written contract with the plaintiffs Daley to construct a building on the mortgaged premises; that at the same time, and in consideration of the said contract, the said Cunningham, as principal, and the other defendants, as sureties, executed and delivered to said Savings and Loan Society, for the benefit of plaintiffs, their certain bond, etc.; * * * that said bond was upon the express condition, thereunder written, that if the said Cunningham should well and truly complete his said contract, should save, harmless and fully indemnified, the said Annie and John H. Daley and the said Savings and Loan Society of and from all liens, claims, and demands arising or growing out of the furnishing of the material and labor for said buildings, then the said obligation should be void; otherwise that the same should remain in full force and virtue; that the defendant Cunningham failed to perform his contract, and that plaintiffs had been damaged thereby in the sum of six thousand dollars.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-9\"><em>J. E. McElrath, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-10\">The demurrer should have been sustained for misjoinder of plaintiffs. The Daleys were the real parties in interest, and could alone sue on the bond. (\u00a7 367, C. Civ. Proc.; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bartol, </em>7 Cal. 551; <em>Summer </em>v. <em>Farrish, </em>10 id. 347.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-11\"><em>A. N. Drown, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-12\">The demurrer for misjoinder of parties plaintiff did not lie. Both the Savings and Loan Society and the Daleys were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>real parties in interest. The building contract, the performance of which was secured by the bond, was entered into by the Daleys alone, hut the money, as we have seen, was to be paid by the Savings and Loan Society, whose security for repayment was a mortgage upon the land and buildings, which security would of course suffer by a non-completion of the inprovements, Accordingly, the bond was executed to the Savings and Loan Society for the benefit of itself and the Daleys, and for the protection of both. (C. C. P. \u00a7\u00a7 378, 382, 389.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-4\">The Savings and Loan Society was, to a certain extent, that is, so far as it held the bond for the benefit of others, a trustee of an express trust\u2014\u201c a person with whom or in whose name a contract was made for the benefit of another,\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 369); it might perhaps, have sued without joining with it \u201cthe person for whose benefit the action is prosecuted.\u201d But it was not compelled to do so. (Bliss on Code Pleading, \u00a7\u00a7 52, 61, 73 and 75; Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. 7 ed. \u00a7\u00a7 72, 207, 218, 219.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b554-5\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We do not think there was any misjoinder of parties plaintiff in this canse (C.
