In <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>47 Cal. 646, it was held that Section 3666 of the Political Code, as the section read originally, in so far as it delegated to the State Board the power to fix the rate of taxation, \u201cafter allowing for delinquency in the collection of taxes,\u201d was unconstitutional, because it was a delegation of legislative power. That section left it entirely in the hands of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to add any sum of percentage they might deem proper in anticipation of possible delinquencies.

(Const. Cal., Art. xii, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9; Art. i, \u00a7 13; Pol. C., \u00a7 3692; <em>Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>56 Cal. 194.) \u201cThe value is to be ascertained as provided by law.\u201d Potter\u2019s Dwarris on Statutes, etc., 395, 403; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>29 Cal. 449; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sneath, </em>28 Id. 615.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-7\">There is no authority given the Board by the Constitution to levy any tax or to make its assessments of railroad property the basis of taxation; that authority, whatever it may be, is given by the Code. (Pol. C., \u00a7\u00a7 3628, 3664, 3665, 3692, 3693, 3696, and 3713.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-8\">Sections 3664-3665, Pol. C., as amended 1880, are void, because the title of the Act does not designate the Code to which they are added, nor express the subject thereof. (Const. Cal, Art. iv., \u00a7 24; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>January, </em>56 Cal. 1; <em>Earle v.Board of Education, </em>55 Id. 489; <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>University, </em>57 Cal. 612.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-9\">The Board has failed to comply with Section 9, Article xiii, Constitution of California, which requires it to give notice according to some rule of whatever it assumes to do. It has also failed in this regard to comply with the directions contained in Sections 3692-3693, Political Code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-10\">The authority attempted to be conferred, or at least that claimed as being conferred upon the State Board, is in violation of Section 1, Article xiv of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. <em>(In re Ah Fong, </em>3 Saw. 157.) Such power would also be in violation of Subdivision 10, Section 25, Article iv of the Constitution of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-11\">The sworn statement of petitioner, made in due form as required by Section 3664, Political Code, had to be taken as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>true, unless controverted after general investigation. (Pol. C., \u00a7\u00a7 3664, 3693.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-4\">No investigation, evidence, or statement was had or received by the Board, except petitioner\u2019s sworn statement above mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-5\">The attempted assessment of the roadway is void for want of description. The description must be by metes and bounds. (Pol. C., \u00a7 3664.) Sections 3664-5, Pol. C., so far as they attempt to make the assessment of the State Board valid for taxation purposes in counties, cities, towns, townships, and other local taxing districts, are void. (Const. Cal., Art. xii, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13; Art. iv, \u00a7 25, Subd. 9 and 10.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-6\">The order of assessment is made for the year 1881. There is no such fiscal year. The statute authorizing a tax based upon the assessment of the Board, declares that such tax shall be for the fiscal years 33-4. No law has declared that the valuation'made by the State Board of property as it existed on the first Monday in March, 1881, should be the assessment and basis of taxation for the thirty-third fiscal year. If the valuation so made be good under the tax levy act (\u00a7 3713, Pol. C.) for the thirty-third fiscal year, it must of necessity be good for the thirty-fourth fiscal year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">The apportionment is void, because it blends all the items of property in one. (Const. Cal., Art. xiii, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>29 Cal 451; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sneath, </em>28 id. 615.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">The act of assessing and that of equalization arc distinct, and could not have been performed at the same time. No provision is made for the equalization of the assessment after notice and an opportunity for hearing on the part of the owner of the property assessed. <em>(Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>The State Board of Equalization, </em>56 Cal. 194; <em>State Board of Equalization </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Sacramento County.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-9\">Double taxation is forbidden by law; therefore, the Board of Equalization erred in assessing the roadway, roadbed, and rails in the place separately, as they are all together but one\u2014 the road or roadway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-10\">It is the duty of the Board to apportion the amount assessed, and the length of road, to each of the counties, cities and counties, cities, towns, townships, and districts. This the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Board has not pretended to do, but has contented itself with the apportionment to the counties only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-4\">The apportionment is as much a part of the act of assessing as the valuation of the property, and without such apportionment every other act is absolutely void. If Section 3664, Political Code, should be held to mean that the County Boards can make the apportionment for the purposes of local taxation, then the section is in violation of the article and section of the Constitution above referred to, and is void. It would also violate the provisions of Sections 12 and 13, Article xi, of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-5\">The Act of the Legislature commonly known as the Tax Levy, which went into effect May 12, 1881, is void. 1. Because the objects of the Act are not expressed in the title. (Art. iv, \u00a7 24, Const.) 2. Because it confers the power of fixing or levying the tax on the State Board of Equalization. (See Art. xi, \u00a7 13; Art. xiii, \u00a7 6.) The sovereign power of taxation for State use can not be delegated by the Legislature to the State Board of Equalization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>A. L. Hart, </em>Attorney General, for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">The power to make the said assessment, and to apportion the same, is clearly conferred upon the respondent by Section 10 of Article xiii of the State Constitution, and that section is self-executing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Sacramento County.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-8\">It is argued by petitioner, however, that the foregoing provision of the Constitution is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, because, as is alleged by petitioner, no provision is made for the equalization of the said assessment after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the part of the owner of the property assessed; and, in support of this proposition, reliance is placed upon the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States. The vice of this argument is, that it is based upon the assumption that no provision is made in the Constitution for the equalization of assessments made by the State Board of Equalization, when in fact such provision is clearly and unquestionably made. (Const. Cal., Art. xiii, \u00a7 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The only difference between the assessment of this and of other kinds of property, that can be found in the Constitution, is, that the value of the one is primarily determined by the State Board of Equalization, while the other is assessed by .the county assessors and other local authorities. Assessments of this, as of all other kinds of property, go upon the county assessment roll for the purposes of State and county taxation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-4\">The language of Section 9, of Article xiii, conferring upon the Boards of Equalization the. power to equalize by raising or lowering the \u201c entire assessment roll, or any assessment contained therein,\u201d is sufficient, therefore, to cover assessments of the character herein complained of. Plainer or less ambiguous language could not have been used to express the will of the people; and in whatever manner the powers con-* ferred by that section may be distributed, it can not be denied that the sum total of all the powers possessed by both the Boards extend, to the equalization of all kinds and classes of property, whether it belongs to persons or to corporations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">The power to equalize such assessment being conceded, no doubt can remain as to the validity of Section 10, of Article xiii, under the provisions of which the State Board of Equalization unquestionably has the jurisdiction to make the orders herein complained of, and hence this proceeding must be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">It is not conceded, however, that the rule established in, the case of <em>Mulligan </em>v. <em>Smith </em>is applicable to the general tax system under which the revenues of Government are collected. \u201cThe existence of Government depending on the prompt and regular collection of revenue must, as an object of primary importance, be insured in such a way as the wisdom of the Legislature may prescribe. There is a tacit condition annexed to the ownership of property that it shall contribute to the public revenue in such mode and proportion as the legislative will shall direct.\u201d (Cooley on Taxation, 39.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">The power of. taxation is necessarily unlimited in every State, and the doctrine of \u201cdue process\u201d is not applicable to the exercise of that power. ..\u201cA legislative act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>when clearly within the limits of legislative authority, is, of itself, the law of the land.\u201d (Cooley on Taxation, 38; <em>Weimer </em>v. <em>Bunbury, </em>30 Mich. 202.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-4\">It results that the State Board had the power, under the Constitution, to assess the property of the petitioner, and any error committed by that Board, whether of law or of fact, was committed in the exercise of an exclusive jurisdiction conferred by the organic law. (Cooley on Taxation, 533, 534, 527, 540; <em>State R. R. Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S. 575.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-5\">It was proper for the Board to ignore the statement furnished to it by petitioner in the petition, and to proceed to fix the value of and assess the property of petitioner, for the reason that the statement furnished- did not conform to the requirements of Section 3664 of the Political Code, and hence was no statement at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-6\">The statement furnished being lacking in these essentials required by statute, could properly be considered by the Board as no statement at all, and hence ignored by them; and thereupon the Board had but one course to pursue, as designated by statute\u2014to proceed, notwithstanding the failure of petitioner to furnish a proper statement, and fix the value of and assess the property of petitioner; which valuation, when so fixed, is final and conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-7\">It is urged, however, that the assessment of the property.of petitioner was made without notice to petitioner, and without the Board of Equalization having ever made any rules or regulations governing the assessment or valuation of railway property. There is nothing in the Constitution or statutes requiring such notice, or pointing out specifically the manner to be pursued by the Board in making assessments and fixing valuations. This being so, the Board may adopt such a mode of proceeding as appears to it suitable and proper. (C. C. P., \u00a7 187; <em>Mawson </em>v. <em>Mawson, </em>50 Cal. 539; <em>Estate of McCauley, </em>Id. 544.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b40-8\">If petitioner was dissatisfied with the assessment levied against its property, the law provided a remedy: to apply, within five days thereafter, by written petition, to have the assessment corrected in any particular. When such petition is filed, the Board must fix a time for hearing, and must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>upon such hearing, receive such proof as may be offered. (Pol. C., \u00a7 3664.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-4\">The point made in the brief of petitioner, that the State Board of Equalization failed to comply with Section 9, Article xiii of the Constitution, relative to the giving of notice, is entirely without support from the reading of the section referred to. The section has no reference to the original assessment. Such original assessment may be made without notice. The section of the Constitution applies only to proceedings taken by the Board to equalize assessments already made. In the case of petitioner, since no proceedings were taken to change or equalize the assessment after it was made, it is to be presumed that both petitioner and the Board were at the time satisfied with the assessment as made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-5\"><em>James A. Johnson </em>and <em>Lloyd &amp; Wood, </em>for Plaintiffs, in reply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-6\">The power conferred upon the State Board of Equalization relative to the assessment of railroads operated in more than one county is in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-7\">An obligation rests upon every property owner to contribute his proportionate share to the support of the Government. To enforce this obligation, the Constitution of the State of California provides a system applicable to the great mass of property, the salient features of which are that all property shall be taxed in proportion to its value, to be ascertained as provided by law. (Art. xiii, \u00a7 1.) That property shall be assessed in the county, city, or district in which it is situated, in the manner prescribed by law. (Art. xiii, \u00a7 10.) That the Boards of Supervisors must equalize the valuation of the taxable property of the county (Art. xiii, \u00a7 9), and that a State Board of Equalization shall equalize valuations as between the counties. (Id.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-8\">This system requires legislation to carry it into effect\u2014the manner of assessment and the means by which the proportions are to be ascertained are left to legislation, except in so far as means for the latter purpose are found in the constitutional requirements relative to the Boards of Equalization. The legislation providing the manner of assessment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>means of ascertaining proportions must be had in subordination to the constitutional provisions that \u201c all laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation\u201d (Art. i, \u00a7 12); that \u201cno local or special laws\u201d shall be enacted \u201cfor the assessment or collection of taxes\u201d (Art. iv, \u00a7 <em>25, </em>Subd. 10); that \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d shall not be granted to any citizen or class of citizens \u201c which, upon the same terms, shall not be granted to all citizens\u201d (Art. i, \u00a7 21); and that no person shall \u201c be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d (Art. i, \u00a7 13.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-4\">All of the safeguards compatible with the power involved, are thrown around its exercise. The right of local self-government is acknowledged, for the assessment must be made by local officers. That each person is to pay a local tax in proportion to the value of his property, is admitted in the creation of a local board to adjust proportions. That the State tax is to be apportioned so that equality is preserved between the taxpayers of different localities, a State board has been created to adjust proportions between the localities; but above all, the right of every person to be heard, at some point of time before his liability becomes fixed, is recognized as a fundamental principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">Having instituted this system, co-extensive in its operation with the territorial limits of the power levying the tax, and including within its scope all kinds of property, the same Constitution provides: \u201cThe franchise, roadway, roadbed, rails, and rolling stock of all railroads operated in more than one county in this State, shall be assessed by the State Board of Equalization, at their actual value, and the same shall be apportioned to the counties, cities and counties, cities, towns, towships, and districts in which such railroads are located, in proportion to the number of miles of railway laid in such counties, cities and counties, cities, towns, townships and districts.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">Franchises, roadways, roadbeds, rails, and rolling stock, as separate and distinct classes of property, are not withdrawn from the operation of the general rule, for such property, when not owned by railroad companies, or even when owned by railroad companies, the roads of which are operated in a single county, are governed by the general rule</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Property situated partly in one county and partly in another, is not, as a class, so withdrawn, for lands and houses so situated fall within the general rule.

That the Solicitor General shrank from facing such a Court, packed even though it was with a claim that the \u201c High Commission,\u201d in passing upon property rights, \u201ccould make rules for its own government, change such rules as often as it saw fit, and adopt a new rule for each case if it desired so to do.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">Lord High Steward Jeffries\u2019 answer to the Bishop of London, descriptive of the powers of that tribunal, \u201c This Court does not proceed upon written- allegations; its proceedings are summary and by word of mouth; no fixed mode of procedure, no rules of evidence govern its movements,\u201d is the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>description which the Attorney General gives of the powers of the State Board of Equalization.

The order of the State Board is not an assessment for purposes of taxation, the assessment being for the year 1881, there being no such \u201cfiscal\u201d year, and no law declaring the valuation made for \u201c1881\u201d the basis of taxation for the thirty-third or thirty-fourth fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">8. The assessment is <em>void </em>because it blends the several items of property in one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">9. The assessment could only be equalized when petitioner applied to the Board, in the month of September.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-10\">10. The assessment is <em>void </em>because it attempts to assess the same property thrice, the roadway, roadbed, and rails being the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">11. The assessment is <em>void, </em>because the record fails to show that it has been apportioned to the <em>cities, towns, </em>etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">12. The Act of the Legislature which went into effect May 12, 1881, is <em>void: </em>First, because the object of the Act is not expressed in the title; second, it attempts to confer the power of levying a tax on the State Board of Equalization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">After consideration of the points made by counsel for petitioner, we say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-14\">1. Had the Board power to proceed to the assessment without previous and independent ascertainment of the value under some law, order, or rule? In <em>People </em>v. <em>Supervisors of Sacramento County, </em>this Court said: \u201c But it is the manifest intent of the Constitution that the valuation of the railroad property, mentioned in Section 10 of Article xiii, shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>finally fixed and determined by the State Board of Equalization\u2014the State Board has the exclusive power to assess and equalize its value. Thus the Constitution furnishes a system for the assessment of railroads, operated in more than one county, which is separate and distinct from that provided for the assessment of other property. The system is prescribed in Section 10 of Article xiii. \u2018The franchises, roadway, roadbed, rails, and rolling stock of all railroads operated in more than one county in this State shall be <em>assessed </em>by the State Board of Equalization, <em>at their actual value, </em>and the same shall be apportioned to the counties, cities and counties, cities, towns, townships, and districts in which said railroads are located, in proportion to the number of miles of railway laid in such counties, cities and counties, cities, towns, townships, and districts.\u2019 It can not be doubted (if the Constitution is constitutional) that the State Board of Equalization has power thus to assess the railroad property mentioned in Section 10 of Article xiii, and to apportion the same to the several counties, etc. The portion of the section quoted is clearly self-executing. We are at a loss to imagine how any statute could make the duty of the State Board any clearer than does this distinct and positive mandate of the Constitution. If any doubt could possibly be built upon the words cited it would be dispelled by the first clause of the same section. \u2018 All property, <em>except as hereinafter in this section provided, </em>shall be assessed <em>in </em>the county, city, city and county, town, township, or district in which it is situated <em>in the manner prescribed by law.\u2019 </em>Thus by the very language of the Constitution all other but the railroad property mentioned must be assessed by the local assessors, in the manner prescribed by statute; the railroad property must be assessed in the manner prescribed by the sections of the Constitution.\u201d (8 Pac. L. J. 103.) That is, by the State Board without the aid of statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">2. Are sections 3664-3665 of the Political Code of none effect for the reasons stated in point two, as above stated ? The title of the Act of 1880 (Amendments to the Codes, 1880, p. 5), must be held to be sufficient. It has been repeatedly assumed here, that, under the present Constitution, a title expressing the object of an Act to be \u201cto amend Section-\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of a named Code \u201crelating to\u201d the particular object treated of in the body of the Act, was a compliance with Section 24 of Article iv. The title of the Act now under consideration, shows that the sections added, are to be added to the <em>Political </em>Code, and relate to the object already mentioned. If, therefore, the attempt to amend Sections 3664-3665, in 1881, failed by reason of' the amendment not receiving the necessary majority, the action of the State Board in assessing the petitioner\u2019s property may be upheld.by the Act of 1880.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">But the Board had the power under the <em>Constitution. </em>It may be admitted that the Legislature may prescribe their mode of procedure; limit the period in each year within which the Board can assess; determine how their records shall be kept; regulate their conduct to any extent which does not detract from their powers, nor relieve them of duties imposed by the Constitution. Under the Constitution no other officer or board can assess the property of railroads, operated in more than one county, and the State Board is commanded to assess it at its <em>actual value. </em>If the Legislature fails to regulate the mode, the power and duty is in the State Board of Equalization to assess at the actual value. It is of the <em>assessment </em>that petitioner complains. The Legislature can not relieve the railroad property of all taxation by neglecting to add further machinery to the sufficient direction which is found in the self-executing mandate of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">3. In answer to the subdivisions of point three we say: <em>(a) </em>Section 9 of Article xiii, so far as it relates to the State Board, has reference to the equalization of assessments <em>between cowrvties. (b) </em>The ninth subdivision of Section 3692 of the Political Code also refers to the equalization between counties; and Sections 3692 and 3693, if they attempt to provide for the equalization of individual assessments, are void. <em>(Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>56 Cal. 194.) (c) The particular provision of the Constitution of the United States claimed to be violated by the provision of the State Constitution is found in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment: \u201cNo State shall deny to any person the equal protection of the laws.\u201d The Constitution of the State requires <em>all </em>property to be assessed at its actual value. We are unable to see how the fact that the value of one kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>property is to be ascertained by one officer or Board and the value of another kind of property by another officer or Board \u25a0\u2014each clothed with the duty and responsibility of ascertaining the <em>actual </em>value\u2014can be held to operate a deprivation of legal protection to the owners of either kind of property. The State Board in the one case, the Assessors and County Boards in the other, are but different instrumentalities through which the same result is reached; the fair and just valuation by reference to the same standard\u2014and therefore the equal and uniform valuation \u2014 of property for purposes of taxation. <em>(d) </em>As to the proposition that Section 10 of Article xiii, conflicts with Subdivision 10 of Section 25 of Article iv without pausing to inquire which of the two provisions should be disregarded if they could not co-exist, it is enough to say that the section of the Constitution first mentioned is not \u201c a local or special law <em>\u201d </em>passed by the' Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">4. In support of the fourth point, as above stated, counsel relies upon Sections 3664 and 3693 of the Political Code. Section 3693 has reference to the equalization of assessments in counties. Section 3664 requires the President, or some officer of a corporation operating a railroad in more than one county, to furnish the State Board with a sworn statement of its property and values. It is added that if the corporation shall fail to furnish the statement, the State Board shall fix the value and proceed to assess the property of the corporation so failing, the valuation fixed by the Board to be final and conclusive. But the Constitution imposes the duty of <em>assessing </em>the property of the corporations upon the State Board of Equalization. The provision of the Code ought not to be construed, and can not fairly be construed, to make each railroad corporation the assessor of its own property, in case it chooses to file a statement. Doubtless the Board will place much reliance upon the statements, and will start with a presumption that they are correct, but if satisfied that property has been omitted from them by mistake, or that the valuation inthemeontainedis too low,must performits duty of assessing <em>all </em>of the property at its \u201c actual value.\u201d If the statement is not furnished, the valuation of the Board becomes \u201c final and conclusive.\u201d This is to be read in connection with the clause in the same section: \u201cAny person dissatisfied with an assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ment made by said. Board of Equalization against his or its property may, within five days after such assessment is made and entered of record on the books of said Board, by written petition, apply to said Board to have the same corrected in any particular.\u201d Where no \u201c sworn statement\u201d is filed, the corporation is cut off from its right to appeal to the Board, within five days, to have its first assessment corrected. And since it is only where a statement has been presented that the application can be made to have the assessment corrected, the assessment made by the <em>Board, </em>after the statement is furnished, is the one which may be corrected. It was certainly not the purpose of the statute to allow the corporation to complain of\u2014and have corrected\u2014its own sworn statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">The foregoing, of course, is (as are the points of petitioner) based upon the assumption that the section of the Code is valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\"><em>The </em>description of the \u201croadway\u201d is sufficient. The statute reads: \u201cBy metes and bounds, or <em>other </em>description sufficient for identification.\u201d Here the <em>termini, </em>courses, and distances are given. The law fixes the width.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">6. In support of the sixth point, petitioner cites the Constitution (Art. xi, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13; Art. iv, \u00a7 25). Even if the Sections 3664 and 3665 were of none effect, so far as they make the assessment the basis of city and town taxation, the assessment before us would be valid. It is not necessary, in the present case, to decide whether Section 10 of Article xiii intends to make the assessment by the State Board of railroad property the assessment upon which the taxes in cities, etc., of such property, shall be collected for local purposes. If such is the proper interpretation of Section 10, Article xiii, it is to be read in connection with the other provisions. Each provision of the Constitution is to be given its proper effect. If in one section a power is specially conferred, or a duty specially enjoined, which, in general terms, is prohibited by other sections, the power or duty specially conferred or enjoined constitutes an exception to the general rule; the direction to employ the power or discharge the duty in the particular instance, is as mandatory as the general prohibition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">7. The tenth Section of Article xiii provides, that the railroad property shall be assessed by the State Board; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Political Code, Section 3692, that the State Board shall assess such property <em>annually, </em>on or before the first Monday in March. The very notion of an assessment involves the fixing of values as of a certain date, since there is no mode of making the valuation vary with the increased or. diminished value during the current year, and, if there were, such varying valuations would be destructive of established principles of uniformity. The annual valuation by the State Board, which precedes the fixing of the rate of taxation, applies to the rate which for State purposes is fixed for two years, and' for county (city, etc.) purposes, perhaps, for a single year. The order of assessment made on or before the first Monday of March need not declare the particular fiscal year or years to which it is applicable. It is made applicable, by fair construction of the Constitution and Statutes, to the orders fixing the rate of taxation which next succeed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">8. The order of assessment does assess separately the franchise, roadway, roadbed, rails, and rolling stock\u2014the several subjects of taxation mentioned in the Constitution and Code. (Art. xiii, \u00a7 10; Pol. C., \u00a7 3692.) It is not necessary, therefore, to determine whether it is obligatory on the Board separately to specify the several items of railroad property. The Constitution does not, in terms, require that the assessed value of each item should be separately <em>apportioned </em>to the several counties; and that the Political Code does not contemplate such separate distribution is sufficiently apparent from Section 3650. That section provides that the Assessor shall prepare an assessment book, in which must be specified in separate columns, under appropriate heads: 1. The <em>names </em>of persons assessed; 2. Land by township, etc.; 3. City and town lots; 4. Personal property, showing number, kind, etc.; 5. Cash value of real estate, etc.; 6. Of personal property; 7. Money; 8. \u201cThe assessment of the <em>franchise, roadbed\u2019\u2019 </em>etc., such as may have been made by the State Board and furnished to him; * * * 14. Total value of all property. It thus appears that while as to assessments made by the Assessor the kinds are to be separately stated, the assessment by the State Board of the \u201c franchise, roadbed,\u201d etc., is entered in one column and as a single item,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>9. It is true, that by Section 3664, the assessment of railroad property must be made (as in the ease before us it was in fact made) on or before the first Monday of May. It is also true that by the same section the Board must meet on or before the third Monday of August' to equalize the valuation of property as between the several counties. But a reconsideration of the assessment (or equalization) of railroad property can only be made by the State Board in case a petition shall be filed by a party interested, within <em>five days </em>after the assessment is made and entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">10. \u201c The roadbed is the foundation on which the superstructure of a railroad rests.\u201d (Webster.) The roadway is the right of way, which has been held to be property liable to taxation. <em>(Appeal of N. B. &amp; M. R. R. Co., </em>32 Cal. 499.) The rails in place constitute the superstructure resting upon the roadbed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">11. Even if, as claimed, the assessment is not apportioned to cities, etc., the orders are nevertheless valid. The Constitution does not require that the apportionment to counties and to cities, etc., shall be one act. <em>Non constat, </em>but apportionment has been made to cities, towns, etc. The apportionment to a county is a single act, complete in itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">12. The Act of May 12, 1881, is entitled \u201cAn Act to amend Section 3713 of the Political Code, and to provide for <em>the levy of the tax for State purposes for the thirty-third and thirty-fourth fiscal years.\u201d </em>The title distinctly expresses the single object of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The Act does not attempt to confer the power of levying a tax upon the State Board. In <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>47 Cal. 646, it was held that Section 3666 of the Political Code, as the section read originally, in so far as it delegated to the State Board the power to fix the rate of taxation \u201c after allowing for delinquency in the collection of taxes,\u201d was unconstitutional, because it was a delegation of legislative power. That section left it entirely in the hands of the Board to add any sum or percentage they might deem proper in anticipation of possible delinquencies. Such attempted delegation of legislative power is not found in the Act now under consideration. The Board is commanded to add twelve per centum, neither more nor less, for delinquencies. The twelve per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>cent, is as definitely fixed as is any portion of the tax levied by the law-making power.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Boss and McKee, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
