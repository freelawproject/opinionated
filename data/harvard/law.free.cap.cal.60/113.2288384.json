Nevertheless, during the said months of February, March, April, May, and June, A. D. 1880, at the City and County of San Francisco, upon the building aforesaid, they, the said defendants, as Commissioners aforesaid, had a large amount of concrete work done without advertising for sealed proposals to do the same; and the omission of the said defendants, as Commissioners aforesaid, to make such advertisement was willful, and contrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such case made, and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the People of the State of California.

(\u00a7 1235 <em>et seq.) </em>Mo provision is made for such an appeal, other than by Section 4 of Article vi of the new Constitution, which only gives the appellate jurisdiction. This provision is not self-acting, and no appeal can be perfected thereunder, until the machinery is provided therefor by the Legislature; nor can the proceedings of the Court below be reviewed by this Court, except possibly, on writ of error, as suggested in <em>Ex parte Thistleton, </em>52 Cal. 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>Garber, Thornton &amp; Bishop, </em>for Respondent Dunn.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b137-5\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">This Court has jurisdiction of the appeal.
