Harding, deceased,\u201d whom, it is alleged, was not a party to the action. The only order of substitution attempted to be made in the case of <em>Samuel G. Harding </em>v. <em>George Johnson </em>appears in the record, and is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-12\">\u201c In the Superior Court, City and County of San Francisco, State of California. Samuel C. Harding <em>v. </em>George Johnson. In open Court, August 10, 1882. No. 322. In this cause, on motion of E. B. Drake, Esq., attorney for plaintiff, and suggestion of death of plaintiff, it is ordered that Samuel Newman be and he is hereby substituted as plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b600-13\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">The grounds upon which the writ of review was prayed and granted, were that in the action of Samuel C. Harding against the petitioner the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; and that a judgment was rendered in favor of one Newman, who was not a party to .the action. Neither ground is tenable. The complaint states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction, and the record shows that on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney and suggestion of the death of Harding, the original plaintiff, said Newman, administrator of'Harding\u2019s estate, was duly substituted as plaintiff in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
