Subsequently by a judgment of partition a specific portion of the tract was allotted to M.\u2014 she however, being required by the judgment\u2014in order to equalize the partition, to execute a mortgage to S. upon her allotment for one hundred and eighty-five dollars. Afterwards the interest of M. in the tract allotted to her was sold under execution in the attachment suit, and A. became the purchaser and received his deed, and having been made party to a suit to foreclose the mortgage of S. claimed that his title was paramount to the mortgage.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b649-7\"><em>Held: </em>The plaintiff was entitled to have foreclosure of his mortgage upon whatever interest M. held in the premises in excess of the undivided one half held by her at the time of the levy of A. \u2019s attachment.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-8\">Appeal by the \u2022 plaintiff from, a judgment for defendant Ancker in the Superior Court of San Bernardino County.

(Freeman on Ex., Sec. 835; <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>41 Cal. 325.) The law neither does nor requires idle acts, nor so exercises its powers as to encourage litigation, which would be the case if the Court had made a decree of foreclosure under the authorities cited in appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b649-13\">I.

The defendant Ancker\u2019s title commenced from the time of the attachment levy, as against all persons not parties to the writ, and, therefore, was prior in time and superior to the mortgage lien, if the latter ever attached. <em>(Blood </em>v. <em>Light, </em>38 Cal. <em>656-7; Johnson </em>v. <em>Gorham, </em>6 id. 196.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b650-5\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The plaintiff was entitled to have foreclosure of his mortgage upon whatever interest the defendant, Annie S.
