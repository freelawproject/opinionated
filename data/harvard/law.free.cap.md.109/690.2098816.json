It has been repeatedly held by this Court that if a wife gives to her husband property belonging to her 'separate estate, ox-permits. him to apply it to- his oto use, or he does so- with her knowledge and coxisent, in the absence of proof that it</p>\n<p id=\"Aey\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>was given to him to he held in trust for her use, or of \u00e1 promise by 'the husband at the time to repay it, it will be presumed that \u2019 it was intended as' an absolute gift to him, and she- has no claim therefor against him or his estate. <em>Edelen </em>v. <em>Edelen, </em>11 Md. 415; <em>Kuhn </em>v. <em>Stansfield; </em>28 Md. 210; <em>Farm. &amp; Mer. Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>65 Md. 243; <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>68 Md. 540; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>65 Md. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In the c\u00e1se of <em>Tyson </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>54 Md. 35, the bill- was for divorce and restoration to the wife of the property belonging to her when married, or the value thereof. The Court below granted the divorce and awarded alimony,'but omitted to award to the plaintiff certain property, and because of such omission the appeal was taken from the decree. The property which it was claimed should have been-awarded to the wife, consisted of a legacy to her from her father, '.amdunting to $2,873.75, which had been paid to the husband and wife jointly by the executor of' her father\u2019s estate, \u00e1nd-for which they had-executed a joint release. Her claim was resisted on the ground that the legacy had been appropriated and converted by the husband, with the knowledge and 'Consent of the wife, and without any agreement to'repay It, or to hold it for her use and benefit. The Court, in construing Art. 16', sec. 37 of the Code, said that it was- not conten\u00ed plated \u201cto authorize the Court to annul all \u2019previous-dispositions made by the wife during Coverture by gifts tb her husband or others. *\u25a0 * * If -the husband received and applied the fund, whether money, goods or chattels, or collected <em>choses in action, </em>with the wife\u2019s privity and consent,' and without an agreement or promise to repay or restore it,- no legal obligation rests on the husband to restore it; \u00f1o right of action enures to her, and, to that extent, her rights are extinct. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A decree for divorce has no retroactive effect; <em>per se, </em>it does not legally restore' the <em>status quo </em>of the parties before marriage, or annul their voluntary and legal acts diiring coverture. \u2019 \u2018 '</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\"><em>Bishop, </em>treating of the consequences of divorce flowing by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>law, says: \u201cComing now to consider the effect of the dissolution of a valid marriage, upon property rights, we must remember that the decree of divorce, so far from undoing the original marriage, expressly affirms it, and, therefore, does not restore the parties to their former condition, but places them in a new one. Consequently all transfers of property which were actually executed either in law or fact abide; for example, the personal estate of the wife reduced to possession by the husband remains his after a divorce, the same as before.\u201d 2 <em>Bishop, </em>706. Again (p. 731), referring to the effect of a' divorce <em>a mensa: </em>\u201cThis divorce does not at common law, and without statutory aid, change the relation of the parties as to property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Assuming that the Code confers on the Court the power of awarding the wife all the property she had during coverture, as well as that 'possessed prior and at the time of the marriage, that power must be qualified by the rights acquired by the husband, or others through him, claiming with her privity and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">If the effect of knowledge and acquiescence on the part of the wife was sufficient to destroy her right as creditor in this case, unless there was an agreement or promise of the husband to repay, it follows necessarily that the conversion of the money by the husband, with the wife\u2019s concurrence, and her conjoint act and deed, must equally destroy her right to recover it as her separate properly, after divorce, after tho lapse of a series of years, without any promise or agreement of the husband to return or to repay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">There was no loan or trust created between them, but the transaction amounted to an absolute gift. The wife exercised her <em>jus disponendi </em>absolutely and without reserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Under the averments of the hill, viz, that <em>she. </em>purchased and paid for the property, and that <em>she </em>caused it to be conveyed to herself and her husband, the appellant would not, therefof\u00e9, be entitled to the relief prayed. '</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">But a great deal of evidence was produced by the plaintiff tending to show that she was induced against her will to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the property so conveyed, by the conduct and persistent demands of her husband, and by the defendant, for the purpose of showing that the conveyance was the result of her free and voluntary act; and while, as was said in <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Loeber, </em>75 Md. 195, under Art. 5, sec. 86 of the Code, where there were no exceptions in the Court below to the evidence, or to the sufficiency of the averments of the bill, we may decree according to the proof, \u201cwhether the <em>all\u00e9gala </em>and <em>probata </em>correspond or not,\u201d we think, as the bill was filed and the evidence was offered on the theory that the Court was authorized under sec. 37 of Art. 16 of the Code, to restore the property to her, apart from any question of its having been procured by coercion or undue influence, and the attention of her counsel was not, therefore, specially addressed to that feature of the case, that the case should be remanded in order that the bill may be amended, and the parties may have an opportunity to offer additional evidence, if they desire to do so, reflecting upon the question of fraud, coercion or undue influence in the procurement of the deed to the plaintiff and defendant as \u201ctenants by the entireties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In 2 <em>Story\u2019s Eq. </em>see. 1395, the author, after stating that it is now the established doctrine in equity that a married woman may bestow her separate property upon her husband, as well as upon a stranger, says: \u201cBut, at the same time, Courts of equity examine every such transaction between husband and wife, with anxious watchfulness and caution and dread of imdue influence; and if they are required to give sanction or effect to it, they will examine the wife in Court, and adopt other precautions to ascertain her unbiased will and wishes.\u201d A similar expression of the jealous care with which Courts of equity guard the interests of the wife in such transactions is found in <em>Farmer\u2019s Executor </em>v. Farmer, 39 N. J. Eq. 216, where the Court held that gifts by a wife to her husband \u201care to be closely inspected on account of the danger of improper influence, but if they appear to have been fairly made, and to be free from coercion and undue influence, they ought to be sustained.\u201d And in the case of <em>Liv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>ingston v. </em>Hall, 73 Md. 386, Chife Judge Alvey refers to the above section of <em>Story\u2019s Eq., </em>and says that \u201cit has been held by Courts of high authority, and upon full and careful consideration, that a gratuitous conveyance by a wife of her property to her husband will be held void, unless it affirmatively appears from, the attending circumstances, Or 'otherwise, that it was her voluntary act, free from any undue influence exercised by her husband.\u201d See also <em>Bradish </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>3 Johns. Ch. p. 589; <em>Parks </em>v. <em>White, </em>11 Ves. 222; <em>Whitridge v. Barry, </em>42 Md. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\"If, therefore, the interest Of the appellee in the property referred to in this case was' obtained by him by coercion or undue influence brought to bear\u2019 by him upon the appellant, it is the plain duty of a Court of equity to grant her relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">' We fully Concur in the conclusion reached by the Court below, and for the reasons stated and Upon the authorities cited by that OoUrt, that; as the result of the divorce, the appellant and appellee1 \u2019now hold the property as tenants in common. Rut for the reasons we have'stated the decree will be reversed, and the case be remanded, in Order that the bill may be amended and'the parties ihay produce additional evidence if they'd\u00e9sir\u00e9 to do1 so. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\n<em>Decree reversed and case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with views herein expressed, the costs in this Court and in the Court below to abide the final decree in the case.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
