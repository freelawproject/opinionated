Under that statute, when the Court ratifies and confirms a tax sale reported to it by the Collector of Taxes, the purchaser acquires a good <em>prima facie </em>title, and the burden of proof to show that the proceedings were irregular is thrown upon the person attacking the sale.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-11\">The local law of Baltimore (City Code, 1879), Art. 47, sec. 44, provided that no sale should be made by the Collector for non-payment of taxes until he has first given notice to the person in arrear, or left at his residence, a statement of the indebtedness and not less than thirty days\u2019 notice of his intention, if the bill be not paid, to enforce payment thereof.

Code of 1878, Art. 11, sec. 49) provided that tax sales should be made on the premises or at the Courthouse door. The Act of 1878, ch. 227, relating to such sales in Baltimore City, contained no direction as to the place where the sale should be made. <em>Held, </em>that the general law, being in conflict with the local, did not control in this respect in said city; that under the local law the place of the sale was left to the discretion of the City Collector, and that a sale made by him at the Exchange Sales Booms, where it was customary to make such sales, after due notice by advertisement, was valid.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b681-6\">A collector of taxes executed a deed to the purchaser for the property sold for taxes by his predecessor in office, whereas such deed should have been executed by the collector who made the sale.

The pi\u2019operty involved is leasehold property Nos. 40 and 42 Marsh Market Space, in Baltimore City. The title of the appellees is that of remaindermen under the will' of Edward Bums. The appellant\u2019s title is a tax title derived as follows: The property in fee was sold by Baltimore City through City Collector Webb on October 15th, .1879, for taxes in arrears;-the City was the purchaser at that sale. Afterwards the tax deed was made to the City by City Collector Taylor, and on March 19th, 1884, the City sold the said property at public sale to the appellant for $1,300, and on said date conveyed the property by a fee simple deed to the appellant, and cn the date of said deed the appellant went into possession of the property and has had possession ever since. The appellees as remaindermen from the accrual of their title, being out of possession for only about sixteen years, are not barred by limitation, and they attack the appellant\u2019s fax title upon the ground that the said tax title is in several respects irregular, void and invalid. The three special grounds assigned for the invalidity of the appellant\u2019s tax title are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-6\">1. The <em>place </em>of tax sale, to wit, the Real Estate Exchange Sales Rooms, was not the place assigned for such tax sales under the law of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-7\">2. That-the notice to the delinquent tax debtor given in this case planted in red ink across the face of the tax bills was not as prescribed by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b682-8\">3. That the cui'ative Acts of 1904, chapters 281 and 386, which were intended to remedy the defect of the tax deed for said property by City Collector Taylor to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and not by City Collector Webb, who made the tax sale, was void because these Acts destroyed a vested right of the appellees. The lower Court ruled, that for the first two reasons given the tax proceedings were invalid, and gave the appellant no title whatsoever to the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>erty in question, and the lower Court refused to pass on the third objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-5\">From the judgment of the lower Court, giving in this ejectment action, for the reason stated, the leasehold property to the appellees, the appellant appealed and contends that the learned lower Court committed error in ruling that the <em>place </em>and <em>notice </em>of said tax sale were contrary to law. Considering now these three objections to the tax sale in question in their order, we have:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-6\">I. <em>Place: </em>The lower Court held that the <em>place </em>at which the tax sale should have been held was <em>\u201ceither on the premises or at the Courthouse door\u201d </em>as prescribed by Code of Public General Law of 1860, Article 81, section 50, which provision was also in the Code of 1878, Article 11, section 49, and that as said tax sale was at the Real Estate Exchange Rooms, and not on the premises or at the Courthouse door, the tax sale was null and void. The answer of the appellant to this ruling is that the learned lower Court fell into a patent error in holding that this Public General Law applied or prescribed the mode of procedure or place where such tax sale should be had. The matter of land or ground tax sales for taxes in arrears in Baltimore City was prescribed by a local law for Baltimore City, and that local law governing this tax sale was the Act of 1878, chapter 227; and that this latter Act wisely left the place of land tax sales in the city to the discretion of the City Collector, and that his selection of the Exchange Sales Room, which was fully named and described in the advertisement of sale, was in perfect conformity with this Act of 1878.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b683-7\">II. <em>Notice: </em>The learned lower Court held that the requirement of the notice to delinquent taxpayers was prescribed by Ordinance of Baltimore City Mo. 46, of June 2, 1862 (Baltimore City Code of 1879, Article 47, section 44), and that it had not been complied with by the City Collector, and this defect made the tax sale null and void. The appellant denies that this ordinance had anything whatever to do with the terms of this notice, because a General Public Law, Act 1874, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>chapter 483, section. 48, prescribed what this notice should contain, and that the notices printed across the face of two of the tax bills was an exact compliance with what this .Court in <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, </em>86 Md 441, 442, said was what this general law. requires the. notice to contain; and that the notice on the third tax bill, .while changed in a minor respect in language, was a substantial compliance with what this Court had said in <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, supra, </em>was sufficient. The printed notices across the face of the tax bills which had been approved in <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, supra, </em>was as follows: \u201cNotice\u2014 If this bill is not paid within thirty days from delivery, payment will he enforced by distraint or execution.\u201d And the notice printed on the third tax bill, and which the appellees claimed did not comply with the law, was as follows: \u201cNotice\u2014If this hill is. not paid within thirty days from delivery, <em>it will be subject </em>to distraint or execution.\u201d The legal effect and force of this last-above notice is exactly the same as the first two.. Their. substance, is in every respect legally the same. There is not the slightest force in the contention of the appellees that the above-last notice was not in conformity with the law prescribing the notice. The objection is hypercritical.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b684-5\">. III. <em>Gurative Acts: </em>The curative Acts of 1904 were passed by the Legislature to meet the opinion of this Court as given in the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>96 Md. 529, by which opinion this Court decided that the report of the tax sale as well as the tax deed to the \"purchaser must he made by the City Collector who made the tax sale, and not by his successor in office. As it was found that in most of the tax sales made in Baltimore City neither the report of past tax sales nor the tax deed to the purchaser had lieen made by the City Collector who made the tax sale, but by his successor in office, to remedy this irregularity or defect in the title of a large majority of past tax titles, these Curative Acts of 1904, chapters 281 and 386, were passed. The title of the Act of 1904, chapter 286, conclusively shows that its purpose and object was both retrospective and prospective. This title was as follows: \u201cAn Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>to make <em>all </em>tax sales in the City of Baltimore made by one City Collector and reported, and the property conveyed by his successor in office, or made and reported by one City Collector and property conveyed to (by) his successor in office.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-5\">The tax sale involved in this case was made by City Collector Webb, and the tax deed for property sold at tax sale was made to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore by City Collector Taylor, Mr. Webb\u2019s successor in office; hence, it was necessary to invoke the curative effect of this Act in order to validate the tax title which gave title to the appellant. The appellees insist that this cannot be done, because they claim to permit this Act to have this curative effect on the tax title in question would deprive these appellees of a vested right. The vested right so destroyed as claimed by the appellees is solely and simply permitting the successor in office of the City Collector who made the tax sale to make the tax deed. To claim that the curing of a simple irregularity in the procedure of a public official in making a tax sale, by the Legislature which regulated originally the whole tax procedure, is the destruction of a vested right, does seem calculated to raise a smile on the face of one who hears the statement. If the Legislature had the original power, as it undoubtedly had, as shown by the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forest, supra, </em>to prescribe which City Collector should report the tax sale and make the tax deed, the Legislature unquestionably had also the power to remedy any defect or irregularity of such City Collector by a curative act. . It is difficult to conceive how the remedying of such irregularity or omission can be the destruction of a vested right. All the authorities universally hold that the Legislature has the power to remedy or cure such an omission or neglect of duty of a public official. Some of the many authorities which support the above statement are the following: 6 <em>A. &amp; E. Encyl. Law, </em>940; 26 <em>A. &amp; </em>E. <em>Encyl. Law, </em>998, 999; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Lee County, </em>3 Wall. 331; <em>Randall </em>v. <em>Keiger, </em>23 Wall. 14; <em>Mattingly </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>97 U. S. 690; <em>Steel Co. </em>v. <em>Erskine, </em>39 C. C. A. 173, note. And the following Maryland cases conclusively establish that the Curative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Acts of 1904 destroyed no vested rights of the appellees in the property in question: <em>Grove </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>41 Md. 641; <em>Williar </em>v. <em>Butchers\u2019 Assoc., </em>45 Md. 560; <em>O\u2019Brian </em>v. <em>Balto. County, </em>51 Md. 24; <em>Madigan v. Building Assoc., </em>73 Md. 321; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>91 Md. 7; <em>Miners\u2019 Bank </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>100 Md. 57.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-5\">6 <em>A. &amp; E. Encyl. Law, supra, thus dates the rule of law </em>as to curative acts: \u201cThe general rule has often been declared that the Legislature may validate retrospectively any proceedings <em>which they might have authorized in advance; </em>and it is immaterial that such legislation <em>may operate to divest an individual of a right of action existing in his favor, </em>or subject him to a liability which does not exist originally.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-6\">26 <em>A. &amp; E. Encyl. Law, supra, </em>thus'states the same rule of law as to all curative acts being retroactive and that legislatures could validate any act it might have originally authorized : \u201cAlthough necessarily retroactive, curative acts are not for that reason invalid, for the general rule is that the Legislature <em>can validate any act which it might have originally authorized. </em>Curative acts apply to pending suits unless they are expressly excepted.\u201d In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lee County, supra, </em>it is said: \u201cIf the Legislature possessed the power to authorize the act to be done, it could by a retrospective act cure the evils which existed, because the power thus conferred had been irregularly executed. The question with the Legislature was one of policy, and the determination made by it was conclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-7\">The above quotation was made a part of the opinion of this Court in <em>O\u2019Brian </em>v. <em>Baltimore County, supra. </em>In <em>Williar </em>v. <em>Butchers\u2019 Association, supra, </em>this Court has thus defined a <em>vested right: </em>\u201cA vested right of action is property in the same sense in which tangible things are property, and is equally protected against arbitrary interference. <em>When it springs from contract or from the principles of the common law, it is not competent for the Legislature to take it away.\u201d </em>What City Collector shall report a tax sale or make a tax deed proceeds neither from 'contract nor the principles of the common law, as stated in the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forest, supra; </em>it rests solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>in the power of the Legislature; hence any curative acts to remedy or cure irregularities of the exercise of this power originally conferred and prescribed by the Legislature cannot be said to destroy vested rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-5\">IV. <em>Tax Sale Destroyed All Existing Claims and Liens on Said Property: </em>Since about 1874 the law then passed made aLl tax sales reported to the Circuit Court of Baltimore City and ratified by that Court <em>prima facie </em>good and valid, and put upon the party objecting to the tax sale the burden to show a failure to comply with the law in making said sale, and no presumption can be invoked against the regularity or validity of the sale. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>71 Md. 26; <em>Guisebert </em>v. <em>Etchinson, </em>51 Md. <em>118; Ex Parte Tax Sale, </em>172, 42 Md. 196; <em>Margraff </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>57 Md. 585; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>82 Md. 159; <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>54 Md. 454.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-6\">Vothing whatever has been shown by the appellees to overcome this <em>prima facie </em>case of regularity and validity of the tax sale in question, and hence the appellant under said tax sale has a good and valid fee simple title to the property in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-7\">What, now, is the legal force and effect of the appellant\u2019s tax title on the leasehold estate of the appellees ? It is to wipe the title of appellees as remaindermen out of existence. \u201cIf the tax deed is valid, then from the time of delivery it clothes the purchaser, not merely with the title of the person who had been assessed for the taxes and had neglected to pay them, but with a new and complete title to the land, under an independent grant <em>from the sovereign authority, </em>which bars or extinguishes all prior title and incumbrances of private persons and all equities arising out of them.\u201d <em>Hefner </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>123 U. S. 751. The above exact quotation has been made a part of two opinions of this Court, namely, in <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, </em>86 Md. 438, and <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>104 Md. 604.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b687-8\"><em>S. S. Field </em>and <em>Frank Driscoll </em>(with whom was <em>John E. Dempster </em>and <em>Gill &amp; Preston </em>on the brief), for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-9\">This was an action of ejectment. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>already been passed on by this Court and has been held to show <em>prima facie </em>a title in plaintiffs. <em>Crean </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>106 Md. 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-5\">That was plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. The case was remanded for new trial and a verdict and judgment were rendered for plaintiffs for two-thirds undivided interest and damages for mesne profits, $1,005.58. There are a number of exceptions to evidence, but -the principal point is involved in the Court\u2019s actions on the prayers and motion at the end of the case, and is whether the tax sale title relied on by defendant is void or valid. Another question was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to two-thirds or five-sixths; a third involved the rule for calculating mesne profits; and still another question arose as to the form of the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-6\">In ratifying tax sales, Court acts under <em>special </em>jurisdiction, and unless the <em>recitals of the record show </em>a substantial compliance with all preliminary requisites of the law, the tax sale and title thereunder will be void. <em>Guisebert </em>v. <em>Etchison, </em>51 Md. 487; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>96 Md. 534; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>82 Md. 155.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-7\">In the <em>tax </em>proceedings set up by defendant in this case, the-following defects appear, mentioning them in the order of time without reg\u2019ard to the order of importance:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-8\">(1) The preliminary notice was insufficient. It was: \u201cIf this bill is. not paid within thirty days from delivery <em>it </em>will be subject to distraint or execution.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b688-9\">\u2022 Literally this means nothing, but reading it to mean that <em>the property </em>will be subject to distraint or execution, it simply tells what the <em>law will authorize the collector </em>to do. But the law requires the collector to notify the taxpayer what <em>he intends to do, </em>not what the law would authorize him to do, and he might or might not do. Everyone is presumed to-know the law, but cannot know the collector\u2019s intention, until he tells them, and therefore the law requires the collector to put on the tax bill notice of what he intends to do. \u201cA notice annexed thereto that unless the taxes so due are paid within thirty days thereafter <em>he will proceed </em>to collect the same by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>way of distress or execution to be levied on said real or personal property.\u201d <em>Rev. Code, </em>1878, Art. 11, sec. 48. Compare <em>City Code, </em>1879, Art. 49, sec. 44, page 1084.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-5\">This is a fatal defect. <em>Guisebert </em>v. <em>Etchison, </em>51 Md. 487 (see 3rd prayer on page 481, approved on page 488); <em>Benzinger </em>v. <em>Gies, </em>87 Md. 707-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-6\">Two of the tax bills appearing in the record have the right notice on them, but the third has a defective notice, like that in the report. It looks as though they used the right notice in 1876 and 1877, and began to use the insufficient one in 1878, and therefore naturally used the insufficient one in 1879, when the notice was served on Mr. Crean. At all events, the only evidence of what notice was on the tax bills delivered to Mrs. Crean is the statement in the report: \u201cThat upon each of such bills so delivered was printed a notice, as follows: Tf this bill is not paid within thirty days from delivery, it will be subject to distraint or execution.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-7\">The report does not say that the bills <em>filed with the report </em>are copies of the bills <em>delivered to Mrs. Crean, </em>but merely that the bills filed contain copies of the entries on the assessment books.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-8\">Accordingly, on these bills in the record you find no commissions, interest, penalty, or footing; all of which were, of course, on the bills delivered Mrs. Crean.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-9\">(2) The notice of sale was insufficient, if the general law on that subject governs, because that requires the notice to be set up at the Courthouse door, which was not done. <em>Rev. Code, </em>1878, Art. 11, sec. 49; <em>Baumgartner </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>82 Md. 632, 640.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-10\">But if the Court considers the local law exclusive, then the notice was sufficient. <em>City Code, </em>1879, Art. 49, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-11\">(3) Sale void because made at Real Estate Exchange, whereas law requires it to be made at Courthouse door or on premises. <em>Revised Code, </em>Art. 11, sec. 49; <em>Code, </em>1860, Art. 81, sec. 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b689-12\">The general law governs the place of sale because there was no provision of the local law on that point. <em>City Code, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>1879, Art. 49, sec. 5; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>71 Md. 26; <em>App. Tax </em>Ct. v. W. M. R. R., 50 Md. 296.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-6\">(4) Mo title passed because <em>luhole </em>purchase money not paid. <em>Rev. Code, </em>1878, Art. 11, sec. 51; <em>City Code, </em>1879, Art. 49, sec. 48, and sec. 7, and sec. 10. Report of collector shows property sold for $1,025.00, and only $326.25 paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-7\">(5) Title defective because deed not made by collector who made sale, as required by <em>City Code, </em>1879, Art. 49, sec.7, sec. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-8\">The purchaser has no <em>legal </em>title until he gets the Collector\u2019s deed. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>88 Md. 421; <em>City Code </em>(1879), Art. 49, sec. 49, page 1086.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-9\">And the Collector who made the sale must make the deed (as the law then was) ; a deed by a subsequent Collector conveyed no title available to the purchaser in ejectment. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>96 Md. 533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-10\">The Court below held the title set up by defendants void because of the first and third defects above mentioned. That these were fatal defects is demonstrated by the clear and logical opinion of the Court below, which gives full references to the law then governing tax sales.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-11\">That the fifth defect, that the deed was not made by the Collector who made the sale is fatal, has been decided by this Court in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>above quoted. But the defendant relied on the Act of 1904, chapter 281, to cure this defect. We submitted to the Court below by our fourth and fifth prayers that it was not within the power of the Legislature to validate a prior tax proceeding which was void, and by legislative fiat give defendant a title when before the Act he had none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b690-12\">The situation seems to us clear. On the day before this Act of 1904 was passed plaintiffs had a title on which they could recover in ejectment and McMahon had no'title, as expressly decided by this Court in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forrest. </em>Mow, if after the Act McMahon has a title by which he can defeat plaintiffs\u2019 ejectment, then the Act of the Legislature has divested plaintiffs of their title\u2014their vested rights in land\u2014-'and has vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>a title in defendants. This the Legislature could not do. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>10 L. R. A.

The lot was a leasehold, subject to an annual ground rent of two hundred and forty dollars. The title to this leasehold was acquired by Edward Burns under an assignment from Benjamin V. Eichardson. The property is located on the west side of Market Space in Baltimore City, and at the time of the death of Edward Bums was improved by two brick houses, known as ATumbers 40 and 42 Marsh Market Space. Bums bequeathed the property to Charles and Catherine Orean during their lives, and immediately after the death of the survivor \u201cunto the living issue of the aforesaid Charles and Catherine Crean, share and share alike, absolutely.\u201d Charles Crean died in 1884, and Catherine, the surviving life tenant, in 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">. The State and City taxes on this property for the years 1876, 1877 and 1878 being in arrears and unpaid, it was sold on October 15th, 1879, for non-payment of these taxes by Charles Webb, the Collector of City and State Taxes. The sale was made at the Exchange Building, on Second Street, in the City of Baltimore, and was sold to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in fee, $1,025.00. The sale was reported by Mr. Webb, the Collector, to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and was by that Court finally ratified and confirmed on.the 22nd day of September, 1882. The prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>-erty was conveyed to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore by Henry S. Taylor, Collector, by deed dated December <em>U, </em>1883, and on March 19, 1884, by deed of that date, the City, in consideration of the sum of thirteen hundred dollars, granted and conveyed the property to the defendant in this \u25a0suit, who paid the full purchase price and took possession of the property on the date of the deed, and has been in continuous possession to the present time. At the date of the purchase by the defendant the property was in bad condition and was not tenantable, and in order to put it in condition to be \u2022rented Mr. McMahon was obliged to spend from sixteen to eighteen hundred dollars for necessary repairs. The improve\u25a0ments placed by him upon the property were destroyed by the great fire of 1904, and the property was rebuilt by the defendant at a cost of about five thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u25a0 The case was tried below before the Court without the intervention of a jury and resulted in a vei\u2019dict and judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendant has brought this appeal. In a <em>per curiam </em>opinion filed December 9th, 1908, we said: \u201cIt is admitted that the'suit must fail if the appellant acquired a good title under the tax sale and the deed mentioned. The Court below held that the defendant took no title under the tax sale\u2014first, because the preliminary notice given was insufficient, and, secondly, because the place of sale was not that authorized by law. The property was sold at the Exchange Sales Room, but, in the opinion of the Court below, the property could only be sold either on the premises or at the Courthouse door of the City. Some additional reasons .have been urged against the defendant\u2019s title. It is insisted he took no title under the deed because the deed was not made by the Collector who made the sale. We hold that the proceedings under which the tax sale was made show a sufficient compliance with all the prerequisites of the law relating to tax sales in Baltimore City, and that the defect urged against the deed upon which the defendant relies has been cured by subsequent legislation. We decide that the defendant has shown a good title to the land sued for, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>judgment must be reversed without awarding a new trial.\u201d That judgment was accordingly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Assuming for the moment the validity of the proceedings under which the tax sale was made, and that the deeds of December 7th, 1883, and March 19, 1884, operated to pass the legal title to the property first to the Mayor and City Council and then to the defendant, it cannot be questioned that the last-named deed afforded the defendant a complete bar to recovery in this suit. We said in <em>Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, </em>86 Md. 438, that \u201cthe title of the defendant is founded upon and derived from the tax sale <em>(Burroughs on Taxation, </em>346; <em>Hussman </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>165 U. S. 147; <em>Hefner </em>v. <em>North Western Ins. Co., </em>123 U. S. 751), for although he did not purchase at the tax sale, his grantor, the City, did, In <em>Hefner </em>v. <em>The Insurance Company, supra, </em>it is said: \u201cIf the tax deed is valid, then from the time of its delivery it clothes the purchaser, not merely with the title of the person who had been assessed for the taxes and had neglected to pay them, but with a new and complete title in the land, under an independent grant from the sovereign authority, which bars and extinguishes all prior titles and incumbrances of private persons, and all equi ties arising out of them.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>104 Md. <em>604; Hill </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>106 Md. 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Before the passage of the <em>Act of 1872, chapter 884 </em>(Code, 1904, Art. 81, sec. 53), which required the Collector to report the sale, together with all the proceedings had in relation thereto to the Court for confirmation, a sale made by a Collector of Taxes could only be supported upon it being made to appear <em>affirmatively </em>that all. the provisions of the statute, authorizing the sale, had been strictly complied with. The power of sale vested in a Collector of Taxes is a naked pqwer, specially conferred by statute, to be exercised under a proceeding <em>ex parte </em>in its character, and the effect of which is to divest a citizen of his property without his consent, and often without his actual knowledge. It was therefore established, as an indubitable principle, that a purchaser, who claimed under a power of this nature, should show affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>tively and positively the regularity of the proceedings, upon which his title depended. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>8 Gill, 239-260; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Payton, </em>4 Wheat. 77; <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>6 Wheat. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">But to relieve the purchaser of this <em>onus </em>and to give encouragement t\u00f3 purchasers at tax sales, the statute now in force (Act of 1874, chapter 483, section 51) provides that the Collector shall report the sale and the proceedings in relation thereto to the Courts mentioned in the.Act; and the Court, to which such report shall he made, shall examine the said proceedings, and if the same <em>appear to- be regular, </em>and the provisions of law in relation thereto- have been <em>complied with, </em>shall order notice to be given by advertisement, etc., to show cause, if any they have, why said sale shall not be ratified and confirmed; and if no sufficient cause be shown against the ratification, \u201cthe said sale shall, by order of said Court, be ratified and confirmed, and the purchaser shall, on payment of the purchase money, have a good title to the property sold.\u201d This statute confers upon the Courts designated a special and limited jurisdiction, which attaches upon the report of the Collector; and though the sale may be confirmed by the Court, the order of confirmation operates only to relieve the purchaser of the <em>onus </em>of proof, and to- east the <em>onus </em>of showing the illegality of the proceedings upon the party resisting the s\u00e1lei The effect; therefore, of the order of ratification is only <em>prima facie </em>in support of 'the sale, not conclusive ; the sale, under the order of confirmation, affording evidence of a good title, until successfully assailed by evidence showing illegality in the proceedings upon which it is founded. Gu<em>isebert </em>v. <em>Etchison, </em>51 Md. 478. Until such proof is offered by the assailing party, the sale, if ratified and confirmed, stands good and effective,' by' operation of statute. <em>Steuart </em>v. <em>Meyer et al., </em>54 Md. 465, 466, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">It is only necessary that there shall be a substantial compliance with the tax law under which the sale was made. <em>Guisebert\u2019s Case, supra; Textor </em>v. <em>Shipley, supra. </em>The Court will presume that the Collector has discharged his duty, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>no presumption will be invoked against tbe validity of the proceedings. But where it appears, by the record, or by proof that material and substantial provisions of the law have not been observed in making the sale it will be treated as utterly null and void. Under the Public Local Law of Baltimore City (City Code, 1879, Art. 47, section 44),- no sale could be made by the Collector for the payment of taxes until he has \u201cfirst given to the person or persons so in arrears, or has left at his, her, or their residence, or last known residence, or if neither can be found on the premises, a statement of his, her or their indebtedness, and not less than thirty days\u2019 notice of his intention, if the bill is not paid within the time named, to enforce payment thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In this case the property was assessed to Mrs Crean, one of the life tenants, and the bills for taxes setting forth the amount of the taxes due on the property to the State and City, and specifying the years for which they' were due, were delivered to her. It is true that in the report of the Collector it is stated that on each of the bills delivered to her there was a printed notice stating that if this bill is not paid wdthin thirty days from delivery it will be subject to distraint or execution. Such a notice would be insufficient, because it is not such as the law requires, and if nothing else appeared by the record we would be constrained to hold the sale void. But looking at the whole record of the tax proceedings, it is apparent that this statement in the report of sale is erroneous, as two of the tax bills filed as exhibits with the report of sale contain a notice, printed in red ink across the face of each bill, to the effect that if the bill is not paid within thirty days from the delivery, payment thereof will be enforced by distraint or execution. These exhibits are copies of the entries in the assessment books of the City, and, as we understand the report, they are identical with the bills delivered to the owners. If, however, there should be any doubt upon this point, it should be resolved in favor of the validity of the sale, in the absence of satisfactory proof that this notice was not given. We are of opinion that these tax bills and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the notice printed thereon show the character of the preliminary notice given by the Collector, and are sufficient to gratify the requirements of the law in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>As to the place of sale. </em>The property was sold at the Exchange\u2018Sales Room. This was held by the learned Judge below to be a defect which rendered the sale void.' He held that under <em>Article 11, section 49 of the Code of 1878, </em>the only places at which tax sales in the City of Baltimore could be made were either on the premises or at the Courthouse door of the City. It-has not been the custom in the city to make \u2022tax sales at either -of these places, nor has it been the understanding of the City authorities that the law imposed such a requirement. Such a construction would unsettle many tax titles. This consideration, it is true, should not control the action of the Court if it appears that a plain mandate of the law has been disregarded; but the Court should not be insensible to the serious consequences which would inevitably result from such a construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In making this sale the Collector .proceeded under the <em>Act of 1878, chapter 227, </em>which made provisions for the sale of ground in Baltimore City\u25a0 for non-payment of'taxes. That Act provided that \u201cwhenever it shall become necessary to sell any part or parcel, of ground in the City of Baltimore, improved or unimproved, for the payment of any taxes or assessment of any nature or kind whatever, levied or charged, the Collector-shall first give notice by advertisement published once a week for four' successive weeks in two \u2022 of the daily newspapers published in said City, one of which shall be in the German language, that he will sell at public auction on the day in said advertisement mentioned; said notice shall state the name of the person, when'known, to whom such parcel of ground is assessed, the amount of taxes due on the same, and what improvements, if any, are on said parcel of ground; and in any such notice it shall be sufficient to describe the parcel of ground as located upon' whatever official plat of the City the said Mayor and'City Coitneil of Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>more shall from time to time adopt and designate for that purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">This Act contained no direction as to the place of sale, but left that, we think, very properly and wisely, to the judgment and discretion of the City Collector. A comparison of the terms of this Act with the section of the Code of 1878 mentioned above will show the most irreconcilable conflict. This, in connection with the evident purpose of the legislature to provide by local law a different procedure for the sale of land in Baltimore City for the non-payment of taxes, is sufficient, upon familiar principles of statutory construction, to show that the place of sale named in the general law was not intended to control sales made under the <em>Act of 1878, chapter 227. </em>We are, therefore, of opinion that the tax sale was valid and its ratification by the Court vested in' the purchaser, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, under the statute, a good title to the property sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Hnder the authority of the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Forrest, </em>96 Md. 529, Henry S. Taylor, Collector, had no power to execute a deed to the Mayor and City Council for the property sold by his predecessor, Mr. Webb; but this defect has been cured by <em>section, 2 of the Act of </em>190.L <em>chapter 281. </em>This section provided that whenever any property in the City of Baltimore has been sold for taxes, pursuant to law, by one City Collector, and such sale has been reported by the City Collector who made the sale, but the deed for such property has been executed and delivered by the successor in office of the City Collector who made the sale and report as aforesaid, such conveyance shall be as valid to all intent and purposes as it would have been if made by the City Collector who made and reported the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">It would have been a perfectly valid exercise of power by the Legislature to have authorized the successor in office of the City Collector to make the deed, and this Act which validates the deed of such Collector cannot be said to violate any of the vested rights of the owner. His rights in the property were divested by the tax sale. Instead of designating some partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ular person to execute a deed to the purch\u00e1ser for th\u00e9 property sold, the Act merely validates the deed already executed. We see no possible objection to this. For the reasons assigned we reversed the judgment, without awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><em>Judgment reversed without </em>awarding; <em>a new trial. \u2018</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
