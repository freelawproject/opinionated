We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially com-' plies with the requirements of ORS 250.035. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments and conclude that they are not well taken. Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for the proposed measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: ALLOWS LOCAL REGULATION OF PESTICIDE USE, SALE; CREATES NEW PESTICIDE REPORTING PROGRAM, EXISTING PROGRAM UNDISTURBED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: Wes\u201d vote allows local regulation of pesticide use and sale; creates new fee-funded pesticide use reporting program, without altering existing pesticide reporting program, fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains current law providing uniform statewide pesticide use, sale regulation, preempting local regulation; retains existing pesticide reporting program, registration fees; rejects new program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">SUMMARY: Amends constitution. Current law provides uniform, statewide regulation of pesticide use and sale, preempting local regulation. Measure allows local regulation. Current law authorizes and limits pesticide registration fees; requires Department of Agriculture to: establish system for reporting basic pesticide use information specifying quantity, purpose, month of use, product used, use location by watershed, county, zip code or other identifier; collect information annually regarding major pesticide use categories; publish annual report summarizing pesticide use; adopt rules governing public release of use information. Without affecting existing program mandate, measure directs Department of Environmental Quality to: establish similar program that collects major category <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>information monthly and location information that identifies section, township, range where use occurs; and to impose registration fees adequate to fond new program. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Ballot title certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
