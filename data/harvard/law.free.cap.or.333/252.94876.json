They concern the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title for a proposed initiative measure that the Secretary of State has denominated as Initiative Petition 107 (2002). For the reasons explained below, we refer the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(8) (setting out procedure); <em>Flanagan v. Myers, </em>332 Or 318, 323-24, 30 P3d 408 (2001) (applying ORS 250.085(8)).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The proposed measure would amend the Oregon Constitution by adding \u201cas section ll\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the following to Article I:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">\u201cSection 11. Oath of office of judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this constitution every judge of Oregon law, before entering upon the duties of his office, shall publicly take and subscribe, and transmit to the secretary of state, the following oath:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">\u201c \u2018I, _, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the national constitution of the United States of America (A.D. 1789), and the constitution of the Union state of Oregon (A.D. 1859). And when discharging the duties of this office I will give allegiance to no other like jurisdiction, whether foreign or domestic. I will faithfully and impartially, in a manner free of all bias, discharge the duties of a judge of said state, according to the best of my ability. I further swear (or affirm) that I will honor and maintain the separation of powers doctrine and I will not use my official duties to create law from the bench. As an interpreter of law I will not substitute my opinion or preference, or that of any social faction, for the will of the people, but shall adhere strictly to the intent of the framers, both of the law and of the constitution.

Current law requires judges to take oath of office to support the Oregon and federal constitutions, faithfully and impartially discharge duties according to best of their ability, and not accept any office except judicial office during their elective term. Measure requires that judges take oath to support and defend 1789 federal constitution and 1859 Oregon constitution; give allegiance only to Oregon and federal jurisdictions; \u2018honor and maintain separation of powers doctrine;\u2019 set aside personal views or those of any social faction; not \u2018create law from the bench;\u2019 uphold \u2018will of the people;\u2019 adhere strictly to intent of framers of constitution, statutes, common law; defer to legislature to provide intent where framers\u2019 intent is unclear. Measure does not define quoted terms.

We have considered each of his challenges and conclude that none is well taken. We turn to petitioner Pulvers\u2019s challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">As with Mabon, Pulvers challenges each aspect of the ballot title. We begin with the caption, which Pulvers argues is deficient in two respects. First, he contends that the caption does not advise voters that the proposed measure will \u201creplace or supercede the existing, constitutional oath for judges with a new oath.\u201d Second, he contends that the caption \u201cselectively refers only to judicial interpretation of\u2018Law\u2019 \u201d when the subject matter of the proposed measure is to place strict limits on judicial interpretation \u201cboth of the law and of the constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Regarding Pulvers\u2019s first argument, the Attorney General responds that replacing existing oaths is the <em>purpose </em>of the proposed measure, not its <em>subject matter </em>and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to refer to existing oaths in the caption. Moreover, he asserts that \u201cthe phrase in the caption and summary, \u2018Amends Constitution,\u2019 reasonably informs the voters that the proposed measure (and hence, the proposed oath) either adds to, takes away, or changes what already is contained in the constitution\u201d and that the caption appropriately sets out the substance of existing oaths. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Regarding Pulvers\u2019s second argument, the Attorney General contends that the word \u201claw\u201d can be used to refer to all forms of positive law, including constitutional law. He argues that the caption therefore complies with the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The proposed measure provides that \u201cevery judge of Oregon law * * * shall publicly take and subscribe [to] * * * the following oath.\u201d The remainder of the proposed measure sets out the form of oath. The text of the proposed oath incorporates some of the wording of existing oaths, <em>see, e.g., </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 7 (Supreme Court judges); Or Const, Art VII (Original), \u00a7 10 (circuit court judges); ORS 1.635 (pro tempore judges); ORS 1.300(7) (senior judges); ORS 305.455 (Tax Court judge), but the proposed oath makes several additions: It adds the years in which the United States Constitution and the Oregon Constitution were adopted; it commits judges to \u201cgive allegiance to no other like jurisdiction, whether foreign or domestic\u201d; it commits judges to \u201chonor and maintain the separation of powers doctrine\u201d and not to \u201cuse [their] official duties to create law from the bench\u201d; and it commits judges, when interpreting the law, to \u201cadhere strictly to the intent of the framers, both of the law and of the constitution\u201d and to \u201cdefer to the legislative branch to provide\u201d such intent \u201cwhere [it] cannot be discerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The subject matter of the proposed measure is the creation of a new oath for Oregon judges, the crux of which is to commit judges to the framers\u2019 intent regarding the Oregon and federal constitutions and to the legislature\u2019s intent regarding statutes. Pulvers is correct that the Attorney General\u2019s caption does not identify that subject matter reasonably. The caption gives no indication that the proposed measure creates a new oath that replaces or subsumes existing judicial oaths, or that the new oath commits judges to the framers\u2019 intent regarding constitutional law. The caption fails to comply substantially with the statutory requirement that it reasonably identify the subject matter of the proposed measure, and the Attorney General must modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">We turn to Pulvers\u2019s challenge to the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements. He argues that those statements are defective for the same reasons that the caption is defective. He also asserts that the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>refer to deference to the \u201clegislature\u201d when the proposed measure actually refers to deference to the \u201clegislative branch\u201d which, Pulvers claims, could include the people acting in a legislative capacity. The Attorney General concedes that, if Pulvers is correct that the caption must be modified, then conforming changes must be made to the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements. However, the Attorney General argues that Pulvers did not raise his argument about the word \u201clegislature\u201d in his comments to the Secretary of State and, therefore, that this court should not address that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Attorney General is correct. The Attorney General must modify the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements to reflect the changes that he must make to the caption.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We turn to Pulvers\u2019s contention that the summaiy fails to comply with ORS 250.035(2)(d) because it does not summarize concisely and impartially the proposed measure and its major effect. He contends that the Attorney General\u2019s summary is inaccurate and misleading because it states that \u201c[c]urrent law\u201d requires judges to take an oath when, in his view, it is the constitution that contains that requirement. Pulvers also contends that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to state the major effect of the proposed measure which, he asserts, is to \u201calter the fundamental constitutional relationship between the legislative and judicial branches\u201d and to \u201cmandate a fundamental change in the role of the court in the constitutional system.\u201d Finally, Pulvers contends that the statement in the summary that the new oath would require strict judicial adherence to \u201cintent of framers of* * * common law\u201d is a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The Attorney General acknowledges that the reference to \u201ccommon law\u201d in the summary is an error, but he contends that the summary complies substantially with the statutory standard in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We conclude that the Attorney General must correct the defect in the summary that he has acknowledged. However, we reject Pulvers\u2019s remaining arguments concerning the summary. He has not demonstrated that the Attorney General\u2019s use of the word \u201claw\u201d to refer to the source of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>oaths that judges currently must take is inaccurate or misleading. Moreover, it is open to debate how the proposed measure, if adopted, would alter the province of the judiciary in the constitutional system. It is not this court\u2019s role to decide among arguable effects of a proposed measure when the meaning of the proposed measure is not clear. <em>See Carson v. Myers, </em>326 Or 248, 253, 951 P2d 700 (1998) (not appropriate for court to speculate among arguable \u201cmeanings\u201d of measure).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Attorney General must modify the caption, the \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d vote result statements, and the reference to the \u201ccommon law\u201d in the summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Ballot title referred to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> Section 11 of Article I currently enumerates the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-10\"> ORS 250.035(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">\u201cThe ballot title of any state measure to be initiated or referred shall consist of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">\u201c(a) A caption of not more than 15 words that reasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.
