We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out that standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The substantive part of the proposed measure states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">\u201cAny amendments made to Section 18 of Article I of the Constitution of the State of Oregon by the people at the general election held November 7, 2000, are hereby repealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The purpose and effect of the proposed measure, if adopted, would be to repeal Ballot Measure 7 (2000) (Measure 7), an initiative measure approved by the people in November 2000, the constitutional validity of which presently is before this court in two cases, <em>League of Oregon Cities v. State of Oregon </em>(S48450) and <em>McCall v. Kitzhaber </em>(S48451). There was no other \u201camendment! ] made to Section 18 of Article I of the Constitution of the State of Oregon by the people at the general election held November 7, 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Before the November 2000 general election, Article I, section 18, of the Oregon Constitution, provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-10\">\u201cPrivate property shall not be taken for public use * * * without just compensation; nor * * * in the case of the state, without such compensation first assessed and tendered!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Measure 7 would add to the foregoing \u201cjust compensation\u201d or \u201ctakings\u201d provision of the Oregon Constitution a requirement that, with certain exceptions, governments reimburse private property owners for any diminution in the value of their land caused by governmental regulation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>We first consider the Attorney General\u2019s caption. ORS 250.035(2)(a) requires that a ballot title contain a caption of not more than 15 words (not counting, in the case of a proposed constitutional amendment, the words \u201camends constitution\u201d) that \u201creasonably identifies the subject matter of the state measure.\u201d The Attorney General\u2019s caption for the proposed initiative measure states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REPEALS ANY 2000 AMENDMENTS TO CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FOR JUST COMPENSATION WHEN GOVERNMENT TAKES PRIVATE PROPERTY\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Petitioner Poisner objects to the Attorney General\u2019s use in the caption of the description, \u201camendment [ ] to [Oregon\u2019s] constitutional provision for just compensation when government takes private property.\u201d Petitioner Poisner acknowledges that Measure 7 indeed purports to <em>add </em>considerable wording to Article I, section 18, the \u201cjust compensation\u201d provision, but, he asserts, none of that added wording \u201camends\u201d the \u201cjust compensation\u201d wording that already is in the constitutional provision and would remain there. Instead, he argues, the effect of Measure 7 would be cumulative, and the ballot title caption should reflect that.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We agree. As presently worded, the caption could create the misimpression that, in voting to repeal \u201cany amendments\u201d to Article I, section 18, made in the year 2000, a voter would be voting to modify or eliminate the constitutional right to \u201cjust compensation\u201d itself. The matter must be referred to the Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Petitioner Poisner offers additional objections and suggestions respecting all parts of the ballot title, but we find none to be well taken. We turn to the arguments of petitioners Hunnicutt and George.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Petitioners Hunnicutt and George offer arguments concerning all the parts of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. We conclude that one, concerning the summary, is well taken. Petitioners Hunnicutt and George object to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>inclusion in the Attorney General\u2019s certified summary of the following sentence: \u201c[Measure 7] did not include any funding mechanism to pay for compensation claims.\u201d Petitioners Hunnicutt and George assert that the foregoing sentence, although it might tell voters something about Measure 7, tells them nothing about the proposed measure to which the Attorney General\u2019s summary is supposed to relate. We agree. The sentence should be omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Ballot title referred to Attorney General for modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\"> The trial court in <em>League of Oregon Cities </em>and <em>McCall </em>issued a temporary injunction in December 2000 that prevented Measure 7 from going into effect. In March 2001, the trial court issued a judgment declaring that Measure 7 had not become effective and was not part of the Oregon Constitution. That judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>remains in place, pending this court\u2019s determination of the constitutional validity of Measure 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
