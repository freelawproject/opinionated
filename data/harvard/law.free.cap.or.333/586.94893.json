If workplace is represented by a union, existing law precludes the employer and individual employees from making agreements that are inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement, requires union to represent all employees in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>unit, and allows union to negotiate agreement requiring all employees to contribute to representation costs. Measure allows employees to receive union representation services without payment, unless employee requests representation in writing. Authorizes employee to cancel a request for union representation services upon 30 days written notice; any obligation to pay for representation or other services shall cease on the thirty-first day after the notice is sent. Measure declares the right of individual employees to \u2018bargain\u2019 directly with employers about wages and benefits.
