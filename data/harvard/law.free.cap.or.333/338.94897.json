We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments and determine that they are not well taken. Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for the proposed measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">DIRECTS ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPENSATION FUND FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND OWNERS FOR LOST OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD HOUSES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Tes\u201d vote directs establishment of state compensation fund for certain owners of farmland who lost house building opportunities due to state land use law changes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects establishment of state compensation fund for certain owners of farmland who lost house building opportunities due to state land use law changes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">SUMMARY: Before 2000, state constitution provided for payment of just compensation when government took private property for public use, but not when regulation only reduced property value. In 2000, voters approved measure that, with exceptions, required compensation for reduced value; court challenge to 2000 measure unresolved when this summary prepared. This measure directs establishment of fund to compensate certain owners of parcels zoned exclusive farm use. Applies to parcels without houses; restricts future houses if compensation accepted. Applies to owners who could build house when parcel acquired but are now prohibited from building by state land use laws; and owners who qualify for \u201clot of record\u201d exception defined by statute. Directs legislature to raise, appropriate funds. Claims must be made by December 31, 2007. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Ballot title certified.
