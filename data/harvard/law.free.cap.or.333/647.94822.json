We review the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with the requirements of ORS 250.035(2). <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(5) (setting out standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We have considered petitioners\u2019 arguments and conclude that they are not well taken. Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title for the proposed measure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">ALLOWS LOCAL REGULATION OF PESTICIDE USE, SALE; CHANGES AGENCY ADMINISTERING STATE PESTICIDE USE REPORTING PROGRAM</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote repeals laws preempting local regulation of pesticide use, sale; modifies existing reporting program; transfers program to different agency, funds program through registration fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-9\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains current law, preempting local regulation of pesticide use and sale, providing for statewide regulation; retains existing pesticide use reporting program, registration fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-10\">SUMMARY: Current law provides uniform, statewide regulation of pesticide use and sale, preempting local regulation. This measure authorizes local regulation, repeals preemption. Current law authorizes and limits pesticide registration fees; requires Department of Agriculture to: establish system for reporting basic pesticide use information, specifying quantity, purpose, month of use, product used, location of use by watershed, county, zip code or other identifier; collect information annually regarding major categories of pesticide use; publish annual report summarizing pesticide use; adopt rules governing public release of pesticide use information. This measure: transfers the pesticide use reporting program to the Department of Environmental Quality; alters program to require collecting location information identifying section, township, range where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>use occurs; imposes pesticide registration fees adequate to fund pesticide reporting program. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Ballot title certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
