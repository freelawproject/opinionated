Myers, </em>333 Or 252, 39 P3d 171 (2002). Under ORS 250.085(8), the court referred the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title for the proposed initiative measure, and petitioner Pulvers has objected timely to the modified ballot title. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We have reviewed the objections and conclude that they are not well taken. <em>See id. </em>(court reviews modified ballot title to determine whether title substantially complies with requirements of ORS 250.035). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the Attorney General\u2019s modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 107 (2002). That ballot title states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: CREATES NEW JUDICIAL OATH COMMITTING JUDGES TO FRAMERS\u2019 INTENT REGARDING CONSTITUTIONS, LEGISLATURE\u2019S INTENT REGARDING STATUTES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar6\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote creates new judicial oath replacing existing oaths; commits judges to framers\u2019 intent in interpreting state, federal constitutions, to legislature\u2019s intent in interpreting statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains existing judicial oaths; does not commit judges to framers\u2019 intent in interpreting state, federal constitutions, or legislature\u2019s intent in interpreting statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends constitution. Current law requires judges to take oath of office to support the Oregon and federal constitutions, faithfully and impartially discharge duties according to best of their ability, and not accept any office except judicial office during elective term. Measure adds requirements that judges take oath to support and defend 1789 federal constitution and 1859 Oregon constitution; give allegiance only to Oregon and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>jurisdictions; \u201chonor and maintain separation of powers doctrine;\u2019 set aside personal views or those of any social faction; not \u2018create law from the bench;\u2019 uphold \u2018will of the people;\u2019 adhere strictly to intent of framers of constitution and statutes; defer to legislature to provide intent where framers\u2019 intent is unclear. Measure does not define quoted terms. Other provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Modified ballot title certified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
