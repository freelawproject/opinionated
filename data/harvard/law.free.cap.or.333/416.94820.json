Under ORS 250.085(8), the court referred the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title for the proposed initiative measure, and no party to the ballot title review proceeding has objected. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title and requiring court to certify modified ballot title if no objection filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">The modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 119 (2002) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: REPEALS ANY 2000 AMENDMENTS TO COMPENSATION RIGHT WHEN GOVERNMENT TAKES PRIVATE PROPERTY; RETAINS PRE-EXISTING RIGHT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote repeals any 2000 amendments providing for payment of compensation when government regulation reduces property value, retains preexisting right to payment of just compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote rejects repeal of any amendments approved by voters in 2000 election that provide for payment of compensation when government regulation reduces property value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Before 2000 election, the state constitution already provided for payment of just compensation when government takes private property for public use, but payment was not required when property value was only reduced. At 2000 election, voters voted on measure that, with some exceptions, generally expanded the right to payment of government compensation to a property owner by providing for payment when state, local government regulation reduces property value. 2000 measure also included other provisions. 2000 measure has been challenged on constitutional grounds. When this ballot title was prepared, that challenge had not been resolved. This proposal would repeal the 2000 measure if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>that measure survives the constitutional challenge and is upheld.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The modified ballot title is certified.
