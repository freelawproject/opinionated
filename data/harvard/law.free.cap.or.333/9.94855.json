Myers, </em>332 Or 648, 34 P3d 666 (2001). Under Oregon Laws 2001, chapter 802, section 2 (now codified as ORS 250.085(8)), the court referred the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification. The Attorney General has filed a modified ballot title for the proposed initiative measure, and no party to the ballot title review proceeding has objected. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(9) (setting out period within which party may object to modified ballot title and requiring court to certify modified ballot title if no objection filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The modified ballot title for Initiative Petition 96 (2002) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\u201cALLOWS INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM SIGNERS TO PREVENT SALE OF THEIR PETITION SIGNATURES; CREATES IMPLEMENTING, ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote allows signers to prevent sale, barter, exchange of their signatures on initiative, referendum petitions; creates implementing, enforcement provisions; requires minimum fine for violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 votes rejects creation of statutory right allowing signers to prevent the sale, barter or exchange of their signatures on initiative or referendum petitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">\u201cSUMMARY: Allows signers to prevent their signatures on initiative, referendum petitions from being sold, bartered or exchanged for anything of value. Secretary of State shall not approve any petition for circulation unless petition clearly indicates signer\u2019s right not to have signature sold, bartered, exchanged, and gives signers opportunity to make that choice. If signer refuses permission, no person or entity may directly or indirectly pay for obtaining that signature or transmitting it to Secretary.
