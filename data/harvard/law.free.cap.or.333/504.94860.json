Myers, </em>333 Or 314, 39 P3d 177 (2002). The court referred the ballot titles to the Attorney General for modification. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(8) (describing procedure). The Attorney General filed modified ballot titles for the proposed initiative measures, and, under ORS 250.085(9), petitioner objected to the modified ballot titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Petitioner initially objected to the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statements in the certified ballot titles, because those statements failed to state that adoption of either proposed measure would reduce state revenues. This court determined that those objections were well taken. In response to this court\u2019s decision, the Attorney General modified the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cRESULT OF \u201cYES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote taxes corporate and personal capital gains differently from other income, lowers that tax rate to four percent, reducing revenue for other state expenditures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Petitioner contends that use of the word \u201cother\u201d to modify \u201cstate expenditures\u201d is inaccurate because the proposed initiative measures would reduce the revenue available for all public services funded through the State General Fund. Petitioner asserts that the reduction does not relate to any specific state expenditure and, thus, that the use of the term \u201cother\u201d is inaccurate. We agree. If either proposed initiative measure were to pass, then revenues for state expenditures generally would be reduced. The use of the word \u201cother\u201d to modify \u201cstate expenditures\u201d is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">We have considered petitioner\u2019s other objections to the modified ballot titles and conclude that they are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the Attorney General must modify the \u201cyes\u201d vote result statements of the modified ballot titles for Initiative Petitions 120 (2002) and 121 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Modified ballot titles referred to Attorney General for modification.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
