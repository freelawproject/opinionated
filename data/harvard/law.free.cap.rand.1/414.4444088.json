Long ago (1823) that question also was put to rest by this court, when this court held that a motion to reinstate the injunction on additional evidence, tendered by the complainant, was in the nature of an original application for an injunction, and that, on the refusal of the chancellor to reinstate the injunction, an application to the judges of this court, or any of them, (under the act of Rev. Code, 1819, vol. 1, p. 205, \u00a7 41) was proper under that act, and was not to be discharged by the chancellor (or inferior judge). <em>Gilliam v. Allen. </em>1 <em>Rand. </em>414.
