Mata<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> with sale of PCP on November 4, 1981. (\u00a7 11379.5.) The information was amended on August 17, 1982, to charge Anaberta Mata with possession for sale of PCP. (\u00a7 11378.5.) After appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss the information and to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 995, 1538.5) were denied, they entered \u201cslow pleas,\u201d submitting the matter to the court on the transcript of the preliminary hearing and exhibits. (See generally, <em>Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 592 [119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086].)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The court found Anita Mata guilty of sale of PCP and Anaberta Mata not guilty of sale but guilty of possession for sale of PCP. On October 14, 1982, the court sentenced Anita Mata to imprisonment for the lower base term of three years. The court suspended imposition of sentence as to Anaberta Mata and placed her on three years\u2019 probation, with conditions including service of eleven months in jail. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">II.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">V. <em>Potential for Abuse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The details of the underlying offenses are not relevant to the published portion of this opinion. The salient facts are that on two occasions Anita Mata, through a third party, sold a gram of PCP to an undercover officer. On a third occasion, in her home, with the help of her daughter, Anaberta Mata, she sold the officer an ounce of the drug for $2,800. A criminalist testified that the contraband which appellant Anita Mata sold was almost 100 percent pure.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>At the time of Anita Mata\u2019s offense, section 11379.5 prohibited the sale of \u201cany controlled substance which is specified in subdivision (e) of Section 11055 . . . . \u201d The cited subdivision defined as being included in \u201cSchedule II\u201d \u201c(e) Any material, compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of phencyclidine <em>having a potential for abuse associated with a depressant effect on the central nervous </em>system(\u00a7 11055, subd. (e), italics added.) The issue before us is the meaning of the italicized phrase (for convenience sometimes shortened hereafter to \u201cpotential for abuse\u201d).* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Appellant Anita Mata contends that the effect of the quoted language was to require the prosecution to prove (1) that she sold \u201cenough PCP . . . to have a depressant effect\u201d and (2) that PCP \u201chad that particular potential for abuse.\u201d  We find no California decisions directly in point,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but we conclude that neither claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">One California appellate decision considered an argument analogous to appellant Anita Mata\u2019s first point in a methamphetamine case. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hardin </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d 994 [197 Cal.Rptr. 194], defendant was charged with sale of methamphetamine in violation of sections 11055, subdivision (d)(3) (now subd. (d)(2)), and 11379. He had sold a bindle of what he represented to be \u201cgood crank\u201d to an undercover officer for $120. A criminalist testified that the powder in the bindle weighed 757 milligrams and that it contained \u201cmore than half a percent\u201d of methamphetamine by weight, which was, scientifically speaking, \u201ca large amount.\u201d <em>(Hardin, supra, </em>at p. 996.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>On appeal, defendant Hardin raised our appellant Anita Mata\u2019s first point\u2014that the prosecution was required to show \u201cthe amount of methamphetamine sold was enough to have a potential for abuse associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system.\u2019\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 997-998.) The court rejected the claim for three reasons. First, the requirement that \u201cusable quantity\u201d be proven applies to simple possession cases, not to cases of sale. . . Proof of the intentional sale of a dangerous drug is proof the quantity sold was \u201cusable for sale.\u201d . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 998, quoting <em>People </em>v. Diamond (1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 798, 800-801 [89 Cal.Rptr. 126].) Second, even if usable quantity is required, the fact the parties treated it as salable quantity is evidence that it was a usable quantity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardin, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. 999.)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">And third, the <em>Hardin </em>court rejected the contention based on a grammatical analysis of the statutory language in question. It read: \u201cAny material, compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of the following substances having a potential for abuse associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system ....\u201d(\u00a7 11055, subd. (d), as enacted Stats. 1980, ch. 1223, \u00a7 1, pp. 4141-4143.) Relying in part on a Michigan decision, the court held that \u201c. . . the statute should be read: \u2018Any substance, regardless of quantity, which has a potential for abuse associated with a stimulant effect on the central nervous system. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hardin, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. 1000.) The court concluded that the <em>quantity </em>of drug sold was irrelevant. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Although it dealt with a different drug and a slightly differently worded statute, we find <em>Hardin </em>persuasive for the proposition that the quantity of PCP involved is not relevant in a prosecution for sale of the drug. This does not meet the heart of appellant Anita Mata\u2019s claim, however, which is that the potential for abuse of the substance must be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions have directly confronted the question before us, and the vast majority, with which we agree, have rejected the position posed by Anita Mata. They have done so for a variety of reasons. One court simply found that \u201cThe plain language of the statute indicates that \u2018any material, compound, mixture or preparation\u2019 which contains phencyclidine is a controlled substance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Otten </em>(1980) 91 Ill.App.3d 692, 696 [47 Ill.Dec. 106, 414 N.E.2d 1222, 1225].) Another found that the \u201cpotential for abuse\u201d language \u201cis not a definition of phencyclidine, but a description of a class of substances, and thus had no relevance to any issue in defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Oliver </em>(1979) 90 Mich.App. 144, 147 [282 N.W.2d 262, 264].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>The latter position^ that the language is merely a \u201cdescription of a class of substances,\u201d finds support when the original statutory scheme is examined. In adopting the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, from which our statute was taken, the Legislature listed various substances in several schedules and gave an administrative body the power to add substances to the lists. Thus, former section 11002.1 provided that the Division of Narcotic Enforcement could add new drugs to those enumerated. (Former \u00a7 11002.1, Stats. 1972, ch. 1377, \u00a7 21, pp. 2816-2817; see generally, 2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 680, p. 621.) The \u201cpotential for abuse\u201d language therefore was included in the original statutes as an administrative guideline rather than as an element of any criminal offense. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Bureau </em>(1973) 8 Wash.App. 622, 625 [509 P.2d 105, 108].) The fact that the statute was amended to eliminate this administrative prerogative may have rendered the language superfluous, but it did not change the definition of any offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he weight of the authority is that the unauthorized delivery of any quantity of the controlled substance [PCP] constitutes a violation of the Act. [Citations.]\u201d (People v. Bolden (1978) 62 Ill.App.3d 1009, 1010 [20 Ill.Dec. 79, 379 N.E.2d 912, 914]; contra, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Teada </em>(1975) 235 Pa.Super. 438 [344 A.2d 682].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We are convinced that the view expressed in these decisions is correct and is in keeping with the purpose of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, which \u201cunequivocally manifests a legislative intent to restrict the transportation, sale and possession of controlled substances so as to protect the health and safety of all persons within this state.
