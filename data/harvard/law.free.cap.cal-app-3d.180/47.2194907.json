Code, \u00a7 288a, subd. (c));<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> two counts of rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (2)); two counts of sodomy (\u00a7 286, subd. (c)); and one count of false imprisonment (\u00a7 236). The trial court sentenced defendant to prison for seven consecutive eight-year upper terms for the sex crimes plus one consecutive three-year upper term for the false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Defendant raises many issues on appeal which we will discuss seriatim after summarizing the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">At about 9 p.m. on December 19, 1983, Priscilla P. put her one-year-old son to bed and lay down on the couch in her home in Wasco, California, to watch television. She fell asleep there. Later that night she was awakened by defendant\u2019s hands strangling her. She screamed and tried to break away. Her son woke up crying. Priscilla stopped screaming after defendant threatened to kill her and her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Defendant then held Priscilla\u2019s neck in the crotch of his arm. He pushed her onto her back, sat on her chest, and told her he had come to rob the house but had \u201cfound something better.\u201d Defendant ordered Priscilla to \u201csuck on him.\u201d Out of fear, she complied. Defendant then commanded her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to engage in \u201c69\u201d (he orally copulates her vagina while she orally copulates his penis).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">After this stopped, defendant told Priscilla to get on her knees and lean against a chair. He then attempted to insert his penis into her anus. She said it hurt; the pain lasted several days. Defendant then engaged in normal sexual intercourse with Priscilla.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Defendant permitted Priscilla to go to the bathroom. Thereafter, he took her to her bedroom, and engaged in another \u201c69,\u201d normal sexual intercourse, and sodomy. During this period he asked her if she knew anyone by the name of \u201cSpider.\u201d She replied, \u201cNo.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Finally, at about 4 a.m., defendant fell asleep with his arm around her chest. Paralyzed with fear, Priscilla did not try to flee. At around 6 a.m. she awoke defendant, telling him he had better leave. Defendant told her he had still not gotten what he came for.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Priscilla managed to run into the kitchen and grab some knives before going into her son\u2019s room to protect him. Defendant came out of the bedroom and threw brandy at her. She told him to leave and that if he came any closer, she would kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">At this point, defendant started begging her not to hurt him, saying he was sorry, and repeatedly asking her not to call the police. She only screamed for him to leave. He finally left by the back door and she immediately locked it.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">After defendant left, Priscilla telephoned friends Jaime Guevara and Mary and Clint Tillman.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">On the way to Priscilla's home, the Tillmans spotted defendant, known to them as \"Spider.\u201d a few blocks from her home. When they arrived at Priscilla\u2019s, she was terrified and hysterical; the living room was in complete disarray. After Priscilla described her attacker and what he was wearing, the Tillmans realized it was \"Spider.\u201d Since the Tillmans knew where \"Spider\u201d resided, they showed the police \"Spider\u2019s\u201d residence after the police arrived and were informed of the events that had transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">When Officer Acencion Barrera spotted someone who matched the description of Priscilla's assailant, he pursued the suspect but was unable to apprehend him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Later, Officer Barrera joined Officer Michael Lackey, and they went to the residence Clint Tillman had shown Lackey as \u201cSpider\u2019s\" residence. Defendant\u2019s mother permitted them to enter that residence. Clothing matching that described by Priscilla as worn by her attacker was on a couch and chair in the living room. Defendant was found crouched in a corner of a bedroom hiding beneath a large quantity of clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Defendant was arrested and brought to the Wasco substation where physical evidence (his clothing) could be collected. After defendant heard officers discussing how to package the clothing to avoid contamination, defendant managed to pull the clothing on the floor and stomp on it until he was subdued.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Sometime later that morning, defendant escaped out the back door of the substation but was promptly reapprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Vaginal swabs taken from Priscilla were consistent with defendant\u2019s body fluids. Pubic hair identical to defendant\u2019s was found in Priscilla\u2019s bed. Similarly, pubic hair matching that of Priscilla\u2019s was found in a combing of defendant\u2019s pubic hair at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Defendant\u2019s defense was consent. He testified that he first met Priscilla on the evening in question while he was walking the streets at 7 p.m.. smoking a marijuana cigarette. She was standing on the sidewalk and asked for some \u201chits [on] my joint,\" so he shared it with her. She invited him to her house to smoke some of her marijuana, and he accepted her invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">After they smoked Priscilla's marijuana at her house, she told him she was lonely and wanted to make love. Defendant thought he might be able to get some money out of her, so he consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Defendant said that each of their sexual acts which followed (oral copulation, \u201c69,\" intercourse and sodomy) was initiated by her. At no time was any physical force used. Defendant said he attempted only one sodomy and that he abandoned it because she complained of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">I.-III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\n<em>Privilege Against Self-incrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The trial court ordered defendant to provide the People hair (pubic and head), saliva and blood samples. Defendant argues that this order violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination because there is no specific case law allowing the nonconsensual removal of pubic or head hair. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In <em>Schmerber </em>v. <em>California </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 757 [16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 S.Ct. 1826] blood was drawn from a suspected drunk driver over his objection. The Supreme Court set forth a balancing test of weighing the individual\u2019s privacy and bodily integrity interests against the community\u2019s interest in fairly and accurately determining guilt or innocence. The court held that the evidence was properly obtained and admissible because the intrusion was minimal, society\u2019s interest was significant, and there were exigent circumstances in obtaining the evidence before it dissipated. Recently, in <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1985) 470 U.S. 753, 761 [84 L.Ed.2d 662, 669, 105 S.Ct. 1611, 1617], the court pointed out that: \u201cA crucial factor in analyzing the magnitude of the intrusion in <em>Schmerber </em>is the extent to which the procedure may threaten the safety or health of the individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 55, footnote 7 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534, 23 A.L.R.4th 776], stated: \u201cAlthough we refrain from establishing discovery rules related to testimonial evidence, we leave intact the firmly established precedents that hold the self-incrimination privilege inapplicable to, and allow mandatory production of, nontestimonial evidence such as fingerprints, blood samples, breath samples, appearances in lineups, and handwriting and voice exemplars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Several courts outside of California have ruled that the taking of hair samples does not amount to a violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(State </em>v. <em>White </em>(Mo. 1981) 621 S.W.2d 287 [hair samples]; <em>Perez </em>v. <em>State </em>(Okla.Crim.App. 1980) 614 P.2d 1112 [saliva and hair samples]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCumber </em>(Utah 1980) 622 P.2d 353 [hair samples]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton </em>(1976) 266 S.C. 251 [222 S.E.2d 763], vacated 429 U.S. 807 [50 L.Ed.2d 69, 97 S.Ct. 44], reaffirmed on remand (1977) 268 S.C. 152 [232 S.E.2d 342] [pubic hair].) The mandatory production of saliva and hair samples is reasonable because the taking of those samples involves virtually no risk, trauma, or pain. Moreover, these samples constitute non-testimonial evidence not protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. (See, generally, <em>People </em>v. <em>Collie, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>p. 55, fn. 7.) Thus, the trial court did not err in granting the People\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\n<em>Sodomy Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Defendant alleges there was insufficient evidence of anal penetration to uphold either of his sodomy convictions. Defendant states that Priscilla\u2019s own testimony reflected her uncertainty as to any penetration. Moreover, there was no evidence of any trauma to her anus nor was there any presence of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738, 16 A.L.R.4th 1255] the court, after having initially stated that \u201c[e]vidence, to be \u2018substantial\u2019 must be \u2018of ponderable legal significance . . . reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value\u2019\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 576), went on to point out: \u201c[T]he appellate court \u2018must view the evidence in a light most favorable to respondent and presume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.\u2019 [Citations.] The court does not, however, limit its review to the evidence favorable to the respondent. . . . \u2018First, we must resolve the issue in the light of the <em>whole record </em>.... Second, we must judge whether the evidence of each of the essential elements ... is <em>substantial; </em>it is not enough for the respondent simply to point to \u201csome\u201d evidence supporting the finding, for \u201cNot every surface conflict of evidence remains substantial in the light of other facts.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 576-577.) <em>Johnson </em>relied upon <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781] to the effect that an appellate court does not \u201c\u2018. . . \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citation omitted in original.] Instead the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>This court may not reject statements believed by the trier of fact unless there exists either a physical impossibility they are true, or their falsity is apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 754 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267].)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Section 287 provides: \u201cAny sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime of sodomy.\u2019\u2019 In addition, CALJIC No. 10.52 (4th ed. 1979)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> provides that evidence of emission is not necessary. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 786 [190 Cal.Rptr. 554] the court found that the victim\u2019s testimony that the defendant \u201ctried to enter a little bit, but it hurt a lot\u2019\u2019 supported a finding of slight penetration and, when combined with circumstantial evidence of rectal pain and bleeding, was sufficient to sustain the sodomy conviction. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Cognizant of these principles, we turn to examine the record. Priscilla testified about the first sodomy, which occurred in the living room, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">\u201cQ. [Deputy District Attorney] Then were you touched somewhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">\u201cA. [Priscilla] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">\u201cQ. Where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">\u201cA. On the anus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">\u201cQ. And could you tell what touched you? What it was that touched you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">\u201cA. His penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">\u201cQ. What exactly did you feel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-13\">\u201cA. A lot of pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-14\">\u201cQ. Was this in your anus or somewhere else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-15\">\u201cA. In the anus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-16\">\u201cQ. Could you tell whether or not anything went inside, actually inside your anus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-17\">\u201cA. I couldn\u2019t, it just hurt so bad, I don't know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>\u201cQ. How many times did this occur in the living room? That is with the anus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cA. The one time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">With regard to the second sodomy, which occurred in the bedroom, Priscilla testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">\u201cQ. [Deputy District Attorney] During the time that you were in the bedroom, was there any contact at all made with your anus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">\u201cA. [Priscilla] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">\u201cQ. In the bedroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-11\">\u201cQ. And when that happened were you still on the bed or somewhere else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-12\">\u2018\u2018A. Still on the bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-13\">\u201cQ. Had you changed your position on the bed at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-14\">\u201cA. I was on my stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-15\">\u201cQ. How did you get that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-16\">\u201cA. He told me to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-17\">\u201cQ. When you got on your stomach what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-18\">\u201cA. He tried to enter my anus with his penis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-19\">\u2018\u2018Q. Did you feel any pressure or anything there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-20\">\u201cA. It hurt again, I kept telling him it hurt and he telling me to relax.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7k\">\u201cQ. He told you to relax?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-21\">\"'A. Yes.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-22\">Priscilla also testified that as a result of both sodomies she experienced pain in her anus for several days thereafter. Although denying he ever pen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>etrated her anus, defendant admitted getting his penis once \u201cbetween her buttocks\u2019\u2019 and trying to sodomize her, but he allegedly stopped when she complained of pain. As in <em>Gonzalez, </em>such evidence is sufficient to uphold the sodomy conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">VII.-X.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Franson, Acting P.
