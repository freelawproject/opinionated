Burkhart, reported 207 F.Supp. 885, and 220 F.Supp. 149, comes on for further consideration pursuant to summary order of the United States Supreme Court affirming this Court\u2019s order of reapportionment on its merits and remanding for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362, and related cases. We will briefly review the course of this protracted litigation to again put it in proper perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">After Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, and pursuant to hearings in June, 1962, we refused to interfere with the up-coming 1962 Oklahoma primary, but declared the Okla-. homa apportionment laws prospectively null and void, and inoperative for all future elections and continued the case, until July 31, 1962, to afford the State an opportunity to provide a remedy for the adjudicated malapportionment. When the matter came on for hearing pursuant to assignment on July 31st, we again refused to interfere with the election then in being, but we laid down positive and precise guidelines for bringing Oklahoma apportionment laws into conformity with the requirements of the Oklahoma and the Federal Constitutions. These guidelines were in accordance with the opinion of the then Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma, submitted to the Court in June, 1962. This plan has been referred to throughout this proceedings as \u201cModel C.\u201d We recessed the proceedings until March 8, 1963, to afford the incoming Legislature an opportunity to enact a system of election laws apportioning the State of Oklahoma in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the opinion of the Attorney General of the State, which we recommended as in conformity with the requirements of the Federal Constitution. We then said that if the Legislature failed to act within the time allotted to it, the Court would then be compelled, as a last resort, to reapportion by judicial order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">An Initiative Petition was submitted in the November, 1962, election, providing for the transfer of the apportionment duties of the Legislature to a constitutional reapportionment commission. The Petition received a majority of the votes cast on the measure, but failed of adoption for lack of sufficient affirmative votes. See: Allen v. Burkhart, Okl., 377 P.2d 821. When this case came on for further hearing March 8, 1963, pursuant to assignment, the then Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma and the intervening Senators offered Senate Joint Resolution No. 8, 14 O.S.Supp. \u00a7\u00a7 78.1-78.11, and House Bill No. 586, 14 O.S.Supp. \u00a7\u00a7 102-106 as an appropriate remedy for the adjudicated malappor-tionment. Upon a hearing on the appropriateness of the proffered remedy, we rejected the House Bill as providing \u201clittle or no relief for malapportionment under antecedent laws.\u201d We rejected Senate Joint Resolution No. 8 as a \u201cpatchwork of political maneuvering and manipulation to perpetuate the sa\u00edne invidious apportionment which prevailed under the antecedent laws.\u201d The 1963 session of the Oklahoma Legislature also referred to the people a proposed amendment to the Constitution providing for reapportionment of both houses of the Legislature in accordance with a new formula with built-in constitutional means for effecting reapportionment. This proposal was referred to as Senate Joint Resolution No. 4, Laws 1963, p. 736 and was ultimately submitted as State Question 416. We considered this proposed amendment only to determine its acceptability as an appropriate remedy, if adopted. We noted the gross disparity provided therein and expressed misgivings, but were careful not to interfere with the right of the people to speak on the proposal. Being convinced by all that had transpired that the Oklahoma Legislature was unable or unwilling to reapportion itself, and realizing the importance of settling apportionment laws applicable to the forthcoming 1964 elections, we then promulgated our order of July 17, 1963, reapportioning the Oklahoma Legislature in accordance with so-called \u201cModel C.\u201d The Attorney General and the intervenors appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">During pendency of the appeal, an original action was brought in the Supreme Court of Oklahoma to review House Bill No. 586 and Senate Joint Resolution No. 8, to determine if they were in accord with the Oklahoma Constitution. In the same action, the Attorney General applied to the Oklahoma Court for a \u201cProvisional or Conditional Order\u201d directing \u201chow the 1964 elections for legislative offices should be conducted if the Order of Reapportionment entered on July 17, 1963, * * * should be stayed, reversed, vacated, or held ineffective for any reason.\u201d Davis v. McCarty, Okl., 388 P.2d 480, 482. The Oklahoma Court proceeded to determine whether the most recent apportionment legislation in Oklahoma, i. e., H.B. 586 and SJR 8, \u201cmeet the test of substantial equality prescribed by our State Constitution,\u201d and apparently assumed that compliance with the Oklahoma Constitution would constitute compliance with the mandate of the Federal Constitution. Upon consideration of this legislation, the Oklahoma Court concluded that the legislation could be made acceptable as an appropriate remedy \u201cwithout disturbing in any way H.B. 586, except to remove flotorial representation unauthorized by the [State] constitution; and without disturbing in any way SJR No. 8, except to add senatorial representation to meet the test of substantial equality prescribed by our [State] Constitution.\u201d Davis v. McCarty, supra, p. 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">After the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s stand-by order of reapportionment, our reapportionment order was stayed pending appeal. Primaries have been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ducted under the stand-by order in accordance with the apportionment formu-lae provided therein, based upon H.B. 586 and SJR 8 as revised by the Oklahoma Supreme Court to bring it in conformity with the Oklahoma Constitution. In the 1964 run-off primaries, State Question 416 was duly adopted. The gist of the amendment is to amend Article 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution relating to apportionment of the State Legislature and repealing all conflicting sections of the Constitution. After adoption of this amendment, qualified electors brought an action, No. 64-255 Civil, Reynolds et al. v. State Election Board, to declare null and void the apportionment formulae provided in Sections 9A and 10A of Article 5, as amended, as repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment. The suitors also attack the stand-by plan promulgated by the Oklahoma Court under which the primaries have been conducted, contending that it is invidiously discriminatory and, in any event, contingent upon the reversal or ineffectiveness of our July 17, 1963, order. The Court is petitioned to declare State Question 416 and the stand-by order void and inoperative, and to enter an order vacating the May primary elections; declare all legislative offices vacant and direct the Governor of the State of Oklahoma to proclaim special elections as provided by 26 O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 541-545, inclusive, to fill such vacancies in accordance with \u201cModel C\u201d as incorporated in the reapportionment order of this Court and which is now the constitutional law of this case. A three-judge court was duly constituted and upon motion and by consent of all parties, the case has been consolidated with Moss v. Burkhart. The consolidated cases are now before this Court to consider (1) whether State Question 416 contravenes the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to equality of representation in the State Legislature, as enunciated by authoritative decisions; and, (2) if the amendment is held not to conform to the requirements of the Federal Constitution, the formulation of an appropriate remedy for the invidious discrimination which we have heretofore found in all prior apportionment laws of the State of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Since the Reynolds case was commenced, certified nominees of both political parties from Oklahoma and Tulsa Counties have intervened to challenge the constitutionality of the apportionment laws under which they were nominated and to petition the Court to vacate the May primary elections, declare vacant the offices to which they and others have been nominated, and direct the Governor to proclaim and order special elections, as provided by 26 O.S. \u00a7 541 et seq., to fill the vacancies thus created. The Attor-. ney General, representing the Oklahoma State Election Board, and the interven-,' ing Senators in Moss v. Burkhart, have responded contending that State Question 416 is now the law of Oklahoma insofar as it is not inconsistent with the requirements \u2018of the Federal Constitution, and to the extent that it does infringe upon the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it must yield to the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution. They freely concede by their response and at the bar of. this Court that State Question 416 is in certain enumerated respects repugnant to the Federal Constitution and must, therefore, fail. They have filed a plan or scheme designated herein as Exhibits I and II, in which they clearly indicated that part of the amendment which must be expurgated. As thus modified to conform to the supreme law of the land, they offer State Question 416 as the basic law of Oklahoma for reapportionment of the State Legislature, and as repealing all prior laws in conflict therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. On the question of immediate remedy, we are urged to uphold the May primary under the stand-by order of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, not because the elections are in conformity with the requirements of State Question 416 as modified to conform to Federal law, but rather as an improvement upon all preexisting laws. They say in that connection that the apportionment under the stand-by order is not sufficiently dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>parate in the proportionate representation it will bring about to justify the voiding of an election, which they say is now in process or in being. They would have this Court formulate precise guidelines in accordance with State Question 416 as modified, for the Legislature which will convene in January, 1965, under the stand-by order, or in the alternative to promulgate a provisional order of apportionment in accordance therewith. In that respect, our attention is directed to the provisions of State Question 416 for an apportionment commission, with authority to reapportion the State in accordance with established law, if the Legislature refuses to do so within sixty days after convening. This procedure, they argue, will be the least disruptive of the State processes and, at the same time, will insure a constitutionally reapportioned Legislature for the session convening in 1967. They question first whether a special session of the Legislature is empowered to vacate the elections now in being, as indeed, they question the power of this Court to do so. They further question whether the voiding of the elections would result in a vacancy within the meaning of 26 O.S. \u00a7 541. And finally, they suggest that the expense of an extraordinary session of the Legislature or of special elections outweighs the benefit to be derived by these plaintiffs thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">It is true, as the plaintiffs suggest, our July 17, 1963, order of reapportionment has been affirmed. It does surely provide for reapportionment of the Oklahoma legislature in accordance with the principle of equality of representation enunciated in Reynolds v. Sims, supra, and related cases. It is based upon the then subsisting provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution, with modifications to bring it into conformity with the supreme law of the land. But since our previous order, the Oklahoma Constitution has been changed and the provisions upon which our previous order rested have been repealed by State Question 416. State Question 416 is now the basic law of Oklahoma for apportionment of the State Legislature, repealing all conflicting sections of the Oklahoma Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">While Moss v. Burkhart, supra, was affirmed on its merits, it was remanded to allow us to effect reapportionment of the State of Oklahoma in accordance with the principles announced in Reynolds v. Sims, supra, and to that end, leave in this Court the power to fashion a remedy in the light of well-known principles of equity. See: Reynolds v. Sims, supra [84 S.Ct. p. 1393]. We believe that by affirmance of our previous order of reapportionment in accordance with Reynolds v. Sims, the Supreme Court committed to us the equitable discretion to fashion a remedy for the reapportionment of the Oklahoma State Legislature to suit the exigencies of the case now before us. In the exercise of our equitable discretion, we have accordingly examined the constitutional amendment (State Question 416) to determine whether it can be utilized for the effectuation of constitutional reapportionment in Oklahoma. We agree with the present Attorney General of Oklahoma that it should now be considered as the basic law of Oklahoma on apportionment of the Legislature. We accept the Attorney General\u2019s candid statement in his response and at the bar of this Court concerning the provisions of this amendment which he deems to be in conflict with the Federal Constitution, and which he admits must, therefore, yield to its requirements. We also accept the Attorney General\u2019s view that the \u201cAmendment was proposed by the Legislature and adopted by the people, both charged with knowledge of the supremacy of the Federal laws, and, in truth, aware that standards and guidelines were in the process of formulation in the Federal courts, and aware that the apportionment formulae in said amendment would, of course, be subordinate to the standards being so formulated.\u201d The amendment having been adopted as an appropriate remedy for existing malapportionment, the people intended for it to prevail as basic law to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>it is in conformity with the supreme law of the land and that it would fail only insofar as it must yield to the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution. To paraphrase the words of the Attorney General, we will not strike down the amendment in toto, because one Article contravenes Federal guaranties, nor an Article because a Section is void, nor a Section because a clause is bad. And see: Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347, 366, 35 S.Ct. 926, 59 L.Ed. 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In our July 17,1963, order we accepted the then Attorney General\u2019s opinion of the constitutionality of the then existing apportionment laws and order the State reapportioned in accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General. We now accept the present Attorney General\u2019s views of the present law of the State, except as we shall hereinafter depart therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Specifically, we agree with the Attorney General and the intervening Senators that Section 9A, Article 5 of the amendment (State Question 416) is the basic law of Oklahoma for the apportionment of the State Senate. We accept the provisions of Section 9A which provides (1) for forty-eight one-senator senatorial districts in Oklahoma; (2) that the term of office of a senator shall be four years; (3) that one-half of the senators shall be elected each two years; and (4) that the apportionment of the senatorial districts shall be substantially in accordance with the Attorney General\u2019s Exhibit I and as more specifically delineated in the revised order of reapportionment hereinafter set forth, and provided further that the multi-district counties shall be subdivided into senatorial districts of approximately equal population, as specifically delineated in the revised order herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">We agree with the Attorney General and the intervening Senators that Section 10A, Article 5 of the amendment should be retained as the basic law of Oklahoma to provide a formula and procedure for the apportionment of the House of Representatives of the State of Oklahoma. The House of Representatives shall, therefore, be apportioned in accordance with Section 10A, Article 5 as amended, to provide (1) for approximately 100 representatives (the ratio being %ooth of the population of the State); and, (2) that the term of office of a representative shall be two years. The House of Representatives will be apportioned into districts of approximately equal population, as prescribed and delineated in the revised order of reapportionment hereinafter set forth. All of the remaining parts and provisions of Sections 9A and 10A are unconstitutional and they are, hereby, declared null and void. The apportionment commission provided by Sections 11A and 11B, Article 5 of the amendment, and the means for the enforcement of its apportionment orders provided in Sections 11C, 11D and 11E in no way conflicts with the Federal Constitution, and remains as a part of the basic law of apportionment in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">Having arrived at what seems to be a satisfactory and acceptable plan for reapportionment of the State of Oklahoma in accordance with the amendment to Article 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution and in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Constitution, the question remains when and how shall it become operative as the controlling law of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The Attorney General and the intervening Senators plead for forbearance and further delay. The plea is plausible on its face, but becomes unacceptable when considered in the light of .the history of this case. This litigation had its genesis in Radford v. Gary, D.C., 145 F.Supp. 541, nine years ago. At that time the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma freely conceded in open court that the Oklahoma Legislature was malapportioned under both the Oklahoma and Federal Constitutions. The answer then was simply that there was no redress in the courts. Since Baker v. Carr, supra, more than two years ago and upon full hearing, we declared the then existing apportionment laws of the State of Oklahoma prospectively null and void, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>but permitted the 1962 Legislature to be constituted under such laws, and left the matter of correcting the deficiencies to that Legislature on the solemn promise that once their duty was made clear, they would discharge it with honor and fidelity. The result was new laws, equally discriminatory, and an amendment to the State Constitution, which all parties now frankly concede must be materially revised in order to meet the constitutional test of representation based upon population.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">While we must, in the exercise of our equitable discretion, fashion a remedy which will bring about effective reapportionment with the least disruption of State processes, we are reminded in Reynolds v. Sims, supra, that \u201conce a State\u2019s legislative apportionment scheme has been found to be unconstitutional, it would be the unusual case in which a court would be justified in not taking appropriate action to insure that no further elections are conducted under the invalid plan.\u201d It is suggested that an \u201cunusual case\u201d is where an impending election is imminent and the State\u2019s election machinery is already in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">If the election in Oklahoma were imminent, i. e., so close that a vacation of the primary would be unduly and inequitably disruptive of the orderly elec-torial process, we would surely yield to the exigencies of the situation. In 1962, we refused to vacate the primary although ample time remained, and we refrained from interfering in any way in order to permit the Legislature to provide its own remedy. As in 1962, primary elections have been conducted and nominees have been certified. But, the primary elections were conducted under the stand-by order of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which was expressly conditioned and contingent upon the ineffectiveness of our July 17, 1963, order of reapportionment. The judgment of this \u25a0Court was challenged and litigated, and the primary elections conducted on the assumption that our judgment would be overturned. That judgment has now become the settled law in Oklahoma, and our present situation is thus demonstrably different from the circumstances existing in 1962. If confusion and hardship results from the vacation of the primary elections, it is not of our making. Our duty is to reapportion the Oklahoma Legislature in accordance with the established law of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Certain nominees under the May primary have come forward as intervenors to sacrifice the advantages they have gained by successful campaigns and urge us not to leave reapportionment to a Legislature of which, if successful in November, they would be a member. We should, of course, do nothing to put an end to the existence of any co-ordinate branch of State government, or even permit it to destroy itself, but we are reasonably sure that the voiding of these elections and the declaration of vacancies in the respective offices would do no harm to the legislative process in the State of Oklahoma. Since 1913, the State has provided for the filling of vacancies which occur by death, resignation, removal or otherwise. In the event of such vacancies, the Governor shall issue his proclamation, designating a day when an election may be held throughout the county or district for the filling of such vacancy. See: 26 O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 541-545, inclusive. There is ample time and sufficient funds for the special elections. In these circumstances, we decline to withhold the immediately available remedy to which the plaintiffs are clearly entitled. We accordingly vacate the primary elections conducted under the Oklahoma Court\u2019s stand-by order and we find and hold that a vacancy exists in all of those offices, within the meaning and as contemplated by 26 O.S. \u00a7 541 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Section 9A, as amended by State Question 416 provides: \u201c[A]ny Senator, serving at the time of the adoption of this amendment, shall serve the full time for which he was elected.\u201d But, no office-holder has a vested right in an unconstitutional office any more than he has a right to be elected to that office. We believe that it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>invidiously discriminatory to allow this provision of the new constitutional amendment to stand, and it is, therefore, stricken. The July 17, 1963, order of reapportionment provides that the terms of office of senators elected in November, 1960, general election, as well as those elected at the November, 1962, election, will end with the fifteenth day after the general election of November, 1964. We adhere to that part of our former order and declare all legislative offices of the Oklahoma Legislature vacant as of the fifteenth day after the general election in November, 1964, and subject to special elections under 26 O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 541-545, inclusive. It thus becomes the statutory' duty of the Governor to call special elections as provided by 26 O.S. \u00a7\u00a7 541-545, inclusive. The special elections will be conducted for the purpose of nominating candidates for the offices of the Senate and House of Representatives from the districts designated and delineated in the revised order of reapportionment hereinafter set forth. It is the obligation of the State Election Board and those acting under its authority and direction, to conduct elections as herein provided, out of any available funds appropriated to it. And, it is the obligation of the members of the Emergency Fund Board to make any necessary funds available to the Governor and to the State Election Board, for the purpose of conducting the special elections herein ordered. It will, of course, be unnecessary to proclaim or conduct special elections for nominations to the legislative offices in those reapportioned districts which coincide with the nominations in the May primary. Those nominees will be recognized as duly certified for the purpose of the general election in November in such reapportioned districts.

Certain Inter-venors filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Supreme Court after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>filing of such motion. Jurisdiction remains in this Court to consider such motion of the Attorney General, the Notice of Appeal being premature. We have considered such motion and reconsidered our Order of August 7, 1964, and find that such motion, as supplemented, should be in part overruled and in part sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Under , the Oklahoma law, where precinct lines do not conform to legislative district lines, it is the duty of the County Election Board to change such precincts. In our previous order there were only a few instances where such precincts were interferred with in Oklahoma County and in Comanche County. The Oklahoma County Election Board has begun the procedures required to alter the appropriate precincts and such procedures should be carried through in sufficient time for the September 29, 1964, special election. We hereinafter amend the Revised Order of Reapportionment as it applies to Districts within Comanche County to make precinct changes unnecessary. No instances of necessary changes of precinct lines in Tulsa County are pointed out to the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The intent of the Court is to follow precinct lines in all districting except in Oklahoma County. In the event any district lines in either this order or the Revised Order of Reapportionment, except in Oklahoma County, shall not conform to present precinct lines the Districts as described in such orders are by the terms of this order amended to so conform by following such precinct lines in the manner which will effect the smallest population change in the Districts affected. If such conformation shall be necessary in any district the appropriate County Election Board shall report such fact to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The Attorney General questions that part of our Revised Order of Reapportionment which provides that senators elected in 1970 shall serve only a two year term, asserting that this is contrary to the Oklahoma Constitution. That part of our previous order is stricken and such senators shall be elected for a period of four years. The possible problem envisioned by the Court, which prompted the Order now stricken, can be met if and when the occasion arises, j '</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Certain former nominees for election to the House of Representatives, allowed by this Court to intervene herein on August 17, 1964, have filed their Answer alleging that the mechanics and complexities of state election laws result in a chaotic condition because this Court has held the May, 1964, Primary election void. Such allegation is merely a conclusion. This Court has examined the State election laws. It has had the benefit of the testimony of the Secretary of the State Election Board at the trial and the opinions of the Attorney General of Oklahoma relating to the election procedures under the laws of Oklahoma. In no instance has there been any suggestion of any difficulties which will be encountered in proceeding with the ordered special elections. Oklahoma has the means, time and funds under the law with which to effect a properly and legally apportioned legislature for the 1965 session and need not wait until the 1967 session to effect this relief. There is no basis in law for the allegation that the order of this Court has or will create chaos, confusion, or great difficulties and the special elections heretofore ordered shall proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">House of Representative Districts 10, 11, 33, 34, 37, 38, 40, 41, 44 and 45, as described in the Revised Order of Reapportionment, ai'e the same in area as Districts provided in the law of Oklahoma prior to the enactment of State Question 416. This Court did not void the primary and run-off primary elections held in May, 1964, in such districts for the reason that such Districts in no way contributed to the unconstitutionality of the then existing apportionment scheme. The people in the counties comprising these Districts did not have representation substantially disproportionate to their numbers. We overrule the motion of the Attorney General to establish district lines within such counties and again permit the candidates for such Districts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>to run at-large in such counties. In so doing, we reiterate that we do not indicate approval of at-large elections and do not mean to hold that such elections would necessarily comport with constitutional requirements of equal protection of citizens under other circumstances. We find that to void such elections for the sole purpose of achieving as near the ideal as we are able in effecting reapportionment would not be equitable in view of the proportionate representation of the people in such districts. The division of such counties into separate Districts not overlapping in area may be accomplished in the near future by the ensuing legislature so long as such divisions are substantially equal in population.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">In order to conform the Senatorial ahd Representative Districts strictly to precinct lines in Comanche County, Senatorial Districts and Representative Districts, as described in the Revised Order of Reapportionment, are amended to read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">SENATORIAL DISTRICTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">DISTRICT AREA WITHIN DISTRICTS NO._</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">31 All of that portion of Comanche County lying East of a line which commences at the point where U.S. Highway 277 intersects the South border of Crosby Township; thence North along U.S. Highway 277 through Crosby Township and between Lawrence and Lincoln Townships to Southwest Bishop Road in Lawton, Oklahoma; thence West along Southwest Bishop Road to Sheridan Road; thence North along Sheridan Road to Northwest Ferris Avenue; thence East along Northwest Ferris Avenue to Northwest Fort Sill Boulevard; thence North to and through the Fort Sill Military Reservation along the line which constitutes the East boundary of Lake Township to the Caddo County line.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">DISTRICT AREA WITHIN DISTRICTS NO._</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">32 All that portion of Comanche County and the City of Lawton, Oklahoma, not included in the preceding district.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE DISTRICTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">DISTRICT AREA WITHIN DISTRICTS NO.</p>\n<p id=\"A8V\">62 All of that portion of Comanche County lying South and West of a line which commences at the point where U.S. Highway 277 intersects the South border of Crosby Township; thence North along U.S. Highway 277 through Crosby Township and between Lawrence and Lincoln Townships to Southwest Bishop Road in Lawton, Oklahoma; thence West along said Bishop Road to Sheridan Road; thence North along Sheridan Road to Northwest Cache Road; thence West along Northwest Cache Road to Northwest Fifty-Second Street; thence North along said section line to the South boundary of the Fort Sill Military Reservation; thence West along the South boundary of said reservation to the line between Sections 16 and 17 in Quanah Township, T2N, R13W; thence North along such section line a distance of three (3) miles; thence West along the North Quanah Township line to the half Section line of Section 4 in Quanah Township, T2N, R14W; thence North a distance of one-half mile; thence West a distance of three and one-half miles to the section line between Sections 35 and 36, T3N, R15W; thence North one-half mile; thence West one mile; thence North along the West boundary of said reservation, conforming to such boundary, to the Northwest corner of said reservation, thence one mile East to the first section line; thence North along said section line to the Kiowa County Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>DISTRICT AREA WITHIN DISTRICTS NO._</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">63 All of that portion of Comanche County lying South and East of a line which commences at the point where U.S. Highway 277 intersects the South border of Crosby Township; thence North along U.S. Highway 277 through Crosby Township and between Lawrence and Lincoln Townships to Southwest Bishop Road in Lawton, Oklahoma; thence West along said Bishop Road to Sheridan Road; thence North along Sheridan Road to Gore Boulevard; thence East along Gore Boulevard to Southwest Fourth Street; thence South to the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad tracks; thence East, North and West around the boundary of Precinct 1, Ward 3 to the intersection of East Gore and Northwest Nebraska; thence Northwest along Nebraska to the C.R.I. 6 P.
