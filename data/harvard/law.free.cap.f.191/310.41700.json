The ground of the action was the alleged negligence of the railroad company by which certain fires were started, resulting in the alleged injury to certain timber belonging to the government. That timber was within the Cascade Forest Reserve, through which the railroad company had a right of way for its road. In the first of the two counts contained in the complaint the plaintiff alleged that the defendant company negligently permitted inflammable material to accumulate upon its right of way, which, on or about July 23, 1906, was set on fire by fire falling from one of the defendant\u2019s locomotives, and which fire, so started, spread into the plaintiff\u2019s forest and burned and destroyed its timber, of the alleged value of $100, for the recovery of which damage, together with alleged amounts necessarily expended by the plaintiff in preventing the said fire from further spreading and destroying other timber of the plaintiff, the latter sought to recover by means of its first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The second cause of action counted on was based on a similar fire alleged to have occurred on the 11th of August, 1906, by reason of similar negligence on the part of the defendant in respect to accumulation of inflammable material on its right of way, and also by reason of other and further negligence, in that the defendant company negligently permitted its engine to be out of repair, to be unequipped with apparatus to prevent the escape of sparks, cinders, coal, and fire, and to be placed in charge of unskilled employ\u00e9s, which engine, so controlled, and in that condition, started the fire of August 11, 1906, in the aforesaid inflammable material, which fire spread to the plaintiff\u2019s timber, burning and destroying the same to the extent in value of $9,828.50, which sum, together with alleged amounts necessarily expended by the plaintiff in fighting that lire, it sought to recover by means of the second count of its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The case was tried with a jury and resulted in a verdict in the government\u2019s favor for $4,422.28, for which sum, together with costs amounting to $724.21, judgment was entered against the railroad company.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In support of the present writ of error, which that company sued out, it is contended that the court below erred in certain rulings re- o specting evidence, and also in respect to instructions given and refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Much reliance seems to be placed by counsel for the plaintiff in error upon the point that error was committed in the admission in \u2022evidence of these two letters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cPortland, Oregon, Apr. 24, 1906.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">\u201cMr. John A.

The letter of the inspector called the attention of the railroad company to a report made by a forest ranger as to the condition of its right of way, asked that suitable measures be taken to rectify the reported wrong, and called attention tO' possible consequences. Even if inadmissible, we cannot see that it could have been prejudicial to the defendant company. There was much positive testimony tending to support the contention of the government that the company permitted combustible material to accumulate upon its right of way, and, although a knowledge of the actual condition of its right of way is by law imputed to the company, the calling of its attention to a report of the ranger that it was in that unlawful condition was rather to the benefit of the company than to its injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Based upon the rule that in actions for injury caused by alleged defective machinery evidence of its subsequent alteration or repair is incompetent to show that such machinery was defective before the happening of the injury, the plaintiff in error, by assignment, complains of certain testimony of the witness. Merle, who was foreman of the machine shop of the defendant company in which the engines in question were kept when not in use on the road. We extract from the record the proceedings on the trial covered by such assignments :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">\u201cQ. What was the condition, Mr. Meric, if you remember it. of the engines or engine which run up to Detroit at or about the 23d day of .July as to its spark-arresting or fire-arresting devices and apparatus? A. After the engine being repaired, and being examined, and being reported several times, 1 eventually found the stack in bad condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cQ. Who reported it? A. Mr. Simpson, the engineer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\u201cQ. Who was lie? A. lie was running engines i and 2. We used to have two big engines and kept them for the east end of the run principally, and very seldom we would run a little engine on that run, because the work is heavy up there; and he was the man referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201cQ. What report did lie make? A. Well, he made several reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201cWhereupon said witness further testified that these reports were made .on the roundhouse work report book, the regular record of the company; that book was put there by the company, given to him to put there for the engineers to make report on, and the engineers would make such reports on the return of each trip, if he had any work to be done. Lots of times they had no work to be done, and they just went light on home. Whereupon said witness was interrogated and testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201cQ. Now, do you remember whether or not Engineer Simpson made such a report on the day of this fire \u2014 yes, on the day of this fire, or do you know? A.

Well, he told me that they claimed that they set fire. So that is all I \u2014 that is as near as F can say from the date of the book \u2014 that it is after the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">\u201cMr. Kenton: I move to strike that out as incompetent and not responsive,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">\u201cTlu&gt; Court: I will strike out the testimony as to the conversation with Simpson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">\u201cWhereupon said witness further testified that the report book was missing in 1908, in the fail of the year. lie went over in the morning. The book was there the night before. He went over ta see if the man on the ruij had reported any work, which lie done every night all the time he was there. Does not know wliat went with that book. It was taken out of there that night. The book is gone. Whereupon said witness was interrogated and testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">\u201cQ. Will you please state the condition you found that engine in after the July 23d fire, pursuant to the report made to you? A. After the engine was reported, 1 examined the netting and stack.

I told them, \u2018No,\u2019 and they allowed the engine to go out the next day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-17\">\u201cWhereupon said witness testified that this was after the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">\u201cWhereupon counsel for defendant moved to strike out all of that, for the reason that it is incompetent and immaterial, and that any conversation the witness had, or what he told any other person, would not have any bearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cWhereupon the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">\u201cThe Court: The conversation he had would not be competent in this case, but what he saw in the examination of the engine would be competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cWhereupon said witness further testified that he went out on the following day. He reported the engine had thrown fire. Whereupon counsel for defendant moved to strike out that; whereupon the court said: Counsel asks you what you did,' what you know by your examination, not what somebody told you. Whereupon said witness further testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cThey had to work at it the fallowing day and concluded to hold the engine and take the stack off the engine, and the barrel of the stack of this engine stands up maybe turn feet on the inside, cannot tell how many inches, could figure it out on a blueprint map. \u2022 It had no hole out in the bottom of the barrel of the stack to allow cinders to go into the smoke box. The base of the stack to the top of the barrel was full of cinders, and they were hot. He got down on the floor and took all these cinders out. Searched the netting and could not find anything wrong with the netting. Held the smokestack there all that day until late in the evening, waiting for the master mechanic to come and look at it himself, to see if he could see anything wrong with it. 1-Ie didn\u2019t come, and about 7 o\u2019clock that night he had the stack on and told them, and let the engine go out. It went out a few days and he had to look at it again. Complaint made of the engine again. They concluded to take stack off and put another one on, and they done so, and shortly after this other engine that had this stack, it was reported, and he got up on this engine and looked at the stack, and found between the easting of the trapdoor, where the man that had put the netting in didn\u2019t have material enough to reach over to the flange, consequently he could take his rule by opening it two inches single thickness \u2014 two-foot rule \u2014 and put it between the casting and the netting. He went to work and got some pieces of netting\u2014 the engine had to be used \u2014 and put in three different pieces, he thinks. They have six courses in that or more. The same stack went on the second engine. Oh that engine at that time he put them in and flanged them out, and that stack was all right after that. Consequently he concluded there was trouble with the stack. He had taken that stack down before that and put two holes \u2014had a machinist drill two big holes in the barrel of the stack. First thought that was the cause, and after the holes were cut in, and made the same as the other stacks, there were still complaints made, and after that he located the trouble under that trapdoor between the lower casting of the trapdoor, the base, and the netting, and he fixed it. Was up at Breitenbush Springs after the second fire, talking about it, one thing and another. It was after the second fire that he located that stack, but there was another stack reported on another engine afterwards, on' two or three engines that run up there. Engine 2 was reported. It had been running up there. Engine 1 was reported g again and found in bad condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cWhereupon said witness was further interrogated and testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af5\">\u201cQ. Now, on these examinations, what condition did you find the ash pan of this engine in? That is, the apparatus underneath to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cWhereupon counsel for defendant objected to the same as incompetent, and as not pleaded. Whereupon said witness answered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cA. Mr. Walsh had come and asked me to look over the ash pans at that time, and we found the ash pan netting. After looking at the stack and everything, he insisted on looking at all the ash pans. They looked at engine l\u2019s ash pan, and the netting did not come up to the mud rim by two inches\u2014 the piece of netting. The ash pan is maybe from eight to ten inches deep, and the netting came \u2014 it is bolted on with three bolts on the bottom of the ash pan, two bolts on the side. There was a space of two inches. He looked through the wheel himself. He insisted on my putting a piece of netting across. We did not bolt it on, hut sewed it on with wire, and it remained in that way that season.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cWhereupon said witness further testified that there was nothing between this mud Ting and the piece .of netting when the damper was open; when it was shut the damper was closed. There was an aperture for the escape of sparks and coals \u2014 you could put your arm through it \u2014 the full length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ash pan, full width of it. In1 one corner of that pan the ashes had accumulated all around. They were kind of hot, and it bucked it up. He corked in asbestos, and kind of fixed it down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">\u201cWhereupon counsel for defendant moved to strike out all \u00f3f the foregoing testimony referring to the ash pan, as hereinbefore set out, upon the ground that same is incompetent and not pleaded, which motion was overruled and exception allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cWhereupon said witness further testified that he found a hole under the trapdoor casting and the stack, base of the trapdoor casting and the netting. Hid not examine the stack door itself. Examined the netting and this underneath. It was a hard thing to get to. There is no other trapdoor except the one below there in the stack, in any of the nettings and stack, there is only the one trapdoor in the netting. The trapdoor is faced and set on it with hinges. The trip before that they found a hole in this netting. This was the day before the first fire. It was the trip before he examined the netting, as near as he can remember, immediately before the fire. The trapdoor netting was in bad order, and he repaired that there on the 23d or 24th \u2014 it might have been the 22d, it was the trip before that, the trip when it was reported for the fire. He repaired it when he examined it that time, repaired the trapdoor before the fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Passing the fact that the only ruling appearing in these proceedings against the plaintiff in error was that denying.its motion to strike out the reference in the witness\u2019 testimony to the ash pan, we think no prejudicial error appears, since the evident purpose and scope of the evidence was to show the negligent condition of the engine prior to and at the time of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">But one other question in the case calls for special mention, and that relates to the measure of damages. Counsel for the plaintiff in error contends that instructions requested by him upon that subject were not sufficiently and properly covered by the charge of the court, and further that, since the plaintiffs sought to recover only for timber burned and destroyed, the court was in error in referring in its charge to the laud upon which the timber stood, and also in its reference to other timber of the government not burned or destroyed. The charge upon the point in question is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">\u201cThe measure of damages in this case is the difference, if any, between the value of this timber immediately before the fire, and immediately after. I think it probably can be assumed from the way the case has boon tried, and from the record in this case, that the value of this property consisted in the timber, and that the land, without the timber, is of no special value; at least the evidence has all been directed to show the amount of timber destroyed, and its value. Of course the land belongs to the government of the United 'States, and there is no law, I believe, under which it could be disposed of, but there is a Jaw authorizing the sale of timber from government reserves under certain conditions and restrictions, and therefore, in arriving at the damages, if any, sustained by the plaintiff, it will be your duty to take into consideration the market value of the limber both burned and unlrarned upon the land immediately before and immediately after the fire, and the difference between such market values, if any, will be the damage sustained by the plaintiff to this land and the timber thereon. You are\" authorized in arriving at this conclusion to take into consideration the location of the land and the timber, its accessibility to market, and the transportation facilities, the quality of the timber, the effect of the burned timber upon the value of the other timber, adjacent to or surrounded by it, together with all the other evidence in the case. To the sum which you may find to be the damage the plaintiff is entitled to recover on account of the destruction of this timber, you will add the amount that it expended, or the amount the testimony shows that it expended in fighting these fires and in preventing them from spreading into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>other, and adjoining timber, and to this latter item you will be justified in adding interest at 6 per cent., or the legal rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\">\u201cNow, in this, as in all cases, it is the duty of a party to reduce his damages as much as can reasonably be done under the circumstances, and therefore, if you believe from the testimony that, after this timber had been burned, it could have been disposed of by the government officials for any sum \u2014 according to what sum it could have been disposed of, if it had an opportunity to sell it \u2014 it was. I think, its duty to have done so and thus reduced the damages; but in determining that question, and in examining that view of the question, you will not overlook the fact as to whether there is a market for the sale of this timber; whether they had an opportunity to sell it; whether they could have disposed of it; and all the circumstances that surrounded the location and condition of this particular timber now in controversy. If these people could have sold this timber \u2014 if there was a market for it, and they could have sold it and gotten something for it \u2014 it was their duty to do so, and reduce the damages. If, on the other hand, they could not sell it, there was no market for it, and no opportunity to sell it, they were not negligent in failing to do so, and the government would be entitled to recover whatever damages it sustained by reason of the fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\u201cI do not understand that one can negligently and carelessly cause a fire in a timber claim belonging to another, and then respond in damages to the full extent that the other suffered b!y reason of that fact because the timber would, from a speculative standpoint, be worth more money. 'Whether it is worth anything or not is of course dependent upon the market. After the timber is killed, the testimony in this case shows it will decay, and it will decay in a certain length of time. Now, if during that time, before it decayed, there was no market for the timber, no opportunity to sell it, no means by which a man could get any money out of it, the fact that it may have a speculative market value ought not, it seems to me, to be a reason why the damages should be reduced, provided the owner of the property exercised reasonable care and diligence and effort to dispose of the property and reduce the damages to the smallest possible extent, and in that view you have a right to consider this question as it appears from the testimony in this case. * <em>* ' *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cMr. Fenton: I think it but fair to your honor to call your honor\u2019s attention to the instructions that my Brother MeCourt asked your honor to give, and which your honor gave on the subject of damages, where I think your honor used this expression, \u2018And the effect of the burned timber upon the value of the other timber adjacent to it,\u2019 in the last instruction. I think that is not pleaded, your honor, and, although my Brother MeCourt insists upon it, I think I should call the attention of the court to it at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cMr. MeCourt: I don\u2019t remember that your honor gave it. I was going to except because you didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cThe Court: Gentlemen, these instructions were submitted by the counsel, and it may be that in reading them I read more than I intended to. M-y attention has been called by Mr. Fenton to the fact that, in instructing as to the measure of damages. I said you might take into consideration the effect the burned timber would have upon the other timber standing adjacent. I did not intend to give that instruction. The question for you to determine is the injury to the timber that was destroyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">While the instruction given by the court to the jury in respect to the duty of the plaintiff to minimize its damage.by the sale of the damaged timber, if possible, was not as clear as it might have been made, still we are of opinion that the jury must have understood therefrom that that duty devolved upon the plaintiff, and that the effort to do so must be reasonable as to time as well as in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Nor do we think the contention of the plaintiff in error that the jury was left by the instructions t\u2019o consider, in arriving at its verdict, damage to other timber of the plaintiff tljan such as was burned or destroyed, and to consider damage to the land upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>timber stood, is well founded. The record shows that at the close of the court\u2019s charge the counsel for plaintiff in error made objection to that clause thereof which reads, \u201cAnd the effect of the burned timber upon the value of the other timber adjacent to it\u201d; but counsel made no other or further objection, which he should have done if he had any. In response to the objection that was made, the court said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u201cGentlemen, these instructions were submitted by the counsel, and It may be that in reading them I read more than I intended to. My attention has been called by Mr. Fenton to the fact that, in instructing as to the measure of damages, I said you might take into consideration the effect the burned timber would have upon the other timber standing adjacent. I did not intend to give that instruction. The question for you to determine is the injury to the timber that was destroyed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The court thereby limited the consideration of the jury to the timber that was destroyed, and, in our opinion, sufficiently instructed them as to the law governing the case. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
