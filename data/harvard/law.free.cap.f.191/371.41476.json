S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3200]), and 29 individual defendants, owning 56 per cent, of its common stock, were adjudged parties to such illegal combination. The cause was remanded to the Circuit Court to hear the parties \u201cfor the purpose of determining upon some plan or method of dissolving the combination, and of recreating out of the elements now composing it a new condition which shall be honestly in harmony with, and not repugnant to, the law.\u201d The defendant company had property and assets of some $300,000,000 in value, and by means of its own plants, etc., and through other corporations in which it acquired a majority of the stock, controlled approximately 80 per cent, of the business of the United States in tobacco and allied products as well as a very large proportion of foreign business. The plan proposed, as amended and approved by the court, provided in outline that the company should transfer plants and property to the value of over $100,000,000, dividing its previous business between four cor- . porations, and with the proceeds of such property should retire its bonds to the amount of about $100,000,000, thus reducing its working capital and assets; that its preferred stock, exceeding its common stock, previously nonvoting, should be given full voting rights; that the subsidiary and controlled companies should be similiarly subdivided and their preferred stock given voting rights, so that the business previously controlled by it should be in the hands of 14 separate corporations; that its share of the stock of such corporations should be distributed among its stockholders; that all contracts or covenants between it and any of its subsidiary companies, or between it or them and third parties, in restraint of interstate or foreign commerce, should be abrogated. The decree further contained sweeping injunctive provisions restraining each of the 29 individual defendants from increasing his interest in any of the . 14 corporations, and restraining such corporations from acquiring stock in each other, or having common officers or directors, and from entering into any combination or contract with each other in violation of law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b386-8\">[Ed.

For upwards of two months successive conferences, in the presence of two or more members of the court, were had between the Attorney General and the counsel and representatives of the Tobacco Company. Objections of the .Attorney General were followed by modifications of the plan; some of its most drastic provisions being inserted in order to meet or avoid his criticisms. When a point was reached where such adjustment of differences ceased to be .practicable, a time was fixed for a hearing before the whole court upon the matters remaining in dispute. It was in the course of these conferences that a very material reduction of the holdings of the American Tobacco Company was brought about. According to the plan as originally proposed, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>to retain in its treasury, in addition to its working capital, sufficient to pay the outstanding bonds when they matured, about $104,000,000. To this the Attorney General at once objected, insisting that the possession of this enormous amount of money over and above its capital invested in the tobacco business was fraught with possibilities of evil use; that it would be a standing menace to all competitors and could not be tolerated. While not fully conceding the justice of this criticism, counsel for defendants promptly stated that they would undertake to eliminate it. After discussion of two different methods of so -'doing, they themselves at the last conference submitted the present scheme, whereby half of the outstanding bonds would be bought up (and canceled) at a price in excess of their present value, thus insuring a willing surrender of them by present holders, and for the other half securities of the new companies would be offered on a basis of exchange which would insure acceptance of the offer. Since the plan was filed the market reports have given quotations of such bonds of the new companies \u201cif and when.\u201d While such reports are possibly not competent evidence in the trial of a cause,, they seem to indicate that, if the present plan be approved, a very brief period will suffice for the disappearance of substantially all the old bonds and the elimination from the treasury of the American Company of the money or securities required to make them good at maturity. Thus the menace of holding an enormous amount of money, additional to what is legitimately used in the business of the American Company, will disappear. Upon, the .hearing, committees representing a majority of the holders of both issues of bonds appeared and requested the court to approve the plan. Out of the entire two issues, amounting to over $100,000,-000, one holder only of ten 4 per cent, bonds appeared to object on the ground that the terms offered for sale and exchange were not satisfactory to him. Inasmuch as he is under no obligation to accept the offer if it does not please him, and the security for his bonds, if the plan be carried out, will be ample, no modification of the plan is necessary to protect him or others similarly situated. A committee representing a majority of the preferred stockholders also asked that the proposed plan be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The plan contains very many provisions, necessarily so because of the intricate nature of the combination of corporations about to be disrupted. It would unreasonably extend this opinion to undertake to epitomize these provisions. An admirably clear summary of them has been filed by the proponents, and may be considered as in the nature of a recital to this opinion. Besides distributing among its common stockholders a large amount of the stock it now holds in other companies, the American Tobacco Company will be split into three companies which, with a fourth set free of control by the American Company through such distribution of stock, will divide between themselyes the property now owned and the business now done by the American Com'pany. Each of these four companies will thus have a business which in every branch of it will fall materially below a percentage sufficient to control. There are similar disruptions among the accessory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>companies, for the details of which the plan or the summary may be consulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Some of those who have been heard in opposition insist that no plan is practicable; that in conformity with the statute as construed by the Supreme Court the only thing for this court to do is to seize the property through receivership, and proceed to sell it. This proposition need not be discussed. Evidently the Supreme Court believed some plan was practicable, or it would not have directed this court to inquire into the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Upon the hearing other plans for dissolving and recreating were submitted, plans not merely suggesting modifications of the one proposed, but differing widely from it in form and scope. One of them calls for a division into upwards of 60 different companies, others for a distribution of properties by specific allotments, as in the case of a partition of real estate. No time need be given to a consideration of any of these, since there is no suggestion that the defendants will adopt them. On the contrary, counsel for the defendants expressly stated on the argument that they would not undertake to carry them out. Presumably they think they might better take their chances at receiver\u2019s sale. This court has neither authority nor power to carry out and enforce any plan of readjustment without the co-operation of the owners of the property, the holders of these stocks and bonds. It would be a sheer waste of time, therefore, to consider any plan radically different from the one now before us. If we find this plan would not create the conditions defined in the opinion of the Supreme Court, or if such modifications as we may require as a condition of giving our approval are not accepted by defendants, we must obey the mandate of that court, must seize the property, and sell it at public auction in appropriate and convenient lots, applying the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the debts (including the mortgages) or of such dividend thereon as the proceeds may allow, turning over the surplus, if any, to the owners of the equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The main objection to the proposed plan, an objection found in every document filed by those who were given permission to be heard and which seemed to be principally relied on by those who spoke, is what is referred to as \u201ccommon stockholding.\u201d For instance, under the plan two new companies, \u201cI,orillar\u00e1\u201d and \u201cEiggett <em>&amp; </em>Myers,\u201d will be formed out of the American, which will itself, thus reduced in size, continue in existence. The same individuals, the present 1,800 or more common stockholders of the American, will hold the entire common stock of each of the other two companies. A similar condition will exist with some, at least, of the other companies. It is contended that, although under such circumstances there may be potential competition, no real competition can exist. With this argument or the reply to it, it seems to me this court is not 'concerned. In two recent cases (the Northern Securities and the Standard Oil) the Supreme Court found a combination of corporations to have offended against the anti-trust act. As a result of such finding there was a disintegration of the combination. In each the disintegration left the stock of the separate entities into which the group was split in the hand of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>same body of individual stockholders. Since there was no disapproval of this method of disintegration indicated in either opinion, it would seem that the question whether or not common stockholding is \u201crepugnant to the law\u201d \u2014 that is, repugnant to the anti-trust act \u2014 has been settled for this court by controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">It is true that the Supreme Court did not enter into any discussion of this question of \u201ccommon ownership,\u201d but its existence in both cases was so plainly manifest that it is difficult to understand how the court could have approved of the new arrangement, unless it was satisfied that such arrangement did not contain the same vice as the old one, which they held must be terminated. If this be so, discussion here of the question whether or not <em>common </em>ownership is within the prohibition of the statute would seem'to be academic. This also seems to be the view of the government, which does not discuss common stockholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The next objection presented by those not parties who have been heard is directed to the size of the companies. As an illustration, it appears from the statistics submitted that of the total smoking tobacco business of the country four companies will have the following percentages : American, 33.08; Liggett &amp; Myers, 20.05; Lorillard, 22.82; Reynolds, 2.66. It i's insisted that these large companies should be still further disintegrated. The plan is further criticised because each of these companies is described as \u201ccompletely equipped for the conduct of a large tobacco business,\u201d whereas existing independent concerns are none of them so equipped, and it is argued that there can be no effective competition until the several concerns which are to carry forward the business of the trust are put into the same condition as to size and equipment as now prevails among existing independent concerns. It is further contended that no company engaged in the plug tobacco business should be allowed to take over any cigarette or cigar business; that a company taking a cigarette business should not take over any smoking tobacco, plug, or cigar business, and so on; that there should be a rearrangement of factories and brands, an intricate subject, which is fully discussed in a report from the bureau of corporations, filed at the hearing. Manifestly the minuter the fragments into which the old combination is split, and the more they are prohibited from conducting business as other companies are free to conduct it, the less will be their ability'to compete with such other companies. This whole line of argument deals with the economics of the tobacco business. No doubt the novel problem presented to this court is connected with questions of economics as well as with questions of law. But this is a court of law, not a commerce commission, and the legal side of the proposition would seem to be the controlling one. The true way to state the problem, as I understand, it, is this: Assume that a group of corporations engaged in some business which comes within the domain of interstate commerce is charged before the Supreme Court with violation of the anti-trust act. Assume that they are organized as the companies provided for in this plan will be; that they are similarly capitalized; that the business they do ' is similar in amount and similarly distributed; that their stock is similarly held, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>with the natural temptation to co-operate which such common stock-holding may be calculated to induce, but are also curbed and restrained from yielding to such temptation as these companies will be by the injunction which will accompany our approval of this plan, a permanent injunction binding all defendants in this suit and their privies, and all new companies created under the plan and their privies. Would the Supreme Court hold that the condition thus presented was \u201c'repugnant to the law\u201d- \u2014 that is, repugnant to the anti-trust statute? A long and careful study of the last two deliverances of that court (in the Standard Oil Case and in this case) has convinced me that its answer to that question would be in the negative. I may he wrong in interpretation of its deliverances \u2014 if so, it will not be for the first time \u2014 but, since such is my conviction, there would seem to be no necessity for discussing on its economic side a question already settled by controlling authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Leaving for the moment the objections and suggestions of persons not parties, those of the Attorney General may be next considered. He does not attack the general features of the proposed plan with its division of the business controlled by the old company among 14 companies, nor does he contend that \u201ccommon stockholding\u201d is in and by itself an infraction of the anti-trust statute. His suggested modifications are directed mainly towards providing such safeguards for the future that the 14 companies may not so conduct their operations as to violate the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">He requests that the following conditions to any approval of the plan submitted be imposed \u2014 presumably the more convenient way to impose most of such restrictions would be by injunctive provisions incorporated in the final decree:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">(1) That during a period of not less than five years no one of the corporations among which the properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed shall have any officer or director who is also an officer or director in any other of such corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">This suggestion is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">(2) That the plan be so modified that the principal company shall dispose o\u00ed, and, when the disintegration is complete, shall not retain any of the stocks of any of the accessory companies, and each of the accessory companies shall dispose of all of the stocks held by it of the principal and of each of the other accessory companies held by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The general proposition here advanced is sound and is approved, but the last clause seems to be already provided for, and there is probably an exception or two necessary to be made in the first clause by reason of the rights of outstanding stockholders not connected with the American Tobacco Company. Counsel can probably agree as to phraseology which will conform more especially to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">(3) That no one of the corporations among which the property and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed shall during the same period retain or employ the same agency for the purchase of tobacco leaf or other raw material, or for the sale of tobacco or other products, as that of any other of such corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">There should be a change of phraseology in this and some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>other requests. It is not entirely clear whether the prohibition is directed to all the 14 companies or only to a part of them. It should apply to all. After the words \u201cagency for the purchase\u201d there should. be added the words \u201cin the United States.\u201d This request with such modifications is approved, and counsel may agree on a phraseology which will cover any possible exceptions arising from the allotments in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">(4) That no one of the corporations among which the property and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed shall retain or employ the same clerical or other organization, or occupy the same office or offices as any other of the said corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">This is approved, with modifications similar to those indicated as to the request next above.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">(5) That no one of the corporations among which the properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed shall retain and hold capital stock in any other corporation, any part of whose stock is also retained and held by any of the other of the corporations among which such properties and businesses are to be distributed, or . shall purchase or acquire any stock in any other of such corporations. This is approved, but should contain an exception, upon which it is understood counsel are in accord, in the single case of the Porto Rican Leaf Tobacco Company. Counsel may agree upon the phraseology to be inserted in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">(6) That no one of the corporations among which the properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed shall, during a period of five years, directly or indirectly, acquire any stock in any one of the others of said corporations, or purchase or acquire the property or business, or both, of any other of said corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">With a change of phraseology which will make this applicable to all the 14 companies, this request is approved. A similar request is found among those submitted! by other'objectors, with an additional clause forbidding any one of these 14 companies \u201cfrom making loans or otherwise extending credit\u201d to any of the others. This suggestion is a proper one and may be embodied in the Attorney General\u2019s request..</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">(7) To the end that the 29 individual defendants in this suit shall not increase their control over any of the corporations among which the properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed, pursuant to the plan that such defendants be severally enjoined from, at any time within five years from the date of the decree, acquiring, directly or indirectly, the legal or equitable ownership of any amount of stock in any one of said corporations in addition to. the amounts which they will respectively hold if and when the plan shall have been carried out as proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">This is approved, but the phraseology should be modified as already indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">\u25a0 Upon the argument the Attorney General stated that he would be willing to substitute \u201cthree years\u201d for \u201cfive years.\u201d Such change seems desirable, as it would probably result in more rapid distribution, of present holdings. There should also be a proviso excepting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the operation of this prohibition any and ail sales and purchases by these 29 individuals inter sese, the phraseology of which counsel may 'agree upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">It may not be a wise public policy to make it easy for foreigners to take over the control of the British-American Company, with its large and growing business in foreign countries, notably in South Africa land the Ear East, now in American hands. That is what would probably happen if the 29 defendants be prohibited from increasing their holdings of that stock. We do not undertake to determine this question of public policy, which is one for the consideration of the executive branch of the government. It is sufficient to say that a further exception of the shares of that company from the operation of this paragraph would not in our opinion make the plan repugnant to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">(8) That the preferred stock of the American Cigar Company,, aggregating in book value $2,530,216.69, held by the American Snuff Company, and the stock and bonds of American Tobacco Company, held by the American Snuff Company, referred to on page 11 of the plan (footnote \u201ca\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> be sold or otherwise be disposed of within one year, instead of three years, as proposed in the plan, with leave to defendants to apply to the court to extend such period for not more than two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">There seems to be no good reason for modifying the plan in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">(9) That in the distribution of the properties and businesses now held in the combination pursuant to the plan of disintegration no corporation shall be allowed to acquire property, tangible or intangible, which would invest it with as much as 40 per cent, in volume or in value of any particular line of the tobacco business.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">This is substantially what the plan now provides. The few instances in which the 40 per cent, limitation is exceeded result from inherent difficulties of distribution, which it seems impracticable to eliminate. These instances are so few, and the excess in each instance so .small, as to be fairly negligible. The request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">(10) That the stocks of the JBiggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and P. Lorillard Company, provided to be in accordance with the plan, be deposited with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York as the agent, or depository of this court in this cause for the purposes specified in the plan, and that at the end of the period designated the court-make an order for their further disposition. That in the meantime no voting right with respect to such stock shall be exercised, except \u2022 as the court may from time to time order.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">All of this is already sufficiently provided for in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">(11) That all the covenants in any way restricting the right of any company or individual in the combination to buy, manufacture, or sell tobacco or its products should be rescinded by the affirmative action of the respective parties thereto, who are parties to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">This is approved, except that there should be a proviso excepting certain foreign business, the phraseology of which counsel may agree upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>(12) That the action proposed in subdivision C of the plan on page 6<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> terminating certain covenants be amplified so as to include like action with respect to all covenants not only concerning the tobacco busi-. ness, but any other business which is in any way embraced in the combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">This is approved. We understand the proposed plan as so providing in spirit, if not in letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">(13) That all contracts or covenants between the American Tobacco Company or any other companies in the combination and the British-American Tobacco Company giving to the latter company the exclusive right 'to manufacture, or sell brands belonging to any of the companies in the combination' be rescinded or otherwise terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The brands thus sold passed to the purchaser for a valuable consideration under an executed contract. The request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The fourteenth request deals with the United Cigar Stores Company, a subject which will be treated separately infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The Attorney General further asks for a comprehensive injunction to be incorporated in the final decree providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">\u201cThat the defendants named in the petition, their respective officers, directors, agents, servants, and employes, be forever enjoined and prohibited from continuing or carrying into further effect the combination adjudged illegal by the Supreme Court, and from entering into or forming any like combination or conspiracy the effect of which is or will be to restrain commerce in tobacco or its products, or in articles used in connection with the manufacture and trade in tobacco and its products, among the states or in the territories or with foreign nations, or to prolong the unlawful monopoly of such commerce obtained and possessed by the defendants as adjudged herein in violation of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">\u201c(1) By causing the conveyance of the physical property and business of any of the corporations among which the properties and businesses now in the combinations are to be distributed to any other of said corporations, by placing the stocks of any one or more of said corporations in the hands of voting trustees or controlling the voting power of such stocks by any similar device; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">\u201c(2J By making any express or implied agreement or arrangements together or one with another like those adjudged illegal by the Supreme Court in this cause relative to the control or management of any of said corporations, or the price or terms of purchase or of sale of tobacco or any of its products, or the supplies or other product dealt with in connection with the tobacco business, or relative to the purchase, sale, transportation, or manufacture of tobacco, or its product or supplies or other product dealt with as aforesaid, by any of the parties hereto, which, will have a like effect in restraint of commerce among the states, in the territories and with foreign nations, to that of the combination the operation of which is enjoined in this cause; or by making any agreement or arrangement of any kind with any other of such corporations under which trade or business is apportioned between such corporations, in respect either to customers or localities; or by any of such corporations doing business directly or indirectly under any other than their own corporate respective names; by refusing to sell to any jobber any brands of any tobacco product manufactured by it except upon condition that such jobber shall purchase from the vendor some other brand or product also manufactured and sold by it; or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">. \u201c(8) By the British-American Company and the Imperial Company employing a common agent for the purchase of leaf tobacco in the United States or. by either of said two companies uniting with any of the corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ciiiciis which the properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed in the employment of a common agent for the purchase of tobacco leaf.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The clause in the latter part of subdivision 2 as to each company doing business under its own corporate name should be made more specific, especially in view of the requests of other objectors that tobacco products should be sold only under the name of the owner. There should be nothing in the decree destroying the value of a brand or altering the classification of products in the records of the internal revenue bureau. Counsel may agree upon a modified phraseology to avoid any such difficulty leaving the 14 companies to pursue all ordinary methods prevailing in the tobacco business.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The clause as to refusing to sell to any jobber should be reconstructed so as not to prohibit any of the 14 companies from methods of business which arc open to and practiced: by all their competitors. Counsel may agree to a phraseology which will formulate this expression of opinion. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Clause 3 should be amended bv adding the words \u201cwithin the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">With these modifications, the entire section providing for injunctions is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Returning now to the requests of the various other objectors, we find that nearly all of them are covered by those of the Attorney General or have been already disposed of by the discussion of the general features of the plan. Among those not so disposed of are noted requests that the 14 companies be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">(A) From giving away or selling at or below the cost of manufacture and distribution any of its products, from giving rebates, allowances, or other special inducements to purchasers or users, and from refusing to sell to any jobber any special brand he may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">The record in this case show\u2019s that these are the common methods of the tobacco business, practiced by all alike. It is only by giving away samples, or by offering on favorable terms, irrespective of cost, that newr brands of tobacco products can be introduced or old brands extended into new territory. All other companies are free to employ these methods, which are obnoxious to no statute, and there is no reason why the 14 companies should be forbidden to do so. This request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">(B) From espionage on the business of any competitor, from bribery of employes of such competitor, and from obtaining information from any United States revenue official.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Why any one individual or corporation engaged in this business may not acquire such information as he or it can legitimately obtain from private or public sources as to the business of a competitor w\u2019e fail to see. When illegitimate methods are proved, they may be dealt with. This request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">(C) That every independent or other person interested should, in the event of any alleged violation of the injunction, have liberty to apply to the court for protection and for such action as may. appear to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The result of 'such a provision would be to overwhelm the court with a multitude of applications, mainly frivolous. Any one who feels aggrieved should take his complaint to the Attorney General, who will winnow the wheat from the chaff. If he finds substance in any allegation, he can bring it before the court. This request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">(D) It is requested that the majority stock of the Eipfort Scales Company, now owned by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, be sold, \u201cwith an injunction against any present stockholder in the Reynolds Company, in the American Company, or in any of the allied companies, from purchasing at such sale.\u201d A similar request for a sale, under like restrictions, is made as to the stock of five other companies now owned by the American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">This request is denied for reasons set forth infra in discussing the disposition of the stock of the United Cigar Stores Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">(E) The Attorney General of the state of New York suggests that the proposed plan may violate the anti-monopoly laws of this state. He does not indicate in what respect it will do \u2022so. We think it unnecessary to make any investigation on the line suggested. Our approval of this plan will not secure to these 14 companies immunity for violation of the laws of this or of any other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Referring next to the defendant the Imperial Tobacco Company, the Attorney General asks that the plan shall include provisions terminating all executory contracts or agreements between the Imperial Tobacco Company, on the one hand, and the American Tobacco Company and the British-American Tobacco Company and each and every of the corporations parties defendant hereto on the other; and also a provision enjoining the said American Tobacco Company from uniting with the British-American Tobacco Company in the employment of a common agent for the purchase of leaf tobacco in the United States, and from uniting with any of the corporations among which the properties and business now in the combination are to be distributed, in the employment of a common agent for the purchase of leaf tobacco or any of the products of tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">These provisions, of course, should be restricted to such as affect trade or commerce between the states, or between the United States and foreign countries. We understand that the proposed plan in substance so provides; but, if there be any doubt as to its doing so, counsel may agree on the form of amendments which will insert these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The disposition of the United Cigar Stores Company has been discussed by most of the objectors. ' Those who represent the independents insist that it shall be split up into separate concerns, \u201cpreferably ten.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">It is not one of the so-called accessory companies, and the Supreme Court has not directed that it be disintegrated. Upon the trial much \u2022testimony was taken as to this company, and the question whether or not it was a combination obnoxious to the provisions of the anti-trust act was carefully examined. We reached the conclusion, unanimously, \u2022 that it was not. A succinct statement of our reasons for reaching that conclusion will be found in Judge Coxe\u2019s opinion (164 Fed. 700). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>We therefore dismissed the bill as to that company. The Supreme Court, however, held that we erred in so doing, solely because the American Tobacco Company had bought and held two-thirds of its capital stock, which brought it into the general combination. Under the proposed plan all this stock held by the American Tobacco Company is to he distributed to its own common stockholders, and the sole ground upon which the Supreme Court reversed this court is thus removed. The situation will then stand as to all other grounds as it did before, and we see no reason to change the opinion expressed on the original hearing. No new evidence is offered except to the fact that it has in the interim largely increased the number of its stores. Such increase, however, leaves it in control of less than 4 per cent, of the entire business in which it is engaged. The request to disintegrate it is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\">The Attorney General does not ask that it be disintegrated. He has, however, argued at length and with much earnestness that the continued growth of this enterprise affects the small retail dealer, who is without capital to compete with it and applies to the government to protect him. There may come a time when the growth of this company or the methods by which such growth is stimulated may bring it within the prohibition of the statute. Tut that time has not yet come, and the only request the Attorney General, in response to appeals for aid, has formulated is this: That the stock of the United Cigar Stores Company he sold and distributed to parties other than the 29 individual defendants or others of the common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company, to the end that the corporation be entirely separated from any <em>connection </em>with <em>the </em>corporations to which <em>the </em>properties and businesses now in the combination are to be distributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">We have no power to grant any such request. The anti-trust act carefully enumerates the penalties for a violation of its provisions\u2014 fines, imprisonment, injunction against continuing to transact interstate business, treble damages to all persons injured by an unlawful combination, seizure, and forfeiture of property in course of interstate transportation. These are certainly ample to enforce obedience. Ty confiscation of property in transit and injunction against continuance in interstate business an offender may be put out of active existence into a state of paralysis as helpless as dissolution. It might be said that to these penalties the Supreme Court has added another, a qualified confiscation of property not in transit by receivership and forced sale. Nowhere, however, is there any authority for the proposition that this court may seize the property of private persons who may have offended against the statute and sell it under conditions which would preclude the holder of the title or the owner of the equity from bidding at the sale so as to compel the purchaser to pay a reasonable price for it, or from buying it himself if no one else will pay full value for it. That is confiscation; none the less so because the proceeds of such a sale, after paying outstanding debts and expenses, are to be turned over to the owner. Until Congress shall expressly give such power to this court, or until some obscure language in its grant of power shall be construed by the Supreme Court as in effect convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>ing such power, this court is not prepared to assume that it possesses any such authority. The request is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The Eudington Cigarette Machine Company, which has a decree for an accounting against the Anargyros Company, has applied for relief. The stock of the last-named company is by the plan to be transferred to P. Lorillard Company. \u2022 The Tu ding ton Company asks for the insertion of a provision which will secure it against any resulting difficulty on such accounting. Provision should be made in carrying out the plan for keeping intact the books and records of the American Tobacco Company, its present constituents and branches, so that they shall be available and subject to examination to the same extent as at present in suits for accounting and other existing litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The Attorney General further requests that there should be reserved to the government the right at any time within five years from date of entry to apply to the court for other and further relief upon a showing that as a matter of fact such plan has not resulted in creating a new condition which shall be honestly in harmony with and not repugnant to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It is not apparent that this court has the power so to do. Had it not been for the mandate of the Supreme Court, it might be questioned whether a Circuit Court of the United States had any jurisdiction to recreate a new group of corporations out of the elements into which a pre-existing group of corporations had been split, or to formulate a plan or method according to which individuals, natural or corporate, were to be invited to invest money and embark in business. All such questions are, of course, resolved for us by the decision of the court of last resort. But neither in its mandate nor in its opinion is there any warrant for the conclusion that this court is to prescribe the temporary terms of a modus vivendi, with power to reassemble five years hence, ourselves or our survivors and successors, and modify those terms, while in the, interim by purchase or exchange of these bonds upwards of $100,000,000 worth of property shall have changed hands irrevocably.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The only function assigned to *us is to consider any proposed plan which responsible parties engage to carry out, and approve or reject it. In the event of rejection the only alternative is injunction,\u2019 receivership, and sale. The time limit fixed in the mandate \u2014 six months, and possibly two more \u2014 precludes any other construction of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">WARD, Circuit Judge, concurs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\"> See 191 Fed. 400,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b394-13\"> See 191 Fed. 399.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b398-9\">COXE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-b\">I approve of the proposed plan, not because I think it perfect, but because it is. the best plan attainable. Perfection is impossible. The condition existing before the illegal combination was formed, cannot b\u00e9 restored; it has gone beyond the hope of recall. The plan which we have sanctioned eliminates the objectionable features prohibited by the anti-trust act, and permits no unreasonable or unlawful restraint of trade. In short, were the various corporations which the plan authorizes organized for the first time to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>day they would not be within the letter or the mischief of the statute. We have endeavored, while punishing the guilty defendants \u2014 corporations and individuals \u2014 to remember that the rights of many innocent bondholders and shareholders are at stake and should be protected as far as is consistent with a complete compliance with the requirements of the law. The plan disintegrates the combination, destroys the monopoly and liberates trade; but it accomplishes all this without a wanton destruction of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">I have been impressed with the evident intention of counsel representing the various defendants to accept without reservation the result of the litigation and faithfully to carry out the plan, not only in letter but in spirit as well. Many suggestions have been advanced by counsel representing persons not parties to the suit, which, from an economic or ethical viewpoint are impeccant. When, however, it is remembered that we are acting only under the command of the Supreme Court, limited as to scope and time, it will be seen how powerless we are to make conditions favorable to the so-called \u201cindependents,\u201d when we can exact no reciprocal obligations from them. We are to ascertain and determine upon \u201csome plan or method of dissolving the combination and of recreating out of the elements now composing it, a new condition which shall be honestly in harmony with and not repugnant to the law.\u201d This we can do, and when it is done our commission ends. The consideration which has the greatest weight with me is that no one has proposed a better plan, the only alternative offered being the appointment of a receiver \u2014 a receiver for corporation.; solvent and prosperous. I agree with the Attorney General that such a calamity should be avoided, except as a last resort. It is impossible to forecast the disaster which would follow such a step. It would wreck a flourishing business upon which an army of employes are depending for a livelihood; it would unsettle trade, and it would punish with equal severity the innocent and the guilty. More than this, I am by no means convinced that it would not produce the very evil which this action was instituted to destroy. A receiver can dispose of the property in his hands only by a judicial sale to the highest bidder, who will lake title sanctioned by a decree of the court creating the receivership. In the present case, the men best equipped to make this bid are the very men who now control the condemned corporations. It is surely possible, if not probable, that the property might thus come under their control with a title which will render them immune from further prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">For these reasons, thus briefly stated, I think that the plan, with the amendments directed by this court, should be adopted.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">NOYES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A86\">(concurring). The Supreme Court of the United States, after finding the illegality of this combination, placed the duty upon this court of hearing the parties \u201cfor the purpose of ascertaining and determining upon some plan or method of dissolving the combination and of recreating, out of the elements now composing it, a new condition which shall be honestly in harmony with and not repugnant to the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>And the Supreme Court added these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201cIn view of the considerations which we have stated, we leave the matter to the court below to work ont a compliance with the law without unnecessary injury to the public or the rights of private property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">By these directions this court is required to enter into the examination of questions, economical as well as legal, and to depart from the function of determining existing controversies to that of deciding the legality of future proposed action. The duty imposed is extraordinary, because the Supreme Court in imposing it was dealing with an extraordinary situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The question was as to the relief to be afforded. A decree forbidding corporate stockholding would have been inadequate, because the combination was largely based upon property ownership. Original conditions could not be restored. Immediate extreme measures \u25a0 would have inflicted irreparable injury upon innocent interests. It was necessary to provide a method for determining in advance whether a proposed plan of disintegration would harmonize with the law, and hence the direction to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The magnitude and varied nature of the assets of the corhbination, the extent of its liabilities, the ramifications of its business and the complexity of its affairs would make our duty difficult if we were required merely to apply rules of dissolution and recreation prescribed by the Supreme Court. But from the very intricacy of the case there are no rules. We are left without guide to turn a condition in violation, of the law into a condition honestly in harmony with it. The only measure of the extent of rehabilitation required is the object to be attained. The evils found to exist alone indicate the measure required to meet them.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">If, then, we approach the performance of our duty without an appreciation of the complexity of the problem and of the difficulties under which the formulators of any plan must labor, we will not go far. If we are not satisfied with a substantial compliance of the law, if we strain after the ideal and put aside the practicable, it will be easy to bring on a receivership with its attendant losses to innocent investors. But that result was what the Supreme Court was. solicitous of avoiding, and, I think, intended that we should recognize the problem presented to us as a very practical one to be disposed of in a practical way. Moreover, in the performance of our duty we owe much to the Attorney General, who, while always insisting upon the rights of the public and by such insistence bringing the plan into its present shape has, nevertheless \u2014 as it has seemed to me \u2014 felt that he, too, owed a duty to protect innocent interests and not to cause ruin and disaster by forcing extreme measures which might, even from the public point of view, in the end produce no better results than those at hand, and possibly infinitely worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Taking up the plan, we know at the outset that it is an honest one. It has been built up almost in our presence, and whatever question there may be as to its merits, there is none of the good faith of its authors nor of the ability and conscientiousness with which they have performed their task.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The present combination lias vast capitalization and assets. The corporations of the plan will have large capitalization and assets. Whether that is an objection should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The Supreme Court did not condemn the combination on account of the great amount of property which it had acquired. Indeed it must now be accepted that magnitude of business in and of itself does not constitute unlawful monopoly, at least up to the point where economy of production and management are thereby promoted. There must be something more \u2014 some unlawful or oppressive act or purpose in acquiring the business or after its acquisition \u2014 to come within the condemnation of the statute. But it cannot be denied that there is an enormous, inherent and collateral power incident to the holding by a single corporation of vast assets which no group of individuals, although having similar possessions, should obtain. There is such a potentiality of monopolization that a court in striving to bring about a condition in harmony with the law should hesitate to approve the existence of a producing corporation having vast assets not necessary for the work of production. Consequently when it appeared in the formulation of this plan that the American Tobacco Company was to receive from the other corporations over a hundred million dollars in cash and securities which it was required to hold to meet its indebtedness, but which it did not need in its business, thq plan, notwithstanding many valuable features, seemed unacceptable. But meeting the objections of the Attorney General, a way was found \u2014 as shown in the plan \u2014 of appropriating those funds to the payment of debts so that the readjusted American Company \u2014 still the largest of ail \u2014 will possess some one hundred millions of property\u2014 mostly working assets and brand values \u2014 as compared with the three hundred millions it formerly held. In view of modern commercial conditions, I think that the court should make tio objection to the mere size of the corporations of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Taking up the question, then, whether the plan gives effect to the statute, the answer, as we have seen, depends upon whether it remedies the conditions found to violate the statute, and it is necessary to turn to the decision of the Supreme Court to find out those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Without examining the decision in detail, it is sufficient here to say that the court found broadly the combination to be in restraint of trade within the first section and an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization within the second section of the statute. In particular the court found among the bases for its conclusions: (a) Covenants of vendors and others binding themselves for long periods not to compete with the combination; (b) the absorption of the control of corporations supplying the elements essential to the manufacture of tobacco product and other corporate stockholding; (c) the existence of controlling \u201cpower in the hands of the few\u201d; (d) the obtaining' of control of tlie tobacco trade by wrongful and oppressive acts, agreements and arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Obviously, the evil of restrictive covenants must he met by the termination of such covenants and that is accomplished by the plan. It provides for the abrogation of all covenants made by vendor corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>rations, partnerships or individuals not to engage in the tobacco business, and for the termination of foreign restrictive covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The evil qf controlling the production of the elements essential to tobacco manufacture must be met by requiring the tobacco manufacturing corporations to be disconnected from the production of such elements. This seems to be fairly accomplished by the plan. The shares held by the combination in the corporation manufacturing tinfoil and the voting shares held in the corporation manufacturing licorice are to be distributed. When that is done, none of the tobacco manufacturing companies of the plan will have any legal domination over the production of those essentials. So the evil of corporate stockholding is met by divesting the American Company of any interest in the snuff business, in the retail cigar business, and of its shares in\u2019 other important corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The evils pointed out'by the Supreme Court growing out of the existence of power in the hands of the few to control the combination must be met by the destruction of such power. This power had its basis in the holding of a majority of the voting shares of the American Company by the individual defendants in this suit. It is proposed to destroy this power by giving the preferred stock of the American Company, which has heretofore had no voting rights, full voting power by creating voting rights in the preferred shares of other corporations, and by so distributing shares that, in the language of the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">\u201cNo smalt group of men, nor even <em>the 29 </em>individual defendants in the aggregate, will own the control of any of the principal, accessory or subsidiary companies defendant, and the control of the American Tobacco Company itself and of the new companies to be formed will be vested in a body of more than six thousand stockholders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In addition to these provisions this court, at the instance of the Attorney General, will guard against the acquisition by the defendants of control in the future by enjoining them from increasing their aggregate stockholdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">With this additional provision I think the requirement that power of control be taken out of the hands of the individual defendants sufficiently met. It is true that while shorn of legal control they will own substantial minority interests in the different corporations, and that in the practical workings of the affairs of a corporation a minority interest through the inaction of the majority, may often control it. But the control of a corporation lies in the majority of its shares, and if we see that the legal control of those corporations is placed in other hands than those of the defendants I think we go far enough. In my opinion we are not called upon to guard against the possible failure of the majority to exercise its power.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The next inquiry is whether the plan fairly meets the evil of obtaining control of the tobacco trade by oppressive tactics as well as the broad conclusion of illegality. And my opinion is that it does in case, but only in case, the state of monopoly found to exist is ended by a division of business and a state of reasonable competitive business established.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>This is the state of monopoly which now exists: The American Company,, either directly or through its ownership of stock in other corporations, controls the manufacture of 75 per cent, of the smoking tobacco manufactured in the United States; 80 per cent, of the plug \u00a1tobacco, 70 per cent, of the fine cut, 80 per cent, of the cigarettes, 13 per cent, of the cigars, 90 per cent, of the snuff, and 93 per cent, of the little cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Broadly speaking, the proposed plan of disintegration is to divide the tobacco business among four corporations, no one of which is to have a controlling interest therein. When the disintegration is accomplished, the business will be so distributed that no company will have substantially over 40 per cent, in volume or value in any particular line. Furthermore, I am satisfied that there is to be a fair distribution of brands as well as of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Without examining the details of the plan, it is enough to say that careful study of it has convinced me that in so far as the distribution of business is concerned, sufficient has been done to end the state of monopoly and to establish reasonably competitive conditions. If practicable, it might have been more desirable to divide the business into a greater number of parts. But as the plan stands it cannot, in my opinion, be said that any of the corporations will have such preponderating influence in the tobacco industry as to give it power to control the market, either as manufacturer, seller or purchaser. The possibility of future acts of oppression is to be guarded against by a comprehensive injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">This brings us to the final question which is whether the fact of common stockholding is a material objection to the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Obviously common ownership in the shares of the various corporations cannot well be avoided. Each stockholder of the American Company had an undivided interest in its property remaining after the payment of its debts. When its assets are distributed among stockholders each is entitled to his proportionate share. When such distribution takes the place of corporate shares the necessary result is a common ownership of stock in different corporations. I am not convinced that in the absence of statutory authority any division by valuation and allotment could be effected, and if legally possible it is evident that the complicated conditions which would necessarily arise in carrying it out would render it impracticable wflthin the time prescribed by the Supreme Court for the disintegration of this combination.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The objection to mutual stockholding is not that competition is eliminated in principle. Potential competition necessarily exists. The same conditions do not continue indefinitely. Stockholders die and estates are divided. Differences of opinion upon values lead to sales and exchanges. Potential competition with an open market must fairly end in real competition. But the objection is to present and not future conditions, and, from an economic point of view, 1 have always thought it entitled to serious consideration. \u00a1Manifest difficulties must attend the establishment of real competition between different corporations having the same body of stockholders. In the case of small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>corporations having few stockholders who directly participate in their management they would be, perhaps, insuperable. They would decrease in proportion to the increase.in the size of the corporation and the separation of the stockholders from the active management of their affairs, until \u2014 as I view it \u2014 in the case of the disintegration of a corporation having vast assets and a very large number of scattered stockholders they would be so minimized as hardly to warrant consideration even from an economic standpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">That which has made me pause in the present case is the concentrated common stockholding of the individual defendants. After careful consideration, however, I have reached the conclusion that that objection should not operate to prevent the acceptance of the plan, but should call for most rigorous measures of injunctive relief to keep the various corporations apart, independent and free from connections or arrangements to prevent competition. In reaching this conclusion I am influenced by the proposition stated at the outset that we should take care that we do not by seeking the ideal reject the practicable and put in peril innocent property interests, and I am controlled, as I view it, by the decisions of the Supreme Court in the Northern Securities and Standard Oil cases. It is impossible for me to read those decisions without being convinced that the Supreme Court in remanding this case to us did not intend that we should reject a plan upon the ground of pro rata distribution. I am also influenced, if not controlled, by the position taken by the Attorney General, the representative of the party plaintiff in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">So, taking the plan as a whole, with the essential measures of injunctive relief proposed by the Attorney General, I think that it meets the principal evils pointed out in the opinion of the Supreme Court; that it brings about a condition fairly in harmony with the law, and that it is the duty of this court to approve it as the best solution possible under all the circumstances of a very difficult practical problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In conclusion: The extent to which it has been necessary to tear apart this combination and force it into new forms, with the attendant burdens, ought to demonstrate that the federal anti-trust statute is a drastic statute which accomplishes effective results; which, so long;as it stands on the statute books must be obeyed, and which cannot be disobeyed without incurring far-reaching penalties. And, on the other hand, the successful reconstruction of this organization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute against industrial combinations is not to destroy but to reconstruct; not to demolish but to recreate in accordance with the conditions which the Congress has declared shall exist among the people of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">I concur in the opinion of Judge LA COMBE, and fully approve his disposition of the subjects not considered in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The present American Tobacco Company was organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey. Either directly or through its ownership of stock in other companies, it controls the production of 75 per cent, of smoking tobacco manufactured in the United States, 80 per cent, of plug tobacco, 79 per cent, of fine cut, 80 per cent, of cigarettes, 13 per cent, of cigars, 90 per cent, of snuff, and 93 per cent, of little cigars. Through its ownership of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>two-thirds of the .stock of the Conley Tin Foil Company it has a large control over the tin foil business. By its stockholding in the American Snuff Company it exercises a controlling influence in the snuff business. Through its ownership of the stock of .MacAndrews &amp; Forbes it dominates the business of manufacturing licorice paste. By reason of its ownership of two-thirds <em>of the </em>ordinary shares of the British-American Company it has a controlling position in trade with and in foreign countries, its control of two-thirds of the stock of the Porto Rican-Ameriean Tobacco Company makes it the most influential factor in the manufacture of lJorto Rican tobacco. Because of its ownership of two-thirds of the stock of the United Cigar Stores Company it is an important factor in the retail tobacco trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The American Tobacco Company has an outstanding issue of 6 per cent, debenture bonds of 852.882,050, an out standing issue of 4 por cent, debenture bonds of 851,354,100. $78,080,000 of 6 per cent, preferred stock, and $40,-200,400, of common stock. Of tlic common stock the 29 individual defendants, who were adjudged by the Supreme Court to be parties to the illegal combination. own about 56 per cent., while the great majority of the preferred stock, which has never had voting rights, is owned by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The Supreme Court having declared this combination of corporations and individuals, engaged in the manufacture and sale of tobacco and its related products, to be illegal, because in restraint of trade and an attempt at monopolization, directed the Circuit Court for the Southern District of ISfew York to 'hear the parlies for the purpose of devising some plan or method of dissolving the combination, and of recreating out <em>of </em>the (dements composing it a new condition in harmony with the law. lmt without unnecessary injury to the public or the rights of private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The plan now proposed undertakes to disintegrate the combination and to restore lawful conditions, by dividing the businesses in tobacco and related products heretofore dominated and controlled by the American Tobacco Company, or by companies in which it has hold a large or controlling interest, among 14 separate and independent, companies; no one of them having control of or dominance in the trade as to any of the products manufactured by it, no one of them having any dominance or controlling position as to purchase of raw material of any kind, whether of the several types of leaf tobacco or otherwise, no one of them having any interest by way of ownership of stock or otherwise in any other of them, and each of them being a company, whether now existing or to tie created under the plan, in which the American Tobacco Company will have no interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">This disintegration will be accomplished by one or the other of the following methods: (1) By distributing by way of dividends, to the stockholders entitled thereto, securities of other companies held by the companies sought to be disintegrated. <em>(2) </em>By forming one or more new companies and selling thereto a substantial part of the property and,business of the company sought to be disintegrated, in return for securities of such new company or companion and distributing such securities by way of dividends to the stockholders entitled thereto out of the surplus of the company to be disintegrated. (3) By the sale of property and business for cash. (4) By forming a new company or new companies and selling thereto a substantial part of the property and business of the company to be disintegrated, for cash and for new securities to be offered in exchange for and retirement of the securities of tile vendor coin]\u00a1any. (5) By terminating all restrictive covenants not to engage in the tobacco trade, whether with corporations or individuals, and whether affecting domestic or foreign trade, thus releasing a large number of persons and corporations from their present obligation not to engage in tlie tobacco trade, and removing ail obstacles in the way of those* who desire to re-enter it. (6) By radical changes in the voting rights of stock, so that the individual defendants will no longer in the aggregate have control of any company in the tobacco business or any related business.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Inasmuch as the American Tobacco Company, denominated the \u2018\u2018principal defendant,\u201d and the five companies, to wit, American Snuff Company, American Cigar Company, American Stogie Company, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company, and the Conley Foil Company, denominated \u201caccessory defendants,\u201d are held each to constitute in and of itself a combination in restraint of trade, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>the plan provides for the disintegration of each of these six companies by the disp'osition by each of them of a substantial part of its property and business. In addition to this disintegration of the American Tobacco Company and the five accessory companies, many other companies, denominated \u201csubsidiary companies,\u201d are to be wholly separated from the principal and accessory companies by one or other of the methods above indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The American Tobacco Company, so far as its domestic tobacco business is concerned, is to be divided into four companies, no one of which will have a controlling influence in the tobacco business. The four companies are the American Tobacco Company (the present company), Liggett <em>&amp; </em>Myers Tobacco Company (to be organized), the P. Lorillard Company (to be organized), and the It. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (an existing corporation). When the disintegration is accomplished the volume and value of the business in the several branches of tobacco manufacture will be divided between the four companies as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Percentage</p>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">in Volume</p>\n<p id=\"APH9\">(Lbs. or Thousands.)

The common stock of the new companies will lie sold for cash at par to tbo common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company, thus making what is in the nature of an assessment of 836.651.925 on the common stock of the American Tobacco Company. This suns will be used for the retirement and cancellation of existing bonds at par of the American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">Each 6 per cent, bondholder of (he American Tobacco Company will be offered 120 in cash for half his holdings, and for the other half <em>7 </em>per cent, bonds at par, in the aggregate, of the Liggett &amp; Myers and Lorillard Companies. Each 4 per cent, bondholder of the American Tobacco Company will be offered 96 for half Ms holdings, and for the other half 5 per cent, bonds at par, in the aggregate, of the Liggett &amp; Myers and Lorillard Companies. Each preferred stockholder of the American Tobacco Company will be offered the right, to exchange one-third of his holdings at par into <em>7 </em>per cent, preferred stock of the Liggett &amp; Myers and Lorillard Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">The effect of these changes, when made, will be to pay off the entire bonded debt of the American Tobacco Company, amounting to 8104,236,750, and to reduce its assets correspondingly. It will be left with 852,459,400 of preferred stock and 840,200.400 of common stock, as its only outstanding securities. The preferred stock will be given full voting rights, and the control the American Tobacco Company will thus pass from the 29 individual defendants to the holders of $92,701,800 preferred and common stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">Both the preferred stock of Liggett &amp; Myers and Lorillard Companies will also have full voting rights, and the 29 defendants will control neither of these companies. The same will be true of the R. ,1. Reynolds Tobacco Company. None of the four companies, the American Tobacco Company, Liggett &amp; Myers. Lorillard Company, and the Reynolds Company, will have any interest in or relation to the other, although at the outset they will of necessity have many stockholders in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">The American Snuff Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">The American Tobacco Company now holds nearly half of the shares of rhe- stock of the American Snuff Company. Such influence as this stock-holding gives to the American Tobacco Company will be terminated, and the Snuff Company itself will be disintegrated into three companies by the following method:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">There will be organized two new snuff companies, one to be called the George W. Helme Company, and the other IVeyjnan &amp; Bruton Company. The American Snuff Company will convey to these two companies, respectively, manufacturing assets consisting of factories and brands, so that the resulting division of the snuff business will be in volume as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-19\">American Snuff Co................................. 32.05 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-20\">George W.

It will thereupon distribute to its common stockholders as a dividend the common stock of both the new companies, aggregating $8,000,000, charging it to surplus account. It will offer to its preferred stockholders proportionately these 7 per cent, preferred stocks of the new companies in exchange for the preferred stock of the American Snuff Company at par. So much of the preferred stock of the American Snuff Company as is thus exchanged will be retired. So much of the preferred stocks of the new companies as are not exchanged will be disposed of 'by the American Snuff Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">llhe American Tobacco Company, being a holder of the common stock of the American Snuff Company, will xiartieipate in the distribution above provided, and will in turn distribute the common ^stocks of the Helme Company and the AAreyman &amp; Bruton Company, together with its present holdings of American Snuff common and preferred stock to its common stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">The result of this disintegration of the Snuff Company will be that there will be three companies engaged in the production of snuff, none of which will have any dominating position in the snuff trade, and none of which will have any interest in or relation to the other. Such control as the American Tobacco Company has over the Snuff Company will pass away from it, &gt; and also from the 29 individual defendants..</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The Conley Foil Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The American Tobacco Company owns more than half of the stock of the Conley Foil Company, engaged in the business of manufacturing tin foil used for the most part by tobacco manufacturers. The Conley Foil Company, whose plant is in New York, owns all the stocks and bonds of the Johnston Tin Foil &amp; Metal Company, which has a plant in St. Louis. The Conley Foil Company will distribute its holdings of the securities of the Johnston Tin Foil &amp; Metal Company, to wit, 3.000 shares of stock, all wf one class, and $100,000 of bonds, to its stockholders. The American Tobacco Company, being a stockholder of the Conley Foil Company, will participate in the distribution, and will in turn distribute its dividend, together with its stock in.the Conley Foil Company, to its common stockholders. The result will be that the control of the American Tobacco Company over the tin foil business will terminate, and there will be two tin foil companies in which the American Tobacco Company has no interest, and which will have no interest in oi\" relation with each other. The control of these companies will not be in the 29 individual defendants, but in the hands of present individual stockholders of the Conley Foil Company, and common stockholders of American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">The Licorice Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">The American Tobacco Company owns a majority of the capital stock of the MaeAndrews &amp; Forbes Company, a corporation engaged in manufacturing licorice paste, which is an essential ingredient in x&gt;lug tobacco. The Mac-Andrews &amp; Forbes Company has two plants, one at Camden, N. J., and the other at Baltimore, Md., and produces about 90 per cent, of all the licorice paste manufactured in the United States, but over 50 per cent, of its product consists of a single brand, known as the \u201cShip\u201d brand. The MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company will be divided into two companies in the manner following:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">There will be organized a company, to be known as the J. S. Young Company, and the MaeAndrews &amp; Forbes Company will convey to it the Baltimore factories and brands, taking in payment $1,000,000 7 per cent, preferred and $1,000,000 common stock of the Young Company. The annual output <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>of the Young Company will he $1,201,000. The MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company will have an annual output of' $2,514,000, of which $2,214,000 -will he in the \u201cShip'\u2019 brand. The common stock of the Young Company will be distributed as a dividend to the common stockholders of the MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The American Tobacco Company, as a stockholder of the MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company, will share in <em>the </em>distribution of the Young Company\u2019s common stock, and will in turn distribute it, together with the common stock which it now holds in the MacAndrews <em>&amp; </em>Forbes Company, to its common stockholders. The preferred stock of the Young Company will be offered in exchange for an equal amount of the preferred stock of MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Company \u2014 any of the latter thus exchanged to be retired, and any of the preferred stock of the Young Company not thus taken up by exchange to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The result will be two licorice companies, having no interest in or relation to each other, and the American Tobacco Company will have no interest in either of them. The control which the American Tobacco Company now has over these companies will pass to the individual stockholders of the Mac-Andrews &amp; Forbes Company and the common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company, hut will no longer be held by the 29 individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Cigar Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The American Cigar Company is not a dominant factor in the cigar trade of the United States, for it represents not more than 15 per cent, of the cigar business. Hut, nevertheless, it is to be disintegrated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">It will part with its interest in the American Stogie Company, and the American Stogie Company itself will be dissolved. It will sell to the American Tobacco Company for cash all its interest in the Porto Rican-American Tobacco Company, and the American Tobacco Company will distribute the stock so acquired, together<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with its own stock in the Porto Rican-American Tobacco Company, to its common stockholders. The American Cigar Company will also sell a substantial part of its domestic business, carried on under the name of the Federal Cigar Company, to the American Tobacco Company for cash. The American Tobacco Company in turn will sell this business to the P. Lorillard Company for securities, being a part of, the consideration paid by the Lorillard Company for the property conveyed to it by the American Tobacco Company, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The result of the disintegration will be that the Porto Rican-American Tobacco Company will be completely divorced from the control of the American Tobacco Company and the American Cigar Company, neither of which will have any interest in it. It will not be controlled by the 29 individual defendants. and a large part of the business of the American Cigar Company will pass to the P. Lorillard Company, which will have no interest in or relation to the American Cigar Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The Foreign Companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland, the American Tobacco Company, and the American Cigar Company, one of its accessory companies, and <em>the </em>British-American Tobacco Company, Limited, are now hound together by contracts, which forbid the Imperial \u2019Tobacco Company from doing business in the United \u00a1-states. except buying leaf tobacco, the, American Tobacco Company and the American Cigar Company ^ from competing with tlie Imperial Company in Kngland, and both the Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company from competing with the British-American Tobacco Company in foreign countries. These contracts will be terminated, leaving each company free to hereafter compete in the territory of the other. The shares of the British-American Company, amounting to two-thirds of the ordinary shares, now held by the American Tobacco Company, will be distributed to its common stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">The result will be that the control of the American Tobacco Company over the British-American Tobacco Company will cease, and these companies will hereafter have no interest in or relation to each other. As the Imperial Tobacco Company now owns one-third of the ordinary shares of the British-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>American Company, the control of the British-American- Company will pass to the Imperial Company, and to the common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company, but not to the 29 individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The United Cigar Stores Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The American Tobacco Company now owns two-thirds of the stock of the United Cigar Stores Company. It is proposed to distribute these shares to the common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The result will be that, the American Tobacco Company will have no further control over the United Cigar Stores Company, nor will these two companies have any interest in each other. The control of the United Cigar Stores Company will pass to its present individual stockholders and the common stockholders of the American Tobacco Company, but, in view of the fact that one-third of its stock is held by persons not connected with the American Tobacco Company, it will not be in the hands of the 29 individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The petition itself summarizes the results of the disintegration as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u201cThe tin foil business now done and controlled by the Conley Foil Company will be divided into two companies having no interest whatsoever the one in the other, and neither in a dominant position with respect to the tin foil business. The licorice business now done and controlled by MacAndrews <em>&amp; </em>Forbes Company will be divided into two companies, with no interest in nor connection with each other, and neither in a dominant position in the licorice business. American Stogie Company will be dissolved, and its business disintegrated. The business of American Cigar Company will be disintegrated, and it will have no dominant position in any branch of the cigar business. The snuff business now done and controlled by American Snuff Company will be divided into three companies, American Snuff Company itself and two other companies to be organized, and none of the three will have any interest in nor connection with either of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u201cThe American Tobacco Company, through distribution out of its surplus, will have denuded itself of any interest in, or control over, the tin foil business, the licorice business, and the snuff business. It will have stripped itself of any interest in or control over R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a company manufacturing, and selling tobacco in the Southern states.

Lorillard Company.\u201d and the American Tobacco Company will sell, assign, and convey to these two companies factories, plants, brands, and businesses, and capital stocks of tobacco manufacturing corporations, as* shown in Exhibit A hereto attached; each of these conveyances to include proper and adequate storage houses, leaf tobacco, and other materials and supplies, provision for book accounts, including in each case a ratable proportion of the cash held by the American Tobacco Company on December 31, 1910, so that each of the new corporations will be fully equipped for the conduct of the business of manufacturing and dealing in tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">(2) Resources and Capitalization of Companies and Provisions for Exchanging and Retiring Securities of American Tobacco Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The American Tobacco Company has securities issued and outstanding as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\"><em>6% </em>bonds............... $52,882,650</p>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">4% bonds (including outstanding 4% bonds of Consolidated Tobacco Company)............................................... 51,354,100</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">6% preferred stock.............................................. 78,689,100</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Common stock...................................'............... 40,242,400</p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">The American Tobacco Company, in October, 1904, immediately after' the merger, had an outstanding issue of its own 4 per cent, bonds and the Consolidated Tobacco Company 4 per cent, bonds which it assumed, amounting to $78.689.100, but it has purchased on the market and retired $27,335,000 at par of these <em>4 </em>per cent, bonds, charging the amount thus expended to surtilus. The 6 per cent, bonds and 4 per cent, bonds aforesaid are what ar\u00ab ordinarily known as \u201cdebenture bonds,\u201d and are issued under a trust indenture which imposes a general charge on the property, income, and earnings of the company in favor, first, of the 6 per cent, bonds, and, second, of the <em>4 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ppr cent, bonds. The' American Tobacco Company, after the reduction of the surplus through the acquisition by it of 4 per cent, bonds as aforesaid, had oh December 31, 1910, a surplus of $61,119,991.63, which will be increased by the surplus earnings of the current year. The distribution of securities herein provided for to be forthwith made would diminish the said surplus by $35,-011,865.03, the book value of securities to be so distributed. This book value is less than actual value; but, in view of the fact that none of the assets of-the American Tobacco Company are overvalued, the advance of the book value of the securities to be distributed as hereinbefore set forth to their actual value would operate at the same time to increase the surplus of the company, and so its surplus, after such distribution, would remain just the same as though the advance to actual value had not been made on the books of the company.'</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The properties to be conveyed to the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and P. Lorillard Company, based upon conditions as of December 31, 1910, the last completed year, including in such conveyances the proper and proportionate .storage houses, leaf tobacco, supplies and materials, and cash, but without anything for value of brands, trade-marks, formulas, recipes, and good will, are of the value of $30,607,261.96 to Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company, and $28,091,748.86 to P. Lorillard Company. So far as these conditions shall be changed before the day of the conveyance, any deficiency is to be made good in cash, so that these two companies will have said amounts in tangible assets, useful, and such as have been used, in the manufacture of the brands to be conveyed to them, respectively, and cash. The American Tobacco Company will be\u2018left with tangible assets, employed in manufacturing tobacco and its products, cash, and bills and accounts receivable, of the value of $53,408,-498.94 as of December 31, 1910. The profits earned during the year 1910 on the brands and businesses to be conveyed by the Ajneriean Tobacco Company to Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company amounted to $7,468,172.02, and the profits on the brands and businesses to be conveyed by the American Tobacco Company to P. Lorillard Company amounted to $5,264,729.38.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It is proposed that the value of the brands, trade-marks, recipes, formulae and good will to be sold to each of these companies, be determined by their earning capacity, based upon the results for the year 1910, so that each shall have an earning capacity of 11.02 per cent, per annum upon its total property, including both tangible property and.-brand value and good will. Upon this basis the consideration to be paid by the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company will be $30,607,261.96, value of tangible assets as above stated, and $36,840,-237.04, value of brands, trade-marks, recipes, formulae and good will, making a total of $67,447,499; and the consideration to be paid by the P. Lorillard Company will be $28,091,74S.86, value of tangible assets as above stated, and $19,460,752.14, value of brands, trade-marks, recipes, formula; and good will, making a total of $47,552,501. The brands, trade-marks, recipes, formulae and good will of the American Tobacco Company, on December 31, \u00cd910, were of the book value of $101,324,964.07. The payments for brand value, etc., to the American Tobacco Company to be made by Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and P. Lorillard Company as aforesaid, makes an aggregate of $56,300,989.18, and would thus leave the book value of brands, trade-marks, recipes, formula; and good will retained by the American Tobacco Company at $45,023,-974.89, which added to the $53,408,498.94 of tangible manufacturing assets to be retained by the American Tobacco Company, -will make the total book value of manufacturing property to be retained by that company $98,432,-473.83, upon which its earnings, based upon the results for the year 1910, would be $11,369,809.82, o-r 11.55 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and the P.

Pending such, the said 7 per cent, bonds, 5 per cent, bonds, and 7 per cent, preferred stocks of the Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and the P.

Such deposit will be made, not to secure, nor create a trust fund for, the bonds, but for the purpose of sequestrating and taking from the control of the American Tobacco Company the securities and cash so deposited. During the time of such deposit the securities shall be in the name of, as well as in the custody ol', said Trust Company, with any voting rights attaching thereto, but the American Tobacco Company shall receive from the Trust Company all dividends and interest collected by it on account of such securities; and the American Tobacco Company shall have the right at any time and .from time to time to sell, at such price as it may determine, and direct the delivery of any of such securities (except the securities of Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company and P.

Certain Incidental Provisions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">P. Lorillard Company is a New Jersey Company, with $3,000,000 of common-stock, all of which is owned by the American Tobacco Company, and $2,000,-000 of 8 per cent, preferred stock. Of this preferred stock the American Tobacco Company holds $1,596,100 at par, and there is held by others $403,900-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>at par. Under the laws of New Jersey the present P. Lorillard Company may be dissolved by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding stock, and upon such dissolution the preferred stock is entitled to be paid at par; the balance of the assets going to the common stock. In view of the fact, however, that the preferred stock of the present P. Lorillard Company is an 8 per cent, preferred stock, with abundant assets and earnings to make the principal and income secure, it is deemed fair to the holders of this outstanding $403,900 of preferred stock that they be given an opportunity to take, at their option, either cash at par, which they are legally entitled to, or the 7 per cent, preferred stock of the proposed new P. Lorillard Company. As the preferred stock of the new P. Lorillard Company is to be a 7 per cent, preferred stock, the holders of said $403,900 of said present preferred stock will be offered stock of the new company at the rate of $114.25 for each share. It is therefore proposed that the now 1*. Lorillard Company provide for an additional amount of preferred stock sufficient to lake care of $403,900 preferred stock on that basis, to wit, $114.25 in new 7 per cent, preferred stock for each $100 of said stock, amounting to $401,600 at par of preferred stock, in addition to that set out hereinbefore. In view of the fact that in the statements hereinbefore made as to earnings of the P. Lorillard Company there is included only such part of <em>the earnings of the </em>present P. Lorillard Company as accrued to the proportion of its stock held by the American Tobacco Company, this increase of preferred stock would increase proportionately the profits of the P. Lorillard Company, and does not derange any of the figures hereinbefore given, or given in any of the exhibits hereto and hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">American Snuff Company manufactures and sells a brand of snuff called \u201cGarrett,\u201d which has a large sale in the Southern and Southwestern sections of the country. Originally this brand was manufactured at Yorklyn, Del., and in part packed in Philadelphia. Several years ago American Snuff Company determined, oil account of freight rate conditions, to manufacture this brand at Clarksville, Tenn., and to pack it at Memphis, Tenn., and that the factories at Yorklyn, Del., should be given up to the manufacture of other brands. It has yet, though, been unable to produce in Clarksville, Tenn., goods similar to the goods heretofore and now made by it at Yorklyn, Del., although the experiment is still in progress, and with hope of success. Under the plan hereinbefore outlined, the brand \u201cGarrett\u201d smiff is allotted to American Snuff Company, and the factories other than one <em>factory at </em>Yorklyn, Del., are allotted to George W. Holme Company. Your petitioners pray that, in the approval and adoption by this court of this plan, American Snuff Company and George W. Helme Company be permitted to manufacture brands the one for the other, for a period not exceeding one year from March 1, 1912, each company paying\u2019 to the other, as consideration for such manufacture, the cost thereof plus 5 per cent. The necessity of paying <em>5 </em>per cent, above cost is suifieient inducement to each company to manufacture its own goods as soon as American \u00a1Snuff Company is able to manufacture \u201cGarrett\u201d snuff of the requisite character and kind in its Clarksville factory, thus leaving the Xorklyn factories, other than No. 5, for the manufacture by the George W. Helme Company of its own brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">III. Exhibits Showing Results.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Tlie foregoing plan and method, based upon the allotment of brands and businesses herein provided and shown in Exhibit A hereto, and the volume and value of the business on these brands for the year 1910, will divide the tobacco business of the United States in all its branches, as shown by Exhibit R hereto attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The American Tobacco Company, Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company, P. Lorillard Company, and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will have property, as of December 31, 1910, and based upon the business for the year 1910, will have an annual net selling value of products, and net profits all as shown on Exhibit C hereto attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The distribution of factories and principal brands among the three companies will be \u00e1s shown on Exhibit D hereto attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The distribution of purchases of different types of tobacco based upon the business of each company for the year 1910, with the estimated average aggregate of the entire production of these types, is shown on Exhibit E hereto attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The relative ownership of voting stocks held by the 29 individual defendants in the aggregate, and held by those not defendants nor in any way connected with the defendants, is as shown on Exhibit F hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">IV. Results of Adoption of Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Tour petitioners show unto the court that upon the adoption and execution of this plan the combination heretofore adjudged to exist will have been effectually dissolved, and out of the elements heretofore composing the same a new condition, which will be honestly in harmony with and not repugnant to the law, will have been brought about as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The tin foil business now done and controlled by the Conley Foil Company will be divided into two companies having no interest whatsoever the one in the other, and neither in a dominant position with respect to the tin foil business.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The licorice business now done and controlled by MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Cbmpany will be divided into two companies, with no interest in or connection with each other, and neither in a dominant position in the licorice business.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">American Stogie Company will be dissolved, and its business disintegrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The business of American Cigar Company will be disintegrated, and it will have no ddminant position in any branch of the cigar business.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The snuff business now done and controlled by American Snuff Company will be divided into three companies. American Snuff Company itself and two other companies to be organized, and none of the three will have any interest in or connection with either of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">The American Tobacco Company, through distribution out of its surplus, will have denuded itself of any interest in, or control over, the tin foil business, tjie licorice business, and the snuff business.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">It will have stripped itself of any interest in or control over R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a company manufacturing and selling tobacco in the Southern states.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">It will have completely severed all relations with the Porto Rlcan-Ameriean Tobacco Company, manufacturing and selling cigarettes and cigars in Porta Rico, and selling in the United States cigars manufactured in Porto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">It will have divested itself of all interest in or association with British-American Tobacco Company, Limited, and the Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland), Limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">It will have parted with all.its interest in United Cigar Stores Company, a company engaged in the retail distribution of cigars and tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">The American Tobacco Company itself, as an operating company, will be broken into three companies, each completely equipped for the conduct of-a large tobacco business, neither of which will own any interest in any other, and neither of which will be dominant in the tobacco trade, whether reference be had to proportion of sales in any branch of the business, or regard be had to dominating ownership of popular and valuable brands, or regard be had to purchase of any t5rpe of leaf tobacco, or regard be had to any other measure of importance in the tobacco trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">All covenants that prevent the American Tobacco Company from extending its business abroad, or British-American Tobacco Company, Limited, or the Imperial Tobacco Company (of Great Britain and Ireland), Limited, from extending their business in the United States, will be terminated, and each will be free to engage in business throughout the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">All covenants not to engage in the tobacco business made by vendors or others will be terminated, leaving all free to engage in any branch of the tobacco business.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">. Thus the business in tobacco and related products heretofore controlled by the American Tobacco Company, or by companies in which it- owns a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>trolling or largo interest, will not only 1)0 completely divorced from such control, but will be distributed among 14 separate and. independent companies, none of which will have any control over or interest in any other, and nono of which will have any preponderating- influence in any branch of the business, either as a manufacturing company, a selling company, or as a purehas-' er of any type of leaf tobacco.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Finally, no small group of men, nor even the twenty-nine individual defendants in the aggregate, will own the control of any of the principal, accessory, or subsidiary companies defendant, and the control of the American. Tobacco Company itself and of the new companies to be formed will be vested in a body of more than 6,000 stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">That the difficulties and possible delays In securing the amendments of charters, formation of new companies, issuance of new securities, preparation of bonds and trust indentures, conveyances, deliveries, and adjustments of factory condii ions, with the details incident to complete compliance with the internal revenue laws, are such that the necessities of the situation, in the judgment of your petitioners, require an extension of the period for the full accomplishment of the purposes contemplated and provided for by the mandate of the Supreme Court of the United States, and for the putting into operation the plan hereby proposed, and that such, extension be for the full period permitted by the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States, to wit. 60 days from the expiration of 6 months from receipt of the mandate from the Supreme Court of the United States, or until March 1, 1912.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Wherefore your petitioners pray:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">1. That this court accept and approve the plan and method set forth in \u25a0section III of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">2. That this court extend until March 1, 1912, the time within which your petitioners shall carry out said plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">3. That, should unforeseen difficulties arise in the execution of said plan, your petitioners have leave to apply to the court for such modification of the plan or other relief as may be necessary, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\"><em>4. </em>That all persons he enjoined from in any way interfering with the carrying out of said plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">5.

Certain Incidental Provisions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">P. Lorillard Company is a New Jersey company, with $3,000,000 of common stock, all of which is owned by the American Tobacco Company, and $2,000,000 of 8 per cent, preferred stock. Of this preferred stock the American Tobacco Company holds $1,390,100 at par, and there is held by others $403,900 at par. Tinder the laws of New Jersey the present P. Lorillard Company may be dissolved by the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding stock, and upon such dissolution the preferred stock is entitled io be paid at par: the balance of the assets going to the common stock. In view of the fact, however, that the preferred stock of the present P. Lorillard Company is an 8 per cent, preferred stock, with abundant assets and earnings to make the principal and Income secure, it is deemed fair to the holders of this outstanding $403,900 of preferred stock that they he given an opportunity to take, at their option, either cash at par, which they are legally entitled to, pr the 7 per cent, preferred stock of the proposed new P. Lorillard Company. As the preferred stock of the now <em>V. </em>Lorillard Company is to be a 7 per cent, preferred stock, the holders of said $403,900 of said present preferred stock will he offered stock of the new company at the rate of $114.25 for each share. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>It is therefore proposed that the new ,P. Lorillard Company provide for an additional amount of preferred stock sufficient to take care of $403,900 prfeferred stock on that basis, to wit, $114.25 in new 7 per cent, preferred stock for each $100 of said stock, amounting to $461,600 at par of preferred stock, in addition to that set out hereinbefore.. In view of the fact that in the \u2022statements hereinbefore made as to earnings of the P. Lorillard Company there is included only such part of the earnings of the present P. Lorillard Company as accrued to the proportion of its stock held by the American Tobacco Company, this increase of preferred stock would increase proportionately the profits of the P. Lorillard Company, and does not derange any of the figures hereinbefore given, or given in any of the exhibits hereto and hereinafter referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">American Snuff Company manufactures and sells a brand of snuff called \u201cGarrett,\u201d which has a large sale in the Southern and Southwestern sections of the country. Originally this brand was manufactured at Yorklyn, Del., and in part packed in Philadelphia. Several years ago American Snuff Company determined, on account of freight rate conditions, to manufacture this brand at Clarksville, Tenn., and to pack it at Memphis, Tenn., and that the factories at Yorklyn, Del., should be given up to the manufacture of other brands. It has yet, though, been unable to produce in Clarksville, Tenn., goods similar to the goods heretofore and now made by it at Yorklyn, Del., although the experiment is still in progress, and with hope of success. Under the plan hereinbefore outlined, the brand \u201cGarrett\u201d snuff is allotted to American Snuff Company, and the factories, other than one factory at Yorklyn, Del., are allotted to George AY. Helme Company. Your petitioners pray that in the approval and adoption by this court of this plan, American Snuff Company and George AY. Helme Company be permitted to manufacture brands the one for the other, for a period not exceeding one year from March 1, 1912, each company paying to the other, as consideration for such manufacture, the cost thereof plus 5 per cent. The necessity of paying 5 per cent, above cost is sufficient inducement to each company .to manufacture its own goods as soon as American Snuff Company is able to manufacture \u201cGarrett\u201d snuff of the requisite character and kind in its Clarksville factory, thus leaving the Yorklyn factories, other than No. 5, for the manufacture by the George AY. Helme Company of its own brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">This court, having heard the parties as directed by the Supreme Court of the United States, it is further ascertained and determined, and</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Ordered, adjudged, and decreed that said plan hereinabove set forth is a plan or method which, taken with the injunctive provisions hereinafter set forth, will dissolve the combination heretofore adjudged to be illegal in this cause, and will recreate out of the elements now composing it a new condition which will be honestly in harmony with, and' not repugnant to, the law, and without unnecessary injury to the public or the rights of private property.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the said plan as hereinabove set forth be, and it is hereby, approved by this court, and the defendants herein are respectively directed to proceed forthwith to carry the same into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The necessities of the situation in the judgment of this court requiring the extension of the period for carrying into execution said plan to a further time not to exceed 60 days from December 30, 1911,</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the defendants be allowed until February 28, 1912, to carry said plan into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the defendants, their officers, directors, servants, agents, and employ\u00e9s be, and they are hereby, severally enjoined and restrained as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">From continuing or carrying, into further effect the combination adjudged illegal in this cause, and from entering into or forming any like combination or conspiracy, the effect of which is or will be to restrain commerce in tobacco or its products, or in articles used in connection with the manufacture and trade in tobacco and its products, among the states or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>lerritories or with foreign nations, or to prolong the unlawful monopoly of such commerce obtained and possessed by the defendants, as adjudged herein, in violation of the act of Congress approved ,Tuly 2, 1890, either:</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">1.
