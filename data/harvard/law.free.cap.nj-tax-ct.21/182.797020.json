(plaintiffs) for relief under the Freeze Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:51A-8, for tax years 2000 and 2001, based upon a judgment reported at 18 <em>N.J.Tax </em>540 (Tax 2000). On July 2, 2001, defendant municipality moved for a rehearing and reconsideration. Following study of the papers submitted on the motion and review of the oral arguments presented on August 17, 2001, Judge Kuskin denied the motion for reconsideration. He expressed his reasons for the ruling in a bench opinion on that date, amplified by a letter opinion dated October 9, 2001. In the oral opinion, Judge Kuskin stated that he did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alq-dedup-0\">not find sufficient statements, allegations or certified facts that would support ... reconsideration or rehearing under the standards set forth in the rules as explained in ... case[law]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>[Movant\u2019s] submission ... is very far from in any way establishing that the Court\u2019s rulings were arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable within the context of the use of that phraseology in the <em>D 'Atria </em>or <em>Cummings v. Barr </em>decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Judge Kuskin went on, however, to consider, reflectively and in substantial detail, in a \u201cvery painful review of the record\u201d whether \u201csome unfairness [to defendant] had inadvertently crept into these proceedings\u201d through a series of procedural events. He concluded that the trial court had bent every effort</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeT\">to insure that the defendant had been treated fairly and particularly had not been in any way misled by the Court[;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-8\">the record is such that [counsel for defendant] had fair warning of the Court\u2019s intentions to hear the Freeze Act motion on its merits ..., that no adjournment request was made after that position of the Court was made clear to him and, therefore, it was appropriate for the Court to proceed and decide the motion on its merits ...[;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">and, further, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">although the position of the plaintiff with respect to the statute was not asserted initiallyt,] it was asserted within time for [defendant\u2019s counsel] to have responded and reacted to that position before the return date of the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">Judge Kuskin then commented on the quality of the showings defendant had made in certifications in support of the motion for reconsideration and rehearing. He regarded those certifications, collectively, to be inadequate bases for granting defendant\u2019s application. In his prior opinion deciding the Freeze Act issue initially, Judge Kuskin, at 19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 513-15, had held defendant\u2019s showing to have been inadequate to defeat the Freeze Act application.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">The judge characterized the certification of defendant\u2019s appraiser on the reconsideration motion as inadmissible because it consisted of \u201cessentially a net opinion\u201d as to economic rent and therefore a net opinion as to valuation analysis. He viewed the certification as \u201cproviding] no information which was either available or could have been determined in response to the Freeze Act motion and submitted prior to the ... return date[,]\u201d noting that \u201c[t]he attitude of the Courts towards post-assessing date lease information has, generally speaking, been much stricter than the attitude with respect to post-assessing date sales information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Judge Kuskin also characterized as net opinion the first of two certifications of the defendant municipality\u2019s tax assessor submitted on the reconsideration motion: \u201cit does not in any way indicate that the added assessment was attributable to an addition as I have interpreted the phrase in my [earlier] opinion.\u201d The assessor\u2019s second certification \u201cbelatedly\u201d reflected a \u201crealization] that there had been something that might be characterized as an addition.\u201d The judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">It is apparent from the reading of the two certifications that this addition as described by [the assessor] was not the basis for the added assessment. There\u2019s no way of determining from what he has submitted that it is the addition which \u201cqualified for an added assessment or as an added assessment\u201d in the words of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Finally, the judge noted \u201cthat all the information provided by [the assessor] in his two certifications was available and could have been presented in\u201d a timely response by defendant to plaintiffs Freeze Act motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Notwithstanding the disposition of the reconsideration motion on the aforementioned grounds, Judge Kuskin went on to address, once again, the merits of the Freeze Act issues in the light of the certifications submitted. He opined that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">would have concluded that the defendant failed to establish either that a substantial and meaningful change in value had occurred because the only value information submitted by the defendant was a pure net opinion by [the appraiser], and I would have concluded that no addition qualifying as an added assessment occurred at the subject property during the year 2000 and, therefore would have ... granted the Freeze Act motion in the face of those certifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">He went on to reflect on the policy considerations behind the Freeze Act supporting his evaluation of the certifications defendant had submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Judge Kuskin concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">It is very tempting to the Court to provide relief to a litigant who in all candor comes before it and acknowledges that perhaps the responses could have been more complete initially and takes responsibility for what was and was not submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">On the other hand, there are two litigants before the Court and both are entitled to the same considerations of fairness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">... I have reviewed the record as carefully as I can and I find no basis on grounds of fairness or ... legal conclusions or the law to change the result____I see no basis for granting reconsideration or rehearing[.] ... [H]ad I granted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>motionU based on the submissions before me the result on the merits would be the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In his letter opinion amplifying the bench opinion, Judge Kuskin expressly dealt with and rejected defendant\u2019s contention that a statutory interpretation the judge had articulated in his earlier opinion on the merits should be applied prospectively only. That issue is not raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Even though Judge Kuskin\u2019s merits decision, as reflected in his opinion of May 29, 2001, reported at 19 <em>N.J.Tax </em>505, has not been the object of a timely notice of appeal and is thus, technically and formally, not before us, we have elected, as Judge Kuskin did on the motion for reconsideration and rehearing, to reflect on the merits issues as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">After reviewing the detail of the record in the light of the written and oral arguments advanced by the parties and pertinent legal standards, we agree substantially with the reasons for decision so carefully, completely and reflectively articulated by Judge Kuskin. We discern no misapplication of discretion in his reasons for denying defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and rehearing; and we have been given no adequate basis as the matter comes before us for differing with the trial court\u2019s interpretation and application of recent amendments to the Freeze Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Moreover, we discern no fatal procedural lapse not adequately justified by the judge\u2019s reasoning, which amounted to a deprivation of fundamental proof opportunities comprehended in the two-stage process of consideration established in caselaw. <em>See, e.g., AVR Realty Co. v. Cranford Twp. </em>(AVR II), 316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 720 A.2d 434 (App.Div.1998), <em>certif. denied, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>476, 734 A.2d 791 (1999). Defendant, in erroneously positing a three-stage process, contends that the primary error in this regard occurred when the trial court \u201ccollapsed the various standards in a fashion that subjected defendant to an improperly elevated hurdle just to be able to receive a plenary hearing.\u201d We discern no such error. We regard as sound, both procedurally and substantively, Judge Kuskin\u2019s evaluation that the material submitted by defendant in support of its position, initially and in its motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>reconsideration and rehearing, did not qualify as a <em>prima facie </em>showing, entitling defendant to a plenary hearing on the issues. We also discern no lapse of discretion in Judge Kuskin\u2019s denial, in the circumstances, of defendant\u2019s motion for discovery of a lease between plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In sum, in the light of the substantive and procedural standards articulated in <em>Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co. v. Township of West Deptford, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 801 A.2d 1199 (App.Div.2002); <em>AVR II, supra, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 407-08, 720 A.2d 434; and <em>AVR Realty Co. v. Cranford Twp. (AVR I), </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>294, 683 A.2d 235 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>460, 690 A.2d 608 (1997), we discern no deficiency in reasoning qualifying for corrective action by us concerning either the quality of the showings defendant made in support of the motion for reconsideration and rehearing, or its adequacy in tending to meet the burden assigned to defendant in response to plaintiffs Freeze Act application. <em>See Clearview Gardens Assoc. v. Parsippany-Troy Hills Twp., </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 330, 482 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
