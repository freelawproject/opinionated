The trial judge held that the husband had failed by a preponderance of the evidence to prove that the separation was mutually voluntary. We have examined the record and are of the opinion that the husband\u2019s evidence was not so clearly sufficient in support of his case that the trial judge\u2019s conclusions should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
