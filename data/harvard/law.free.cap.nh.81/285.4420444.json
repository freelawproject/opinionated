S., c. 176, s. 2, for if they are not such undertakings the statute provides that they may be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">It can serve no useful purpose to consider what constitutes such an undertaking, for in this jurisdiction the court holds that an agreement a married woman makes with a third person to enable her to obtain the means to aid her husband is not an undertaking by her for him or in his behalf. <em>Iona Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>69 N.
