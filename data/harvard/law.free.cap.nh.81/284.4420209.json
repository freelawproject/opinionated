The parties were in court, and the finding of the court indicated that justice required such an amendment. <em>Jellison </em>v. <em>Jellison, </em>70 N. H. 633; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 65. In fact the libelee does not deny the right of the court to permit the amendment. But his complaint is that he was not given a further hearing after the amendment was allowed. Whether this privilege should be granted to the libelee is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>of fact to be determined by the trial court. <em>LaCoss </em>v. <em>Lebanon, </em>78 N. H. 413, 417, and cases there cited. If justice requires that the libelee should have a further hearing, it should be granted to him upon application.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-4\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
