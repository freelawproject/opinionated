The question presented here is the ascertainment of the rights of the daughter, under the terms of the will, to the possession and disposition of the property sold and the extent to which such right follows the fund in the hands of the trustee. It was clearly the intention of the testatrix, upon all the competent evidence, that the life tenant should have the possession of the property devised during her life irrespective of the form in which it may be invested. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Ladd, </em>80 N. H. 44, and cases cited. In no other way could she have \u201cfull control and management\u201d thereof, and \u201cuse such portion or all of said property, if she shall deem it necessary for her comfort and support.\u201d The investment of the life tenant with the power of determining what shall be necessary for her comfort and support, her nomination as sole executrix without either the intervention of a trustee or the requirement of a bond to protect- those in remainder, if any, are facts confirming this conclusion. <em>Langley </em>v. <em>Farmington, </em>66 N. H. 431, 432; <em>Shapleigh </em>v. <em>Shapleigh, </em>69 N. H. 577, 581; <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Tilton, </em>70 N. H. 325, 326; <em>Clough </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>71 N. H. 412, 419; <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Society, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>77 N. H. 576, 579. It follows that it is the duty of the trustee to pay over to the life tenant the net proceeds of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
