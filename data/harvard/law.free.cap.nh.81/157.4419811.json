Process dependent upon service so made is subject to .abatement. <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Ela, </em>68 N. H. 312, 313; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>74 N. H. 505, 506, and cases there cited. The court has found that at the time of the service of the writ the defendant was returning within a reasonable time from attendance as a party and witness at the trial of the earlier suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">(2) The court has found that the defendant\u2019s attorney was not authorized to accept service.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">(3) \u2019 It follows, therefore, that this action is subject to abatement unless there has been a general appearance. A restricted appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>for the purpose of objecting to jurisdiction merely will not confer jurisdiction. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Boynton, 37 </em>N. H. 9, 19. But in that case the appearance must be made for the sole purpose of raising the question of jurisdiction. <em>March </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>40 N. H. 548, 583. \u201cAn objection to service or notice is waived when a party, by general appearance or otherwise, submits any other question, except the sufficiency of service or notice, to the court or other tribunal. He cannot take the chance of succeeding on any other objection to the case made against him, and at the same time reserve his exception to service or notice.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Stark, </em>47 N. H. 223, 225; <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>51 N. H. 61, 62; <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>60 N. H. 210, 211; <em>Patten </em>v. <em>Patten, 79 </em>N. H. 388, 389. It is conceded by defendant in argument that the filing _of_ his answer to J.he merits would have been a waiver of his plea, to the jurisdiction Hut-far the saving clause, but it is claimed that, inasmuch as a waiver is a voluntary act, such waiver cannot be found in the face of an\u2019express disclaimer. This position disregards the elementary principle that waiver, like any question of fact, is to be determined upon all the evidence and is not concluded by the declaration of the party. Any act which recognizes the jurisdiction has somejtendency to show that the actor intends to submit to it. The recital byjhe defendant that he did not intend to waive his plea does not modify the character of his acts in praying the consideration of tbe court in his plea in abatement and in his answer to the merits. He could not at the same time invoke the judgment of the court upon the merits of the case and deny its jurisdiction. Defendant\u2019s application for a commission to take depositions to be used in the triahof the issue was an unreserved invocation of the jurisdiction. It follows that the implied finding of the court that the defendant had waived his plea to the jurisdiction was based upon competent evidence. No error of law appears in its dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The defendant predicates his claim of error in the _denial_af the prayer of his plea in abatement upon authority of <em>Gamsby </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>52 N. H. 513, holding that the pendency of two suits for one cause at one time brought by one plaintiff against one defendant is a cause for abating the second suit without inquiry into the fact of actual vexatiousness and oppression. The decision in that case, in so far as it holds that the second suit is necessarily in all cases vexatious as a matter of law, is overruled, in <em>Tinkham </em>v. <em>Railroad, 77 N. </em>H. <em>111, 112, </em>to the extent that the second suit is not to bo dismissed as vexatious when justice requires otherwise. This con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>elusion is re-affirmed in <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>80 N. H. 27, 32. Therefore the question here presented is whether it conclusively appears from the facts reported that justice required that the present suit be dismissed as vexatious.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The present suit is brought, to recover rent. Upon defendant\u2019s motion in the first suit, the count for rent had been disposed of by a directed verdict in his favor for the reason that the suit as respects that count had been prematurely brought. Plaintiff\u2019s exception thereto, subsequently withdrawn, then remained the only impediment to an entry of judgment for the defendant which, otherwise, would follow as a matter of course upon judgment day. It is apparent, therefore, that it could be found that the present suit, brought after the withdrawal of plaintiff\u2019s exception, did not subject the defendant to a multiplicity of suits, and that, therefore, it was not vexatious or oppressive. It cannot be said as a matter of law that justice required a dismissal of the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Defendant\u2019s exception to the court\u2019s finding that the waiver of plaintiff\u2019s exception in the first suit preceded the bringing of the second, raises no question of law. The superior court takes judicial notice of any action taken in court by counsel in cases there pending, and may rely upon the statements of counsel in respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
