H. 400, that a piano if kept for use in a family was an article of \u201chousehold goods\u201d within the meaning of the above statute, and therefore was excepted from its operation. In this case a verdict was found by the court for the plaintiffs. This necessarily included a finding that the phonograph was kept for use in Swanson\u2019s family, which under the above decision would give it the character of \u201chousehold goods.\u201d <em>McGinley </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 N. H. 320; <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Association, </em>72 N. H. 525, 527; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Exchange, </em>72 N. H. 315, 319; <em>McConnell v. McConnell, </em>75 N. H. 385, 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The sole question consequently is, can that fact be found from the agreed facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In the statement of those facts it is said that Swanson at the time he bought the instrument was keeping house with his wife in Dover, and-the phonograph was delivered to his house and after-wards kept there. The only inference that can reasonably be drawn from that statement is that the phonograph was kept for use in Swanson\u2019s family. The finding of the court in that respect was fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In the agreement between the plaintiffs and Swanson this clause appears: \u201cVendee admits that this property is not part of the vendee\u2019s necessary household goods.\u201d Because of that admission in the contract, the defendant contends that this determined as to the plaintiffs and the defendant that the phonograph was not a part of the vendee\u2019s household goods, and therefore not within the exception contained in the statute, and consequently as the contract was not recorded, the defendant, who was a purchaser without notice of any lien, had acquired a title that was good against the plaintiffs. This admission cannot affect the plaintiffs\u2019 lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">The words of the statute, which makes the lease without being recorded good against third parties, are \u201chousehold goods.\u201d It is quite probable that it could not be found that a phonograph was a part of the necessary household goods of the vendee. But that does not furnish an adequate reason why it cannot be found upon the facts and under the decision of this court, that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>strument was kept for use in the vendee\u2019s family, and was a part of his household goods. In other words, the statute under consideration has no application to the vendee\u2019s admission that the phonograph was not a part of his necessary household goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">A decision made in accordance with the demand of the defendant would constitute the admission of the vendee that the instrument was not a part of his necessary household goods, a waiver by the plaintiffs of the benefit of the exception granted them by the statute in question. It is apparent that the admission clause was not intended to be a waiver of any right of the plaintiffs or vendors, but was -designed to affect some right of the vendee, otherwise it would not have been written \u201cthe vendee admits,\u201d etc., but would have been an admission by the vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">There are provisions in the contract that payment for the phonograph may be enforced by suit and judgment. And it is evident that this admission clause was placed in the lease so that in case the plaintiffs desired to bring suit and attach the phonograph, the vendee could not claim it was exempt from attachment as a part of his necessary household goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">. <em>Exception overruled.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b150-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
