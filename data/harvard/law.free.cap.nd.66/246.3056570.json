It is evident the cutting and threshing were all one process because of the machine used. AA7hile so working the plaintiff was injured and now seeks to recover compensation from the workmen\u2019s compensation fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">This matter is before us on demurrer to the complaint and requires the construction of the term \u201chazardous employment\u201d as defined in 369a2 of the Supplement, wherein those \u201cemployed in agriculture\u201d are excepted from the hazardous employments governed by the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The trial court overruled the demurrer and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It is admitted that if plaintiff was injured while \u201cemployed in agriculture,\u201d as contemplated by the workmen\u2019s compensation act, he has no claim against the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation act, chapter 162 of the Laws of 1919 and amendments thereof, (\u00a7 396al et seq. of Supp.), is to provide sure and certain relief, regardless of questions of fault, for all workmen injured in hazardous employments, etc. (\u00a7 1 of the act). For the purpose of this act, however, one employed in \u201cagriculture\u201d is not considered as being employed in such \u201chazardous employment\u201d as is defined by the act.'</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The term \u201cagriculture\u201d is defined by Webster as \u201cThe art or science of cultivating the ground and raising and harvesting crops,- \u2014 -tillage; husbandry; farming; in a broader sense the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man including to a variable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>extent the preparation of these products for man\u2019s use and their disjDOsal by marketing or otherwise.\u201d See also similar definitions in Century and Standard Dictionaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In Dillard v. Webb, 55 Ala. 468, 474, the court said the term \u201cagriculture\u201d included the \u201craising and harvesting of crops\u201d and \u201crefers tq the field, or farm, with all its wants, appointments, and products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">One may be employed in agriculture and yet not be a \u201cfarmer\u201d in the ordinary sense of the term, nor even a \u201cfarm laborer\u201d as the term is used in our lien laws. They are not synonymous terms. The term \u201cagriculture\u201d is broader than either of the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The expression \u201cemployed in agriculture\u201d refers to the type of work that is done rather than to the form of the contract for the work. As shown in State ex rel. Bykle v. District Ct. 140 Minn. 398, 168 N. W. 130, L.R.A.1918F, 198, \u201cThe important question is: What is the nature of the work ? The work is done upon a farm. It is done upon farm crops. . . . Threshing is as necessary in order that the farmer may consume or market the crop as is sowing or harvest.\u201d Hence the Minnesota Court holds that \u201cAn employee of one who owns a steam thresher and threshes grain for farmers under contract, is, while employed about the threshing machine in the course of threshing grain upon a farm, a \u2018farm laborer\u2019 . . .\u201d In any event, it must be clear the employee in that case was employed in agriculture. If a farmer threshes his own grain and employs men for that purpose, these men are employed in agriculture. They are engaged in harvesting crops. The crops are not fully harvested until they are ready for the farmer\u2019s market. The fact the farmer may thresh for a neighbor or engage in what is called \u201ccommercial threshing\u201d does not alter the work his employees are doing. They are harvesting crops even if doing it under special contract. Hence that the thresher in that case was what is known as a \u201ccommercial thresher,\u201d or one doing the threshing under an independent contract is immaterial \u2014 all are employed in the business, profession, or pursuit known as agriculture, \u2014 and the policy of the law is to exclude such from the benefits of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Section 1 of the workmen\u2019s compensation act clearly intends to furnish relief for all workmen engaged in hazardous employments, and were it not for the exemption, those employed in agriculture would bo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>covered. The exception is to be construed strictly; but even with this in mind, it must be clear that the man who plows a field and sows a crop is engaged in agriculture whether he does it for himself, or as an employee of the owner, or on an independent contract. See Sylcord v. Horn, 179 Iowa, 936, 162 N. W. 249, 253, 7 A.L.R. 1285, 16 N. C. C. A. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Hill v. Georgia Casualty Co. \u2014 Tex. \u2014, 45 S. W. (2d) 566, goes so far as to hold that a nursery laborer is a laborer engaged in agriculture, as \u201cone engaged in the nursery business is engaged in an agricultural pursuit . .</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Our construction is well sustained by authority. The workmen\u2019s compensation act of Idaho excepts \u201cagricultural pursuits\u201d from the provisions of its law and in Cook v. Massey, 38 Idaho, 264, 220 P. 1088, 35 A.L.R. 200, it is held that the operation of a commercial threshing-machine outfit for the purpose of threshing grain is an agricultural pursuit. The decision is exhaustive and well considered. See also Sylcord v. Horn, supra, where an employee of the owner of a corn shredder who contracted with a fanner to do such work was held to be a farm laborer engaged in agricultural woi-lc, even though his employer was an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The plaintiff relies upon such decisions as: Industrial Commission v. Shadowen, 68 Colo. 69, 187 P. 926, 13 A.L.R. 952; Re Boyer, 65 Ind. App. 408, 117 N. E. 507; Dowery v. State, 84 Ind. App. 37, 149 N. E. 922; Roush v. Heffelbower, 225 Mich. 664, 196 N. W. 185, 35 .A.L.R. 196; White v. Loades, 178 App. Div. 236, 164 N. Y. S. 1023; Nace v. Industrial Commission, 217 Wis. 267, 258 N. W. 781. An examination of the statutes involved in these cases shows a much more limited range for the exception. The Wisconsin statute expressly excludes farm laborers; as do the Colorado, Indiana, and Michigan statutes. Almost invariably it is the \u201cfarm laborer\u201d who is excepted. But one may be employed in agriculture, and yet not be a \u201cfarm laborer\u201d though the Iowa decision already cited makes little, if any, distinction. \u201cEmployed in agriculture\u201d is the term used in our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In the Colorado case cited it is shown clearly that the Colorado law excepts \u201cfarm and ranch laborers\u201d only and the court distinguished the Iowa case (Sylcord v. Horn) by showing that in Iowa the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>covers those \u201cengaged in agricultural pursuits,\u201d a much broader term, and thus the court accounts for the difference in the decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In the Indiana case (65 Ind. App. 408, 117 N. E. 507) it is shown that the compensation act does not \u201capply to casual laborers, to farm or agricultural laborers, etc.\u201d It is true in that case it is held that a separator man on a commercial threshing outfit was not a \u201cfarm or agricultural laborer;\u201d but to so hold the court was required to state that \u201cWheat threshing is a business or industrial pursuit in and of itself, entirely separate and independent of farming.\u201d (117 N. E. pp. 507, 508). This statement carries its refutation within itself. But in Dowery v. State, 84 Ind. App. 37, 149 N. E. 922, the court says that \u201cSome statements in the reasoning of the court in that opinion are not in harmony with this opinion. Such statements are disapproved.\u201d However, it does not specify these \u201cstatements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The .Michigan case cited shows that it is not all employed in agriculture wdio are excepted but only \u201cfarm laborers\u201d and the term \u201cfarm laborer\u201d is ordinarily synonymous with the term \u201chired man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The New York case cited is to the same effect \u2014 the day laborer on a commercial threshing machine was in the employ of one not engaged in farming and was not a farm laborer. In addition, the New York law authorized compensation to one engaged in the \u201coperation of a vehicle,\u201d and as the claimant was employed in working and moving the machine from place to place and while so moving it was injured,, he could recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In the Wisconsin case cited the employer was a farmer engaged in shredding his neighbor\u2019s corn in exchange for the use of the neighbor\u2019s threshing machine and while shredding such corn his employee was injured. The court held that such employee Avas a farm laborer. In this case the Wisconsin court very pertinently states \u201cDecisions of other courts in compensation cases are ordinarily not helpful because of differences between the languages of the acts involved and our act.\u201d This observation is applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">It may be true that one employed on a farm may at times be subject to greater hazard than the stenographer in the office; but the legislature of this State has seen fit to exclude those employed in agriculture. That men employed by a farmer to drive his mules or thresh his grain may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>subjected to real hazard is an argument to be addressed to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">It is argued that if one engaged in commercial threshing can be said to be employed in agriculture, what about the miller who grinds the wheat, the elevator agent who ships it, or the carpenter who builds the granary? None of these is engaged in agriculture as herein defined. The term does not include what may be done with the products of the farm after they are gathered any more than it includes the butcher who slaughters the animals raised. The line is drawn strictly in accordance with the definition of the term \u201cemployed in agriculture;\u201d but within that range it must be given the ordinary and usual meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In view of the foregoing, the order overruling the demurrer is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b267-6\">Burice, Ch.
