Thereafter, Nichols was tried for violation of the Maryland lottery laws by Judge Keating and Judge Rasin in the same court, and on May 8, 1961, was convicted and sentenced to one year in the Maryland House of Correction, the sentence to run consecutively with the sentence imposed in the previously mentioned proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">On February 21, 1963, Nichols filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act from his conviction for violation of the lottery laws, alleging that: (1) the evidence used against him was seized illegally without a warrant; (2) his case was improperly conducted by his counsel, because he failed to prove that the State\u2019s evidence was illegally seized, and he did not cross-examine the State\u2019s witness; and (3) a part of the trial was conducted out of his presence. Following a hearing which lasted some four and one-half hours, petitioner\u2019s application for relief was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Nichols stated in his application that he was sentenced \u201cby the Honorable Judge Canton, by whom said case tried with Judge trial * * We suspect that he was alluding to Judge Carter of the Circuit Court for Queen Anne\u2019s County who presided at Nichols\u2019 hearing on his petition for post conviction relief ; however, if he was, he was wrong, because the record on appeal clearly indicates that Judge Keating and Judge Rasin conducted the lottery trial below.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Judge Carter noted in his memorandum that \u201cthe accused himself testified that he '\u00a3ave the officer permission to search [Nichols\u2019 dwelling] for the purpose of determining whether there was a gun in the premises.\u201d It was during that search that evidence of violation of the lottery laws was seized, and then at the trial introduced against petitioner, notwithstanding his objections. \u201cIt is my general understanding,\u201d Judge Carter continued, \u201cthat when permission for a search is given that if the searching authority in the course thereof discovers evidence of other illegal activity such evidence is considered to have been lawfully procured.\u201d We agree with Judge Carter\u2019s statement. See <em>Edwards v. </em>State, 196 Md. 233; <em>Harris v. United States, </em>331 U. S. 145; <em>Collins v. United States, </em>289 F. 2d 129 (C. A. 5th).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Judge Carter\u2019s memorandum shows that petitioner abandoned his second allegation at the hearing, and the only portions of Nichols\u2019 trial on the lottery charge which were conducted out of his presence were \u201ca research of the law by the Court in chambers and a discussion with counsel for both the State and the accused in chambers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AbA\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
