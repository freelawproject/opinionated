This is the second chapter in his application for such relief; see <em>Duckett v. Warden, </em>230 Md. 621, 185 A. 2d 712, for the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">His only contention is that perjured testimony was knowingly used by the State\u2019s Attorney at his original trial. Judge Gray, after a full hearing, found \u201cno sufficient showing of perjury at the original trial,\u201d and not a \u201cscintilla of evidence to show that the State\u2019s Attorney was a party to the presentation of perjured testimony, even had there been any.\u201d His findings were, we think, amply warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
