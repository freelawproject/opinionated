This appeal is from a decree in MTA\u2019s favor, ruling that said seat tax fee applied to streetcars as well as buses.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The questions raised, stated concisely, are: (1) did the Legislature intend, in enacting Section 13(a), <em>infra, </em>to impose a seat tax fee on streetcars; (2) is Section 13(a) a public local law in contravention of Article 11 A, Section 4 of the Maryland Constitution; and (3) does the title to Article 64B, <em>infra, </em>violate Article III, Section 29 of the Constitution ?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The facts are undisputed. The appellant is a public service-corporation engaged in operating a mass transportation system in the Baltimore metropolitan area. The operation involves the-use of both motor buses and streetcars. As a part of its system, the Company constructed tracks, and, for many years, operated streetcar lines along the streets of Baltimore City and Baltimore County. Prior to July 1, 1961, the Company operated its buses by the authority of permits issued by the Public Service-Commission, pursuant to the provisions of Code (1957), Article 56, Sections 181-190. The Company was required to present to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles those permits when making application for registration tags. Under Section 184, the Company was required to pay an annual fee of $4.00 per passenger seat of each motor vehicle. And the Company paid to Baltimore City, under Article 29, Section 26, of the Baltimore City Code (1950), an annual license fee of $5.00 for each regularly operated streetcar and trolley.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Under the provisions of Code (1962 Supp.), Article 64B,, Section 9(b), after January 1, 1962, all authority and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tory control which the Public Service Commission had or exercised over the Company was transferred to, and vested in, the MTA. Section 13(a) provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cEvery mass transit or transportation system * * * shall pay a seat tax fee to the Authority, the same to be used * * * in defraying its necessary administrative expenses. * * * such a seat tax fee shall be in lieu of any such fee heretofore levied, paid or payable, by such mass transportation system * * *. The * * * fee payable under this article <em>shall be at the rate of $4.00 per seat, per vehicle </em>used by mass transit or transportation company * * (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">MTA interpreted Section 13(a) as imposing the seat tax fee on the Company\u2019s streetcars, as well as its buses. The Company contested the right to collect the seat tax fee, in so far as it was sought to be imposed upon its streetcars. This suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Appellant first contends that the Legislature did not <em>intend </em>to impose a seat tax fee on its trolleys and streetcars, when Section 13(a) was enacted; hence, any construction thereof requiring the payment of such a fee would be contrary to the purpose and intention of the Act. The Company begins its argument by stating that it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that statutes should be construed to effectuate the intention of the Legislature, and, where there is doubt or ambiguity as to the meaning of a statutory enactment, its legislative history should be considered in determining such intention, which will (where doubt, or ambiguity, exists) prevail over the rules of grammatical construction. This principle of law is well established, and, we think, may be conceded. <em>Welsh v. Kuntz, </em>196 Md. 86, 75 A. 2d 343; <em>Tyrie v. Baltimore County, </em>215 Md. 135, 140, 137 A. 2d 156; <em>Frazier v. Warfield, </em>13 Md. 279; <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 48 A. 2d 754; <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 257, 170 A. 2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We, therefore, proceed to a consideration as to whether or not there is ambiguity in Section 13(a). Appellant cites seven cases, <em>City of Chicago v. Keogh, </em>125 N. E. 881 (Ill. 1919), <em>Harris </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>v. Johnson, </em>161 P. 1155 (Cal. 1916), <em>Monongahela Bridge Co. v. Pittsburgh &amp; B. P. Ry. Co., </em>8 A. 233 (Pa. 1887), <em>Condor v. Griffith, </em>111 N. E. 816 (Ind. 1916), <em>Georgia Power Company v. Clark, </em>25 S. E. 2d 91 (Ga. 1943), <em>Whitney v. City of Seattle, </em>242 P. 2d 178 (Wash. 1952), and <em>State, use of Stumpf v. Baltimore &amp; Belair E. Ry. Co., </em>133 Md. 411, 105 A. 532; an excerpt from one of the definitions of \u201cvehicle\u201d in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th Ed.); and 91 C.J.S., <em>Vehicle, </em>pp. 806-807, as authorities to sustain its claim that there is doubt as to whether the word \u201cvehicle\u201d as used in Section 13(a) includes its streetcars. We find it unnecessary to consider all of the cited cases in detail. Five of them concerned statutes regulating traffic; and different operating conditions between streetcars and other vehicles were held to justify the exclusion of the former from the definition of \u201cvehicle.\u201d The rationale of these five cases seems to reach no further than to sustain the proposition that in statutes and/or ordinances constituting rules of the road, which are obviously not applicable to fixed-rail vehicles, the definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d will not encompass streetcars. (In <em>Stumpf, supra, </em>the pertinent act explicitly exempted vehicles that ran only on rails.) As was stated by the Court in <em>Syck v. Duluth St. Ry. Co., 177 </em>N. W. 944 (Minn.) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cAppellant cites decisions of other states upon somewhat similar statutes wherein the word \u2018vehicle\u2019 has been held not to include street cars. [Citations.] But, either specifically or by the context, the statute in those states excludes street cars. Cases involving the law of the road for passing or meeting vehicles do not appear to us to bear upon the question in hand, for in the very nature of things such regulation cannot affect vehicles operated along fixed tracks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The other two cases, <em>Whitney </em>and <em>Pittsburgh </em>are, likewise, not in point. In <em>Whitney, </em>it was held that a railroad train was not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d within the meaning of a venue statute. The reference in that case to \u201cstreetcar\u201d was dictum based upon <em>Condor v. Griffith, supra, </em>which will be considered below. <em>Pittsburgh </em>dealt with whether \u201cstreetcars\u201d had to pay tolls under an act providing for the construction of a new bridge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>fixing toil rates for \u201cevery carriage, wagon, buggy, or other wheeled vehicle, of whatever description, and for every sleigh or sled, drawn by horse.\u201d The Court applied the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>to exclude streetcars from the definition of \u201cvehicle,\u201d but said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cA streetcar certainly is a wheeled vehicle in the general sense of that term. * * * To pass the railroad company\u2019s cars over this bridge their railroad track must be permanently laid upon it so as to connect with their tracks at either end. In other words, the bridge must form part or parcel of the route of the railway. The vehicles which are specified in the Act of 1871, \u2014\u2018carriages, wagons, buggies, sleighs, and sleds\u2019- \u2014 are all of that class which requires no such special appliance to promote their passage, and it is reasonable to suppose that the general phrase \u2018other wheeled vehicles, of whatever description,\u2019 used in immediate connection therewith, may refer to vehicles of the same general class or kind of those particularly specified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">This case, actually, seems to be authority for the proposition that normally streetcars should be included in the definition of \u201cvehicles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The <em>Condor v. Griffith </em>case, <em>supra, </em>is the common source of the statement quoted from <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>the citation from 91 C.J.S.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the dictum in <em>Whitney, supra, </em>men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tioned above. It, therefore, seems appropriate to examine this case closely. It was decided in 1916. There, liability for a collision required consideration of an ordinance that made it unlawful for vehicles to drive on the left side of the street \u201cexcept in the necessary act of crossing the same or passing a vehicle going in the same direction, * * <em>* but the provisions of this section shall not apply to street railways </em>[italics ours].\u201d During the course of its opinion, the Court made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cA vehicle is any carriage or conveyance used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on land. [It] will not ordinarily include locomotives, cars and street cars, which run and are operated only over and upon a permanent track or fixed way, and it will not be held to include them unless the context of the * * * statute clearly indicates an intention to do so.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">It seems proper to classify <em>Condor </em>as another rule-of-the-road case, and appropriate that the above quotations from <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>and 91 C.J.S., p. 807, be confined to automobile law. The distinction between the word \u201cvehicle\u201d as used in automobile law and the Federal statutory definition is pointed out in <em>Cyclopedic Law Dictionary </em>(3rd Ed.), wherein it defines \u201cvehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">VEHICLE. By general Federal statutory definition: every description of carriage or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on land. R.S. \u00a7 4; 1 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4 (Aircraft excluded. 44 Stat. 572; Title 49 U.S.C.A. (Supp. \u00a7 177)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201cIn automobile law, every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway except devices moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. (Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways, \u00a7 1.) 11 U. L. A. 8.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Finally, upon the matter under immediate consideration, appellant urges that the provisions of Code (1957), Article 66)4, Section 2(67), which define \u201cvehicles\u201d for the purposes of the Motor Vehicle Article of the Code and exclude streetcars and devices propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wire, but not operated upon rails or tracks, assist in creating a doubt as to the meaning of \u201cvehicles\u201d in Section 13(a). We do not find this argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">For general definitions of the word \u201cvehicle,\u201d see <em>Websters New International Dictionary, The American College Dictionary, Punk &amp; Wagnalls, New Standard Dictionary, </em>(1938), which definitions are sufficiently broad to include streetcars. Also compare 55 Am. Jur., <em>Urban Transportation </em>\u00a7 7, which states: \u201cThe term \u2018car\u2019 or \u2018vehicle\u2019 as used in a statute or ordinance may include a street car.\u201d And for cases that have held streetcars to be vehicles, see <em>Bradley v. Minneapolis St. Ry. Co., </em>201 N. W. 606 (Minn.) ; <em>Syck v. Duluth St. Ry. Co., supra; Cleveland C. C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co. v. Urbana B. N. Ry. Co., </em>73 Ohio St. Rep. 364; <em>Poster v. Curtis, 99 </em>N. F. 961 (Mass.); and <em>Havins v. Dallas Ry. &amp; Term. Co., </em>130 S. W. 2d 878 (Tex. Civ. App.). And see the Baltimore City Code (Flack 1950), Article 29, Sections 19 and 20, wherein it is provided that \u201c* * * all <em>street railway cars, </em>trackless trolleys and buses * * * shall stop on the near side\u201d of crossings, and \u201call owners and operators of <em>vehicles </em>(italics ours) failing to comply\u201d with the provisions shall be subject to a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">From what has been said above, we hold that the meaning of the phrase \u201cper vehicle used by mass transit or transportation company\u201d is not ambiguous; hence the word \u201cvehicle\u201d therein must be construed as having been used in its general sense so as to include streetcars.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Although we have held above that no ambiguity exists in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Section 13(a) and, therefore, its meaning must be determined from its terms, we may add that we have carefully examined the legislative history of the Act as stated by the appellant, but we are unable to discover anything therein that would alter the result reached herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Appellant\u2019s next assignment of error states that if Section 13(a) is interpreted as imposing a seat tax fee on streetcars, then it is invalid as being in contravention of Section 4 of Article 11A of the State Constitution, and the Charter and public local laws of Baltimore City. It argues that among the powers heretofore granted to the City under the authority of Section 2 of said Article 11A were the powers to \u201cregulate the use of streets by street railways\u201d (Baltimore City Charter [1949], Article 4, Section 6 [25]), and \u201cto license and regulate all carriages and other vehicles owned or used * * * in said city\u201d (Article 4, Section 6 [2] Code of Public Local Laws 1930); and, since Section 13(a), which purports to impose a seat tax fee on streetcars, is a \u201clocal law,\u201d it violates said Section 4. The answer to this contention depends upon whether or not Article 64B is a public local law within the meaning of Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The express powers granted to the City of Baltimore were originally set forth in Article 4, Section 6, Public Local Laws of Maryland. Section 2 of Article 11A (ratified November 2, 1915) provides that \u201c* * <em>* </em>the powers heretofore granted to the City of Baltimore [named above] shall not be enlarged or extended by any charter formed under the provisions of this Article, but such powers may be extended, modified, amended or repealed by the General Assembly.\u201d And Section 4 (also ratified on November 2, 1915) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201cFrom and after the adoption of a charter * * * by the City of Baltimore * * *, no public local law shall be enacted by the General Assembly for said City * * * on any subject covered by the express powers granted as above provided. Any law so drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>as to <em>apply to two or more of the geographical sub-divisions of this State shall not be deemed a bocal baw, within the </em>meaning of this Act. The term \u2018geographical sub-division\u2019 herein used shall be taken to mean the City of Baltimore or any of the Counties of this State.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Since Section 4 defines the term \u201cgeographical sub-division,\u201d the provisions of Section 13(a) of Article 64B relate to a \u201csubject covered by the express powers\u201d granted to Baltimore City, and the provisions of Article 64B deal with an \u201carea\u201d containing \u201call of the territory [later enlarged] located within the boundary lines of Baltimore City and Baltimore County with the exception of the fifth, sixth, seventh and tenth election districts of Baltimore County,\u201d our question narrows to whether a law, which applies to one whole geographical sub-division and part of another, is a local law within the purview of Section 4, or must it apply to at least two <em>complete </em>geographical subdivisions, in order to be taken out of that category.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In order to make this determination, we naturally turn to a consideration of the objectives and purposes intended to be accomplished by Article 11A and Section 4 thereof in particular. In <em>State v. Stewart, </em>152 Md. 419, 137 A. 39, this Court pointed out that the wisdom of incorporating in the organic law of this State such provisions as are contained in Article 11A had long been urged prior to its adoption. The reasons assigned by its proponents w'ere that a larger measure of \u201chome rule\u201d would thereby be secured to the people of the respective political subdivisions of the State in matters of \u201cpurely local concern, in order that there should be the fullest measure of local self-government,\u201d and, with the local questions withdrawn from consideration of the General Assembly, that body would have more time to consider and pass upon \u201cgeneral legislation.\u201d In its opinion, the Court states that the Legislature has \u201cfull power\u201d to designate the subjects in respect to which the power of legislation is delegated to local authorities under Article 11A and it has reserved unto itself the power and authority to enlarge, repeal or change the grant of powers theretofore made, provided it does so in a proper manner. The Court then held that a law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the subject-matter of which was \u201cexclusively local to Baltimore City,\u201d was a local law within the meaning of Article 11 A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">It seems clear to us that Article 64B is not a local law within the meaning of Article 11 A. It is not \u201cexclusively local to Baltimore City,\u201d nor is it \u201cexclusively local\u201d to those portions of Baltimore County encompassed within the \u201carea\u201d in which MTA is operative. Therefore, any attempt to legislate for the entire \u201carea\u201d by the authorities of either Baltimore City or Baltimore County would be ineffective. And, since certain of the provisions of Article 64B relate to \u201csubject[s] covered by the express powers\u201d granted to Baltimore City and also to those granted to Baltimore County, the General Assembly would not have authority to legislate for the \u201carea,\u201d if such legislation were local laws within the purview of Section 4 of Article 11A. With the large and thickly settled metropolitan districts of Maryland adjacent to Baltimore City and Washington, D. C., it seems particularly appropriate that some legislative body should have authority to legislate for \u201careas\u201d comprising at least a portion of two or more of the \u201cgeographical sub-divisions\u201d named in Section 4. We are unable to conclude that the provisions of Section 4 require an enactment of the General Assembly to apply to two or more <em>complete </em>sub-divisions in order to take it out of the category of being a \u201clocal law,\u201d within the meaning of Article 11 A. We think, and therefore hold, that Article 64B does not impinge upon the provisions of Section 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Section 29 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution provides, in part, that \u201cevery Raw enacted by the General Assembly shall embrace but one subject, and that shall be described in its title,\u201d and this provision has been a prolific source of litigation. Although we have repeatedly held that every presumption favors the validity of a statute and it will not be declared unconstitutional unless it plainly contravenes the Constitution, liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>gants seize upon every opportunity to claim a violation of the above provisions, if they feel there is any possibility of a successful challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It will be unnecessary to set forth, in great detail, the objects of the above quoted constitutional provision, as we have already done so on numerous occasions. For two recent cases, see <em>Leonardo v. County Comm., </em>214 Md. 287, 298, 134 A. 2d 284; and <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 150 A. 2d 421. See also Everstine, <em>Title of Legislative Acts, 9 </em>Md. L. Rev. 197. It will suffice here to state that its purposes are to prevent the combination in one act of several distinct and incongruous subjects, and to inform the members of the legislature and the public of the nature of the proposed legislation. The cases arising under this Article may be generally divided into those in which it is contended that the title is not sufficiently descriptive, and those wherein it is claimed the title is misleading. This Court has consistently held that the Constitution is complied with if the title of the statute <em>fairly </em>advises the legislature and the public of the real nature and subject matter of the legislation sought to be enacted, and it is unnecessary that the title be an abstract of the text of the proposed statute, nor need mention be made of the means and the methods by which its purpose is to be accomplished. <em>Leonardo v. County Comm., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The title to the Act reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cAN ACT to add a new Article 64B to the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957 edition), to follow immediately after Article 64A thereof, and to be under the new title \u2018Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019, creating a Metropolitan Transit Authority as an instrumentality of the State of Maryland, providing generally for its membership, powers, duties, operations and procedure, relating generally to mass transit facilities in a certain metropolitan area in and around Baltimore City, authorizing the Authority to license, regulate, acquire or operate mass transit facilities in this metropolitan area, relating also to the present powers of the Public Service Commission over such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>facilities, and generally concerning and relating to mass transportation in the said metropolitan area of Baltimore City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The crux of appellant\u2019s contention here is that Article 64B (construed in the manner as we construed it above) imposes a tax not disclosed by its title. Chief reliance is placed upon <em>Culp v. Commrs. of Chestertown, </em>154 Md. 620, 141 A. 410, but that case is distinguishable from this one, for the reasons given by Judge Hammond in <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>(219 Md. at 614).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The title, we think, fairly and amply apprised the Legislature and the public of the purpose of the Act, and it was not misleading. It stated that the statute created MTA as an instrumentality of the State, and provided generally MTA\u2019s powers, duties, operations and procedures relating generally to mass transit facilities. It stated further that the Act authorized MTA to license, regulate, acquire and/or operate mass transit facilities ; and that the Act dealt with matters \u201cgenerally concerning and relating to mass transportation.\u201d We hold that it was not necessary to abstract the Act in its title; and the seat tax fee imposed in Section 13(a) was a valid and constitutional provision of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The questions involved herein were thoroughly and capably briefed by counsel on both sides, and the case was ably argued. The Court received material assistance therefrom in its determination of the issues, and acknowledges its appreciation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\">. \u201cBlack first defines \u201cvehicle\u201d as \u201cthat in or on which a person or thing is or may be carried from one place to another, especially along the ground, also through the air; * * Later, in giving the interpretations given the word by different courts, it is said: \u201cany carriage, conveyance, or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on land;\u2014 not ordinarily including locomotives, cars, and street cars which run or are operated only over and upon a permanent track or fixed way * * *.
