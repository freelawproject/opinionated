Both motions were denied on the same day, and, still on the same day, separate appeals were noted to this Court, and, after the jury\u2019s determination that applicant was a defective delinquent, he was committed to Patuxent Institution (still on April 3rd). Thereafter, on May 6, 1963, he noted a simple appeal to this Court from \u201cthe finding by the Jury that the Defendant was a Defective Delinquent.\u201d The State moves to dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">It is apparent that they must be dismissed. The denials of the two motions were obviously preliminary orders and any attempted appeals therefrom before the case was heard below are premature. Cf. Code (1957), Art. 5, \u00a7 1; Maryland Rule 894 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>(a) (1961 Ed.). There are no provisions in the laws of Maryland or in the Maryland Rules that permit appeals, or applications for leave to' appeal in defective delinquencji- proceedings from interlocutory orders (in addition we have held that there is no constitutional nor statutory authority to remove defective delinquency proceedings, <em>Bullock v. State, </em>230 Md. 280, 186 A. 2d 888; and the only reason given for requesting Judge Macgill to disqualify himself was the bald statement in the motion that he had sat in a previous case of the applicant, when he was convicted of a crime, which, by itself, was not a sufficient reason to require the judge to disqualify himself).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The third appeal was not noted within the thirty days provided by Maryland Rule 894 (a) 1; and none of the attempted appeals malees any attempt to comply with Maryland Rule 894 (a) 2 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>Appeals dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
