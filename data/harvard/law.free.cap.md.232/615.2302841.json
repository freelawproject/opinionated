He was transferred to Patuxent Institute for determination of his status as a defective delinquent. After hearing, he was found to be a defective delinquent, and committed to Patuxent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">He poses three questions: (1) that he does not meet the definition of a defective delinquent; (2) that Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Article 31B, Section 6 is \u201cconfusing and an examination\u201d of him should not have been made \u201csince he had only one conviction\u201d; and (3) that he was not given \u201ca copy of the report of the institution,\u201d as required by Section 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">His first contention challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. There are ample grounds contained in the report to support Judge Harris\u2019 conclusion that appellant was a defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">Appellant pleaded guilty to incest, a felony and a sex crime. Section 6 (a) explicitly names felonies and sex crimes as two of the categories of crimes, the commission of which renders a person subject to be examined as a possible defective delinquent.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>His third contention is based upon the provision of Section 8 which provides that when the defendant is summoned for hearing he \u201cshall be given a copy of the report of the institution * * However, although he is represented by an experienced court-appointed attorney, he makes no showing that the point was raised below (assuming that, in fact, he was not furnished with a copy of the report). When he failed to raise the question below, we hold that he waived the same.
