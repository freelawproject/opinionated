Porter, III, was sentenced to 2 years in the Maryland House of Correction by the Criminal Court of Baltimore on a charge of statutory burglary. He was sent to Patuxent Institution for examination, and on February 8, 1963, after a jury found him to be a defective delinquent at a hearing at which he was represented by counsel, he was committed to Patuxent. On February 11, 1963 he filed a \u201cMotion for a New Trial\u201d. The clerk of the lower court wrote Porter informing him, in effect, that the motion would be treated as an application for leave to appeal to this Court, and no objection by Porter appears in the record. Consequently, we shall so treat the motion in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Porter raises several issues with respect to the defective delinquency hearing below, which are summarized as follows: (1) that Dr. Boslow, the Director of Patuxent Institution, gave false, misleading and exaggerated statements in his testimony against him; (2) that the State\u2019s Attorney gave a misleading and false closing statement to the jury \u201cwhen he stated that Petitioner was tried on facts\u201d \u2014 his contention being that psychology and psychiatry are theory only and not fact as stated by the State\u2019s Attorney; and (3) that Code (1962 Cum. Supp.), Art. 31B, Sec. 6 (a), requires that a person have two or more convictions of a crime or misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment before he can be subjected to a proceeding for defective delinquency, whereas the applicant has had only one conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">As to the first contention, applicant makes only a bare allegation with no reference to specific false testimony of Dr. Boslow. He seems merely to reassert that he is not a defective delinquent and that Dr. Boslow was wrong in saying he was. On its face, Dr. Boslow\u2019s report filed in the proceeding does not indicate any false or misleading statements. In reality, this contention merely attacks Dr. Boslow\u2019s credibility, which was for the jury to determine. <em>McCloskey v. </em>Director, 230 Md. 635, 187 A. 2d 833 (1963); <em>Meredith v. Director, </em>226 Md. 653, 172 A. 2d 501 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Regarding applicant\u2019s second contention, it was not improper for the State\u2019s Attorney to state that applicant was tried on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>facts. We have consistently held that it is proper for the Director of Patuxent Institution to express an opinion respecting an inmate\u2019s mental condition, both on the basis of his own examination and report and upon the findings of others. <em>McCloskey v. Director, supra; Schultz v. Director, 227 </em>Md. 666, 177 A. 2d 848 (1962), and cases cited. That Dr. Boslow and other members of the Patuxent staff had concluded that the applicant was a defective delinquent was one of the basic facts before the jury; Dr. Boslow\u2019s report contained references to concrete facts, such as instances of the applicant\u2019s behavior; the fact of the applicant\u2019s conviction for statutory burglary was in evidence. We think the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s remarks were permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Applicant\u2019s final contention, that he was not subject to examination for possible defective delinquency because he was convicted only once, is without merit. The same complaint was made and rejected in <em>Gee v. Director, </em>231 Md. 610, 188 A. 2d 565 (1963), where it was pointed out that under the terms of Sec. 6 (a) of Art. 31B a request for such an examination may be made for a person who has been convicted and sentenced in a court of this State for a felony or a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary. Applicant was convicted of statutory burglary, a misdemeanor, under the first and second counts of the indictment based upon Secs. 32 and 342 of Art. 27, Code (1957), respectively. Both sections provide for imprisonment in the penitentiary, and hence applicant was properly subjected to a proceeding for defective delinquency.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>Application denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
