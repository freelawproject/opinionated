The facts are undisputed, and the question comes here upon the granting of the tenant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in a bill for specific performance by the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">On September 25, 1955, the Caplans executed a lease of a tract of unimproved land to Goldstein for a period of six months at a rental of $150.00 per month. The tenant was given the right to place improvements thereon, and did so. The lease provided in paragraph 3 that the tenant should have \u201cthe unconditional rights and options to renew this lease subject to all of the same terms and conditions as set out for the original six month term hereof, for four successive and consecutive optional periods of five years each, the First Optional Period beginning on the first day of April, 1956 and ending on the 31st day of March, 1961; the Second Optional Period beginning on the first day of April, 1961 and ending on the 31st day of March, 1966; * * There followed statements as to the terms, finally ending on March 31, 1976, and provisions that the tenant should notify the landlord a certain number of days before the end of each term, if he desired to renew, and that if notice of renewal was not sent \u201cthen upon the expiration of such term this lease shall automatically terminate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Paragraph 7 of the lease provided that \u201cat any time after August 1, 1960, the Tenant shall have the unconditional right and option to purchase in its entirety the herein demised premises upon the giving to the Landlords of a thirty day notice in writing of the Tenant\u2019s desire to make such purchase. The pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>chase price to be paid to the Landlords and to be accepted by them shall be computed at the rate of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) per acre, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Goldstein took possession of the leased premises and continuously occupied them and paid the monthly installments of rent, although he did not give the required notice of renewal prior to the expiration of the original term. The landlords accepted the monthly payments. On September <em>7, </em>1962, Goldstein sent to the Caplans by registered mail a letter purporting to exercise the option to purchase the demised premises. The Caplans refused to convey the property and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In <em>Gressitt v. Anderson, </em>187 Md. 586, the tenant under a lease for a term of one year held over and attempted to. exercise an option during a second year. The lease provided that the option could be exercised \u201cat any time during the life of this lease after April 27, 1944\u201d, the date when the lease began. Admittedly, the lease had terminated and it was argued that the option was limited to the life of the lease, and hence could not survive it. It was argued that the rule of implication, laid down in the earlier cases cited, was inapplicable in the face of the express limitation, but we held otherwise. The <em>Gressitt </em>case was followed in <em>Bagley v. Clark, </em>190 Md. 223, and <em>Hyatt v. Romero, </em>190 Md. 500. See also <em>Stedman v. Hill, </em>195 Md. 568. We find nothing to the contrary in <em>Darling Shops v. Balto. Center, </em>191 Md. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The appellants seek to distinguish the <em>Gressitt </em>case on the ground that there the option could be exercised at any time during the term, whereas in the instant case it could not be exercised until after August 1, 1960, and the original lease was terminated before that date. In the <em>Gressitt </em>case the attempted exercise, as here, was after the original term, and after the lease itself had terminated. The mere fact that the present lease set a time before which the option could not be exercised is no bar, since that time limitation was satisfied. With that condition fulfilled, we think the <em>Gressitt </em>case is indistinguishable and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The appellants rely upon <em>Canary v. Wagner, </em>191 Md. 413. It is true that it was there held that the option did not survive the termination of the lease, although the lease provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>it should continue in force from year to year after the expiration of the initial four and one-half year term. But the option was limited by its express terms to one point of time, at \u201cthe expiration of the above four and one-half years term mentioned.\u201d It was held that the parties did not intend to permit a redemption after that time. In the instant case the language was \u201cat any time after August 1, 1960,\u201d and the exercise was in 1962. The case is readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
