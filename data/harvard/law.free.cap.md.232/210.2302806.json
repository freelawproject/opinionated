C. of Baltimore and its Building Inspection Engineer be enjoined from granting a building permit to Non-Profit Housing Company (Non-Profit); that the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals (the Board) be ordered to cancel a permit originally granted to Non-Profit on September 28, 1960, and the then current extension thereof; and that Non-Profit be restrained from seeking a building permit with the variances authorized by the Board\u2019s resolution of September 28, 1960, and subsequent extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">We decided the case earlier by a <em>per curiam </em>order; we now give the reasons for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">This is the second chapter wherein Mr. Nutter, <em>et at., </em>have shown their displeasure at the Board\u2019s action in granting a variance which authorized a permit to Non-Profit for the construction of an apartment house. The first chapter is found in <em>Nutter v. City of Baltimore, </em>230 Md. 6, 185 A. 2d 360. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>facts up to the time of that appeal are fully set forth therein. We shall, therefore, outline them very briefly, and state what has transpired since.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">As indicated above, the Board granted a variance to NonProfit authorizing a permit to erect an apartment building. Under the provisions of an ordinance, the grantee of such a privilege was required to exercise the rights conferred by it within six months of the final action validating said privilege. Due to certain matters beyond the control of Non-Profit, it was unable to take advantage of the privilege within six months. The board, therefore, granted it three extensions of six months each, the last one being in March of 1962. Within thirty days thereafter, the appellants, there and here, appealed to the Baltimore City Court \u201cfrom the action of the Board * * * dated March 7, 1962, and the earlier orders of the said Board * * That court dismissed the appeals. We held that the appeals which were not taken within thirty days of the orders appealed from were properly dismissed, but the appeal from the last order was timely and should not have been dismissed. We further held that although Judge Foster dismissed the appeal, he actually passed upon the propriety of the Board\u2019s extension \u25a0of March 6, 1962, and we affirmed his ruling thereon. In doing so, we pointed out that appellants, in their petition of appeal, alleged that the zoning change sign posted on the property gave notice only that the approval sought would be fewer parking spaces than the usually required seventy per cent of the number of apartments, and did not warn of the increased .height, additional coverage of the lot and restricted back yard. However, they failed to press the point below and here. It was mentioned briefly in the statement of facts in appellants\u2019 brief. Under these circumstances, we held \u201cthe point [was] not before us for decision.\u201d The day after our mandate issued, ap-pellants instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Upon the above facts, appellants and appellees raise several \u2022questions, but, in the view we take of the case, it will be nec\u25a0essary to determine but one. Appellants contend that the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>cannot apply because \u201cthe merits of the \u2022case have never been adjudicated,\u201d as the Court of Appeals .said \u201cthe point is not before us for decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Appellants apparently misunderstand why the point was not \u201cbefore us for decision.\u201d (Their only real contention herein is that the Board lacked jurisdiction to grant the variance, <em>etc., </em>because of a defective notice.) It was because of their failure, through lack of diligence or deliberate and considered action, to present it to the Court properly. Although the above mentioned contention was not specifically \u201cbefore us for decision,\u201d the only reason that it was not was the fact that appellants by failing to raise and argue it in their brief waived the same. Maryland Rule 831, 831 C 2, 831 C 4; <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Aerial Products, </em>210 Md. 627, 644-645, 124 A. 2d 805; <em>Mullan v. Mullan, </em>222 Md. 503, 161 A. 2d 693. Other contentions presented and argued in their brief were considered and decided. And the existence of jurisdiction in the Board to pass the original resolution and each of the extensions was a necessary element of our previous decision. <em>Res judicata </em>(without setting forth the doctrine at length as we have done so quite recently and quite frequently) applies not only to every issue between the same parties expressly decided in a prior case, but also to every matter which properly might have been presented. <em>White v. Athey, </em>229 Md. 28, 181 A. 2d 466; <em>Johnson v. State Roads Comm., </em>229 Md. 151, 182 A. 2d 346; <em>Alvey v. Alvey, </em>225 Md. 386, 171 A. 2d 92; 30A Am. Jur., <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7 376; 50 C.J.S., <em>Judgments, </em>\u00a7 723. We, therefore, hold that appellants are precluded from again raising the issue previously raised and abandoned by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">This concludes our reasons for the <em>per curiam </em>order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
