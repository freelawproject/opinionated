The conspiracy alleged was the combination of the defendants \u201cto cheat, wrong and defraud this plaintiff\u201d by making \u201cfalse, fraudulent and deceitful\u201d statements concerning certain worthless oil properties with the purpose of selling interests therein to plaintiff. The petition alleges such deception of plaintiff and sale to him of such interests for which he paid $1,670, recovery of which with interest is sought. The petition continues as follows: \u201cThat because of said conspiracy, combination and agreement, and because said acts and conduct of the defendants herein were willfully, maliciously, fraudulently, deceitfully and intentionally committed by these defendants and each of them, and because said defendants took advantage of the said fraud and deceit practiced upon plaintiff, this plaintiff is* entitled to- recover of said defendants in addition to said actual damages exemplary damages in the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AUR\">&lt;p0 this petition a motion to dismiss for jacjc 0f jurisdictional amount was filed based upon several grounds which may be summarized as (1) that exemplary damages are jj0\u00a3 recoverable in this character 0f act;ion, and (2) that the allegation and prayer for exemplary damages is only colorable and not in good fajtb, The record contains no evidence as to the second ground which was, apparently, unsupported_ The court sustained the motion on the first gr0und upon the authority of Bank of Arapahoe v. David Bradley &amp; Co., 72 F. 867, a decision of this court. The plaintiff appeals from such order of dismissal. r</p>\n<p id=\"AJm\">, . , , T1[e question here is whether exempary images are recoverable under the allegations of this petition. This question really comprehends two inquiries: (1) Whether, jn federal courts, exemplary damages are recoverable in tort actions for conspiracy, deceit, and fraud; and (2), if so recoverable, whether the allegations here are sufficient to warrant such recovery'</p>\n<p id=\"ADJ\">It is stated, in the motion to dismiss, that the law of Nebraska does not allow recovery of exemplary damages and that this actl0n ]s Sove\u2122e\u00bf thf ,W+e are not aware of any statute of that state bearing upon this situation. Absent such statute, we need not determine what is the law of Nebraska because the allowance of exemplary damages (absent a governing statute) is a matter of general law which federal courts determine for themselves.

Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 86, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632. Also, it is clear that if the action is of the character where exemplary damages are so allowable, the amount claimed therefor is included in determining the jurisdictional amount even though the compensatory damages sought are clearly below such jurisdictional amount. Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 86, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632; Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 6 S.Ct. 501, 29 L.Ed. 729, and see Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U.S. 468, 18 S.Ct. 645, 42 L.Ed. 1111. Also, it is clear that the mer.e claim for such damages, if in an action where exemplary damages are not recoverable, cannot affect the jurisdictional amount. North American T. &amp; T. Co v. Morrison, 178 U.S. 262, 267, 20 S.Ct. 869, 44 L.Ed. 1061; Vance v. W. A. Vandercook Co., 170 U.S. 468, 18 S.Ct. 645, 42 L.Ed. 1111. With the above general statements concerning the rules of law in the federal courts as to exemplary damages, we pass to the particular question of whether the case before us is of that character of tort wherein exemplary damages are recoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"ANk\">The trial court determined that this court h^d decided against such recovery in Bank of Arapahoe v. David Bradley &amp; Co., 72 F. 867. Appellant seeks to avoid such a conclusion by two lines of argument. First, that the petition in the Bradley Case lacked the allegations necessary to warrant recovery of exemplary damages, and, therefore, the decision should not be construed as broadly determining that exemplary damages could never be recovered in torts for deceit or fraud. Second, that if the Bradley decision is to be given the broader scope, yet it is superseded by the later case in this court of Young v. Main, 72 F.(2d) 640.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai6j\">We think the Bradley Case should be understood as ruling broadly that exemplary damages are not allowable for \u201closs of personal property by fraudulent representations.\u201d 72 F. 867, at page 870. While there is some basis for appellant\u2019s contention that the allegations necessary to recovery of exemplary damages were lacking in the Bradley Case, yet this is a very doubtful matter and the language of the opinion shows clearly that the court accepted them as sufficient and ruled the matter as though they were. In the instant case, the trial judge was right in construing the Bradley Case as holding that exemplary damages were not recoverable in actions in tort for fraudulent representations. However, it should be noted that no conspiracy was present in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"Atd\">The second matter urged is the effect upon the Bradley Case of Young v. Main (C.C.A.) 72 F.(2d) 640. The Young Case involved the inclusion of claimed exemplary damages where actual damages were below the jurisdictional amount. The two questions treated therein (72 F.(2d) 640, at page 642) were (1) whether the action was in tort for conspiracy and deceit or was in contract for return of purchase price, and (2), if the latter, whether exemplary damages were recoverable. The court determined the action to be in contract for recovery of purchase price after rescission for fraud. In discussing whether exemplary damages were recoverable in that kind of action, the court (72 F.(2d) 640, at page 643) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFM\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that the action is in tort for deceit and for damages \u2018in the, nature of a writ of conspiracy\u2019; that he may sue an agent in tort as well as a principal; that the contract is void ab initio because in violation of an Iowa statute making it a crime to obtain money or property by false representations; and that he has a right to sue in tort notwithstanding the rescission,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJG\">\u201cIt is true that exemplary damages may be added to actual damages to make up the federal jurisdictional amount where exemplary damages are permitted to be recovered, Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 89, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632; and <em>exemplary damages may be allowed in actions on the case of conspiracy or deceit, </em>Alexander v. Staley, 110 Iowa, 607, 81 N.W. 803; Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 14 L. Ed. 181; 17 C.J. 977.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">\u201cThe petition does set up all the elements necessary to support an action in deceit, and, were it not for the allegation that the plaintiff duly rescinded the contract of purchase, the claim of the plaintiff that the action was one in tort would be we^ founded.\u201d (Italics inserted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMq\">Obviously, the statement that \u201cexemplary damages may be allowed in actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>on the case of conspiracy or deceit\u201d is directly contrary to the statement in the Bradley Case that exemplary damages are not recoverable for \u201cthe loss of personal property by fraudulent representations.\u201d Although the Bradley Case was neither discussed nor cited in the Young Case, and although the above italicized statement was made concerning a secondary matter, yet it cannot be brushed aside as merely dictum. If not essential to determination of the case, it was highly pertinent to the issues being discussed. If this statement in. the Young Case does not supersede the holding in the Bradley Case, at least it throws such doubt upon the Bradley Case and also as to what is the rule of law in this Circuit, that the question must be broadly examined. Therefore, we now consider what should be the rule in this Circuit as to allowance of exemplary damages in tort actions for conspiracy or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We think the proper rule is that exemplary damages may be recoverable in tort actions based upon conspiracy or deceit. In the leading case of Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371, 14 L.Ed. 181, the Supreme Court laid down the rule as follows : \u201cIt is a well-established principle of the common law, that in actions of trespass and <em>all actions on the case for torts, </em>a jury may inflict what are called exemplary, punitive, or vindictive damages upon a defendant, having in view the enormity of his offense rather than the measure of compensation to the plaintiff.\u201d (Italics inserted.) This rule has not been qualified or limited, but has been followed consistently by the Supreme Court. Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 88, 17 S.Ct. 265, 41 L.Ed. 632; Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107, 13 S.Ct. 261, 37 L.Ed. 97; Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railway Co. v. Harris, 122 U.S. 597, 609, 7 S.Ct. 1286, 30 L.Ed. 1146; Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 562, 6 S.Ct. 501, 29 L. Ed. 729. Actions in tort based on conspiracy or deceit are within this rule since they- are \u201cactions on the case for torts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APo4\">To authorize recovery of exemplary damages the tort must be aggravated by \u201cevil motive, actual malice, deliberate violence, or oppression\u201d (Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 86, 17 S.Ct. 265, 267, 41 L.Ed. 632); the defendant must have acted \u201cwantonly, or oppressively, or with such malice as implies a spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations\u201d (Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107, 13 S.Ct. 261, 263, 37 L. Ed. 97, and see Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 562-565, 6 S.Ct. 501, 29 L.Ed. 729); \u201cWhenever malice, gross neglect, or oppression has caused or accompanied the commission of the injury\u201d (Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Humes, 115 U.S. 512, 521, 6 S.Ct. 110, 113, 29 L.Ed. 463); where the injury \u201cwas done wilfully, or was the result of that reckless indifference to the rights of others which is equivalent to an intentional violation of them\u201d or where there has been \u201csome wilful misconduct, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of a conscious indifference to consequences\u201d (Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Arms, 91 U.S. 489, 493, 495, 23 L.Ed. 374) ; \u201cwhenever the injury complained of has been inflicted maliciously or wantonly, and with circumstances of contumely or indignity\u201d (Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214, 16 L.Ed. 73) or where the injury is \u201cwanton and malicious, or gross and outrageous\u201d (Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371, 14 L.Ed. 181). Obviously, there is a variance in the above quoted definitions\u2014such differences are colored by the character of the tort in connection with which the particular language was used. However, all of them have to do with \u201caggravated misconduct or lawless acts.\u201d Day v. Woodworth, 13 How. 363, 371, 14 L.Ed. 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Any \u201cactions on the case for torts.\u201d covering torts which cannot, in their very nature, be committed with or accompanied by \u201caggravated misconduct or\u201d lawlessness can, of course, never afford exemplary damages. We do not conceive torts based on conspiracy or on deceit to be of this very exceptional character. Nor have they so appeared to other courts. Exemplary damages have been held proper in a tort for a conspiracy. Robinson v. Van Hooser, 196 F. 620, 625 (C.C.A.6); Duffy v. Frankenberg, 144 Ill.App. 103, 107; Doremus v. Hennessy, 62 Ill.App. 391, affirmed 176 Ill. 608, 52 N.E. 924, 54 N.E. 524, 43 L.R.A. 797, 802, 68 Am.St.Rep. 203; Stoner v. Wilson, 140 Kan. 383, 36 P.(2d) 999; Hildebrant v.

Exemplary damages- in tort actions based on deceit are allowed in many ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>risdictions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ****&amp;and reputable text-writers approve and state that such is favored by. the weight of authority (Smith on Fraud (1907 Ed.) \u00a7 290, p. 311; Sutherland on Damages (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 392, 1178; Sedgwick on Damages (9th Ed.) \u00a7 367; Bauer on Damages, pp. 391, 392; Eggleston on Damages, \u00a7 56; also see \u201cSome phases of the Doctrine of Exemplary Damages\u201d, by Dean McCormick, of the University of North Carolina Law School, in 8 N.C^r.L. R. (Feb., 1930) pp. 129-151). We con-elude that exemplary damages may be recovered in tort actions on the case based on conspiracy or on deceit, provided, of course, a petition contains the necessary averments showing a right to recover such damages in addition to compensatory damages,</p>\n<p id=\"A7U\">This petition alleges defendants \u201cwrongfully, willfully, deceitfully and fraudulently entered into a * * * conspiracy to cheat, wrong and defraud this plaintiff\u201d; that the defendants \u201cfor the purpose ' of carrying out the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>aforesaid, knowingly, willfully, wrongfully and deceitfully\u201d made certain detailed representations to plaintiff; that defendants knew the representations were material \u201cand were false, fraudulent, and deceitful\u201d; that such acts were \u201cwillfully, maliciously, fraudulently, deceitfully and intentionally committed.\u201d Thus, according to the petition, the intentional injury was the result of a conspiracy to defraud and the acts causing the injury to plaintiff under the conspiracy were \u201cmaliciously\u201d done. We construe \u201cmaliciously,\u201d as here used, as meaning not simply the \u201cdoing of an unlawful or injurious act\u201d (Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 563, 6 S.Ct. 501, 508, 29 L.Ed. 729; Philadelphia, W. &amp; B. R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214, 16 L.Ed. 73), but as going further and meaning \u201cevil motive, actual malice\u201d (Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 86, 17 S.Ct. 265, 267, 41 L.Ed. 632) in the sense of \u201ca spirit of mischief or criminal indifference to civil obligations\u201d (Lake Shore &amp; M. S. Ry. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107, 13 S.Ct. 261, 263, 37 L.Ed. 97; Barry v. Edmunds, 116 U.S. 550, 563, 6 S.Ct. 501, 29 L.Ed. 729; Philadelphia, W. &amp; B. R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214, 16 L.Ed. 73). Such allegations sufficiently plead grounds for exemplary damages. The petition having sufficiently stated grounds for recovery of exemplary damages; exemplary damages being recoverable in this character of tort action and the sum sought as exemplary and compensatory damages being above the jurisdictional amount, the court has jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-20\">The case is reversed and remanded, with directions to set aside the order of dismissal, to reinstate the action and to proceed further in accord with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AHm\"> Alabama: Cartwright v.
