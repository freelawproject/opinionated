They were discharged because, as found by the Board, they had joined and assisted a labor organization. The order of reinstatement was based upon a finding that the respondent is engaged in unfair labor practices affecting commerce, as defined in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>8, subsecs. (1) and (3) of the act, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 158 (1, 3), and section 2, subsecs. (6) and (7) of the act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 152 (6, 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The Board found that the respondent is engaged in interstate commerce and commerce with foreign countries. It made findings that the respondent had discriminated in regard to the hire and tenure of the employment of five employees, thereby discouraging membership in a labor union; that by interfering with, restraining, and coercing its employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed by section 7 of the act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157) it had engaged in unfair labor practices within the meaning of section 8, subsec. 1 (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158 (1); further, that such unfair labor practices \u201coccurred in commerce and tend to lead to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of commerce.\u201d The findings of the Board, having evidence to support them, are conclusive upon this court. Section 10 (e) of the act (29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (e); National Labor Relations Board v. Associated Press, 85 F.(2d) 56 (C.C.A.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Respondent\u2019s business consists of the consolidating and arranging for transportation of packages, which are already on an interstate journey pursuant to a contract of sale between buyer and seller. The purpose is to obtain bulk rates for transportation. Ninety percent of the shipments are to buyers in other states. The only change which occurs in' the transitory stop, that of uniting into single and larger packages, is intended to facilitate and render more economical the shipment of merchandise. Respondent, acting as agent for out-of-state buyers, is engaged in interstate transactions which fall within the sphere of federal power. Texas Transp. &amp; Terminal Co. v. New Orleans, 264 U.S. 150, 44 S.Ct. 242, 68 L.Ed. 611, 34 A.L.R. 907; McCall v. California, 136 U.S. 104, 10 S.Ct. 881, 34 L.Ed. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Undoubtedly, the mere fact that goods are intended to be transported interstate does not bring their production or manufacture under the Commerce Clause (Const, art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 3). Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160. Nor does an interstate journey justify federal regulation of local activity which follows the termination of that journey. Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 55 S.Ct. 837, 79 L.Ed. 1570, 97 A.L.R, 947. But there is a region of intrastate activity, tied up with interstate transportation and communication, in which federal power may properly operate and from which state regulation may be barred. Dahnke-Walker Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U.S. 282, 42 S.Ct. 106, 66 L.Ed. 239; Lemke v. Farmers\u2019 Grain Co., 258 U.S. 50, 42 S.Ct. 244, 66 L.Ed. 458; International Text-Book Co. v. Pigg, 217 U.S. 91, 30 S. Ct. 481, 54 L.Ed. 678, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Moreover, there is a continuity of transit from seller to buyer in which the respondent participates. The transitory stop does not break the interstate journey. Carson Petroleum Co. v. Vial, 279 U.S. 95, 49 S.Ct. 292, 73 L.Ed. 626. \u201cIt was merely halted as a convenient step in the process of getting it to its final destination.\u201d Binderup v. Path\u00e9 Exchange, 263 U.S. 291, 309, 44 S.Ct. 96, 99, 68 L.Ed. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The motion for enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
