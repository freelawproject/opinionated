This veteran has been dead over eighteen months and she has not received any remuneration of any kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-21\">\u201cKindly forward to me immediately the necessary forms and information for filing her claim in official form in your department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-22\">We are to assume that this letter was received, but there is no evidence that the Administration ever took any action under it. Obviously they could not treat it as a \u201cclaim\u201d to be \u201cdenied,\u201d or as the basis of a \u201cdisagreement\u201d; it was merely preparatory and assumed that a \u201cclaim\u201d would follow upon the official form. Under section 445 the time to sue expired on July 1, 1931; the letter was mailed on February 3, 1931. The section tolls from the limitation any period between the filing of the \u201cclaim\u201d and its \u201cdenial\u201d by the Administrator, leaving to the insured whatever remains of his period when he filed. It follows that the \u201cclaim\u201d must be something which the Administrator can refuse. No doubt it may be very informal, but it must at least be the assertion of a present demand, not an announcement that a demand will be made. No official can take any action on such a paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-23\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
