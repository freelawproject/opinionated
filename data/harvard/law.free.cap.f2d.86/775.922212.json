There is no merit in this contention, as an examination of the record discloses that appellant at no time abandoned its right to rely upon the decree of the state court and the discrepancy in figures is manifestly an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-26\">The order of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-27\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
