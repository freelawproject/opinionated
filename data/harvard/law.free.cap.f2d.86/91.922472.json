The principals were acting as general agents for Transatl\u00e1ntica Italiana, a steamship company whose vessels plied between European ports and the port of New York, and the bond was given for the purpose of obtaining clearance of its vessels, which might otherwise be held at the port of New York to await the determination of liability for fines and penalties which might thereafter be asserted against said general agents or the vessels under certain sections of the Immigration Act of 1924. The bond was conditioned upon payment to the collector of customs of \u201call fines and penalties imposed against any vessel * * * by reason of the violation of any of the provisions of sections 16, 19, 20 and 26\u201d of said Act (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 216, 166 and notes, 167, 145) \u201cfor the payment of which the said McDonnell &amp; Truda, General Agents for the Transatlantic Italiana or any such vessel shall be determined to be liable.\" A breach of the condition was alleged in the complaint, and was found by the district court to have occurred, by reason of the failure of the defendants to pay fines imposed by the Secretary of Labor under said section 26 (8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145) against said general agents with respect to three inadmissible aliens who were brought to the port of New York during 1927 upon a vessel of the above-mentioned steamship company. The fines in question were imposed early in 1928, and this action was not brought until more than five years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Because of this delay the defendants contend that the suit is barred by the statute of limitations, and this presents the main question raised by the appeal. The statute relied upon (28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 791) forbids prosecution of a suit for any penalty or forfeiture unless the same is commenced within five years from the time when the penalty or forfeiture accrued, provided the person liable shall have been subject to process during that period. McDonnell and Truda were subject to process during all of the five year period. If this were an action upon the statutory liability of the general agents, the statute would be a bar. But it is not. It is an action upon the defendants\u2019 promise to pay penalties for which the agents \u201cshall be determined to be liable.\u201d No statute of limitations has run against this promise. See Raymond v. United States, Fed.Cas.No. 11,596 (C.C.S. D.N.Y.); United States v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 221 F. 27 (C.C.A.4); United States v. Springer &amp; Lotz, 69 F.(2d) 819, 820 (C.C.A.2) ; United States v. John Barth Co., 279 U.S. 370, 49 S.Ct. 366, 73 L.Ed. 743. The appellants take the position that the phrase above quoted refers to a determination of liability by a court and that such a determination cannot be made by any court after the expiration of five years after the Secretary\u2019s action. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>cannot agree. When the Secretary of Labor imposed the fine, he determined liability of the agents within the meaning of the bond. National Surety Co. v. Holtzman, 43 F.(2d) 544, 546 (C.C.A.4). It is true that the correctness of his determination is subject to judicial review in an action upon the bond, for \u201cthe bond secured only valid fines, and if there were none, it was not forfeited.\u201d United States v. Columbus Marine Corporation, 62 F.(2d) 795, 796 (C.C.A.2). But determination whether the fine was validly imposed by the Secretary is not within the prohibition of section 791 unless the suit itself is upon the statutory liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The appellants rely upon our decision in United States v. Springer &amp; Lotz, 69 F. (2d) 819. We did not there hold that section 791 applied to an action on the bond; in fact, we said it did not. We held that though the action was brought in time, it failed on the merits because the penalties must themselves be \u201cpayable\u201d to be within the coverage of the bond. If that holding were still good law, the appellants should prevail, but it can no longer be sustained in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in United States v. Mack, 295 U.S. 480, 55 S.Ct. 813, 79 L.Ed. 1559. Our conclusion is that section 791 \"affords no defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The remaining contentions of the appellants require little discussion. It is urged that no breach of the bond was alleged and proved because no penalties were imposed \u201cagainst any vessel\u201d but only against the agents. Such a construction would make meaningless the reference to fines to be imposed for a violation of section 26. Fines under the specified sections, for the payment of which clearance of the vessels could be withheld, were plainly intended to be within the coverage of the bond and the words used are a sufficient expression of that intent. See National Surety Co. v. Holtzman, 43 F.(2d) 544 (C. C.A.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In respect to the alien excluded on the ground that he was afflicted with a physical defect which might affect his ability to earn a living, it is contended that the fine was unlawfully imposed because the Secretary did not submit to the examining physicians at the port of arrival the medical testimony and the consul\u2019s letter contained in the carrier\u2019s protest. The rule in Fusco\u2019s case is relied on (Lloyd Sabaudo Societa Anonima Per Azioni v. Elting, 287 U.S. 329, 53 S.Ct. 167, 77 L.Ed. 341). We do not think it applicable. The medical diagnosis abroad was not substantially different from that of the local physicians. The physical defect was patent and known to the carrier when the alien embarked. With all the evidence before him it was for the Secretary to decide how much the defect would affect the alien\u2019s earning capacity. Cf. Swedish-American Line v. United States (April 6, 1936, Ct.Cl.).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
