This act of Congress was in effect approved by an act of the Legislature of the state of California, approved September 20, 1934 (St.Cal.1935, p. 5). The matter proceeded in the lower court to the point where the court approved a reorganization plan from which the bondholders of the district take this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-22\">During the pendency of this appeal the Supreme Court has held that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act relied upon are unconstitutional and that the lack of federal authority for such legislation cannot be acquired or validated by the Consent of the state through its Legislature.
