It is claimed that the declaration, upon which appellee\u2019s judgment ivas based, does not show a cause of action, the note sued upon not appearing to be then due. Standing alone it perhaps does not, but the warrant in the note, upon which judgment was entered, authorizes a judgment at any time, and although, by the declaration, the action may appear to be prematurely brought, a confession will cure the defect. Bush v. Hanson, 70 Ill. 480.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-10\" pgmap=\"374\">And it is well settled that the warrant Avhich authorizes an attorney to confess judgment at any time, and waive and release all errors which may intervene, will give the court jurisdiction of the parties, and Avill sustain a judgment, although it would appear that the note was not then due by the recital of the note in the declaration. Sherman v. Baddely, 11 Ill. 622; Adam v. Arnold, 86 Ill. 185; Condon v. Basse, 86 Ill. 159; Wyman v. Yeomans, 84 Ill. 403; Walker v. Ensign, 1 Ill. App. 113.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-12\" pgmap=\"374\">A warrant of attorney to confess judgment is a familiar common laAY security, and the entry of judgment by cognovit thereunder is a proceeding according to the course of common law which courts have ever entertained.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-4\" pgmap=\"375\">But a brief reference to the second point raised by appellants seems necessary. It is contended by appellants that the judgment in the court below should have been set aside. Had a meritorious defense been shown this would have been the proper practice. Courts of law exercise equitable jurisdiction over judgments entered by confession, and a due regard is ever had of the rights of a diligent creditor, and the court will not set aside or re-open a judgment to let in a frivolous defense, or delay a creditor in enforcing the collection of his claim.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-5\" pgmap=\"375\">Affidavits were introduced by appellants setting up usury. The affidavits introduced upon the hearing by appellee admitted usury, and the court in the exercise of its equitable powers found that the judgment embraced usurious interest, and remitted the amount so found to be usurious, and entered judgment for the sum of \u00a7300. This the court Avas author ized to do. Ralph v. Baxter, 66 Ill. 416.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-6\" pgmap=\"375\">In conclusion, I will add that no meritorious defense Avas shoAvn by the affidaA\u00dats filed by appellants for the purpose of setting the judgment aside, and no good reason appears Avhy any issue should have been tried by a jury. Appellee offered to remit any usury which the court should find Avas embraced in the judgment, and the court remitted all the usury claimed or set up in the affidavits filed by appellants, and added a small amount for the storage of certain pictures Avhich Avere held by appellee as a security, and the judgment should stand.</p> <opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b375-7\" pgmap=\"375\">Shepabd, J.</author> <p id=\"AGW\" pgmap=\"375\">Judgment by confession was entered against appellants, upon a promissory note and Avarrant of attorney, of Avliich the folloAving is a copy :</p> <blockquote id=\"b375-8\" pgmap=\"375\">\u201c 338.90.

S.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">The declaration or narr. and cognovit, were filed July 27, 1891, and on the same day judgment by confession was entered for $351.40. It is contended by appellants that the suit was premature; that the declaration shows no cause of action could exist prior to August 4,1891, the day on which the note matured. The argument is based on that clause in the warrant of attorney, which reads as follows: \u201c And confess a judgment against us for the amount of the above note and interest then due.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b376-8\" pgmap=\"376\">And it is said that because the note did not mature by its terms until August 4th, it was not on July 27th, \u201c then due.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b376-9\" pgmap=\"376\">The word \u201c due,\u201d considered by itself, has many definitions. Bouvier defines it, in its first and broadest sense, as that which is \u201c just and proper; \u201d and, in another and less general sense, as, \u201c what ought to be paid; what may be demanded.\u201d Webster gives its definitions, so far as applicable to the matter under consideration, in the following order: \u201c Owed, as a debt; that ought to be paid, or done to or for another; payable; owing and demandable; proper; suitable.\u201d The warrant of attorney authorized a confession of judgment \u201c at any time,\u201d which, under the well settled decisions of this State, authorized it to be done at any time after the delivery of the note. Thomas v. Mueller, 106 Ill. 36; Adam v. Arnold, 86 Ill. 185; Sherman v. Baddely, 11 Ill. 622.</p> <p id=\"b376-10\" pgmap=\"376(21) 377(17)\">It is the duty of courts to so interpret the meaning of words employed in contracts as to effectuate the intention of the parties, when such intention is not clear without the aid of interpretation. Bishop on Contracts.</p> <p id=\"b377-4\" pgmap=\"377\">It seems to us to be perfectly plain from the whole instrument that the intention of the parties to the note in question, was to empower the entering of judgment upon it at any time after it was given, in accordance with the usual course and custom of business where judgment notes are resorted to; and it therefore devolves upon us to save this instrument from the effect of a defeat of its objects, which Avould follow from such an interpretation and application of the words \u201c then due,\u201d as appellants contend for, if it can be done consistently with maintaining the integrity of the parties\u2019 intentions.</p> <p id=\"b377-5\" pgmap=\"377\">In accordance Avitli the proposition just stated, apply to the instrument the definitions of the word \u201c due,\u201d already quoted, and the clause AArould read: For the amount, etc., \u201cthen\u201d just amd proper; or, that \u201cthen\u201d ovglitto be paid; or, \u201cthen\u201dpayable; or, \u201cthen\u201d proper; or, \u201cthen\u201d owing tin (l demamdcible.</p> <p id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377\">The substitution of only this last definition out of all the others tends to sustain the interpretation of the appellants. A debt may be due in the sense that it is- OAving, although not at that time demandable. But leaArn the instrument just as it is, Avithout substituting any definitory AA'ords, and it seems to be apparent that the Avords \u201c then due,\u201d as employed, do not operate to limit the poAArer to confess judgment \u201cat any time,\u201d but that they relate exclusively and most clearly to the time AAdien the poAver shall be exercised, and not to the condition of maturity of the note. Such is both their grammatical sense and reasonable meaning. \u00a1Nothing but a most restricted and narroAV interpretation of the word \u201c due \u201d aauII lead to any other conclusion.</p> <p id=\"b377-7\" pgmap=\"377(48) 378(76)\">The other contention is that the court below erred in not vacating the judgment and giving appellants an opportunity to plead to the declaration. Affidavits were filed in support of and against the motion to vacate the judgment, from AAdiich it appears that an usurious consideration entered into the note, and upon which the court reduced the judgment from $351.40 to $300, in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction over judgments entered by confession. Heeney v. Alcock, 9 Ill. App. 431. But it is complained that a much more considerable reduction should have been made, and that' upon the authority of Pitts v. Magie, 24 Ill. 610, the question should have been submitted to a jury. See also, 9 Ill. App. 431, supra.</p> <p id=\"b378-5\" pgmap=\"378\">It is unnecessary for us to decide whether the affidavits which appear in the bill of exceptions make out such a case of meritorious defense as would have required the appellants to be let in to plead, for the reason that the certificate of the trial judge to the bill of exceptions does not purport to say that nothing else was presented by way of evidence to the court. Where the certificate of the judge omits to state that the bill of exceptions contains all the evidence, it will be presumed that there was other evidence sufficient to sustain the finding. Brown v. Miner, 128 Ill. 148; Ottawa Gas Light &amp; Coke Co. v. Graham, 35 Ill. 346.</p> <p id=\"b378-6\" pgmap=\"378\">Our reports abound in authorities in support of this proposition, and we are bound, therefore, to presume that there ivas evidence before the court sufficient to support the judgment. The case will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b378-7\" pgmap=\"378\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
