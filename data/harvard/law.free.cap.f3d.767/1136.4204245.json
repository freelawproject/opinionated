On appeal, Kirk argues that the district court erred in applying the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), for two reasons. First, he argues that his prior burglary offenses do not qualify as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. Second, he argues that the government did not show that the burglaries were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d as required by the ACCA. As to his conviction, he argues that the Constitution requires the government to prove that a firearm or ammunition \u201csubstantially affected\u201d interstate commerce before its possession can be punished under \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-14\">We address each of his arguments in turn, and after careful consideration, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-16\">Kirk\u2019s first argument on appeal is that his prior burglary offenses do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. We consider <em>de novo </em>whether a particular conviction qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>466 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-17\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, defendants who are subject to enhanced sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) are con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>sidered armed career criminals. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.4(a). The ACCA mandates a fifteen-year minimum term of imprisonment for defendants who violate \u00a7 922(g) and have three previous convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies] ... committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">The ACCA\u2019s inclusion of convictions for crimes that \u201cotherwise involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is known as the statute\u2019s \u201cresidual clause.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.; see United States v. Weeks, </em>711 F.3d 1255, 1262 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 311, 187 L.Ed.2d 220 (2013). The Supreme Court requires courts to use a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and a \u201ccomparative inquiry\u201d to determine whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1294 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 182, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-10\">Using the categorical approach, the central inquiry is whether the offense presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another comparable to the risk posed by the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes.... [A] crime involves the requisite risk when the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\"><em>Id. </em>(second alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-15\">The Florida burglary statute under which Kirk was convicted prior to his \u00a7 922(g) offense defines burglary as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-16\">1. Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-17\">1. Notwithstanding a licensed or invited entry, remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-18\">a. Surreptitiously, with the intent to commit an offense therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-19\">b. After permission to remain therein has been withdrawn, with the intent to commit an offense therein; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-20\">c. To commit or attempt to commit a forcible felony, as defined in s. 776.08.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-21\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-22\">Kirk argues that because it is unclear whether his prior convictions under the Florida statute were based on his \u201centering\u201d or \u201cremaining in\u201d a dwelling,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Court must presume that they were based on his remaining in a dwelling, which he argues presents less of a risk of physical injury than generic \u201cunlawful entry\u201d burglary and consequently cannot qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. However, the Supreme Court has held that \u201ca person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, <em>or remaining in, </em>a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (emphasis added). The Court has recognized the risks posed by such conduct: \u201cThe main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\u2019s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party\u2014whether an occupant, a police officer, or a bystander\u2014who comes to investigate.\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). The Supreme Court commented on these risks in the context of considering whether attempted burglary under Florida law, with burglary being defined by the previous version of \u00a7 810.02, constitutes a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>See id. </em>at 195, 197, 127 S.Ct. at 1590-91. The definition of burglary under Florida law at the time was \u201centering <em>or remaining in </em>a structure or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 127 S.Ct. at 1591 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court was considering a statute with a \u201cremaining in\u201d element at the time it explained the risks of physical injury associated with burglary as defined under Florida law, and the Court found that attempted burglary fell within the ACCA\u2019s residual clause as a violent felony involving conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 127 S.Ct. at 1590. We therefore have no doubt that \u201cremaining in\u201d burglary involves the same significant risks of physical injury to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">Furthermore, we have previously held that a conviction under the earlier version of \u00a7 810.02, which included a \u201cremaining in\u201d element, was a conviction for a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See Matthews, </em>466 F.3d at 1275 (holding that, in the context of a conviction for burglary based on entry into the roofed portion or curtilage of a structure, \u201ceven if [the defendant\u2019s third-degree burglary convictions [were] not convictions for \u2018generic burglary,\u2019 they [were] convictions for violent crimes under the ACCA because they satisfied] th[e] alternative definition\u201d under the residual clause). Although Florida\u2019s definition of burglary encompasses the curtilage of a structure and is therefore broader than the definition of generic burglary,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we explained in <em>Matthews:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>Regardless of whether a burglar breaches the roofed portion of a structure, his unlicensed entry into the enclosed area surrounding that structure may bring him into close physical proximity with the same persons he might encounter were he to enter the structure. He may come into contact with the property\u2019s owners, occupants, or caretakers. His close physical presence to the structure could lead an innocent person to investigate why he is there, and his presence alone could reasonably be perceived by any of these persons as threatening. Either the innocent or the burglar might react violently. In short, the burglar\u2019s presence in the curtilage of the structure presents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\"><em>Id. </em>We thus held that burglary under the prior version of \u00a7 810.02 qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause even though it was unclear from the record there whether the defendant had entered into the roofed portion or the cur-tilage of the structures at issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">Kirk argues that this precedent is not applicable to his case because we did not consider the \u201cremaining in\u201d portion of the statute in <em>Matthews. </em>However, the Supreme Court in <em>James </em>expressed nearly identical concerns about potential violence when considering attempted burglary based on the earlier version of \u00a7 810.02, which defined burglary as \u201centering <em>or remaining in </em>a structure or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein.\u201d <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 197, 203, 127 S.Ct. at 1591, 1594-95. Accordingly, we think the same risks as explained in <em>Matthews </em>and <em>James </em>are present in the context of \u201cremaining in\u201d burglary. In sum, we find that Kirk\u2019s prior burglary convictions qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause regardless of whether they were based on his \u201centering\u201d or \u201cremaining in\u201d the dwellings at issue because either type of offense \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">Kirk\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the government did not prove that his prior convictions were for offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another\u201d as required for the ACCA mandatory minimum to apply. \u201cWhether prior convictions meet the ACCA\u2019s separate offenses requirement is a legal determination we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Sneed, </em>600 F.3d 1326, 1330 n. 5 (11th Cir.2010) (citing <em>United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 689 (11th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">A defendant is subject to the ACCA enhancement only if he has three prior convictions for qualifying offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). This requirement means that the defendant\u2019s prior convictions must have resulted from crimes that are \u201ctemporally distinct\u201d and arise out of \u201cseparate and distinct criminal episode[s].\u201d <em>Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1329 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c \u2018[S]o long as [the] predicate crimes are successive rather than simultaneous, they constitute separate criminal episodes for purposes of the ACCA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1261 (alterations in original) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>Pope, 132 F.3d at 692). \u201cDistinctions in time and place are usually sufficient to separate criminal episodes from one another even when the gaps are small.\u201d <em>Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1330 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1261 (holding that'the defendant failed to establish that the district court erred in classifying his three burglary convictions as separate ACCA predicate offenses even though two of the burglaries occurred on the same date and in close proximity to each other because \u201ceven small gaps in time and place are sufficient to establish separate offenses\u201d); <em>United States v. Proch, </em>637 F.3d 1262, 1265-66 (11th Cir.2011) (holding that two burglaries committed on the same day at different addresses on the same street constituted separate and distinct criminal episodes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">We have held that the government must prove that prior offenses occurred on different occasions using only <em>Shepard </em>documents. <em>See Sneed, </em>600 F.3d at 1332-33 (holding that police reports may not be used for ACCA inquiries and vacating the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 924(e)-enhanced sentence because the government had failed to produce any Shepard-approved documents establishing that the defendant\u2019s prior offenses occurred on different occasions); <em>Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1259 (\u201c[F]or ACCA purposes, district courts may determine both the existence of prior convictions and the factual nature of those convictions, including whether they were committed on different occasions, so long as they limit themselves to Shepard-approved documents.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">In this case, the charging documents submitted by the government show that Kirk pled guilty to burglarizing seven different dwellings, located at seven different addresses and owned by seven different people, on or about three separate dates\u2014May 5, August 16, and August 19, 2002. The government therefore used Shepard-approved documents to prove that Kirk\u2019s prior offenses arose from separate and distinct criminal episodes that were temporally distinct in that they were committed on at least three different dates. <em>See Weeks, </em>711 F.3d at 1261; <em>Proch, </em>637 F.3d at 1265-66. Accordingly, Kirk has failed to show that the district court erred in concluding that his prior convictions were for offenses \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-8\">Kirk\u2019s final argument on appeal is that the district court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the government failed to prove that the firearm and ammunition in his possession \u201csubstantially affected\u201d interstate commerce. Kirk also argues that \u00a7 922(g) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power as applied to purely intrastate conduct, such as mere possession of a firearm, under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Kirk concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by \u201cEleventh Circuit precedent directly to the contrary,\u201d but he presents the arguments \u201cin order to preserve the issue for further review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-9\">It is unlawful for a convicted felon to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The Supreme Court, in considering the predecessor statute to \u00a7 922(g), held that the interstate commerce element is met by demonstrating a \u201cminimal nexus that the firearm have been, at some time, in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Scarborough v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 563, 575, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 1969, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977). In <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court held that gun control legislation related to the possession of firearms in school zones was an invalid exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power partly because the statute could not be sustained under the reasoning that the regulated activities, in the aggregate, substantially affected interstate commerce. <em>See Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631. In addition, the Supreme Court emphasized that the challenged statute \u201ccontain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affect[ed] interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Since <em>Lopez, </em>we have continually held that \u00a7 922(g) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because unlike the statute at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g) contains a jurisdictional requirement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that Section 922(g)(1) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause because it contains an express jurisdictional requirement.\u201d); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (reaffirming the holding that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, i.e., the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) (upholding the conclusion that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) brings it within the commerce powers of the Congress\u201d); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) defeats a facial challenge to the statute even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Lopez).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">Moreover, we have also held that \u00a7 922(g) is not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who merely possessed a firearm within state lines so long as the government introduces sufficient evidence showing that the firearm has a minimal nexus to interstate commerce, <em>i.e., </em>that the firearm was manufactured, assembled, or sold outside the state or that it travelled in interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189 (holding that \u00a7 922(g) was not unconstitutional \u201cas applied to a defendant who possessed a firearm only intrastate\u201d because the government showed that the firearm involved was manufactured and assembled outside the state); <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1260 (holding that \u00a7 922(g) requires only a minimal nexus to interstate commerce and that the defendant\u2019s actions of brandishing in Georgia a firearm that was manufactured in California satisfied the jurisdictional requirement of \u00a7 922(g)); <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390 (holding that even in the wake of <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g) is constitutional as applied to a defendant who m\u00e9rely possessed a firearm within state lines so long as the firearm has a minimal nexus to interstate commerce, an element that was satisfied in that case because the firearm possessed by the defendant had travelled in interstate commerce).</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">Here, the government produced evidence that the firearm and ammunition Kirk possessed in Florida were manufactured outside the state and therefore had necessarily traveled in interstate commerce. Given our undisturbed precedent, such evidence was sufficient to demonstrate the minimal nexus between the firearm and ammunition Kirk possessed and interstate commerce. Therefore, the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) was satisfied, and the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to Kirk\u2019s conduct. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Kirk\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and Kirk\u2019s conviction and sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1151-11\">. Because Kirk and the government agree that Florida\u2019s definition of burglary is broader that the definition of generic burglary and that the enumerated offenses clause does not apply to Kirk\u2019s case, we only consider whether Kirk\u2019s prior convictions fall within the residual clause of the ACCA. <em>See, e.g., Matthews, </em>466 F.3d at 1276 (\"The district court did not decide whether burglary of the curtilage of a structure is a 'generic burglary\u2019 as discussed in <em>Taylor [v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)]. Given our holding that burglary of the curtilage of a structure (as defined by Florida law) \u2018otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,' we need not express an opinion on whether the offenses in question here are 'generic burglaries' as discussed in <em>Taylor.\u201d).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1151-24\"><em>. </em>Each criminal information regarding Kirk\u2019s prior convictions reads that on a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>date, Kirk \"did unlawfully <em>enter or remain in </em>a certain structure, to-wit: a dwelling\u201d located at a particular address, \"with the intent to commit an offense therein, to-wit: Theft, contrary to Florida Statute 810.02.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">.
