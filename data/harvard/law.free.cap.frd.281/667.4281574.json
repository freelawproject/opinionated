The Court has carefully considered the Motion, response, reply, and the documents attached to them, as well as Plaintiffs\u2019 voluminous evidentiary submission and the oral argument of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons explained more fully below, the Court grants class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">I. Factual Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendant TD Bank, N.A. (\u201cTD Bank\u201d) employed specially designed software programs in a systematic scheme to extract the greatest possible number of overdraft fees from Plaintiffs and similarly situated TD Bank customers across the country. TD Bank allegedly collected \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in excessive overdraft fees as a result of this systematic scheme, much of it, according to Plaintiffs, from TD Bank\u2019s most vulnerable customers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>See </em>DE # 997 (\u201cThird Amended Compl.\u201d), at \u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">To carry out this scheme, Plaintiffs allege that TD Bank manipulated debit card transactions by, <em>among </em>other things, employing a bookkeeping trick to re-sequence the transactions from highest-to-lowest dollar amount at the time of posting. Plaintiffs allege that these account manipulations, which TD Bank deponents testified were applied in the same manner to all class members as a result of TD Bank\u2019s standardized computer software, caused funds in customer accounts to be depleted more rapidly, resulting in more overdrafts and, consequently, more overdraft fees. Plaintiffs further allege that, in many instances, overdraft fees were levied at times when, but for TD Bank\u2019s manipulation, there would have been sufficient funds in the consumers\u2019 accounts. Plaintiffs allege that TD Bank did not fairly disclose its manipulations, took active steps to keep them secret, and engaged in these manipulations despite recognizing that it harmed its own customers. TD Bank disputes that it has manipulated account transactions and that it has committed any violations of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs move to certify their claims for breach of contract and the breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, unconscionability, and violation of the unfair and deceptive trades practice laws of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed Class comprises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4lZ\">All customers of T.D. Bank, N.A. (\u201cTD Bank\u201d) in the United States who had one or more consumer accounts and who, from the applicable statutes of limitation through August 13, 2010, (the \u201cClass Period\u201d), incurred an overdraft fee as a result of TD Bank\u2019s practice of sequencing debit card transactions from highest to lowest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3d\">Excluded from the Class are TD Bank; its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors; any entity in which TD Bank has a controlling interest; all customers who make a timely election to be excluded; and all judges assigned to this litigation and their immediate family members. (DE # 2533, at 10).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">II. Legal Standard for Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Questions concerning class certification are left to the sound discretion of the district court, and the Court must undertake a rigorous analysis to insure that the Rule 23 prerequisites are met. <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2004). In making the decision, the Court does not determine whether plaintiffs will ultimately prevail on the merits, but it may consider the factual record in deciding whether the requirements of Rule 23 are satisfied. <em>Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., </em>350 F.3d 1181, 1188 n. 15 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Courts \u201cformulate some prediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to determine whether common or individual issues predominate in a given case.\u201d <em>Waste Mgmt. Holdings v. Mowbray, </em>208 F.3d 288, 298 (1st Cir.2000). In other words, the Court undertakes \u201can analysis of the issues and the nature of required proof at trial to determine whether the matters in dispute and the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs are principally individual in nature or <em>are susceptible of common proof </em>equally applicable to all class members.\u201d <em>In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., </em>200 F.R.D. 326, 334 (E.D.Mich. 2001) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Little Caesar Enters., Inc. v. Smith, </em>172 F.R.D. 236, 241 (E.D.Mich.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">A. Rule 23(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">There are four prerequisites for class certification: numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 613, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997); <em>Prado-Steiman v. Bush, </em>221 F.3d 1266, 1278 (11th Cir.2000). However, \u201cRule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. A party seeking class certification must affirmatively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule-that is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011); <em>see also London v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>340 F.3d 1246,1253 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that party moving for class certification bears the burden of establishing each element of Rule 23(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">A district court may certify a class only if, after \u201crigorous analysis,\u201d it determines that the party seeking certification has met its burden of a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of the </em>S.W. <em>v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 158-61, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). <em>See also Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier, Inc., </em>546 F.3d 196, 202-04 (2d Cir. 2008) (requiring plaintiffs to meet burden by a preponderance of the evidence). If the party seeking class certification fails to satisfy any one of the Rule 23 requirements, then the case may not continue as a class action. <em>Jones v. Roy, </em>202 F.R.D. 658, 662 (M.D.Ala. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">In reviewing a motion for class certification, the court generally is bound to take the substantive allegations of the complaint as true. <em>Moreno-Espinosa v. J &amp; J Ag Prods., Inc., </em>247 F.R.D. 686 (S.D.Fla. 2007). However, the court may look beyond the pleadings to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 have been met. <em>Vega v. T-Mobile USA Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1256, 1264 (11th Cir.2009). In making that assessment, the Court may not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits, although some consideration of the merits may often be necessary. <em>Compare Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, </em>417 U.S. 156, 177-78, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974); <em>and Kirkpatrick v. J.C Bradford &amp; Co., </em>827 F.2d 718, 722-23 (11th Cir.1987); <em>with Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551 n. 6 (noting that \u201c[fjrequently a \u2018rigorous analysis\u2019 will entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim\u201d); <em>and Love v. Turlington, </em>733 F.2d 1562, 1564 (11th Cir.1984) (holding that the <em>Eisen </em>doctrine should not be \u201ctalismanically invoked to artificially limit a trial court\u2019s examination of the factors necessary to a reasoned determination of whether a plaintiff has met her burden of establishing each of the Rule 23 class action requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">(i) Numerosity</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Rule 23(a)(1) requires that \u201cthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d Impracticable does not mean impossible, only that it would be difficult or inconvenient to join all members of the class. <em>Hammett v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., </em>203 F.R.D. 690, 694 (S.D.Fla. 2001). Certainly, such factors as size of the class and geographic location of the would-be class members are relevant to any consideration of practicality. <em>In re Recoton Corp. Secs. Litig., </em>248 F.R.D. 606, 616, 617 (M.D.Fla.2006). However, the focus of the numerosity inquiry is not whether the number of proposed class members is \u201ctoo few\u201d to satisfy the Rule, but \u201cwhether joinder of proposed class members is impractical.\u201d <em>Armstead v. Pingree, </em>629 F.Supp. 273, 279 (M.D.Fla.1986). Parties seeking class certification do not need to know the \u201cprecise number of class members,\u201d but they \u201cmust make reasonable estimates with support as to the size of the proposed class.\u201d <em>Fuller v. Becker &amp; Poliakoff, P.A., </em>197 F.R.D. 697, 699 (M.D.Fla.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">In general terms, the Eleventh Circuit has found that \u201cless than twenty-one [prospective class members] is inadequate, [while] more than forty [is] adequate.\u201d <em>Cheney v. Cyberguard Corp., </em>213 F.R.D. 484, 490 (S.D.Fla. 2003) (quoting <em>Cox v. Am. Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>784 F.2d 1546, 1553 (11th Cir.1986)). Thus, the \u201csheer number of potential class members may warrant a conclusion that Rule 23(a)(1) is satisfied.\u201d <em>LaBauve v. Olin Corp., </em>231 F.R.D. 632, 665 (S.D.Ala.2005) (citing <em>Bacon v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., </em>370 F.3d 565, 570 (6th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">As this Court is required to do even where a requirement for class certification is not satisfied, it has independently considered the prospective numerosity of the putative class members. <em>See Valley Drug Co., </em>350 F.3d at 1188 (noting court\u2019s independent obligation to examine elements of Rule 23); <em>Martinez-Mendoza v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>340 F.3d 1200, 1216 n. 37 (11th Cir.2003) (same). The proposed number of class members on these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>facts easily exceeds the minimum threshold recognized by the Eleventh Circuit. More importantly, individual joinder of the proposed Class members would be impractical given not just the number of class members, but also their geographic distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">TD Bank argues that the proposed Class does not satisfy the implicit definition requirement because the definition requires a merits determination and the class period is defined by reference to the applicable statutes of limitation. These arguments are unpersuasive. As explained below, the Court finds that the Class is readily ascertainable. <em>See Singer v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>185 F.R.D. 681, 685 (S.D.Fla.1998) (holding that \u201c[wjhile the definition of the class must not be vague or difficult to apply, the implicit definition requirement does not require an overly strict degree of certainty and is to be liberally applied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Plaintiffs propose to have their expert, Mr. Olsen, mine TD Bank\u2019s data to determine who the members of the class are. This method of determining class membership has been accepted by other courts. <em>See Sadler v. Midland Credit Mgmt., </em>2009 WL 901479, at *2 (N.D.Ill. Mar. 31, 2009) (automated query of defendants\u2019 database would yield \u201cobjective criteria\u201d necessary to ascertain the class); <em>Stern v. AT &amp; T Mobility Corp., </em>2008 WL 4382796, at *5 (C.D.Cal. Aug. 22, 2008) (defendants\u2019 business records provided sufficient information to identify individuals who purchased cellular telephone service and were enrolled in either one of the challenged services without ever having requested the service); <em>In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>1999 WL 673066, at *13-14 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 26, 1999) (finding class definition was adequate because there were reliable means to determine who had actually taken the drug where fact sheets, prescription records, and records of medical treatment were available to verify consumption).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Mr. Olsen can identify which TD Bank customers incurred additional overdraft fees as a result of high-to-low re-sequencing of debit transactions by comparing that re-sequeneing to each of the alternative posting scenarios that he discussed in his declaration. While the finder of fact will ultimately have to decide which of these scenarios is most consistent with TD Bank\u2019s duty of good faith and fair dealing, Mr. Olsen will be able, at the outset, to identify all of TD Bank\u2019s customers who were harmed as compared to each of these alternative scenarios. The exact damages due each member of the class will then be calculated by Mr. Olsen once the fact finder has chosen the appropriate posting methodology. <em>Klay, </em>382 F.3d at 1259-60 (footnotes omitted) (\u201c[Wjhere damages can be computed according to some formula, statistical analysis, or other easy or essentially mechanical methods, the fact that damages must be calculated on an individual basis is no impediment to class certification.\u201d); 7A Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Civil Sd </em>\u00a7 1760 (3d ed. 2005) (\u201cIf the general outlines of the membership of the class are determinable at the outset of the litigation, a class will be deemed to exist.\u201d); <em>Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113, 1133 n. 16 (11th Cir.2004) (noting \u201cfact that class definitions may undergo modification, possibly several times, during the course of a class action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The crux of TD Bank\u2019s argument is that Olsen\u2019s testimony in <em>Gutierrez </em>does not \u201cfit\u201d the case because Olsen refuses to identify the \u201cproper\u201d posting method, i.e., chronological, and does not account for predicted changes in bank practices and customer behavior. The Court has previously considered and rejected this argument on TD Bank\u2019s <em>Daubert </em>motion to strike Mr. Olsen\u2019s Declaration. <em>See </em>Minute Order (DE # 2569). Mr. Olsen is able to calculate damages on an account-by-account basis using the bank\u2019s own computerized records, a method upon which Mr. Olsen previously relied, with court approval, in <em>Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2010 WL 1233810, at *14 (N.D.Cal. Mar. 26, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Although the exact number of class members is not presently known, the proposed Class appears to number in the tens- or hundreds-of-thousands. Because of that great number, and the fact that the members of the class are geographically dispersed, individual joinder is impractical. <em>Kilgo v. Bowman Transp., Inc., </em>789 F.2d 859, 878 (11th Cir.1986) (numerosity satisfied by class of 31 members who were geographically dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>persed across Florida, Georgia and Alabama). Accordingly, the Court finds that the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) is satisfied, that the class definition is quite clear, and that the class is readily ascertainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Commonality<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The prerequisite commonality factor requires that there be at least one issue common to all members of the class, and that any class certification be predicated on \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Notably, it \u201cdoes not require that all of the questions of law or fact raised by the case be common to all the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Walco Invs., Inc. v. Thenen, </em>168 F.R.D. 315, 325 (S.D.Fla. 1996). However, \u201ca class action must involve issues that are susceptible to class-wide proof.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>390 F.3d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The commonality element is generally satisfied when a plaintiff alleges that \u201c[d]efendants have engaged in a standardized course of conduct that affects all class members.\u201d <em>In re Terazosin Hydrochloride, </em>220 F.R.D. 672, 687 (S.D.Fla.2004); <em>Agan v. Katzman &amp; Korr, P.A., </em>222 F.R.D. 692, 697 (S.D.Fla.2004); <em>In re AmeriFirst Sec. Litig., </em>139 F.R.D. 423, 428 (S.D.Fla.1991). <em>Cf. WalMart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011) (holding plaintiffs failed to satisfy the commonality requirement because they \u201cprovide[d] no convincing proof of a companywide discriminatory pay and promotion policy\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 2557. It is particularly noteworthy that, where a \u201ccommon scheme of deceptive conduct\u201d has been alleged, the commonality requirement should be satisfied. <em>In re Recoton, </em>248 F.R.D. at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Plaintiffs here have provided evidence of a common corporate policy or practice, namely, TD Bank\u2019s systematic and uniform manipulation and re-ordering of debit card transactions to increase the number of overdraft fees imposed. <em>See Oakley v. Verizon Communications, Inc., </em>No. 09-9175, 2012 WL 335657, *14 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2012) (\u201cOf course, when a group of plaintiffs suffer under a uniform policy, the commonality test is often satisfied, even after <em>Dukes\u201d). </em>Plaintiffs thus satisfy the commonality requirement under Rule 23(a)(2) by alleging and providing significant evidence that TD Bank uniformly manipulated and re-ordered debit card transactions to increase the number of overdraft fees imposed. That is the common contention that applies to all Class members that drives the resolution of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">In particular, the common issues of law and fact in this ease include whether TD Bank:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-13\">\u2022 Manipulated and re-ordered transactions in order to increase the number of overdraft fees imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">\u2022 Disclosed and/or refused to allow Class members to opt out of the overdraft protection program and shadow line of credit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">\u2022 Omitted to alerted Class members that a debit card transaction would trigger an overdraft fee if processed and provided them with an opportunity to cancel the transaction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-16\">\u2022 Imposed overdraft fees when, but for resequenciag, there would be sufficient funds in the account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-17\">\u2022 Delayed posting transactions so that Class members were charged overdraft fees even when sufficient funds were in the account to cover the transactions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-18\">\u2022 Breached its covenant of good faith and fair dealing with Plaintiffs and the Class; engaged in practices that were substantively and procedurally unconscionable; was unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiffs and the Class; and violated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>unfair and deceptive trades practice laws of Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">(iii) Typicality</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The third factor under Rule 23(a)(3), typicality, requires that \u201cthe claims or defenses of the representative parties [be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(3); <em>Appleyard v. Wallace, </em>754 F.2d 955, 958 (11th Cir.1985). Like the commonality requirement, the typicality requirement is permissive: representative claims are \u2018typical\u2019 if they are reasonably coextensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical. <em>Brown v. SCI Funeral Sens, of Fla., Inc., </em>212 F.R.D. 602, 605 (S.D.Fla.2003). Moreover, if \u201cthe same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the class representatives and the class itself, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of varying fact patterns which underlie the individual claims.\u201d <em>Davis v. S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>No. 89-2839, 1993 WL 593999, *4 (S.D.Fla. Dec. 23, 1993). To defeat typicality, a defendant must show that conflict between the named representatives and the class members is \u201csuch that the interests of the class are placed in significant jeopardy.\u201d <em>Walco, </em>168 F.R.D. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of the same course of conduct and are based on the same legal theories as those of the absent class members. That is, all Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class, whose accounts were governed by common and materially uniform agreements, were subjected to TD Bank\u2019s practice of re-sequencing debit card transactions from high-to-low, and Plaintiffs allege that they and all members of the proposed class were assessed additional overdraft fees as a result. Plaintiffs propose discrete multistate subclasses for some of the state law claims to ensure that the proposed class representatives\u2019 claims are materially identical to all other class members that they seek to represent. Therefore, the Court finds that the typicality exists within the meaning of Rule 23(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">(iv) Adequacy</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Rule 23(a)(4) requires that \u201cthe representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4). The two questions considered when determining the adequacy of representation are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">(1) Do either the named plaintiffs or their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">(2) Will the named plaintiffs and their counsel prosecute the action vigorously on behalf of the class?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-13\"><em>Kirkpatrick, </em>827 F.2d at 726. While courts generally hold that a class representative have \u201cworking knowledge\u201d of the ease, <em>see, e.g., Buford v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>168 F.R.D. 340 (S.D.Ga.1996), class certification will not be prevented solely on that basis unless the representatives \u201cparticipation is so minimal that they virtually have abdicated to their attorneys the conduct of the case.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>827 F.2d at 728. Thus, the threshold of knowledge required to qualify a class representative is low.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">The Court finds that neither the Plaintiffs nor their counsel have any interests that are antagonistic to those of the absent class members. The central issues in this case \u2014 the existence, unlawfulness and effect of TD Bank\u2019s scheme to manipulate debit card transactions and increase the number of overdraft fees assessed \u2014 are common to the claims of Plaintiffs and the other members of the class. Each representative Plaintiff, like each absent class member, has a strong interest in proving TD Bank\u2019s scheme, establishing its unlawfulness, demonstrating the impact of the illegal conduct and obtaining redress. Plaintiffs thus \u201cshare the true interests of the class.\u201d <em>Hastings-Murtogh v. Texas Air Corp., </em>119 F.R.D. 450, 459 (S.D.Fla.1988); <em>see also Tefel v. Reno, </em>972 F.Supp. 608, 617 (S.D.Fla.1997) (the \u201ccommon goal of each member of the class\u201d is to remedy the unlawful conduct, and \u201c[i]f the Plaintiffs succeed, the benefits will inure to all class members.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">The law firms seeking to represent the class here include qualified and experienced lawyers. The Court has reviewed the firm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>resumes setting forth their experience and expertise in class actions. In addition, the Court is familiar with many of the lawyers seeking to represent the class, as they have appeared before the Court a number of times. The Court is satisfied that the lead Plaintiffs and the firms seeking appointment as class counsel will properly and adequately prosecute this case. The Court therefore appoints Plaintiffs as representatives of the class, and appoints the following firms as class counsel pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(g): Bruce S. Rogow, P.A.; Podhurst Orseck, P.A.; Grossman Roth, P.A.; Baron &amp; Budd, P.C.; Golomb &amp; Honik, P.C.; Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein LLP; Trief &amp; Oik; Webb, Klase &amp; Lemond, L.L.C.; and Whatley Drake &amp; Kallas, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">B. Rule 23(b) Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In addition to meeting the requirements under Rule 23(a), Plaintiffs must establish that one or more of the grounds for maintaining the suit as a class action are met under Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3). Thereunder, a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating two requirements are met: 1) predominance of the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class over any questions affecting only individual members; and 2) superiority of class action for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy. <em>See Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 625, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Rule 23(b)(3) further specifies four areas of inquiry relevant to both predominance and superiority: i) class members\u2019 interest in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; ii) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; iii) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in a particular forum; and iv) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3)(a)-(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">(i) Predominance</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">\u201cThe Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to warrant adjudication by representation.\u201d <em>Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 623, 117 S.Ct. 2231. The question of predominance presumes the overriding existence of common issues; thus, a mere showing of commonality as in Rule 23(a) is not enough. <em>Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., </em>150 F.3d 1011, 1022 (9th Cir.1998); <em>see also Amchem, </em>521 U.S. at 624-25, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (predominance criterion is \u201cfar more demanding\u201d than Rule 23(a)\u2019s commonality requirement). Predominance focuses on the relationship between the common and individual issues. <em>Kerr v. City of West Palm Beach, </em>875 F.2d 1546, 1558 (11th Cir.1989); <em>Hanlon, </em>150 F.3d at 1022. \u201cWhen common questions present a significant aspect of the case and they can be resolved for all members of the class in a single adjudication, there is clear justification for handling the dispute on a representative rather than on an individual basis.\u201d <em>Hanlon, </em>150 F.3d at 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Here, \u201cirrespective of the individual issues which may arise, the focus of the litigation\u201d concerns \u201cthe alleged common course\u201d of unfair conduct embodied in TD Bank\u2019s alleged scheme to maximize overdraft fees through the hidden reordering of transactions at account posting. <em>Sargent v. Genesco, Inc., </em>75 F.R.D. 79, 86 (M.D.Fla.1977). Any analysis of this scheme will depend on evidence relating to the standardized form account agreement and bank practices affecting all class members in a uniform manner. A scheme \u201cperpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if liability is found, for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class.\u201d Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 23(b)(3) (1966 Amendments). Indeed, predominance is \u201ca test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or securities fraud or violations of the antitrust laws.\u201d <em>Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 625, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The Court finds that predominance is satisfied in this case. Plaintiffs allege that TD Bank\u2019s course of conduct commonly, and adversely, affected the entire class, and have submitted evidence supporting that allegation. The class members are similarly situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ated with regard to the readily determined, allegedly excess fees they incurred as a result of a standardized process. The class is unified by both common questions and a common interest. The evidence necessary to establish Plaintiffs\u2019 claims is common to both Plaintiffs and all members of the class; they all seek to prove that TD Bank\u2019s high-to-low re-sequencing practice was wrongful. That evidentiary presentation involves the same evidence of (i) TD Bank\u2019s form contracts, with similar terms, applicable to all Plaintiffs and class members; (ii) TD Bank\u2019s systematic re-sequencing of debt transactions from high-to-low for all Plaintiffs and class members through its automated software programs; and (iii) the line of credit that TD Bank secretly established for all Plaintiffs and class members in order to charge them overdraft fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The evidence to be presented by the Plaintiffs has a direct impact on every class member\u2019s effort to establish liability and on every class member\u2019s entitlement to relief. <em>Klay, </em>382 F.3d at 1255. Moreover, where corporate policies \u201cconstitute the very heart of the plaintiffs\u2019 ... claims,\u201d as they do here, common issues will predominate because those policies \u201cwould necessarily have to be re-proven by every plaintiff.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>382 F.3d at 1257; <em>see also Allapattah Servs., Inc. v. Exxon Corp., </em>333 F.3d 1248, 1261 (11th Cir.2003), <em>aff'd, </em>545 U.S. 546, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005); <em>In re Tyco Int\u2019l, Ltd. Multidistrict Litig., </em>236 F.R.D. 62, 70 (D.N.H.2006) (varying degrees of knowledge among class members do not present an obstacle to class certification where other common issues unite the class).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Court further notes that the problems plaguing the proposed classes in <em>Sacred Heart Health Sys., Inc. v. Humana Military Healthcare Servs., Inc., </em>601 F.3d 1159 (11th Cir.2010), and <em>Klay </em>are not present here. In <em>Klay, </em>the court ultimately found certification of the breach of contract claims inappropriate given the individualized issues of fact they entailed, even though questions of contract law were common to the whole class. <em>Id. </em>at 1261. There were many different defendants with many different contracts with many different provider groups. Moreover, because the defendants breached the contracts through a variety of means and differing computer algorithms that were not subject to generalized proof, each physician would have to prove a variety of individual circumstances leading to the breach. <em>Id. </em>at 1263-64. Similar problems precluded certification in <em>Sacred Heart, </em>where there were substantial variations in the terms of over 300 hospital contracts that were individually negotiated, leading the court to find that \u201cthe diversity of the material terms is overwhelming.\u201d <em>Sacred Heart, </em>601 F.3d at 1171-72. In contrast, the agreements at issue here are uniform form contracts offered on a take-it- or-leave it basis and were not the product of any individual negotiation. <em>See id. </em>at 1171 (\u201cIt is the form contract, executed under like conditions by all class members, that best facilitates class treatment.\u201d). Nor do Plaintiffs have to prove a variety of individual circumstances supporting the breach, as TD Bank\u2019s standard re-sequencing policy resulted in uniform conduct directed at all members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">In addition, the court\u2019s certification in <em>Gutierrez </em>is instructive. Wells Fargo, like TD Bank, also contends that individual issues would predominate, but the court in that case found the \u201cchallenged practice is a standardized one applied on a routine basis to all customers.\u201d <em>Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2008 WL 4279550, at *17. Thus, while \u201cthere will be some individual issues ... these individual variations will not predominate over the pervasive commonality of the highest-to-lowest method and its adverse impact on hundreds of thousands of depositors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, as in <em>Gutierrez, </em>Plaintiffs allege that TD Bank exercised its discretion in bad faith by re-sequencing debit card transactions posted to their checking accounts from highest to lowest in order to maximize overdraft penalties against customers. Moreover, as in <em>Gutierrez, </em>TD Bank\u2019s \u201cchallenged practice is a standardized one applied on a routine basis to all customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *17. Any individual issues will \u201cnot predominate over the pervasive commonality of the highest-to-lowest method and its adverse impact on hundreds of thousands of depositors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>As discussed above, class members are readily ascertainable through objective criteria: TD Bank\u2019s own records of individuals who were assessed overdraft fees. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert will formulate calculations that can identify members of the class by running queries in TD Bank\u2019s computer records. Such calculations will be merely ministerial in nature, and will not be plagued by resolution of individual class member issues. Damages will be calculated using the same TD Bank records used to identify the class members. These facts make this case manageable as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Nor do TD Bank\u2019s affirmative defenses defeat certification of the class. Affirmative defenses must meet the pleading standards in <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Twombly. See Castillo v. Roche Laboratories, Inc., </em>No. 10-20876-CIV, 2010 WL 3027726, at *2 (S.D.Fla. Aug. 2, 2010) (noting that \u201ca majority of district courts in Florida have applied this heightened pleading standard to affirmative defenses\u201d). TD Bank\u2019s affirmative defenses are insufficiently pled, as they are mere \u201clabels and conclusions,\u201d consisting of single-sentence allegations formulaieally reciting the elements of accord and satisfaction, ratification, waiver, estoppel, voluntary payment, and failure to mitigate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">Even if TD Bank\u2019s specific defenses were sufficiently pled, they do not defeat predominance. Some defenses, such as accord and satisfaction, pertain (if at all) to damages and can be accounted for if proved by Plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s calculations. <em>See Carbajal v. Capital One, F.S.B., </em>219 F.R.D. 437, 441 n. 2 (N.D.Ill.2004) (setoffs would not be a significant focus of the case and would likely involve nothing more than a mere calculation). The Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly held that individual issues relating to damages do not defeat class certification. <em>See Allapattah Servs., </em>333 F.3d at 1261; <em>Sacred Heart, </em>601 F.3d at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Others, such as waiver,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ratification,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the voluntary payment doctrine,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>mitigate<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> require, under the law of all fourteen states at issue, full knowledge by Plaintiffs and members of the Class of material facts making their actions knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, Plaintiffs have alleged, and offered evidence to prove, that TD Bank actively sought to conceal from its customers material information, including the existence of its secret \u201cline of credit which dictated how overdraft charges were generated, and that they had the right to opt out of the overdraft program (and thereby avoid overdrafts), and that TD Bank engaged in the uniform practice of omitting to disclose to its customers at the point of sale that transactions would lead to overdraft fees or their multiplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that throughout the Class Period, if a customer\u2019s primary account and any linked account balances were not sufficient to cover the transaction amount, TD Bank secretly authorized customers\u2019 debit-card transactions into overdraft up to a maximum or ceiling amount that the bank determined was appropriate for each customer. Plaintiffs allege that this was done via a confidential automated process using a line of credit that TD Bank built for the customer. Plaintiffs further allege that, augmenting its re-sequencing practice, TD Bank\u2019s secret use of the line of credit was integral to its overall scheme of increasing the number of completed debit transactions and the number of overdrafts. And they allege that the entire process of determining the amount of the line of credit and authorizing a transaction into overdraft was not disclosed to customers during the Class Period. If Plaintiffs can prove these facts, they will undercut TD Bank\u2019s defenses by common evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">(ii) Superiority</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Finally, the Court now turns to the issue of superiority under Rule 23(b)(3). The four factors identified by Rule 23, <em>see Walco, </em>168 F.R.D. at 337, requires the court to focus on the efficiency and economy elements of the class action so that cases allowed under subdivision (b)(3) are those that can be adjudicated most profitably on a representative basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs contend that a class action is superior to separate actions for each member of the putative class. Citing the factors identified by Rule 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs claim that the class action vehicle provides the most efficient, effective, and economic means of settling the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">When considered in light of Rule 23(b)(3), the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met their burden in demonstrating the superiority of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>class action, and indeed it may be the only realistic way these claims can be adjudicated. \u201cSeparate actions by each of the class members would be repetitive, wasteful, and an extraordinary burden on the courts.\u201d <em>Kennedy v. Tallant, </em>710 F.2d 711, 718 (11th Cir.1983). The class action fills an essential role when the plaintiffs would not have the incentive or resources to prosecute relatively small claims in individual suits, leaving the defendant free from legal accountability. The Supreme Court has long recognized that where, as here, \u201cit is not economically feasible to obtain relief within the traditional framework of a multiplicity of small individual suits for damages, aggrieved persons may be without any effective redress unless they may employ the class-action device.\u201d <em>Deposit Guar. Nat. Bank, Jackson, Miss. v. Roper, </em>445 U.S. 326, 339, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980). Thus, the Court\u2019s jurisprudence demonstrates the \u201crecognition that the class action device is the only economically rational alternative when a large group of individuals or entities has suffered an alleged wrong, but the damages done to any single individual or entity are too small to justify bringing an individual action.\u201d <em>In re Am. Express Merchants\u2019 Litig., </em>634 F.3d 187, 194 (2d Cir. 2011); <em>see, e.g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 809, 105 S.Ct. 2965, 86 L.Ed.2d 628 (1985) (noting that the class action mechanism may empower \u201cplaintiffs to pool claims which would be uneconomical to litigate individually,\u201d such as when most of them \u201cwould have no realistic day in court if a class action were not available.\u201d); <em>Holmes v. Continental Can Co., </em>706 F.2d 1144, 1154 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201c[T]he class attorney, who is familiar with the facts and the progress of the litigation, will be able to present the claimant\u2019s case. If relegated to a new suit, the individual might be unable to obtain counsel to prosecute his action when the amount of individual damages is relatively small____By obviating the need to bring a new lawsuit, the expense of litigating the new individual claim is reduced.\u201d) (quoting <em>Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>576 F.2d 1157, 1220 n. 80 (5th Cir.1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Class treatment is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of this controversy. Nearly all of the class members in this case have claims that are so small that it would cost them much more to litigate an individual case than they could ever hope to recover in damages, and thus there is no reason to believe that the putative class members in this case have any particular interest in controlling their own litigation. Concentrating the litigation in this forum is logical and desirable. And as noted above, this case is eminently manageable as a class action. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have met the superiority requirement of Rule 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">(iii) Subclasses</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The Court also certifies the creation of thirteen subclasses: three good faith and fair dealing subclasses, three unjust enrichment subclasses, two unconscionability subclasses, and five subclasses for the unfair and deceptive trade practice act claims. Plaintiffs\u2019 Trial Plan, included in Appendix I to the Motion, contains an extensive analysis of state law breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, unconscionability, and violation of certain state unfair and deceptive trade practice acts. As the surveys demonstrate, variations are minimal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">The Court therefore finds that the creation of subclasses to address variations in state law is appropriate here, and will make this case manageable as a class action. <em>See, e.g., Klay, </em>382 F.3d at 1262 (noting that \u201cif applicable state laws can be sorted into a small number of groups, each containing materially identical legal standards, then certification of subclasses embracing each of the dominant legal standards can be appropriate.\u201d). The court \u201cmay authorize aggregate treatment of multiple claims, or of a common issue therein, by way of a class action if the court determines that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>(1) a single body of law applies to all such claims or issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">(2) different claims or issues are subject to different bodies of law that are the same in functional content; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">(3) different claims or issues are subject to different bodies of law that are not the same in functional content but nonetheless present a limited number of patterns that the court ... can manage by means of identified adjudicatory procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">American Law Institute, <em>Principles of the Law: Aggregate Litigation </em>\u00a7 2.05(b) (2010). The proposed special verdict forms and supporting surveys of law submitted by Plaintiffs with their Trial Plan illustrate that the variations among the potentially applicable state laws are not material and can be managed to permit a fair and efficient adjudication by the fact finder at trial. Each subclass will have its own start date linked to the statute of limitations for each of those claims. Each subclass groups the laws of the relevant states accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">TD Bank argues that, despite the materially identical legal standards pertaining to the subclasses (as grouped by Plaintiffs), individual issues predominate with regard to these claims. Its argument relies on an incorrect reading of the relevant law. For example, it is not the case that the individual Plaintiffs\u2019 and class members\u2019 subjective expectations are necessary to prove their claims. To the contrary, breach of the duty good faith and fair dealing may be shown by class-wide evidence of a defendant\u2019s subjective bad faith or objectively unreasonable conduct. <em>See, e.g., Menagerie Prods. v. Citysearch, </em>No. CV 08-4263, 2009 WL 3770668, at *10-12 (C.D.Cal. Nov. 9, 2009). Plaintiffs\u2019 uneonscionability claims similarly focus on TD Bank\u2019s common and uniform conduct, making them appropriate for certification. <em>See, e.g., Dienese v. McKenzie Check Advance of Wis., L.L.C., </em>2000 WL 34511333, at *5-6 (E.D.Wis. Dec. 11, 2000) (citing eases approving of class certification of common-law uneonscionability claims). So, too, with Plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims \u2014 courts often certify unjust enrichment claims because \u201ccommon questions predominate\u201d and are \u201call easily resolved class wide.\u201d <em>In re Nat\u2019l W. Life Ins. Deferred Annuities Litig., </em>268 F.R.D. 652, 669 (S.D.Cal.2010); <em>see also In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., </em>220 F.R.D. 672, 698 (S.D.Fla.2004) (certifying unjust enrichment class); <em>James D. Hinson Elec. Contr. Co. v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>275 F.R.D. 638, 647 (M.D.Fla.2011) (\u201c[W]hen the defendant\u2019s conduct is the same, \u2018it is difficult to conceive of any significant equitable differences between class members.\u2019\u201d). Finally, the uniformity of TD Bank\u2019s representations to members of the class, through the account agreement, and the focus on its conduct, also renders the claims under the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Vermont consumer protection statutes appropriate for certification. Indeed, courts have certified classes under each of the relevant states\u2019 consumer protection statutes when the claims arose out of the defendant\u2019s common and uniform conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>III.

It is unclear what TD Bank means by its \"failure to mitigate\u201d defense or how it differs from ratification, waiver, and voluntary payment.

Plaintiffs have alleged and offered evidence to support the allegation that TD Bank instructed its employees not to reveal the limits on the secret lines of credit to customers.
