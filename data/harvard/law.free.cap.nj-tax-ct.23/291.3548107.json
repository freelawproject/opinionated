We affirm, substantially for the reasons set forth in Tax Court Judge Harold Kuskin\u2019s comprehensive opinion of September 13, 2005 reported at <em>Random House, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>485 (Tax 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We add only a few comments. As a general matter, we recognize the expertise of the Tax Court in state tax matters and will not disturb its rulings unless it \u201ccame to its decision in an arbitrary fashion\u201d or its findings of fact are not \u201csupported by substantial credible evidence.\u201d <em>Little Egg Harbor Twp. v. Bonsangue, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 285, 720 A.2d 369 (App.Div.1998) (citing <em>Glenpointe Associates v. Twp. of Teaneck, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 46, 574 A.2d 459 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>391, 585 A.2d 392 (1990)). Here, the pertinent underlying facts were stipulated concerning Random House\u2019s book publishing activities in New Jersey and its customary practice of having its books wrapped in disposable cardboard when they were shipped to retailers and distributors. <em>See Random House, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>at 487-88. We also are satisfied that it was not arbitrary for Judge Kuskin to determine that Random House\u2019s books, notwithstanding their cardboard packaging, were exempt from the litter control tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Although we are mindful that the Director posited a more expansive interpretation of the statute, we agree with Judge Kuskin that respondent\u2019s books were not within the intended scope of \u201cpaper products and household paper\u201d subject to the litter control tax under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-94(e)(12) (also repealed by <em>L. </em>2002, c. 128, \u00a7 12). In that regard, we note the functional similarity of books, such as those published by respondent, with newspapers and magazines, which the Director acknowledges are exempt from the tax. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:1E-94(e)(10)(designating only <em>\u201cnewsprint </em>and magazine <em>paper stock\u201d </em>within the ambit of the statute) (emphasis added). We concur with Judge Kuskin that the Legislature could not have intended every item composed of paper to be subject to the litter control tax as a \u201cpaper product\u201d under subsection (12), for such an interpretation would render the statute\u2019s separate inclusion of \u201cnewsprint\u201d and magazine \u201cpaper stock\u201d in subsection (10) and of \u201chousehold paper\u201d in subsection (12) superfluous. <em>See Flexx Petroleum Corp. v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>12 <em>N.J.Tax </em>1, 12 (Tax 1991)(courts should avoid interpreting legislation in a fashion that renders any part of a statute \u201cinoperative, superfluous or meaningless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We also find Judge Kuskin\u2019s analysis is reinforced by the legislative history of the statute, in which the Assembly\u2019s proposed amendment to insert a broad \u201ccatch-all\u201d in the Act\u2019s definitional section was eliminated by the Senate before the law was enacted. <em>Compare Assembly Committee Substitute far Assembly No. 2003 </em>(April 29,1985) <em>with </em>L. 1985, c. 533, \u00a7\u00a7 2 to 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Lastly, we reject as without merit appellant\u2019s contention that the Tax Court improperly read into the statute a subjective legal standard as the trigger for the tax. The Tax Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that books are not \u201clitter-generating products\u201d within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the meaning of the statute is entirely sound, is predicated on objective principles, and comports with common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
