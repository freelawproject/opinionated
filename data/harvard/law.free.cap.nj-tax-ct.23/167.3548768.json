Following audits, defendant, Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation (Director), assessed use taxes against plaintiff in the amount of $1,137,518.82<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for its purchases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of paper goods used in the entities\u2019 food-services operations, cleaning supplies used in their housekeeping operations, and furniture and renovation material utilized in their cafeterias and dining rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Plaintiff challenged the Director\u2019s assessments in an action before the Tax Court, alternatively claiming that the disputed purchases were exempt from taxation either as purchases made by a procurement agent for the tax-exempt entities or as purchases made for resale to the tax-exempt entities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To facilitate the trial of the use-tax assessment issues underlying plaintiffs complaint, the parties selected the assessments with respect to only two of plaintiff\u2019s clients, St. Francis Medical Center (SFMC) and St. Elizabeth Hospital (SEH), \u201cas test eases to resolve the legal issues common to all of the assessments under appeal\u201d involving plaintiffs other tax-exempt clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Following a hearing, Judge Kuskin rejected plaintiffs argument, determining both that plaintiffs agency relationship with the tax-exempt entities was not sufficient to qualify for derivative tax exemption and that the statutory exemption for resale did not apply because plaintiffs purchases were merely incidental to its objective of providing management services to the entities. <em>Sodexho Operations, LLC v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>21 <em>N.J.Tax </em>24, 57 (Tax 2003). As to the former, the judge found that although plaintiff was the agent of its tax-exempt clients (SEH and SFMC), plaintiffs agency relationship was \u201cat the principal-independent contractor end of the agency spectrum\u201d and not at the master-servant end. <em>Id. </em>at 48. Based upon that finding, the judge essentially concluded that, as an independent contractor, plaintiff did not sufficiently \u201cstand in the [SEH and SFMC] Hospitals\u2019 shoes\u201d to avail itself of the use-tax exemption that SEH and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>SFMC would have been entitled to had they themselves directly purchased the disputed paper goods and cleaning supplies. <em>Id. </em>at 47-49. Thus, the judge rejected plaintiffs claim to a derivative exemption based upon agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">As to plaintiffs alternative claim, the judge found that the \u201ctrue object\u201d of the agreements between plaintiff on the one hand and SEH and SFMC on the other \u201cwas the obtaining of [plaintiffs] Sodexho\u2019s expertise in providing management services for the food service department of each hospital and, in the case of SFMC, its environmental service department,\u201d as well. <em>Id. </em>at 52. Based upon that finding, the judge concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">the sale for resale exclusion does not apply because the paper goods, cleaning supplies, or furniture and materials were not critical elements of the services [plaintiff] Sodexho provided to the [SEH and SFMC] Hospitals, and the providing of these items was not the \u201ctrue object\u201d of the agreement between Sodexho and either SFMC or SEH.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Rather, plaintiffs \u201cpurchases of paper goods, cleaning supplies, and furniture and materials were incidental to that true object\u201d of providing management services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Plaintiff appeals, arguing essentially that its purchases as the tax-exempt entities\u2019 procurement agent were exempt from the use tax either under agency principles or under the resale provision of the SUT Act. We reject these arguments and affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by Judge Kuskin in his thorough and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-12\"> The Director's claim for use-tax assessment against plaintiff was later reduced by $369,518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\"> In its complaint in the Tax Court, plaintiff proffered yet another theory of exemption pertinent to \u201ccapital improvements\" and \u201cequipment purchases\" made on behalf of certain of its tax-exempt clients, namely, that these expenditures qualified for a statutory use-tax exemption applicable to contractors and repairmen under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.22. Plaintiff, however, has not pursued this particular claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"> The judge also rejected plaintiff's third alternative theory of tax exemption, determining that the furniture that plaintiff purchased for use in the SFMC employee dining room and the materials that it purchased to renovate SEH's cafeteria did not qualify for a statutory use-tax exemption applicable to contractors and repairmen under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.22. <em>Id. </em>at 54-56. As previously noted, plaintiff has not pursued this particular claim on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
