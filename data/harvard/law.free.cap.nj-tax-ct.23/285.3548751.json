(Hemisphere), filed a complaint with the Tax Court alleging that the 2003 tax assessment imposed by the City of Newark (the City) on its land and office building was excessive. The property was originally assessed in 2003 for $30,675,300 as the result of a city-wide revaluation. Following a trial, a judgment was entered by the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Court reducing the assessment of the property to $19,300,000 for the tax year 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On appeal, the City requests that the ruling of the Tax Court be reversed and that the matter be remanded, for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">THE COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN DENYING THE REQUEST BY THE CITY OF NEWARK FOR AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE TRIAL DATE TO ALLOW THE COMPLETION OF THE CITY\u2019S APPRAISAL REPORT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ada\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">THE COURT ERRED IN ITS DETERMINATION OF THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE PROPERTY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWt\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">THE COURT ERRED BY ALLOWING DIXON TO PROFFER TESTIMONY THAT REPRESENTED BARE CONCLUSIONS UNSUPPORTED BY PROBATIVE EVIDENCE OR DATA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZS\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-11\">THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL DID NOT SUPPORT PLAlNTflFF\u2019S] POSITION AND THE COURT\u2019S RULING THAT THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE VALUED AS A CLASS A OFFICE BUILDING SHOULD BE REVERSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">In its cross-appeal, Hemisphere presents the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-13\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-14\">THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S EXCLUSION OF THE COST OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM OPERATING EXPENSES WAS PLAINLY ARBITRARY AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-15\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-16\">THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S DETERMINATION AS TO THE COST OF NECESSARY WINDOW REPLACEMENTS AND EXCLUSION OF ANY DEDUCTION FOR CEILING TILE REPLACEMENTS WAS PLAINLY ARBITRARY AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-17\">\n<em>POINT VIII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-18\">THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S REDUCTION OF BRODY\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES BY ALMOST THIRTY PERCENT WAS PLAINLY ARBITRARY AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL CREDIBLE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-19\">After carefully reviewing the record and applicable law in light of the contentions advanced by the parties, we conclude that the City\u2019s arguments lack sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion in a written opinion, <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E), and we affirm sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>stantially for the reasons stated by the trial court in its written decision dated August 4, 2005. With respect to the cross-appeal by Hemisphere, however, we conclude that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s reduction of the estimated cost for new windows and the disallowance of any cost for the replacement of ceiling tiles. We therefore reverse and remand these two issues to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The trial court gave the following description of plaintiffs property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">The subject property is an L-shaped lot of approximately 7.05 acres (307,225 sq. ft.). Access to the subject [property] is primarily from U.S. Routes 1 &amp; 9 (\u201cRoute 1 &amp; 9\u201d), with several other entrances from bordering International Way. Directly across Route 1 &amp; 9 from the subject property is Newark International Airport (\u201cAirport\u201d). Access to the New Jersey Turnpike is available a short distance away by either interchange 14 to the north or 13A to the south. The subject [property] is located approximately 3 to 4 miles from the central business district of Newark, in an area that may be characterized generally as hotels, motels, or parking lots serving the Airport. Indeed, a high rise hotel is immediately in front of the subject property facing Route 1 &amp; 9, as is one to the rear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">A six story office building is currently located on the property, occupying an area of 227,088 square feet. A paved parking lot adjoins the building. The property is zoned \u201cI-3 \u2014 Third Industrial District\u201d by Newark. According to the zoning provision, Art. 11 Title 40:3-54, buildings in this district may be used for any purpose not in conflict with Newark City ordinances, subject to certain exceptions. Use as an office building is presumptively permitted, as well as hotels, motels, and other congregate living arrangements not constituting \u201cdwelling quarters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">After noting that plaintiffs complaint was filed in March 2003, the trial court set forth the procedural history of the case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">Multiple pretrial conferences were held on this matter. On October 25, 2004, an initial pretrial conference was held. At that time, the court was advised that all discovery was complete. A second pretrial conference was held on December 13, 2004. Several settlement figures were discussed but no resolution was obtained, and a further conference was requested in lieu of a trial dale being set. Finally, a settlement conference was held on January 24, 2005, wherein the court set an appraisal report exchange schedule and a trial date of May 10, 2005, as a peremptory firm date, given the extensive delay in concluding this matter following extensive but unsuccessful settlement discussions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">Subsequent to the last conference, Hemisphere requested an extension of time to file its report, originally due on March 10, 2005. An extension was granted until April 7, 2005, and a report was timely filed with the court on that date. Newark, which did not object to Hemisphere\u2019s extension nor express any concerns as to delays in submitting its own appraisal report, had thirty days thereafter to tender same, resulting in a due date of not later than May 7, 2005, instead of April 9, 2005. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Neither party at that time requested an adjournment of the trial date. No timely request was made by Newark to extend the report submission or trial deadlines. It was only the court\u2019s inquiry on the eve of trial as to the absence of its report that belatedly caused Newark to simply advise that no report was prepared, no time frame for its preparation or conclusion was volunteered, but it would be requested that the scheduled trial be adjourned on the scheduled trial date when it was to appear. As a result, Newark was barred from submitting an appraisal report at the trial the following day. <em>See 525 Realty Holding Co. v. Hasbrouck Heights, </em>3 <em>N.J.Tax </em>206 (Tax 1981) (wherein only \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d not present or expressed in this matter, would warrant consideration of a further delay). However, Newark did participate in the trial (aided by its appraisal expert) and cross-examined witnesses, raised objections as to testimony and documentation submissions, and submitted a written factual and legal summation at the trial\u2019s conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">[Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">It is clear from these circumstances that the City failed to demonstrate good cause for an adjournment, and the trial court\u2019s decision to deny its request to adjourn the trial date was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">With respect to plaintiffs cross-claim, the trial court explained that it reduced the operative expenses proposed by plaintiff from $4.25 per square foot to $3.00 per square foot because the figures proposed by plaintiffs expert were based on \u201cexpense statements from the Gateway buildings, and Prudential Plaza,\u201d which were not \u201ccomparable to this subject property.\u201d The court also found that the proposed allowance for tenant improvements and reserves was \u201coverstated,\u201d and reduced the figure from $1.50 per square foot to $.75 per square foot in light of the size and age of plaintiffs building, and \u201cthe overriding theory that the entire property is in need of thorough overhaul at this time.\u201d These explanations are plausible, the Tax Court\u2019s analysis is entitled to deference, <em>Disabilities Res. Ctr./Atl. &amp; Cape May, Inc. v. City of Somers Point, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9, 851 A.2d 792 (App.Div.2004), and there is sufficient evidence in the record to support these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">With respect to the need for new windows, plaintiffs real estate appraiser, Mr. Brody, testified that the windows were in very poor condition, and needed to be replaced to improve the building\u2019s environment and capacity. Mr. Brody testified that many of the window seals were broken and the windows were \u201cfoggy.\u201d Mr. Dixon, a licensed professional engineer, who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>recognized by the court as an expert in \u201cdetermining the need for and possible cost of rehabilitation and renovation of an existing commercial industrial structure,\u201d provided similar testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">The windows in this building are double-paned insulated glass in a metal frame. The individual units themselves suffer from age as well as from vibration relative to the air traffic next to the airport. It is common to drive by the building and see that the glazing has lost its seal, and therefore, many of the units have condensing water vapor inside the glass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Plaintiff also established the need to remove and replace the ceiling tiles throughout the building. According to Dixon, the ceiling is \u201cin deplorable condition. It needs to be removed and redone even if no above-the-ceiling work is done. It\u2019s ... broken, its missing tiles. The tiles can\u2019t be matched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Mr. Brody estimated that it would cost $1,640,000 to replace the windows and $1,022,000 to remove and replace the ceiling tiles. The trial court agreed that replacement of the building\u2019s windows was necessary, but reduced the proposed cost by $890,000 (from $1,640,000 to $1,250,000). The court also agreed that the ceiling tiles needed to be replaced, but found that \u201cthe cost of replacing same is unsubstantiated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">As noted by Hemisphere, the Tax Court concluded that the sum of $1,250,000 \u201cis realistic for a window replacement of this size,\u201d but the court did not explain its reasons for reducing the estimate provided by plaintiffs expert. In addition, Mr. Brody testified that he relied upon information obtained from the Marshall Swift Valuation Services to calculate all of the estimated costs in his report, which was admitted into evidence. Accordingly, the evidence of the cost to replace the windows and ceiling tiles was identical to the evidence that the court accepted and relied upon to calculate the cost of repairing or replacing other items in the building. We conclude therefore that the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding the windows and ceiling tiles are not supported by the record, and those matters are reversed and remanded for reconsideration and redetermination.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">On the City\u2019s appeal, we affirm; on Hemisphere\u2019s cross-appeal, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
