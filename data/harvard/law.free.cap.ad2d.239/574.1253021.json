Accordingly, the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Queens County, for a hearing to determine the portion of the recovery that was intended to compensate the plaintiff for past medical expenses, and whether the settlement was consciously structured to frustrate the Medicaid lien <em>(see, Gromalski v County of Nassau, </em>204 AD2d 391). Rosenblatt, J. P., Thompson, Sullivan and Friedmann, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
