(hereinafter Mid-neck) may not properly seek contribution from the Village <em>(see, Barry v Niagara Frontier Tr. Sys., </em>35 NY2d 629; <em>O\u2019Rourke v Town of Smithtown, </em>129 AD2d 570; <em>Kramme v Town of Hempstead, </em>100 AD2d 447). The Supreme Court therefore correctly severed the plaintiffs\u2019 action against Midneck, and dismissed Midneck\u2019s cross claims against the Village <em>(see also, Boscolo v County of Nassau, </em>229 AD2d 457; <em>Fitzrandolph v Rodrigue, </em>205 AD2d 496; <em>Strauss v Town of Oyster Bay, </em>201 AD2d 553). Bracken, J. P., O\u2019Brien, Santucci, Friedmann and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
