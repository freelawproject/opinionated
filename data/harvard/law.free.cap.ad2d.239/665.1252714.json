Defendant contends on this ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>peal that his sentences were harsh and excessive in light of his brief criminal record (one prior conviction in 1976 of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree) and his steady employment history (23 years with the same company). Defendant\u2019s contentions are unpersuasive. The sentences fall within the statutory parameters and are appropriate given the nature of defendant\u2019s crimes and the absence of a showing of extraordinary circumstances. We, accordingly, decline to disturb them <em>(see, People v Wilson, </em>210 AD2d 520, 523, <em>lv denied </em>85 NY2d 982; <em>People v Powell, </em>209 AD2d 879, 882, <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 1037; <em>People v Willis, </em>200 AD2d 903, 904).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Cardona, P. J., Crew III, White and Casey, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
