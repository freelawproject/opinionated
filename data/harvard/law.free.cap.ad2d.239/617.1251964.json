Although County Court was aware that defendant had a criminal history, the presentence report, which disclosed an extensive and sometimes violent criminal history, revealed defendant\u2019s persistent disregard for and violation of previously imposed sentences of probation and conditional discharge. Consequently, County Court declined to impose the promised sentence and gave defendant the opportunity to withdraw his plea or accept a prison sentence of 1 to 3 years. After a week\u2019s adjournment to consider the option, defendant agreed to the increased sentence. Contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, we find that County Court did not abuse its discretion in failing to adhere to the original plea agreement. The court retained the discretion to impose an appropriate sentence up until the time of sentencing <em>(see, People v Schultz, </em>73 NY2d 757, 758; <em>People v Price, </em>193 AD2d 853, <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 758). In our view, the court sufficiently placed its reasons for departing from the original sentence on the record and gave defendant ample opportunity to withdraw his plea <em>(see, id.). </em>Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions, including his contention that he detrimentally relied upon County Court\u2019s sentencing promise in pleading guilty to a violation of probation charge in Fulton County, have been reviewed and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Mercure, J. P., White, Casey, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
