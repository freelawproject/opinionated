Cleary, Appellant, v New York State Department of Education, Respondent.</parties>\n<citation data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"AQpB\">[659 NYS2d 573]</citation>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"A5i\">Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court (Kahn, J.), entered March 11, 1996 in Albany County, which, in a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, dismissed the petition for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A5Hh\">Casey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In April 1994, petitioner was appointed by respondent to the position of Associate in Education Improvement Services. Her appointment was subject to a probationary period of 12 to 78 weeks. On June 1, 1995, petitioner was notified that her services were being terminated due to problems involving compensatory pay and travel accounts as well as misrepresentations in her employment history. Upon review of the matter, respondent\u2019s Deputy Commissioner declined to reinstate her. Petitioner thereafter commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>to annul respondent\u2019s determination to terminate her. Petitioner claims that she was a permanent employee and that respondent\u2019s decision to terminate her, without a hearing, violated Civil Service Law \u00a7 75, was arbitrary and capricious and was made in bad faith. Respondent answered and raised an objection in point of law that the petition failed to state a cause of action. Supreme Court dismissed the petition on that ground and petitioner now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">We affirm. We agree with Supreme Court that the record does not support a finding that petitioner was a permanent employee. A probationary employee\u2019s appointment becomes permanent either after the completion of the probationer\u2019s maximum period of service or upon earlier written notice following the completion of the minimum period of probation <em>(see, </em>4 NYCRR 4.5 [b] [5] [i]). At the time of her termination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>petitioner had. not yet reached her maximum period of service, 78 weeks, and did not receive written notice that she was to receive permanent status. We reject petitioner\u2019s claim that her status became permanent when Gilbert Cox, her immediate supervisor, initially recommended on a July 1994 probationary evaluation report that she be permanently retained. The record reveals that the decision to permanently retain an employee belonged to the Associate Commissioner in the New York City Office of School and Community Services, who personally reviewed petitioner\u2019s probationary evaluation report and notified petitioner that she would continue under probation. Accordingly, petitioner was a probationary employee and was not entitled to a hearing upon termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We also agree with Supreme Court that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that her dismissal was made in bad faith <em>(see, Matter of Johnson v Katz, </em>68 NY2d 649, 650). The letter notifying petitioner of her termination, which cited petitioner\u2019s failure to resolve outstanding travel accounts, her improper conduct in attempting to claim compensatory time and misstatements she had made regarding her employment history, was sufficient to establish respondent\u2019s good faith in terminating her, despite petitioner\u2019s efforts to refute these allegations <em>(see, id.). </em>Nor do we find that petitioner is entitled to a name-clearing hearing absent any showing that respondent made a public disclosure of stigmatizing reasons for the discharge <em>(see, Matter of Lentlie v Egan, </em>61 NY2d 874, 875-876).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We have examined petitioner\u2019s remaining contention regarding Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of respondent\u2019s answer as a motion to dismiss and find it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
