The plaintiffs\u2019 notice of appeal from the order dated April 8, 1996, is deemed a premature notice of appeal from the judgment <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5520 [c]).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, with one bill of costs to the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The Supreme Court properly granted the defendants\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment dismissing the complaint <em>(see, Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557). \"It is fundamental that where the title in fee to both the dominant and servient tenements become vested in one person, an easement is extinguished [by merger]\u201d <em>(Castle </em>Assocs. <em>v Schwartz, </em>63 AD2d 481; <em>see also, Will v Gates, </em>226 AD2d 366, <em>lv granted </em>88 NY2d 816; <em>Seebaugh v Borruso, </em>220 AD2d 573; <em>Perry-Gething Found, v Stinson, </em>218 AD2d 791; <em>Riccio v De Marco, </em>188 AD2d 847). In such a circumstance, the easement terminates because the party in whom the interests coincide may freely utilize the servient tenement as its owner. Therefore, the easement or restriction no longer serves any function <em>(Stilbell Realty Corp. v Cullen, </em>43 AD2d 966, 967). Here, when Yale Rapkin, the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor-in-interest, acquired ownership of both the dominant and servient tenements, the easements were extinguished by merger. Moreover, the easements were not renewed in any subsequent conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We have examined the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Santucci, J. P., Joy, McGinity and Luciano, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
