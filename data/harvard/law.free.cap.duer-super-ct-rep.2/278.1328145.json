All notaries, or persons acting as such, are authorized, in their protests of bills of exchange, promissory notes, or orders for the payment of money, to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>mention of the demand made upon the drawer, acceptor, or person on whom such order or hill of exchange is drawn or given, and of the manner and circumstances of such demand, and by certificate added to such protest, to state the manner in which any notices of protest to drawers, endorsers, or other persons interested, were served or forwarded; and whenever they shall have so done, a certified copy of such protest and certificate shall be evidence of all matters therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">\u201cWhenever such drawer, acceptor,' endorser or others, shall not reside in the town or city where protest shall be made, then, and in such case, it shall be the duty of such notaries, or others acting as such, to put into the nearest post-office where a protest is made, a notice of such protest to such drawer, acceptor, endorser or others, addressed to them at their domicil, or usual place of residence.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel further read in evidence from volume 1st, page 61, of \u201cReports of Oases argued and determined in the Supreme Court of Louisiana,\u201d by Merritt M.

The certificates were in strict conformity to the laws of Louisiana, where the notes were payable. 2. Courts always and everywhere take judicial notice of the appointment and signature of Rotaries Public. <em>(Shanklin </em>v. Cooper, 8 Blackford 41; <em>Bryden </em>v. Taylor, 2 H. &amp; J. 396; <em>Philip </em>v. Flint, 8 Mill Lou. R. 149, &amp;c.; <em>Caune </em>v. <em>Sagory, </em>4 Martin Lou. R. 81; <em>Haliday </em>v. <em>McDougall; </em>20 Wend. 81; 3 Cow. &amp; Hill, 1852.) 3. It was part of the duties of notaries public in Louisiana, to demand payment and to give notice of non-payment as well of promissory notes, as of bills of exchange.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-6\"><em>Wm. D. Booth, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ad2\">insisted that the verdict ought to be set aside, and argued as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">I. The certificates of protest were improperly admitted in evidence. They purported to be the certificates of a notary of Louisiana, and, 1. If regarded as the certificates of a foreign notary, should have been under a common law seal, to make them evidence of themselves. 2. If regarded as protests of inland bills; they\u2019 should have been authenticated, or some proof given that the person making them was a notary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">H. If properly admitted, the certificates of protest are insufficient evidence of eithe'r the presentment, protest, or notice of protest, of the notes. The answer of the defendants denies any knowledge of either, and is under oath. 1. A notarial certificate is not evidence out of the State <em>(Dutchess County Bank </em>v. <em>Ibbotson, </em>5 Denio, 110). 2. The act making notarial certificates proof of notice, applies to none other than notaries of this State <em>(Bank of Rochester </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>2 Hill, 227). 3. It might be otherwise after the death of the notary; but not while the notary is living (5 Johns. 375; 20 Johns. 168; 5 Har. &amp; Johns. 489). 4. A protest of an inland bill or note, is no evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>deuce of demand or notice, by itself; it must be proved, as if no protest had been made <em>(Cummings </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>Anth. N. P. 1; <em>Union Bank </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>6 Wheat. 572; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>8 Wheat. 326, 7 Barr. 433).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">IH. The notes on which this action is brought, are \u201c inland bills,\u201d and evidence of their alleged presentment and protest, and notice to endorsers, should have been given as such. 1. The law merchant that permits the protest of a notary made abroad, and under seal, to prove itself, is not applicable in this case (Chitty on Bills, 643; 2 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 696; 4 Camp. 129; 5 Johns. 175).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">\u2022 IV. The certificates are themselves defective, in that they fail to show a due presentment of the notes for payment, or that the notary presented them on making demand for payment <em>(Musson </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>4 How. U. S. R. 262).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-7\">By the Court. Emmet, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">The statute of Louisiana, by its terms, makes the certificate of the notary legal proof of the facts which it embraces, only in the courts of that State, and were its provisions not thus limited, so far from being under any obligation to obey, we should be bound to disregard them. There are many cases in which a foreign law must be followed as a rule of decision upon the rights of the parties, but none in which it can be permitted to control and supersede our own rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Setting aside the statute, then, we are clearly' of opinion, that the protests and certificates of the notary at New Orleans were not evidence, either at common law or under our own statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The law is settled, that it is only in relation to foreign bills of exchange, that the protest of a foreign notary can be admitted in evidence, and the notes now in prosecution are certainly not bills of exchange. It is true that promissory notes payable in another state or country, may, for remittance, answer the purpose of bills of exchange; but this circumstance is no more sufficient to convert them into bills of exchange than were they bonds under seal containing the same provision as to the place of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">As to our own statute it has no application. As we under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>stand its provisions, it is only to protests made within this State, and by our own notaries, that they can be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We shall give no opinion upon the question, whether if the protests and certificates could be properly read in evidence, the facts set forth would be sufficient to charge the defendants as endorsers. The notary must now be examined as a witness, and it is upon his testimony, when so examined, that the case must ultimately turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The verdict is set aside, and there must be a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
