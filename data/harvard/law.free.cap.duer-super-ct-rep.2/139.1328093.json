that on or about the thirtieth day of the same month of May, the said plaintiffs, by their said agent and factor, sold said quantities of said iron, received by said ships \u201c E. <em>&amp; </em>E.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>issues made, the pleadings were tried, before Mr. Justice Sandford and a jury on the 22d February, 1852, and on the trial the witnesses on the part of the plaintiffs proved substantially all the material facts set forth in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">The following order in writing addressed by the agent Crookes to the plaintiffs was also given in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">\u201c The Coalbrookdale Co. will please purchase, and ship to my order, for account of Pettee &amp; Mann, New York, 1000 tons Ho. 1 Scotch pig iron of the following brands: Glengarnock, Summerlee, 'Govan, Cambro, Calder, Dundyvan, Coltness, or Gartsherrie, the latter preferred, if at same price as other brands.

The order of defendants of February 1st, 1849, and the notice of acceptance of the order and undertaking to execute it, in the plaintiffs\u2019 letter to defendants, of March 12, 1849, constitute a complete contract in writing, signed by the parties. It was a contract of bargain and sale of 500 tons of pig iron, at \u00a33 7s. 6d. per ton at Liverpool, and was the ordinary case of contract, made by letter of proposal, on one part, and of undertaking, on the other part. <em>(Mactier </em>v. Frith, 6 Wend. 105; <em>Downer </em>v. Thompson, 6 Hill, 208; <em>Eliason </em>v. Henshaw, 4 Wheat. 225; <em>McCullock </em>v. <em>The Eagle Insurance Company, </em>1 Pick. 283; <em>Adams </em>v. Lindsell, 1 B. &amp; Ald. 681; Long on Sales (Rand\u2019s Ed.), 183.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">m. If the contract were of an agreement to purchase and ship on the part of plaintiffs, and of defendants .to accept and pay for, the rule of damages and recovery would be precisely \u2022 the same. The foreign factor, to purchase, buys in his own name, and upon his own credit; he has the possession and control of the property, and a lien for his advances and commissions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">IY. The absence of commissions, however, shows that the relation between plaintiffs and defendants was of vendors and vendees. The order of defendants, given under same date, to Beeh Kunhardt, was an employment on commission, to purchase and ship iron to defendants; the order to defendants was an absolute order of so much iron.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">Y. The tender, refusal, and notice of resale, entitled the plaintiffs to resell on defendants\u2019 account; the sale by brokers, the usual mode of selling iron in this market, fixes the plaintiffs\u2019 damages from the defendants\u2019 breach of contract. <em>(Crockes </em>v. Moore, 1 Sandf. Sup\u2019r Ct. Rep. 297.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">YI. The defendants\u2019 evidence was inadmissible; a special purchase of the defendants at Glasgow is not proper evidence to contradict the market price at Liverpool, established by the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony. If admissible, it is ineffectual against the conclusive evidence that the prices charged the defendants by plaintiffs, were at or within the <em>\u201c </em>current rates,\u201d on receipt of the defendants\u2019 order at Liverpool.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">YH. The verdict should be adjusted at $3,518.60, being the amount shown on schedule D, with the deductions mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>afterwards in the bill, and interest from date of account rendered, to the date of verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-5\"><em>C. O'Conor, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akr\">insisted that the complaint ought to be dismissed upon the following grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-6\">I. The various papers, acts, and conversations spread over the case, .cannot be misinterpreted, ingeniously dovetailed together, and the compound so construed as to create, by inference, an agreement on the part of the defendants, to purchase from the plaintiffs the iron in question, <em>(a.) </em>Such an inference would be directly contrary to the plain terms of the written evidence, and wholly unsupported by any just view of the facts proven. 1. The letter of acceptance from the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, dated March 12, 1849, does not intimate that they intended to supply the order from their own stock. 2. If such an inference could arise, the defendants never assented to this new proposal, and consequently there was no agreement. <em>(Mactier </em>v. <em>Frith, </em>6 Wend. 103; <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 Johns. 191; <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>3 Johns. 534.) (5.) The goods in question being, of greater value than $50, the want of a writing subscribed by the defendants, expressing a contract to pinchase, and of any payment of the price or acceptance of the goods, is fatal to the claim in this aspect. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>26 Wend. 360; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>15 Wend. 360; <em>Cammeyer </em>v. <em>United G. Church, </em>2 Sand. Ch. R. 248, 249.) (c). The order is void by the statute of frauds, as an agreement to buy; because it contains no indication whatever, by which the intended seller could be ascertained. (Story on Sales, \u00a7 257; <em>Champion </em>v. <em>Plummer, </em>4 Bos. <em>&amp; </em>Pul. 252; <em>Laythoarp </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>2 Bingh. N. C. 736; 10 Bingh. 383; 2 B. &amp; Cresw. 627; 5. B &amp; Cresw. 583; 13 Johns. 301.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-8\">H. The order or contract on which this action is founded is not an. agreement, to purchase iron from the plaintiffs, but at most only an employment of the plaintiffs, or a proposal to employ them to purchase iron for and on account of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b156-9\">HI. An agent or factor to buy. or sell for his principal cannot buy from or sell to himself; this is an. universal principle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>(Michoud </em>v. <em>Girod, </em>4 Howard\u2019s U. S. R. 553 to 560; <em>Davoue </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>2 Johns. Ch. R. 252, cited in 4 Howard, at p. 646; see cases of Agents, cited 4 Howard\u2019s U. S.

C. in error, </em>3 Denio, 580.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-5\">IY. The order was widely and wilfully departed from, to the great prejudice of the defendants. 1. The goods were shipped to and in the name of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, instead of being shipped, as required by the order, to the defendants themselves, which delayed the defendants in making sales for fifty days. (Case, fol. 72; Smith\u2019s Merc. Law, 499, 500, ch. 12, \u00a7 3.) 2. The plaintiffs were unreasonably dilatory in making the shipments ; they improperly mingled the goods intended for defendants with others in the shipments and freight accounts, and their charges are excessive.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-6\">By the Court. Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKy\">The principal points raised and discussed on the argument, were these:\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">I. That there was no evidence of a contract, or if there was evidence, the contract was void, not being in writing, and subscribed by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">II. That the order or contract was not an agreement to purchase iron of the plaintiffs, but only an employment of the plaintiffs to purchase iron for the defendants, and that it did not appear that the plaintiffs had made any such purchase, and therefore could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">As to the first point, we are all of opinion that this is a legal and valid order, and binding upon the defendants. It was not necessary that it should be addressed. It was delivered to the agents of the plaintiffs. The case of <em>The Union Bank of Louisiana </em>v. <em>Coster </em>(1 Sand. S. C. R. 566, affirmed in Court of Appeals, 3d Coms. 205), is an authority that the absence of an address or designation in writing, of the party to whom a proposition of contract is made, does not render the contract void under the statute of frauds. This proposition and acceptance we deem sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>As to the second point: The defendants\u2019 order or proposition was for 500 tons of iron, &amp;c., <em>\u201c to </em>be purchased and shipped immediately, at current rates,\u201d and as showing how the agent, Crookes, himself understood the order, he says, in his letter to plaintiffs forwarding the order: <em>\u201c </em>The Coalbrookdale Co. will please purchase and ship to my order, &amp;c.\u201d The rule contended for by the defendants is well settled, that an agent or factor to buy or sell for his principal, cannot buy from or sell to himself. (--- v. Girod, 4 How. U. S. R. 553 to 560; <em>Heys </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>7 Hill, 135, and same case in Court of Errors, 3 Denio, 580.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">It does not satisfactorily appear what the facts are, whether the plaintiffs purchased the iron, or furnished it from their own stock. If purchased, we think the fact should be made to appear, and if proved, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. If, on the other hand, the iron was furnished from their own stock, the defendants would be entitled to a dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Where an agent or factor sells to a purchaser from himself, it is not sufficient that it is made to appear that the prices paid or charged were the current rates in the market. The contract set up in such cases cannot be enforced, not because the principal has been injured, but because it is against public policy. In this case, on a careful examination., it will be found that the other 500 tons of iron, purchased by the defendants, and forwarded from Glasgow, and the evidence in reference to which was put in by the defendants, when difference in freight and commission are added, must have been within a small portion of the price charged for the iron in question. Conceding that the iron in question was furnished by the plaintiffs from their own stock, the defendants were not sufferers, as it appears from other evidence that the price charged was the current ruling price in the market. Still, in the view we take of the law, the plaintiffs are bound to show that they made the purchase of the iron in question, and were not themselves the sellers, and to -enable them to give this evidence there must be a new trial.
