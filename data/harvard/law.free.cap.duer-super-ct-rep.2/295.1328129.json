The answer did not deny the sale, but claimed to set-off a promissory note from Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co. to the defendant, for $653.70, dated May 16th, 1851, payable seven months after date. The credit for the goods expired on or before the 18th of December, 1851. The promissory note fell due on the day following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-11\">The action was tried before Mr. Justice Paute and a jury, on the 12th October, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-12\">The plaintiffs gave in evidence a deed of assignment, bearing date September 20, 1851, made by Henry G. Thompson and Joseph A. Dean, composing the firm of Thompson &amp; Co., transferring all their property and effects to the plaintiffs upon trust, to convert the assigned estate into money, and to apply the proceeds, after defraying the expenses of the trust, First, to satisfy the indebtedness of the assignors to the firms of Brown, Brothers, &amp; Co., and Hicks <em>&amp; </em>Co.; Second, to pay the liabilities of the assignees to F. S. <em>&amp; </em>D. Lathrop &amp; Co., and F. S. Lathrop <em>&amp; </em>Co., and the debts for which those houses were responsible for the said assignors; Third, to pay all the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>debts of said assignors, paying the respective creditors ratably in case of a deficiency to pay in full; and, lastly, to return the surplus, if any, to the assignors. The plaintiffs then proved that the interest on the items of indebtedness mentioned in the complaint, amounted to thirteen dollars and eighty-one cents, and rested their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">The defendant then gave in evidence the promissory note of Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co., for six hundred and fifty-three dollars and seventy cents, mentioned in his answer, and called as a witness,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\"><em>John Jaoksm, </em>who testified as follows: I was,'in 1851, and am now, a clerk of the defendant. The note of Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co. for six hundred and fifty-three dollars and seventy cents, now produced, was given for goods purchased by them of the defendant. The goods had been previously purchased at different times, and the note was given for the aggregate amount of the bills. The witness further testified as follows\u2014(the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objecting to the evidence as inadmissible under the pleadings, and the court reserving the objection)\u2014 Previous to the first item in the account for which this note was given, there had been frequent dealings between Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co. and the defendant\u2014buying of goods by Thompson &amp; Co. of McGrorty, and by McGrorty of Thompson &amp; Co. The items for which this note was given were in continuation of that account. Subsequent to the date of the note, I think there were purchases by Thompson &amp; Co., of McGrorty, which formed the subject of book account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">Cross-examined.\u2014I feel well satisfied there were such purchases as mentioned at the close of my direct examination, but will not swear positively that there were., I cannot recollect the amount or date. Such purchases, if any there were, were settled for by deducting the amount of them from some indebtedness of McGrorty to Thompson &amp; Co. for goods purchased of them, a note being given to Thompson &amp; Co. for the balance-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The defendant then rested, and the plaintiffs called <em>.Renne Martin, </em>who testified as follows: I was the clerk and bookkeeper of Thompson &amp; Co., and am acquainted with the value of their assets, and the amount of their indebtedness at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>time of their assignment to the plaintiffs. The assets embraced in the assignment are not sufficient to pay the indebtedness to Brown, Brothers, <em>&amp; </em>Co., and Hicks &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">Cross-examined.\u2014I am not prepared at present to state the amount of the assets, nor of the debts of the first class of creditors; but they are large, and the assets will not pay the first class. The assets passed into the hands of the assignees, and I suppose they hold them. I cannot state what proportion of the debt to Brown, Brothers, &amp; Co., nor what proportion of the whole indebtedness of Thompson &amp; Co., fell due prior to the 19th of December, 1851. I cannot state the amount of assets\u2014cannot state the amount due to the preferred creditors. I cannot tell what proportion of all the claims were due, or to become due, at the date of the assignment; cannot tell what was due, or to become due, on the 19th December, 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">The testimony being closed, the jury, by consent of the parties, found a verdict for the plaintiffs for two hundred and forty-two dollars and forty-eight cents, subject to the opinion of the court upon a case to he made, with liberty to either party to turn the case into a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-7\"><em>W. M. Evarts, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlEc\">now moved for judgment upon the verdict, and supported the motion as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-8\">I. The debt from the assignors of plaintiffs not being presently due and payable at or before the time of the assignment, cannot be set off in this action. (2 R. S. 354? \u00a7 18, sub. 8; <em>Watt </em>v. <em>The </em>Mayor, &amp;c., 1 Sandf. S. C. R. 23.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-9\">II. The fact that plaintiffs are .assignees for the benefit of creditors does not enlarge the defendant\u2019s right of set-off. The right is created by statute, and in terms defined, and no extension or variation of the rule is prescribed in the case of suits by voluntary assignees for the benefit of creditors. <em>(Spencer </em>v. Barber, 5 Hill, 568.) The proof shows that the assignors\u2019 right is extinguished, the debt exceeding the assets. The plaintiffs\u2019 right is that of the preferred creditors, who, in respect of equity, stand in the same position as if the defendant\u2019s debt had been assigned to them directly. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>1 Johns, case 51; Kent J., p. 54.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>J. Cochrane, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4C\">opposed the motion, and claimed judgment for the defendant upon the following grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">I. The note claimed by defendant to be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, grew out of an account, of which the claim of the plaintiffs was a part. The equities, therefore, between the parties, are superior to those of the creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">H. The evidence does not disclose that there were not sufficient assets to pay all the indebtedness of Thompson <em>&amp; </em>Co. actually due on the 19th day of December, 1851. Therefore, the equities of creditors are shown to exist.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AEW\">The proof is satisfactory, if not conclusive, that the assets of Thompson &amp; Co. will be wholly insufficient to satisfy their debts, and we therefore think that the plaintiffs are entitled to the same protection as assignees for value against the set-off which is claimed. The defendant, as against them, had no subsisting equity when the assignment was made; not only was the note held by him, not due at that time, but it did not become due until he had become liable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Judgment for the plaintiffs, with costs.
