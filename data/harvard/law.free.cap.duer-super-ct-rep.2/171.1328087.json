C. </em>Noyes, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALo\">insisted that the provisions of the will were invalid, upon the same grounds that were relied on by the counsel for the plaintiff in <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Ropke. </em>He also contended that in some respects the case differed essentially from <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Ropke. </em>There the action was against a purchaser from the surviving trustee, and the court decided in favor of the purchaser upon the ground that the power of sale contained in the will was valid. Here the suit is against a lessee from the trustee, and the premises not having been sold before the suit was commenced, the question was whether the power of the trustee to lease continued fourteen years after the youngest child had attained his age. The facts of the sale to Ropke and of the defendant\u2019s holding under him, having occurred since the commencement of the suit, he contended could not be set up as a defence, no supplemental answer having been put in pursuant to the provisions of the Code, \u00a7 197 <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>3 Cowen, 75.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-8\"><em>C. P. </em>Kirkland, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJB\">upon the principal questions, relied on Lang v. <em>Ropke </em>as a controlling authority. Even should the court hold that the trustee had no power to lease, and that the plaintiff had consequently a legal title as a tenant in common when the suit was commenced, yet, .as. before the trial, his title was divested by the sale to Ropke, he could not now be permitted to recover the possession; nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>could any other judgment be given than that which the Rev. Stat. prescribed. (2 R. S, p. 308, \u00a7 31.) If the statute was applicable, a supplemental answer was unnecessary.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b183-5\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i\">The main questions upon which this controversy turns, have been decided by this court in <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Ropke, </em>and as we see no reason to doubt the propriety of that decision, we shall certainly adhere to it. We must, therefore, hold that the provisions of the will created no undue suspense of the power of alienation ; and that the power of sale, given to the executors and trustees, was valid as a power in trust, and was duly exercised by the sale to Ropke.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Although by the terms of the will, the whole real estate of the testator vested in the executors at the time of his decease, yet as they were only to hold it \u00fantil the youngest child should attain his age, their title, as devisees in trust, having power as such to rent-the property, wholly ceased when Edmund attained his age in 1839. Their power to sell was from that time a naked power in trust, wholly unconnected with any right of possession or control. The lease made to the defendant on the 1st of May, 1851, by the agent of the surviving executor, was therefore void as against the plaintiff, it being admitted that it was not made under any authority derived from him; nor can it be denied that when he commenced this suit, he had a clear right, as a tenant in common in fee, to recover the undivided share which he claims. But we hold it to be just as certain, that his title as owner, and consequent right to the possession, were wholly divested by the sale to Ropke; and as this sale was perfected before the trial, the only question is, whether the defendant could then avail himself of the defence which it created.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Rev. Statutes provided exactly for the case, by declaring \u201c that if the right or title of a plaintiff in ejectment expire after the commencement of the suit, but before trial, the verdict shall be returned according to the fact, and judgment shall be entered, that he recover his damages by reason of the withholding of the premises by the defendant to be assessed; and that as to the premises claimed, the defendant go thereof without day.\u201d (2 R. S. p. 308, \u00a7 31.) We are clearly of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>this is one of those general provisions which we are hound to apply to actions under the Code (Code, \u00a7 455), and that by its reasonable interpretation, it applies to all cases where the title upon which a plaintiff seeks to recover the' possession of real property, has from any cause ceased to exist before the trial. It would be a narrow construction to confine it to cases in which the title expires by its own limitation. As under the former practice, a \"defendant could avail himself of the defence which the provision furnishes without a plea <em>puis da/rrein continuance, </em>we do not think that a supplemental answer ought now to be required. When the defence would operate as a surprise, the judge would doubtless deem it proper to postpone the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A rule for judgment must be entered, in conformity to the statute. If the counsel shall have any difficulty in agreeing upon its terms, it will be settled by one of the judges at chambers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
