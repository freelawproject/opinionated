By the terms of the receipt given for the package, the defendants were not to be responsible for any loss or damage not arising from their own fraud or gross negligence, or that of their servants; and \u2022 it was proved that there was the same care in the transportation of all articles without regard .to their value.

That, when the package was so delivered, the agent of the defendants, at New Orleans, signed and delivered a receipt therefor, by which it was stipulated that the defendants should not be responsible for any loss or damage arising from the dangers of the sea, steam or river navigation, or from any cause whatever, unless the same should be proved to have occurred from the fraud or gross negligence of the defendants, their servants, or agents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">The complaint then averred that the defendants had transported the package to New York; that he, the plaintiff, had tendered to them a reasonable sum as a compensation for transporting it, and had demanded its delivery ; but that they had refused to deliver and still retained it: and then demanded judgment in the usual form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\">The defendants, in their answer, denied that the package containing the bonds was delivered to them, to be transported to New York, and there delivered to the plaintiff for <em>&amp; </em>reasonable consideration.

They then insisted that they were entitled to retain the possession of the bonds until this sum, amounting to $400, should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>paid, which they averred was no more than a reasonable and usual compensation for the transportation of similar packages.

The plaintiff had a right to the possession of the bonds in question, upon tendering to the defendants the sum of $20. 1. The evidence does not present any facts, from which the plaintiff can claim compensation for more than a common parcel. 2. It appears, from the receipt given by the defendants, that they were not responsible for any risk, excepting for their own fraud. 3. It also appears from defendants\u2019 receipt, that their charge, in this instance, was not for insurance. 4. It was also proved, that the defendants bestowed no more care on this than they would have given a common parcel. 5. The bonds were not valuable articles, but mere evidences of debt, the destruction of which would not have involved a loss of their nominal amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">II. There was no commercial or other usage which justified the plaintiff in charging, or obliged the defendant to pay $400 for the transportation of the package in question. 1. A usage, like that claimed by the defendant, must be so well settled and of so long continuance, as to raise a fair presumption that it was known to both contracting parties, and that their contract was made in reference to it <em>(Eager </em>v. <em>Atlas Insurance Co., </em>14 Pick. 143; <em>Rayney </em>v. Vernon, 9 Carrington &amp; P.). It must be so uniform and universal, that every one in the trade must be taken to know it <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>1 Carr &amp; Payne, 59; 3 Phil. Ev., Cowen <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2019s Notes, 1422; Story on Contracts, sec. 650, p. 5150, 2d Ed.). Neither of these requisites is supplied by the defendants\u2019 testimony. 2. The testimony of the defendants\u2019 witnesses was not competent to establish the existence of a usage. The witnesses, two in number, were in the defendants\u2019 employ, and had never had any other experience in the Express business. Their experience in the Express business did not exceed one year; and their knowledge as to trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>portation of bonds, is confined to one instance. \u2022 Evidence of a few instances is not sufficient to establish a usage (3 Chitty Com. Law, 45 ; 1 Marsh, 186). Usage must be proved by witnesses, who have had frequent and actual experience of the usage <em>(2 </em>Green\u2019s Ev. 208).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">III. The defendants\u2019 customary charge for transporting packages was not binding upon the plaintiff, it being in evidence that neither he nor his agent had had any prior dealings with defendants, and there being no evidence that the plaintiff knew, or had notice, that there was any customary charge. \u201c For whatever may have been the usage, it can have no effect on a contract unless adopted by the parties\u201d <em>(Eager </em>v. <em>Atlas Ins. Co., </em>14 Pick. 143; <em>Snowden </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>3 Rawle, p. 106). The usages of individuals cannot affect these contracts, unless it appear that the usage was known to the parties with whom they contracted <em>(Loring </em>v. <em>Gurney, </em>5 Pick. 16; <em>Garay </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>3 Barr. &amp; Cr. 793; <em>Laurence </em>v. <em>Stonington Bank, </em>6 Cowen R. 521; <em>Rusforth </em>v. Hadfield, 7 East. 225; <em>Kinkman </em>v. <em>Shadcross, </em>6 T. R. 4; 2 Phill. on Ev., p. 37; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>13 Lawson (N.S); Duer on Jus. vol. i., pp. 179,182, 193, 254, in Notes x. to xiii.; <em>Winstroop </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co., </em>2 Wash. C. C. R. 16; <em>Astor </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co., </em>7 Cowen, 202; <em>Syces </em>v. <em>Bridge, 2 </em>Doug. 527). There must be a general usage, or universal custom, brought home to the knowledge of the party defendant; or it must be the special course or habit of dealing with one of the parties, recognised and assented to by the other (Story on Contr., sec. 14; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Hickock &amp; Harris, </em>2 Wend. 501; <em>Child </em>v. <em>Sun Mutual Ins. Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">IV. The testimony of A. L. Stinson and W. McGill in relation to the usual rate of charge for valuable articles, was irrelevant, and ought to have been excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">V. The judge erred in his charge to the jury, because, 1. If there was a customary charge of one per cent, on valuable articles by the Express office, the plaintiff had no knowledge or notice of it, implied or direct, and is not bound by it. 2. If such a charge were proper for valuable articles, it could not be applied, to the transportation of Arkansas bonds, these having no intrinsic value, and being evidences of value merely. The plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the amount specified in the bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>would still remain, although the bonds were lost or destroyed. The plaintiff could not have recovered the stated or nominal value of such' bonds of the defendants, under any circumstances. Such bonds, therefore, are not valuable articles upon which the defendants can charge a per centage. 3. The plaintiff was not excluded from proving the actual value of said bonds by the amount stated in the receipt; there being no evidence of the manner, or by whom such statement was made, or that the plaintiff or his agent ever assented to it. 4. There was no evidence that any declaration whatever was made in New Orleans, by the plaintiff\u2019s agent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-7\"><em>G. F. Betts, </em>for the defendants, <em>contra.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-8\">I. The charge of the judge was correct, in leaving it to the jury, to determine what was the proper compensation (Chitty on Contracts, p. 547; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>De Tastel, </em>2 Stark. 295; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Flight, </em>5 Mees. <em>&amp; W. </em>114).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-10\">H. It was correctly submitted to the jury that if, from the evidence, they believed that the customary charge by express offices was one per cent, on valuable articles, from New Orleans to New York, they should find for the defendant to that amount <em>(Hinton </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>5 Hill, 437; <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>1 Seld. 155, 158.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-12\">III. The evidence as to the customary charge of Adams &amp; Co. was competent: 1. To show what was a reasonable or proper compensation ; that they only asked from the defendants what they asked from all their other customers. 2. It was not offered to prove a local usage of that house, nor was it so submitted to the jury by the court. 3. A general usage having been proved, this evidence could do no harm, being included in the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-14\">IV. The sum of $40,000, declared to the agent of Adams <em>&amp; </em>Co., at New Orleans,\" by Robb &amp; Co., marked on the trackages, and inserted in the receipt, was to be taken as the Robb &amp; Co. were plaintiff\u2019s agents (Letter from Tucker &amp; 'Xys Crapo). And their declaration and contract are binding on. J the plaintiff (Story, Agency, \u00a7 135). 2. This was me fiontraS\u00ed \u2019iiQOL'l between consignor and carrier (Endorsement on|eng^g&gt;e^ j ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Smith </em>v. <em>James, </em>7 Cowen, 328; <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>3 Sand. 7-13).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-5\">IV. If the' bonds had been actually purchased by plaintiff for $26,000, that was not evidence against the defendants. 1. It was <em>res inter alios acta. </em>2. The plaintiffs were estopped, by their admissions and contract, from showing the value to have been other than $40,000 <em>(Truscott </em>v. <em>Denis, </em>4 Barb. 498; Welland <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>8 Wend. 483).</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b488-6\">By the Court. Oakley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atl\">As no proof was given on the part of the defendants of the express agreement set up in their answer, they were entitled to demand no more than a reasonable compensation for the service which they performed. By the receipt which they gave for the package, they were exempt from the usual liability of common carriers as insurers. They were not responsible for any loss or damage, arising from any other cause than the fraud or gross negligence of themselves, their agents, or servants; and their witnesses proved, that the same care and diligence were bestowed in the transportation of all articles and packages intrusted to their charge, without reference to their value. It is not perceived, therefore, that there was any reason for enhancing the charge for transportation in proportion to the value of the articles transported, and, consequently, the charge which the defendants made, which even exceeds the usual rate of insurance from New Orleans to New York, was apparently unreasonable and extravagant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">We are not, however, to be understood as saying, that the charge made, unreasonable as it seems, may not be sanctioned by usage ; but, it is certain, no usage could justify the charge, unless its character were proved to be such, as to warrant the presumption that it was known to both parties, and that their contract was made in reference to its existence; in other words, that it was known to Robb &amp; Co., the agents of the plaintiff, when they delivered the package to the defendants, and that, by their silence at that time, they consented to be bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Had it been proved that there was a general, uniform, and notorious usage, justifying the charge made, by the defendants, the law would have imputed to the plaintiff and his agents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>knowledge of its existence, but there was no pretence for saying that any such evidence was given. If any usage was proved, it was that of the defendants alone. It was special and particular, not general; and such being its character, we deem it needless to cite authorities to show that, to render it binding on the plaintiff, his or his agent\u2019s actual knowledge of its existence and terms, was necessary to be proved. The evidence, even, of the existence of this limited usage was slight and unsatisfactory ; and there was none whatever from which a jury could be warranted to infer, that its existence was known to the plaintiff or to Robb &amp; Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The judge, however, upon the trial, charged the jury, that if they believed from the evidence, that the customary charge by Express offices was one per cent, on valuable articles from New Orleans to New York, they should find for the defendants to that amount, on the value of the package. We think that this charge was erroneous, and that, upon the evidence before the court, the question of usage ought not to have been submitted to the jury at all. We have, however, no right to say that it was not upon this evidence that their verdict was founded, and it must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The judgment set aside, and a new trial ordered ; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
