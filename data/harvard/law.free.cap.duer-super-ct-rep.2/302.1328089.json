B. Scoles, </em>for plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGq\">moved for judgment on the verdict, and insisted on the following points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-6\">I. The question, whether the evidence produced was sufficient to show a legal authority from the plaintiff to Belden, to accept the sum paid in full of the contract price, was a question of fact, and ought to have been submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">II. The plaintiff never gave. Belden authority to accept the sum paid, in full of the contract price. He himself says, \u201cPlaintiff never authorized me to make any deduction. I made the deduction myself, on my own responsibility, as I wanted to get the money. Defendants refused to pay the whole bill, and I deducted $90.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">III. There was no contract or agreement between plaintiff and the defendants, that Belden should make this deduction from the bill. Even if the testimony of Max Doctor be credible, the reasonable and legal interpretation of the conversation between plaintiff and defendants is, that he, the plaintiff, would be satisfied with whatever Belden should do in the shape of a deduction, provided the defendants had a legal right to any deduction from the contract price. The sale was made by Belden, who alone knew the terms and conditions of sale. The alleged conversation between the defendants and Belden upon this subject, contained in Doctor\u2019s testimony, is in harmony with this view\u2014if there was a contract or agreement between plaintiff and defendants, that Belden should make any deduction he pleased, whether the defendants had a legal right to it or not, it would be, without consideration, a <em>nud/wm pactmm, </em>and of no binding obligation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">IV. Had Belden been legally authorized by the plaintiff to accept a smaller sum than the contract price, in full payment of the contract price of the 'cattle, his acceptance of such smaller sum does not deprive the plaintiff of a right of action for the balance. . The payment of part is no satisfaction of the whole. There was no legal consideration for the deduction. The defendants had no legal claim to any deduction from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>contract price. The doctrine of <em>ca/oeat em/pior </em>applied to the bruised condition of the cattle. There was no warranty of soundness. There is no pretence of fraud. The payment made was not a good accord and satisfaction. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Brannan, </em>5 Johns. 269; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Minturn, </em>17 Johns. 169.) That the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies to the sale of the cattle, see Hilliard on the Law of Sales, 224; Fitzherbert\u2019s N. B., 94 c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-4\"><em>J. Cochrane, </em>for defendants,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYpx\">claimed that judgment should be entered in their favor, and argued as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-5\">I. The answer alleges, that in consideration of the damage suffered by the defendants, on account of the cattle having been bruised, the plaintiff agreed to settle, and did settle his claim at a less sum than he originally demanded. The evidence proves the allegation. This is no answer of an accord and satisfaction, but of an agreement between the parties to settle, and a settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">II. The insufficiency of a smaller sum to cancel a greater, pleaded in form, of an accord and satisfaction, proceeds on the ground of the palpable inadequacy of the less to the greater sum. <em>(Walkman </em>v. <em>Ingleby &amp; </em>Stoke, 5 John. R. 386, 391, and cases cited.) If, in addition, however, to the less sum paid, any other consideration is shown from which the court can see that a benefit could be derived to the plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction, that makes the payment of the smaller sum good as an accord and satisfaction. As, if the less sum be paid at a different place, or before the day agreed <em>(Walkman, </em>v. <em>Ingleby, </em>supra; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>5 East\u2019s R. 230). \u00bbIf the amount is disputed, the acceptance of a sum smaller than the demand, is a good accord and satisfaction <em>(Palmerton </em>v. <em>Huxford, </em>4 Denio, 166). The answer and the evidence in this case both show that the amount was disputed, and that in consideration of the cattle having been bruised, $89 were thrown off in settlement.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-7\">Br the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ays\">We are all of opinion that upon the facts found by the jury, the defendants are entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Admitting that the cattle were not sold under a warranty, express or implied, as to their soundness, and that the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ants had, therefore, no legal right to claim a deduction from the stipulated price; the deduction was, however, just and equitable in itself, and its equity is a sufficient consideration for its allowance. It is sufficient to exempt the case from the general rule, that the payment of a less sum than the amount of the debt is not a good accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">But it is not alone upon this ground that we place our decision. We apprehend that it is settled law, that when the claim of a creditor is disputed in good faith, and in order to settle the dispute he consents to abate a portion of his demand, the settlement, as a compromise, is valid and binding. Nor will the court inquire in such cases, whether he was legally bound to make the sacrifice. We deem it needless to refer to cases to show that such, is the rule.- It is sufficient to say that it was the ground of the decision of this court in <em>Currie </em>v. Steele, 2 Sand. S. C. R., p. 542. There is no reason here to question the good faith of the defendants. They doubtless believed that they were entitled to the deduction which they claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The only question that remains is, whether the agent, Belden, had authority to make the deduction. It is said that this question ought to have been submitted to the jury. As we read the case, it was submitted to the jury, and their finding, if there was any evidence to support it, is conclusive. The testimony of the witness, Doctor, was sufficient to support it; and supposing him to have been contradicted by Belden, whether he or Belden was to be believed, it was for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">But, in truth, it was not necessary that the question of the agent\u2019s authority should have been submitted to the jury at all. TTis authority resulted from the nature of his agency; he had a general authority to sell and collect the price. The amount to be paid rested, therefore, in his discretion, and he exercised this discretion in making the settlement which he did. The sum paid to him he consented to receive as the full price to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">As the facts in this case have been specially found by the jury, the Code makes it our duty to render such a judgment as the finding warrants (\u00a7 262). The verdict for the plaintiff must, therefore, be set aside, and a verdict and judgment thereon with costs, be entered for the defendants. They ought not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>by amere dismissal of the complaint, to be subjected to the risk of a second'action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
