The action was against the defendant, as the first endorser of a promissory note for $2,045/T5T, purporting to have been made by Messrs. McIntosh <em>&amp; </em>Co., payable to his order. It was defended on the ground that the endorsement was forged. On the trial, which took place before Mr. Justice Sandford, and a jury, in May, 1852, many exceptions were taken to the ruling of the judge, which it is deemed unnecessary to state, as the decision of the court in granting a new trial, proceeded on the single ground that the testimony of a particular witness, who was offered to be examined on the part of the defendant, had been improperly rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-11\">The statement in the case, in relation to this witness, is as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">The defendant\u2019s counsel called as a witness,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-13\">\n<em>John Mansfield,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ams\">who was duly sworn, whereupon the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the witness as incompetent, on the ground of interest, and in support read the following papers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-14\">\u201c For value received, I hereby guarantee to Mr. William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Kobbe the punctual payment, at maturity, of a note of Thomas McIntosh <em>&amp; </em>Co., drawn in favor of John McIntosh, and'by him endorsed, dated Hov. 13th, 1850, on six months, and due on the 13th and 16th of May next, for thirteen hundred and thirty-seven -//\u00f3 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">\u201c And another note, dated Hov. 14th, 1850, at six months, drawn by the said Thomas McIntosh &amp; Co., in favor of John McIntosh, and by him endorsed, due the 17th of May next, for two thousand and forty-five <em>r\\\\ </em>dollars, in such a manner its if the same notes were endorsed by me.

Duer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">The witness, Mansfield, had certainly a direct interest in the event of the suit, since it was manifestly the understanding of the parties that he was not to be liable at all upon his guaranty, unless the endorsement of the defendant was proved to be genuine; but, although thus interested, he was not a person for whose immediate benefit the action was defended, within the meaning of the Code (\u00a7 399), according to that interpretation of its meaning which we have heretofore adopted <em>(Catlin </em>v. Hansen, 1 Duer, S. C. Rep. p. 319). His interest, therefore, was not a ground of exclusion. He was not a <em>cestui que </em>trust, nor had he given an indemnity to the defendant, thus making himself the real and sole party in interest. The suit was prosecuted with the intent that the judgment, should a judgment be obtained, should be enforced against the defendant, and it was defended by him, not at the request of, nor for the benefit of Mansfield, but upon his own account, and with a sole view to his own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The case would be wholly different were it understood that the moneys deposited by Mansfield and Robinson shall be applied to the satisfaction of a judgment against the defendant, so as to exonerate him entirely from its payment; upon this supposition the action would be defended for their immediate benefit, and their benefit alone. But such is evidently not the meaning of the agreement between them and the plaintiffs. The intention of the parties, we cannot doubt, is that if a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ment shall be obtained against the defendant, Mansfield and Robinson shall succeed to the rights of the plaintiffs, and be entitled to enforce the judgment for their own reimbursement. Had they paid the note as guarantors, without requesting this action to be commenced against the defendant, as endorser, they might have justly claimed a transfer of the note, so as to have enabled them to compel its payment by the defendant. To save themselves from a suit upon their guaranty, and from the necessity of commencing an action in their own name against the defendant, they entered into the agreement with the plaintiffs, but there is no reason to suppose that they meant to deprive themselves of the right of ultimately resorting, for their own protection, to the liability of the defendant; and it would be unreasonable to give this construction to their agreement. Upon the other questions, that were so ably discussed upon the hearing, we are not fully agreed, and therefore decline to express any opinion in relation to them, but we all agree, for the reasons that have been given, that the testimony of Mansfield ought to have been received. He was interested, but not incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">There must, therefore, be a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
