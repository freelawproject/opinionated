The covenant respecting the party wall was a real covenant, running with the land\u2014because, 1. There was a privity of estate between the covenantor and his grantee. \u00a3. The .covenant related to and was made for the benefit of the land. 3. It was the intention of the parties to the deed containing the covenant' to make it a covenant running with the land. <em>(Spencer's Case, </em>3 Coke, 66. <em>Law Library, </em>27 vol., N. S. page 75 and notes. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Culver, 3 </em>Denio, 297 and 298. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>17 Wendell, 136. <em>Vivian </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>1 B. and C. 410. S. C., L.

The covenant amounted to a grant of an easement which was rendered appurtenant to the lands of the covenantor and Ms grantee. Such clearly was the intention of the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the deed\u2014because, 1. The land upon which the party wall was to be erected was granted and set apart by the covenantor and his grantee as and for a party wall between the property. 2. One half of the wall was to be erected on each lot, and the wall thus to be erected remained the sole property of Hanrahan, or his assigns, until Peck or his assigns used the wall and paid therefor a certain sum, to be ascertained. The wall then became the joint property of the owners of the contiguous lots. (See <em>Mott </em>v. Hawkins, 5 Taunton, 20. <em>Sherred </em>v. <em>Cisco, </em>4 Sandford\u2019s Law Reports, 481.) 3. The conveyance of either lot carried with it, as an incident, the wall or the rights which the party had in and to the wall under the covenant. The burdens and benefits of the covenant were cast upon the respective owners of the lots. 4. If Hanrahan had conveyed to the intestate before building the wall, she would have had a right to build the wall under the covenant, and upon Peck\u2019s afterwards using the wall built by her he would be liable to pay one half of the expense of such wall. 5. If Peck or his grantee had or at any time should extend the wall ten feet further, the intestate, or her heir\u2014devisee or grantee, would, on using such extended wall, be bound to pay one half of the expense thereof. 6. The covenant is in substance and effect, that Peck, whenever the wall shall be used either by him or his assigns, will pay therefor, to the owner of the contiguous lot, at the time of such use. Y. When Hanrahan used the wall, he not only used the part that was upon his own lot, but the part that was on the lot of the intestate. (See Laws of 1830, pages 349 and 350, \u00a7 2, \u00a7 4. Laws of <em>1831, </em>page 392, \u00a7 1.) 8. Ho person is named in the covenant, as the party to whom the payment for the wall is to be made, and in such a case it is a \"well settled principle that the stipulation will be enforced in equity, in favor of the party for whose benefit it is intended, or who is the party legally or equitably entitled, though he be a stranger to the undertaking. 9. The intestate is the person for whose benefit the covenant was made, she being the owner of the lot 69 Third Street, and the easement attached thereto, in lot Y1 Third Street, at the time of the use of the wall. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>3 Denio, 297 and 298. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>17 Wendell, 136. <em>Hills v.

The conveyance of lot 71 Third street, by Peck to Hanrahan, did not discharge Peck from liability on his covenant, to pay for the party wall whenever it was used either by him or his grantee. It is like the case of a lessee and his assignee ; both are liable, one on his express covenant, and the other by reason of his privity of estate. (Taylor\u2019s Landlord and Tenant, pp. 212 and 213.) The assignee may discharge himself from liability, by transferring his interest in the lease, but not the lessee; he always remains liable. <em>(Ibid.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\"><em>IV. </em>The plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants, the-value of one half of the party wall built by Hanrahan, and on the lots 69 and 71 Third street, at the time of the conveyance by Hanrahan and wife, to the intestate\u2014because, 1. The covenant itself cast the burden of paying for the wall, when used by Peck or his assigns. 2. The intestate was the owner of the lot and wall at the time the wall was used by Hanrahan, and neither Peck nor his assignee who used the wall, had then any interest in the lot or wall, and payment was not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>made until the wall was used. 3. \u2018The intestate was, in fact and in law, the assignee of Hanrahan of the lot to be conveyed, and the entire wall. By the deed to her, all the right, title, interest, and claim of Hanrahan to the lot, house, and wall, passed. An easement appurtenant to the land passes with the land, though the deed neither mentions the easement, nor privileges and appurtenances generally, unless it be expressly reserved in the deed, or by another made at the same time. (2 Hillard\u2019s Abridgment, 119 and 349; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 433; <em>Pattison </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>7 Cowen, 747.) 4. The privilege to use the land of the testator, for the building of the party wall, given in the deed to Hanrahan, operated as a grant of the use of six inches of the land of the testator for that purpose, and that privilege beyond all doubt was one running with the land, and passed to the intestate by the deed to her. 5. That part of the covenant being one running with the land, the whole of it is, as the covenant cannot be broken into fragments, and part be a real covenant, and part a personal one. 6. When Hanrahan conveyed to the intestate it was an unbroken covenant respecting the land, and something to be done concerning it, to wit, the using of the wall and paying for one half of it at the time of using, and the covenant not only related to so much of the wall as was built on the lot of either owner, but each had an interest in the entire wall and the land it covered. <em>(Weyman's Ex'rs </em>v. <em>Ringold, </em>1 Bradford, 60, 61; <em>Matts </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>5 Taunton, 20; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Mezier, </em>4 John. C. R. 337, 6 do. 21.) 7. That assigns are not named in the covenant makes no difference; the deed to the intestate passed to her all the equitable interest that Hanrahan had under the covenant, whether the covenant runs with the land or not, and gave her a right of action in her own name since the Code. (Code of 1851, \u00a7 111; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>8 Cowen, 266; 4 Kent, 159; <em>White </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>3 Metcalf, 81; Platt on Covenants, 481; 3 Law Library, 315; Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, 89.) 8. Although assigns are not named in the covenant, they are necessarily implied; the land is granted to Hanrahan, his heirs and assigns for ever, and by reference to the grant of the land the assigns of the grantee are clearly named. 9. The grant of the land being to Hanrahan, his heirs and assigns, the deed may read thus, the parties of\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the first part grant and convey to the party of the second part, his heirs, and assigns, for ever, all that certain piece of land, &amp;c., with the privilege, &amp;c.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-4\">Y. The judgment in favor of the defendant is clearly erroneous, and should be reversed with costs, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff for the amount claimed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-6\"><em>H. </em>Holden, Counsel for respondents,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFHb\">made and argued the following points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">I. The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-8\">H. There is no covenant on the part of Peck, the testator, running with the land, by which Mrs. Burlock acquired any right \"whatever. The covenant related to a thing not <em>in esse, </em>but to be done upon the land, and Hanrahan\u2019s assigns- are not named. <em>(Tullman </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>4 Comstock, 134; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>8 Cowen, 266; <em>Allen &amp; Paxson </em>v. <em>Culver, </em>3 Denio, 284-296; <em>Weyman\u2019s Ex'rs </em>v. <em>Ringold, </em>1 Bradford, 40.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-9\">IH. The deed to Mrs. Burlock describes the land only, by metes and bounds, no reference is made to a party wall, nor is' a dwelling-house named. Mrs. Burlock took, and her heir holds, all that she purchased or intended to purchase. Whatever rights. Hanrahan had, and which he did not convey expressly, he reserved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-10\">IY. In pursuance of the agreement between Peck and Hanrahan, which was personal in its character, Peck actually paid Hanrahan for the party wall by conveying the adjoining lot to Hanrahan, which Hanrahan immediately improved\u2014allowance was then made to Hanrahan for the party wall, and if the plaintiff now succeeds, the effect will be to compel Peck and his representatives to pay for the whole wall instead of half.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-11\">Y. Each owner owns, in severalty, the portion of the wall situated on his own land\u2014with no qualification except that neither has a right to pull it down without the other\u2019s consent. <em>(Sherred </em>v. <em>Cisco, </em>4 Sandford, 480.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-12\">YT. If the agreement set out in the complaint is a covenant running with the land, then Hanrahan (Peck\u2019s grantee) should pay for it; Peck never used the wall. The same Hanrahan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>who was the grantee of Burloek, purchased of Peck the adjoining lot, No. 71, and was the first to use the wall by building on No. 71.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b105-5\">By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">The conveyance by Hanrahan to Mrs. Burloek of lot 69, in March, 1840, transferred to her the title to the whole of the party-wall standing on the easterly line of the lot. Six inches of its width had been lawfully erected on lot 71. The right and privilege to so erect it, were given by the deed of 1839 from Peck to Hanrahan. Until Peck or his grantee of lot 71, built on the latter lot, and used the party-wall, the wall was the sole property of Mrs. Burloek, from the time lot 69 was conveyed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Nothing had been paid for'the party-wall up to the time she became the owner of lot 69. The party-wall was not used by any owner of lot 71, until over seven years after she became the absolute and exclusive owner of lot 69, and of the building erected thereon with its appurtenances, and of every claim and demand of her grantors of, in, and to the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">When Hanrahan built on lot 71, and used the party-wall of the building, belonging to plaintiff\u2019s intestate, he appropriated to his own use her property. It was lawful for him to so appropriate it. But when it was so used she had a right to be paid one half of its value. If Peck wag liable under his covenant to pay half of its value, she was entitled to the payment, for the reason that the property which had been taken and used was hers. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Pentz </em>(decided by the Court of Appeals), N. Y. Legal Observer, vol. i., p. 24; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>1 Sum. R. 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Mrs. Burloek bought and paid for a lot with a dwelling-house on it, having half of one of its walls rightfully on an adjoining lot belonging to Peck, which party-wall he or his grantees had a right to use, but with respect to which he covenanted to pay half of its value when used. When it was used Mrs. Burloek owned it, and she was equitably entitled to the money. The sale and conveyance of property subject to a certain use on payment of a stipulated consideration, carries with it the right to receive such consideration, when the stipulated use shall be made of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>We have not overlooked the numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which hold that the claim to compensation for the use of a party-wall is personal to the first builder, is a mere chose in action, is not a lien on the land, will not pass to a grantee of the building of which it is a part by a conveyance of the lot and building with its appurtenances, and is only a personal charge against the builder of the second house. <em>(White </em>v. Snyder, 2 Miles, 395; <em>Oat </em>v. Middleton, id. 248; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Kucher, </em>5 S. <em>&amp; </em>R., 1 Dallas, 341. <em>Ingles </em>v. <em>Bringhurst, </em>10 Barr. 219; <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>10 id. 155. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Stokes.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">These cases either arqse under the statute of that State of the 24th of February, 1721, or were decided on the authority of cases thus arising. That statute provides that, <em>\u201c </em>the first builder shall be reimbursed for one moiety of the charge of the party-wall, or for so much as the next builder shall use before he breaks into the wall.\u201d <em>(Davids </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>9 Barr. 503.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We are unable to perceive any substantial difference between this case, and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Pentz, </em>and on the authority of the latter the plaintiff is entitled to revover, unless the objection is well taken, that the action should have been brought by the heirs instead of the administrator of Hrs. Burlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">When this party-wall was used, her right of action to recover half of its value became perfect and absolute. This was in her life-time. The title to the half of the wall standing on 71, on, and after the time it was used by the owner of lot 71, was vested absolutely in him; and the owner of each lot, besides owning in fee the part standing on his lot, has, and from that time had, an easement in the other part for the support of his own house. The title to nothing for which Peck was to' pay, descended to the heirs of Hrs. Burlock. It would seem to be as clear that the administrator should recover for the half of the wall, as for the unpaid consideration money of land sold and conveyed by an intestate in his life-time. <em>(Hamilton </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>4 J. R. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">We think the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and judgment entered for the plaintiff, but with liberty to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer, and'answer in 20 days on payment of the plaintiff\u2019s costs upon the demurrer and of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
