It was proved, on the part of the plaintiff, that the child mentioned in the complaint had been run over by a railroad car belonging to the defendants, and severely injured, in the month of June, 1849, and that the plaintiff, as a physician and surgeon, had attended the child, and performed the services stated in the complaint. One of the witnesses testified that Sloat, who represented himself to be an agent of the defendants, said, that \u201c he wished the child t\u00f3 have a first-rate physician, and would see that it should all be right.\u201d Another, that Sloat told him (the witness) to <em>\u201c </em>have the best medical attendance for the child, and that the company would be responsible for the payment;\u201d and that Sloat made afterwards, through an interpreter, the same statement to the father of the child. A third witness swore substantially to the same facts, and that the father had employed the plaintiff. There was no proof that Sloat had made any direct communication to the plaintiff, or that the latter had any knowledge of the assurances which Sloat had given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">Sloat was then examined as a witness, on the part of the plaintiff, and testified as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">\u201c I am one of the officers of the Harlem Railroad Company, and have been in the employ of the company as such, for nearly three years. The title of my office is superintendent. I have a general supervisory control over the whole line of the railroad, from New York to Dover Plains. The advertisements in the newspapers, with regard to the starting of the cars, their stoppage, times of arrival and departure, and general arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ments, are all signed <em>by </em>me, <em>\u2018 </em>M. Sloat, Superintendentthe large placards, giving these particulars, relative to the motive power, posted up in the cars, and at the station-houses along the road, are also signed in the same maimer; everything connected with the running of the road is under my supervision and control. I wish to say that I have no direction over the treasury. I go up and down on the road, between the City Hall and Dover Plains, very often, in the discharge of my duties, as superintendent, I am on the track, in the discharge of my duties, more or less every day. My office is at the corner of 4th Avenue and 27th street. I do not go up and down the track at any stated times, but as my duties call me, sometimes a greater distance, sometimes a less. I have been in the habit of going up and down as superintendent, between here and Dover Plains, during the last three years. I suppose I am pretty well known along the line, as superintendent. I pay money to drivers, conductors, and other persons employed by me, for the company, connected with my business, as superintendent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-4\">On being cross-examined, he said: \u201c I have no share in the direction of the company\u2019s affairs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-5\">The counsel for the plaintiff here rested, and the counsel for the defendants moved the court for a nonsuit, upon the following grounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-6\">I. That there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that the superintendent, Sloat, was authorized by the defendants, as their agent, to employ the plaintiff for the services performed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-7\">H. That there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that the plaintiff had been employed by the said Sloat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-8\">His honor the judge, thereupon ruled in favor of the grounds taken by the counsel for said defendants, and directed a nonsuit to be entered against the said plaintiff; to which ruling and decision, the counsel for the said plaintiff then and there excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-9\"><em>W. A. Butler, </em>for plaintiff and appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>It is insisted on the part of the appellant that the court erred in taking the case from the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-5\">I. The question was not whether the agent and superintendent, Sloat, was authorized by the defendants to employ the plaintiff to perform the services rendered, but whether plaintiff had a right, under all the circumstances, to infer or suppose that he possessed such authority, judging from his own acts and those of his principals. <em>(Perkins </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. Co., </em>4 Cowen, 645, 660; <em>Lightbody </em>v. <em>N. A. Ins. Co., </em>23 Wendell, 18; <em>Johnson </em>v. Jones, 4 Barbour, 369.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-6\">II. There was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the superintendent, Sloat, was authorized on the part of the defendants to employ the plaintiff; such employment was within the scope of the authority of Sloat, as agent and <em>swperimtendent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-7\">III. Even if out of the scope of his ordinary duties or .authority, the <em>emergency of the case </em>and the benefit resulting to the defendants from the employment, justified the act of Sloat in employing the plaintiff, and having been done in good faith, it is binding on the defendants. (Story on Agency, \u00a7141.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-8\">IV. There was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in finding that the plaintiff was employed by Sloat. 1. The promise to pay for medical assistance, though not made directly to plaintiff, was clearly intended for his benefit, and contemplated the performance of the service by him. 2. The promise to pay such surgeon as might perform the service, is good, and enures to the benefit of him who performs it. <em>(Barker </em>v. <em>Bucklin, </em>2 Denio, 45, 51, and cases there cited.) It is analogous to the offer of a reward, which has always been held to entitle the party who brings himself within the terms of the offer, to maintain an action. (<em>Williams </em>v. <em>Carwardine, </em>5 C. &amp; P. 566; S. C. 4 B. &amp; A. 621; <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>4 M. &amp; W. 16; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>7 Met. 411; <em>Wentworth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>3 Met. 352; <em>Fallick </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>1 M. &amp; S. 108.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b353-10\">V. A new trial should be granted, costs to abide the ' event.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-11\"><em>C. W. Sandford, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>I. The pleadings distinctly put in issue, the authority of the superintendent, Sloat, to employ a surgeon; but no evidence was given of any such authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">EL The evidence showed that Sloat was employed <em>merel/y </em>as <em>supermtendmt of the moime power, or mmivng of the rail/road. </em>That he had nothing to do with its finances, and no share in the direction of the company\u2019s affairs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">III. Acts of agents beyond their powers, are not binding on a corporation or individuals. <em>(Munn </em>v. <em>Commission Company, 15 </em>Johnson, 44; Angel &amp; Ames on Corp. 172, 3, 4; <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>18 Johnson, 363; Hartford <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>3 Day, 493; <em>Dispatch Line </em>v. <em>Bellamy Manuf Co., </em>12 New Hampshire, 205; <em>Ready </em>v. <em>Tuscaloosa, </em>6 Alabama, 327; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Manuf. Co., </em>9 New Hampshire, 51; <em>Farmers' Bank v. McKee, </em>2 Barr, 318; <em>Boom </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>2 Barbour S. C. R. 104; <em>Mann </em>v. Currie, id. 294; <em>Johnson v. Bush, </em>3 Barbour\u2019s Ch\u2019y Reports, 207; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Appleby, 1 </em>Sandford\u2019s Sup. Ct. 158; <em>Hone </em>v. <em>Allen, 1 </em>id. 171, Note.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-7\">IV. The nonsuit was properly entered.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b354-8\">By the Court. Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoT\">At the conclusion of the testimony a nonsuit was moved on two grounds. The case states, the judge <em>\u201c </em>ruled in favor of the grounds taken by the counsel for said defendants, and directed a nonsuit to be entered against the plaintiff, to which ruling and decision the counsel for the plaintiff then and there excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">If either ground was sufficient to justify the nonsuit, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">A nonsuit was moved on the ground, 1st\u2014\u201c That there was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, that the superintendent, Sloat, was authorized by the defendants, as their agent, to employ the plaintiff for the services performed by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The answer denies that the defendants ever did, at any time, authorize the said Sloat to employ any person or persons, as physician, or otherwise, to render services to said Peter Peteniat, as alleged in said complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-12\">The title of the office held by Sloat is \u201c Superintendent.\u201d The only evidence of the nature and extent of his powers is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>such as the title of his office implies, and that furnished by his own testimony. There is no evidence, that he ever made any other contract of a like character.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">He testified that everything connected \u201c with the running of the road\u201d was under his supervision and control. That he had no direction over the treasury, and had no share in the direction of the company\u2019s affairs. He pays money to drivers, conductors, and other persons employed by him for the company, connected with his business as superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The only inference deducible from his description of his powers is, that they relate solely to making provision that trains are run as prescribed by the company, that means and men are supplied for the purpose, and other things are provided, which are essential or proper to effectuate this general result. His description of his powers, or of the business which he transacts, does not justify the inference that he is authorized, by his office, to arrange and liquidate claims made against the company for the negligence of its servants in running its trains, or to contract with third persons, as its agent, to repair or remedy the consequences of such negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">There is nothing in the evidence to justify the application of the principle that whether authorized or not, yet the plaintiff had a right to infer and act on the inference, that judged by his own acts <em>and those of his principal, </em>he possessed such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">This case differs, in its essential facts, from that of <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Washington Ins. </em>Co., 4 Cowen, 645. In this case, there is no evidence that the superintendent was ever authorized to employ, as agent of the company, in any event, or upon any contingency, a physician to attend upon persons injured by the running of the company\u2019s cars, or that they ever ratified, or knew of any such contract made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">In <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>The Washington Ins. Co., </em>Russell, who advertised himself as the agent of the company for the city of Savannah, was authorized to agree to make insurances, to receive and remit the premiums, and if the company actually received the money, and the rates charged were such as they had prescribed, and the terms of the agreement corresponded with their regulations, they agreed to furnish a policy which should be operative from the time of the payment of the premium to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Russell. Prior to the transaction between himself and Perkins, he had agreed to insure for a number of individuals, had received the premiums and transmitted them to the defendants, and in every instance except one, the company had issued policies bearing date at the time the receipt was given by Russell for the insurance. Perkins had paid to Russell the highest rate of insurance, had tendered the amount to the company, and there was no ground on which they could exempt themselves from giving a policy, except the arbitrary one, that they did not choose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In <em>Lightbody </em>v. <em>The North American Insurance </em>Company, 23 Wend. 18, <em>Wayner </em>was expressly authorized to <em>unsure. </em>He was furnished with blank policies executed by the officers of the company, really to be delivered to anyone who might wish to contract, after his name, the subject insured, the extent of the risk, and the date of the transaction, had been inserted in the contract. As to all persons, ignorant that his appointment restricted him in the exercise of his agency to a specific locality, . he was a general agent, with unlimited authority. \u2022 The plaintiff had no notice that he was restricted in the exercise of his powers to a defined territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In the case at bar, there is no eyidence that Sloat was ever authorized to make, on any contingency, such a contract as the plaintiff alleges was made with him, or that, with the exception of this instance, he ever made such a contract, or represented himself authorized to make one of such a character.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">It is urged that the emergency of the case and the benefit resulting to the defendants from the employment, justified the act of Sloan in employing the plaintiff, and that having been done in good faith it is binding on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">We cannot assent to this proposition. Ho emergency arose, which but for this employment would have interrupted or prevented the running of defendants\u2019 cars. If the injury was not caused by the negligence of its servants, contracting to pay for expenses to which they could not be subjected by law, would be no benefit to the company. If caused by such negligence this employment would not exonerate them from any liability, which would otherwise have attached. The principle sought to be invoked has no application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>We are of the opinion, that the nonsuit was properly granted on the first ground on which it was moved, and that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
