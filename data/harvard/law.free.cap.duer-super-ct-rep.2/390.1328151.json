And these defendants aver, that, after said iron was removed, as aforesaid, the same was delivered to said plaintiff, upon the payment by said plaintiff of the necessary expenses and charges, as is provided by the ordinances aforesaid; and these defendants further aver, that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>have proceeded herein, in all respects, according to law and. the ordinances aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\">And these defendants further aver, that, on or about the first day\u2019 of September last, a great quantity of iron was deposited upon the pier, number 37, North Eiver, in the city of New York, said pier being a public highway. That the said iron was permitted by the owner thereof, to remain on said pier for a long space of time, encumbering said pier, and obstructing the passage way on said pier, where vessels are constantly loading and unloading, and where carts are constantly passing and re-passing, and so hindered those who had business with said carts, and vessels, and the public way, that the said iron, placed as aforesaid, became a common nuisance, and it became the right and duty of said defendants to abate said nuisance, and they did thereupon remove said iron to a safe, suitable, and convenient place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">And these defendants aver, that the acts hereinbefore recited, are the same complained of by said plaintiff in said complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">The cause was tried before the Chief Justice and a jury, on the 28th April, 1853.

The court erred in denying the motion made by defendants\u2019 counsel to dismiss the complaint. 1. The plaintiff brings this action for damages, which he alleges he has sustained by reason of the illegal, wrongful, and malicious taking and detention of personal property belonging to him. This allegation was material, and was controverted by the defendants\u2019 answer, and it was therefore incumbent upon the plaintiff to prove it (Code of Procedure, sec. 168). 2. Ko sufficient proof of ownership was offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">H. In an action for trespass <em>de bonis </em>asportatis, which this resembles, the gist was the possession, actual or constructive, of the plaintiff, at the time; and he must have had, at least, the right to reduce the goods to possession when he pleased <em>(Smith </em>v. Milles, 1 Term Rep. 475-80; <em>Ward </em>v. Macauley, 4 Term Rep. 489; <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Wiley, </em>8 John Rep. 432). 1. The plaintiff, in this case, had neither actual nor constructive possession. 2. He had parted with his right to the possession, by the sale of the iron on the day in question, to the witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Benjamin, who had a regular memorandum of the sale, giving him an immediate right to the possession. 3. The rule of law is, that a contract for the sale of goods, where nothing remains to be done by the seller, before making delivery, transfers the right of property, although the price has not been paid, nor the thing delivered <em>(Olyphant </em>v. Baker, 5 Denio, 379). 4. In this case, there was no act to be done, on the part of the plaintiff, to consummate the bargain, as regarded the passing of the property\u2014and as the memorandum of sale gave an immediate right of possession to the vendee, both property and possession were out of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">III. The judge erred, in charging the jury, that the defendants had no right to remove the iron before the time fixed in their notice. 1. .The ordinance under which the defendants ordered the iron in question to be removed, made it their duty to have the same removed, if it was not removed by the owner, within twenty-four hours after the order had been given for its removal. Provided, then, the notice was actually posted up for twenty-four hours before the removal was commenced by the defendants, the owner cannot complain, and the defendants but discharged their duty. 2. The notice was up in a conspicuous place on the pier, between eight and nine in the morning of the 2d September (see testimony of Wilkins) ; at nine on the 3d, the defendant, Moneypenny, commenced carting the iron away. More than twenty-four hours had therefore elapsed, from the time of giving the order, till the time of removal. 3. The defendants were authorized to remove the iron, under their notice of 1st September. 4. The defendants can be bound by the notice of 2nd September, only on the ground of estoppel. But the doctrine of estoppel does not apply. The defendants owed no duty to the plaintiff\u2014entered into no contract with him, nor does it appear that the plaintiff relied or acted upon the faith of the notice. He had made no preparation to remove the iron, and clearly was not aware of the notice\u2014so far as appears, it was first seen by the purchaser, Benjamin, at 2 o\u2019clock on 3rd September. There can be no intendment in favor of the' plaintiff, because he was violating the law, nor against the defendants, because they were acting in discharge of their duty (Cow. <em>&amp; </em>Hill\u2014Phillips on Evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>3, 367, 375; <em>Welland Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Hathawa, </em>1 Greenleaf, secs. 207, 209).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">IV. The offer made by the defendants, to prove that the iron was a nuisance in the public way, should have been accepted. 1. Because, if a public nuisance, any individual had a right to abate the same, and he need not aver any special damage to himself (3 Blackstone\u2019s Com. p. 4 <em>&amp; </em>5, N. Y. Chitty\u2019s Edition; <em>James </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>Cro. Charles, p. 184; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>4 Term R. p. 364; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Mayor of Albany, </em>9 Wend. p. 589, 90, Opinion of Sutherland, J.). 2. Admitting that the doctrine is, that no one but a party aggrieved can remove a public nuisance, the defendants had a right to make the removal. They were the agents of the Corporation of the City of New York, who were the parties aggrieved, and to whom the right to remove nuisances belongs, as an incident to their control and supervisory power over the streets, wharves, and piers of said city.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>F. R. Sherman, contra, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">I. The motion for a nonsuit was properly denied\u2014as there was abundant evidence that plaintiff was owner of the iron.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">II. Whether the iron was a nuisance or not was immaterial, for if it was, defendants had no right to remove it to the public yard, without a notice, or order given, as directed by the ordinance (14 Wend. 122).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-9\">M. The defendants had no right to remove the iron, on or before the 3rd of September, because their notice or order was a stipulation not to do so, and upon this stipulation the plaintiff acted. A different construction would be a fraud on the plaintiffs (Cowen &amp; Hull\u2019s Hotes, 200, 202, and authorities there cited; <em>Kingsley </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>4 Sand. Sup. C. R. 364).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-10\">IV. There should be judgment for the plaintiffs, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-11\">By the Court. Emmet, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">The clear justice of this case is with the plaintiff, and we should have regretted had we been forced, upon technical grounds, to disturb the verdict; but we are entirely satisfied that the objections that have been urged, have as little support from authority, as from reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The sale to the witness, Benjamin, did not divest the title of the plaintiff, so as to deprive him of the right, as owner, to maintain this action. There was no actual or constructive delivery of the possession of the iron, for the evidence shows that nearly all of it had been removed before Benjamin presented the order which the plaintiff had given him, and, until this order was delivered and executed, it was certainly not the intention of the parties that the sale should be consummated. It was certainly not their intention that Benjamin should be bound by the contract, unless the order should be complied with. It is true that, in many cases, a contract for the sale of goods, operates, without an actual delivery, as an immediate transfer of the title and of the possession, but it will be found upon examination, that all these are cases in which the actual possession, which, by construction of law, vested in the purchaser, remained, with his consent, in the vendor or his agents,\u2014they have, therefore, no application to the case before us. Here the iron was the sole property of the plaintiff1 when the defendants began to take it away, and it was to him alone that they could be responsible for their wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">That the conduct of the defendants in removing the iron at the time, and in the manner they did, was wrongful, and rendered them liable as trespassers, we cannot doubt. The ordinance of the corporation under which the defendant, White, as superintendent of the streets, professed to act, allows to the owner of any article or thing which, as an encumbrance or obstruction, is ordered to be removed, twenty-four hours after the order is given for making the removal; and, until this time has elapsed, and the removal has not been made, the superintendent has no further power to act. Until then, his removal of the property is unauthorized and illegal. There is no evidence before us that any other order was given by the defendants than that contained in the written notice posted up on the wharf, and bearing date on the 2d September, and admitting this notice to be equivalent to the order which the ordinance requires, (which may well be doubted,) by its fair construction, it gave to the owner of the iron the whole of the next day to make the removal; on the morning, however, of the next day, the defendants began the removal, and completed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>it early in the afternoon, and, by thus acting, they violated the terms of their own order, an d lost wholly the protection of the ordinance, which, they professed to execute.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The defendants cannot be excused on the ground that the iron, as an obstruction on the wharf, was a public nuisance, which, as private citizens, they had a right to remove, and we think the Chief Justice was entirely right in excluding this defence. They were acting, not as private citizens, but as public officers, and, as such, they were bound to act in conformity to the terms of the ordinance of the corporation, and of the notice which they had given. Every unnecessary obstruction on a public wharf is a nuisance, and it is only upon the ground that it is so, that its removal can justly be ordered ; but it is not to be supposed that, when the superintendent of the streets has made an order for the removal of the property within a limited time, not less than that allowed by the ordinance, he can ship him sell of his official character, and at once abate the nuisance, as a private citizen. Such a constructian would make the ordinance a dead letter, and an order given in pursuance of it a trap and a fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. It was also justly observed by the counsel for the plaintiff that, admitting that the iron in its actual situation was a nuisance, which, as such, the defendants might have been justified in removing, they certainly had no right to transport the property to the public yard, and exact from the plaintiff the payment of heavy charges, as the condition of its restoration. We agree with the counsel, that these acts were plainly unauthorized, and had the mere removal been lawful, would have sufficed to render the defendants liable as trespassers, <em>ah initio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The jury have given to the plaintiff little more than the amount, with interest, that he was compelled to pay; and these, we think, are the least damages that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The motion for a new trial is denied, with costs, and judgment must be entered for the plaintiff upon the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
