Upon the coming in of the answer, issues were directed, which were found by the jury in favor of the defendant. Subsequently, at a special term, a new trial was refused, and the complaint finally dismissed. The defendant now moved for an allowance under \u00a7 308 of the Code.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b691-12\">Oakley, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arm\">As it does not appear that the judge who tried the issues, deemed the case to be \u201c difficult or extraordinary,\u201d and there is no evidence that the prosecution of the suit has been \u201c unreasonably or unfairly conducted,\u201d I am satisfied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>that I have no power to make any additional allowance. It is a mistake to suppose that this action is a proceeding to compel the determination of a claim to real property, within the meaning of the Code. The proceedings to which alone \u00a7 308 refers, are those specially authorized hy the revised statutes (2 R. S, or p. 312), and the provisions ip relation to which, although modified in form, the Code, hy an express provision, has retained in force (\u00a7 449). The motion is denied without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Approved on consultation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
