The plaintiff having joined issue upon the allegations of the answer, should have been compelled to try the issues thus framed. The court, by excluding the defence, in effect allowed the demurrer taken in the reply. This was erroneous, and in contravention of the established rule, that a party shall not both reply and demur to the same plea <em>(Slocum </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>4 How. Pr. R. 373; <em>Spellman </em>v. <em>Weider, </em>5 How. Pr.

Woolsey, 19 J. R. 319; <em>Ellsworth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>13 Wend. 663). 2. The qualifications of this rulfe that would limit the provocation to the time of the assault, are not sustained by principle or authority <em>(Frazer </em>v. <em>Grantly Berkeley, </em>7 Car. &amp; P. 621; <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Bunch, </em>3 McCord, 66; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>2 McMullen, 147, 2 Gr.

Whether a sufficient interval had elapsed between the provocation and the punishment in this case, was a proper subject of inquiry for the-jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">IY. The testimony offered at fol. 123 and fol. 125, should have been received, [see reasons stated under point III.] There was also error in the refusal to allow the defendant\u2019s counsel to read and prove to jury the challenge or invitation suggested in the plaintiff\u2019s libel against the defendant <em>(Logan </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>1 Stew. 476).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">Y. The testimony offered at fol. 124, should have been admitted. It served to show the extent of injury done to plaintiff, and to disprove his statement as to the manner in which he was assailed. And proof of Mr. Willis\u2019 admission, that he had no complaint to make, was competent <em>(Yost </em>v. <em>Ditch, </em>5 Black, f. 184).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-7\">YI. This being a speculative suit, in which an enhanced rate of damages was claimed on the score of the personal position of the parties, and for injuries to the sensibilities, as well as to the body of the plaintiff, the offer to prove the standing of plaintiff in society should have been admitted. It was competent upon the question of damages (2 Gr. Ev. \u00a7 267; 2 Car. &amp; P. 292; <em>Paddock </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>2 Cow. 811).</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>E.

The question put to Dr. Warner, as to the state of the plaintiff\u2019s health, at the time of the assault, was relevant, and was properly admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-10\">II. The court properly refused to permit the counsel for the defendant to read the ' pleadings to the jury. All questions arising upon the pl\u00e9adings are for the determination of the court. It was for the court to determine what issues joined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>them were properly for the consideration of the jury; and what evidence was competent when offered in support of such issues <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>8 Wend. 570).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">III. The evidence offered to be given by the witness Underwood, was properly excluded. It did not constitute any justification for the assault, or mitigate, or excuse it (fol. 121). <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Wolsey, </em>19 J. R. 319; <em>Ellsworth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>13 Wend. 658; <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>4 Wend. 336, 55; <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Beardsley, </em>7 Wend. 560, 64).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">TV\". The offer to prove the several causes of provocation set forth in the answer of the defendant, and on which issue had been joined by the reply of the plaintiff, was properly overruled (fol. 122). [See cases cited under point III.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">V. The question put to Mr. Dougherty, whether Mr. Willis said at the police office that he had no complaint to make, was irrelevant, and was properly excluded (fol. 124).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">VI. The offer to prove the publications annexed to the answer, and to prove the absence of the defendant from the State at the time of their publication, and that he had not seen the plaintiff from the time of publication until that of the assault, was properly overruled (fol. 125).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-9\">VII. The question put to the witness Chase, whether he knew the general character of the plaintiff for integrity and morality, was properly overruled (fol. 126).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">VIII. The evidence offered, to show the general standing of the plaintiff in society, was properly excluded. Ho issue on this subject was raised by the pleadings; nor was the evidence offered relevant to any issue raised thereby (fol. 127).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-11\">IX. The judgment appealed from, should be affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b324-12\">By the Court. Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOP\">This was an action for assault and battery, tried before one of the justices of this court and a jury in the spring of 1852, and a verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $2500. A motion is now made on the part of the defendant, to set aside the judgment entered on the ground that the judge had erred in refusing the defendant permission to read the pleadings to the jury, and had excluded the evidence offered in mitigation of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>It was purely a matter of discretion with the judge whether he would allow the pleadings to be read. He might call upon the counsel to read them, or to state their substance, if it was necessary to enable the court to understand the issues which were raised and were to be tried. The pleadings, which are presumed to be statements in legal form of those facts, which constitute the charge or defence of the parties, are for the consideration of the court. When evidence for the consideration of the jury is offered, or given, to sustain or establish those facts, it becomes necessary for the court to understand what issues are raised, and which are properly triable m the case. The facts stated in the pleadings, except so far as admitted, could not be considered by the jury until proved by competent testimony. In this case there was a long answer, admitting the assault, but setting up various causes of provocation which had arisen at different periods previous. The reply took issue and denied these causes of provocation. Thus upon the face of the pleading as they stood when the cause was brought on for trial, issues were joined in a simple action of assault and battery, the disposition of which would call for inquiries into the history, conduct, standing in society, and grievances of these parties, and extending through a series of years. It is very manifest that the judge ought not to allow those issues to be tried in such an action. The correct practice, says Justice Bafculo in a similar case <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>8th Howard, Pr. R. 12), is at the circuit to lay out of the case all the irrelevant allegations, as well as the immaterial issues contained in the pleadings, and hold the parties to trial upon the material issues or points in the case. As most of the issues raised by the pleadings in this case could not be placed before the jury for their consideration, the judge, we think, very properly refused permission to the counsel to read the pleadings to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The evidence, which the defendant offered in mitigation of damages, and which was excluded by the judge, was not admissible. Whatever were the real or fancied causes of provocation, and which were offered to be proved, if they existed, they were known to the defendant a long time prior to the assault. They were not of recent occurrence, had not just come to the knowledge of the defendant, and especially did not happen at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the time of the assault. In one of the oldest reported cases in this country, decided now nearly half a century ago <em>(Avery </em>v. <em>Ray et al., 1 </em>Mass. Rep. 11), it was ruled that in an action for assault and battery the defendant may give in evidence in mitigation of damages, immediate provocation, such as happened at the time of the assault, but not such as happened previously. Mr. Justice Ledyard said in that case that he should be in favor of admitting evidence of provocation given in mitigation of damages upon a liberal scale, but to admit such evidence where the blood has had time to cool would be extending the rule so as to render it impossible to say where the court should stop.</p>\n<p id=\"Azm\">In the leading case in this state, that of <em>Lee </em>v. Woolsey, 19 John. 319, Chief Justice Spencer remarked, \u201cIt appears to me neither,to comport with sound policy nor law to allow an inquiry into antecedent facts in such a case as this, unless they are fairly to be considered as parts of one and the same transaction. A contrary course would greatly encourage breaches of the peace, personal rencounters, and every species of brutal force, and would tend to uncivilize the community.\u201d The rule as first laid down in tMs country, so far as we find in <em>Avery </em>v. Bay, prevails, with scarcely an exception, if indeed there is any, in all <em>the </em>states of this Union, and its justness and policy have been dwelt upon, and favorably considered, in a large number of cases. It is the established rule in this state, and has been followed and recognised in several cases decided since that of <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Woolsey. </em>We see no reason in this case to depart from it. There were some other minor questions raised, but which were not pressed at the argument, and which were of little moment. We think them correctly determined at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
