Federal Judge William H. Holly, through his counsel, accepted service therein, but his sixty-eight co-defendants were not, then, subjected to any process at the state level. While this status of all defendants prevailed, invocation of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442 (a) (3) was effectuated by the Judge\u2019s petition of removal^ filed October 9,1952, in the United States District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">Under his amended notice of appeal plaintiff seeks vacation of two separate orders entered below on December 18, 1952 and March 31, 1953. Denial of plaintiff\u2019s petition to remand \u201cthis cause\u201d to its court of origin, flowed from the. December order which was followed by the March dismissal of the cause as to Judge Holly.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-17\">We think the District Court had jurisdiction and power to act on the dismissal order under \u00a7 1442(a) (3) supra, coupled with Judge Holly\u2019s petition for removal showing, inter alia, want of any process served on his co-defendants. Community Bldg. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 9 Cir., 1926, 8 F.2d 678; Heckleman v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., D.C.E.D. Ill.1942, 45 F.Supp. 984. To hold otherwise would collide with this defendant officer\u2019s unequivocal statutory right and do violence to the mandate embodied in that section.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we do not reach plaintiff\u2019s postulations that the total action has been removed to the court below, because this appeal does not involve a genuine controversy over separability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and divisibility of plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-18\">It must be remembered that Judge Holly is now dismissed out and the remaining sixty-eight defendants are as silent as is this record concerning them. Consequently we make no declaration as to the general jurisdictional status presently occupied by plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-19\"> During oral arguments, before this Court, plaintiff readily admitted that the order of dismissal was proper. No challenge of that adjudication is developed in plaintiff\u2019s briefs. The lower court\u2019s ruling was correct and we would sustain it, plaintiff\u2019s concession aside, under well settled authority. Bradley v. Fisher, 1871, 13 Wall. 335, 80 U.S. 335, 20 L.Ed. 646; Papagianakis v. The Samos, 4 Cir., 1950, 186 F.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-20\">This brings us to plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the order entered December 18, 1952 and requires a threshold re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>minder aptly described by a sentence from our opinion in Jarecki v. Whetstone, 7 Cir., 1951, 192 F.2d 121, 124: \u201cIt is our duty to decide any question of jurisdiction whether or not the parties have raised it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Consonant with that statement we measured the order denying remand against our statutory reviewing powers, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291, and have concluded that it does not qualify as a final decision within the meaning and purview of that section. The narrow ruling made below, denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand \u201cthis cause to the Circuit Court\u201d is not an appealable order. Bender v. Pennsylvania Co., 1893, 148 U.S. 502, 13 S.Ct. 640, 37 L.Ed. 537; Lewis v. E. I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 29, 21 A.L.R.2d 757. Dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the order refusing remand stems from our lack of jurisdiction on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The appeal from the District Court\u2019s order entered December 18, 1952, is dismissed and the order of March 31, 1953 is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-13\">. That part of 28 U.S.C.A. 1442 pertinent here provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">\u201c(a) A civil action * * * commenced in a State court against any of the following persons may be removed by them to the district court of the .United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is . pending: * * * \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"amh-dedup-1\">\u201c(3) Any officer of tbe courts of tbe United States, for any Act under color of office or in the performance of his duties; * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-22\">.
