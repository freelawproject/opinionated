MILLER, and PRETTYMAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b349-12\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">Appellants\u2019 complaint asked for a declaration that Kentucky is entitled to have its insurance agreement with the federal government modified so as to extend Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance, which the appellees administer, to the employees of the City of Louisville Municipal Housing Commission. The complaint also asked an injunction to restrain appellees from adhering to their different interpretation of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that appellees\u2019 interpretation of the Act is not clearly wrong. Cf. Unemployment Compensation Commission of Alaska v. Aragon, 329 U.S. 143, 153, 67 S.Ct. 245, 91 L.Ed. 136. We think appellees\u2019 interpretation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">The Social Security Act as amended authorizes voluntary agreements between the federal government and the States for insurance of State and local employees, but provides that \u201cNo agreement with any State may be made applicable (either in the original agreement or by any modification thereof) to any service performed by employees as members of any coverage group in positions covered by a retirement system on the date such agreement is made applicable to such coverage group.\u201d 64 Stat. 515 (1950), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 418(d). The term \u201cretirement system\u201d is defined as \u201ca pension, annuity, retirement, or similar fund or system established by a State or by a political subdivision thereof.\u201d 64 Stat. 514 (1950), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 418(b) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">An exhibit attached to the complaint shows that the Louisville Municipal Housing Commission is a member of the National Health and Welfare Retirement Association, which is organized for the purpose of providing its employees and the employees of its members with pensions. Appellants concede that the Housing Commission is a \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d and do not deny that its employees are covered by the Retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ment Association\u2019s pension system, but contend that this system is not \u201cestablished\u201d by the Housing Commission and therefore is not a \u201cretirement system\u201d as defined in the Act. We think it clear that by becoming a member of the Retirement Association, the Housing Commission \u201cestablished\u201d the system in question for the Commission\u2019s employees. We disagree with appellants\u2019 contention that the Act contemplates only systems established by legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
