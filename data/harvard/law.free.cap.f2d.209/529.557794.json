Tuohy, was issued Patent No. 2,510,438 on June 6, 1950. The patent claims a contact vision corrective lens which fits on the cornea<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"ant-dedup-1\">Contact lenses are admittedly old in the art of vision correction. However, the contact lenses in general use prior to the Tuohy patent were shaped to the identical curvature of the fitted eye and were held in.place by the use of scleral flanges that extended over the white of the eye and under the eyelids.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their design cut off the flow of natural fluids, blood and oxygen to the eye. Therefore, the use of contact lenses required the insertion of a buffer solution between the eye and the lens. The buffer solution had to be specially prepared for each person and, even with its use, the lenses could be worn for an average of only four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-26\">Tuohy\u2019s claim of invention lay in the development of a contact lens which eliminated the need for buffer solutions and which co\u00fcld be worn for long periods without causing eye irritation. Tuohy accomplished this result by eliminating the scleral flanges and making a lens slightly smaller than the limbus<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>portion of the eye, but larger than the maximum opening of the iris and by making the radius of curvature on the concave side of the lens slightly greater than the radius of curvature of the eye at the cornea <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> upon which the lens rests, thus enabling the natural fluids to reach all portions of the eye. The lens has less curvature than that of the eye and rests on the cornea only at its center point. Yet the lens remains in place, probably through capillary action, and by the slight protrusion of the limbus; and any tendency on the part of the lens to slip off the apex of the cornea can be countered by blinking the eyelids. The inside marginal edge of the lens is beveled both for smoothing and to enable the lens to pass over the raised limbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Solex markets its lens under the name \u201cCorneal\u201d or \u201cTuohy Corneal\u201d. In June, 1950, after receiving its patent, Solex notified Dr. Morris Green (party defendant) that the contact lens which he was selling infringed Solex\u2019s newly acquired patent. Dr. Green nevertheless continued his activities and on October 25, 1950, Solex filed suit praying that Dr. Green, and Pacific Contact Laboratories, Inc., which is under his control, and Lee W. Hoggan, who is the manager of Pacific Contact Laboratories, Inc., be enjoined from infringing Solex\u2019s patent and from using the \u201cdeceptively similar name \u2018Cornea\u2019 \u201d. Solex further sought an accounting for profits and damages, plus costs and a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">The district court found the patent valid and infringed, and that defendants\u2019 use of the words \u201cCornea\u201d and \u201cCorneal\u201d amounted to unfair competition with Solex\u2019s use of the words \u201cCorneal Lens\u201d and \u201cTuohy Corneal Lens\u201d. The defendants were enjoined on both counts and Solex was awarded damages in the amount of $5.00 per pair of contact lenses sold<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by defendants, plus costs, and $500.00 as attorney\u2019s fees. Defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Appellants challenge the validity of Patent No. 2,510,438 on four separate grounds, namely: (1) Tuohy did not invent the corneal type contact lens; (2) The Corneal type contact lens claimed by Tuohy lacks any \u201cflash of creative genius\u201d ;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) The claims do not describe the alleged invention in a clear and definite manner;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (4) The Tuohy patent is at best a \u201cmethod\u201d patent and as such cannot be protected by an \u201carticle\u201d patent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">The district court concluded that the patent was valid as to each of the two claims made,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we may not disturb the court\u2019s conclusion since it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>supported by findings of fact which we do not regard as clearly erroneous<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for the reasons hereinafter stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Did Tuohy Invent the Corneal Type Lens</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Appellants contend that the corneal contact lens was anticipated by an invention of E. Kalt as disclosed ,in 1942 in the book \u201cContact Lenses\u201d by Obrig,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which was admitted, into evidence. Kalt\u2019s development was described</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">in the Obrig book as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2C\">\u201cHe [Kalt] ground some small lenses to correct keratoconus<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which had no scleral band, and rested at the edge of the cornea. They were designed to exert some pressure on the apex of the conus in an attempt to reduce the ecstasia as well as to correct the visual error. \"'As might be expected, they were unsuccessful.\u201d ' .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">The Patent Office issued Patpnt bTo. 2,-510,438 with knowledge of the Kalt' lens and the Obrig book. The district court considered the Kalt lens and rejected it as an anticipation. The quotation itself shoes' both that the objective which Kalt sought to reach was different from Tuohy\u2019s objective and that the Kalt lens was unsuccessful. If a prior art device is adaptable to a purpose, but it is not so adapted, ;that is evidence that the changes required more than mere mechanical\u2019 skill and may support a conclusion of n\u00f3 anticipation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> And a prior unsuccessful experiment does , not constitute invention and cannot therefore be an anticipation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">It must also be noted that the Patent Office, only after making a close examination of Tuohy\u2019s claim of invention, granted him a patent on the corneal type lens. And there is evidence that the corneal lens met with wide acceptance and success only after Tuohy put it on the market. We, therefore, conclude that the district court\u2019s finding that Tuohy invented the corneal type lens is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">\u201cFlash of Creative Genius\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">The Supreme Court in Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., 1941, 314 U.S. 84, 91, 62 S.Ct. 87, 41, 86 L.Ed. 58, set forth the following tests for a patentable device: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">\u201c * * * the new device, however useful it may be, must neveal the flash \u2019 of \u25a0 creative genius, not merely the skill of the calling. If it fails, it has not established its right to a private grant on the public domain.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">However, on July 19, 1952, as part of the revision of Title 35 U.S.C.A. on Pat-\u00e9nts, 66 Stat. 792, Congress enacted \u00a7 103 which provides in part that,\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-20\">. \u201cPatentability shall not be nega- . tived by the manner in which the invention was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-21\">The\u2019 Reviser\u2019s note interprets this sentence to mean \u201cthat patentability as to this requirement, [i. e., invention] is not to be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made,\u2019 that is, it is immaterial whether it resulted from long toil and experimentation or from <em>a flash of genius </em>[italics ours].\u201d That is, as we understand it, the Congress by enacting' \u00a7 103 showed its fear that the meaning of the phrase \u201cflash of creative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>genius\u201d as used by the Supreme Court in Cuno Engineering Corp. v. Automatic Devices Corp., supra, would result in excluding from patentability most if not all mechanical advances derived from study and experimentation. We do not think the phrase \u201cflash of creative genius\u201d implies, or was intended to imply, that patents or patentability spring from inspiration at the cost of reason. The phrase was used more for emphasis than as patent dogma, and the Supreme Court was emphasizing the principle that pat-entability implies more than mere mechanical skill and that a phase of discovery is necessary. The opinion in which the phrase is used did not change the law. But should it be held otherwise, then the new law created by it brought no change as to the instant case, for we are dealing with an unexpired patent and \u00a7 4(a) of the revised Act (inclusive of \u00a7 103) contains the provision that the terms of the new Act \u201c * * * shall apply to unexpired patents granted prior to such [effective] date [of the revised Act]\u201d, 35 U.S.C.A. note preceding section 1, with certain exceptions not here pertinent. Thus, the phrase \u201cflash of creative genius\u201d, as Congress understood it, was emasculated as to the validity of existing unexpired patents and made wholly ineffective as to future patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The district court could not well say that the development of a lens, which utilizes the limbus and capillary action to retain its position and which is so shaped as to utilize the natural fluids of the eyes to avoid irritation, is the result of mere mechanical skill. There is present, also, an idea in advance of the art to which mechanical skill of high order was applied. There is no clear error in the conclusion of the Patent Office and of the district court that this lens is a patentable invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Appellants raise two defenses not raised in the district court, to-wit: That there was no adequate description of the alleged invention filed in the Patent Office, and that the alleged invention is for a \u201cmethod\u201d rather than for an \u201carticle\u201d. In reply, appellee urges the well known principle that objections not made before the trial court cannot be raised here on appeal.<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark> Whether we could consider either of these questions <em>sua sponte, </em>we need not and do not decide, for when laid by the side of a statement of the case they are more pointlessly technical than meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Attorney\u2019s Pees</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">The district court awarded appellee reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. In doing so, the court exercised the discretion conferred upon it by Congress.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the award of fees was an abuse of that discretion, since appellants\u2019 action in copying the Tuohy lens did not amount to \u201cwilful conduct or bad faith\u201d. Citing Dubil v. Rayford Camp &amp; Co., 9 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 899. Appellants\u2019 lens is a \u201cChinese\u201d copy of the Tuohy lens. Appellants\u2019 defense was that the Tuohy lens was not patentable. The district court found upon substantial and convincing evidence that the Tuohy lens was patentable and concluded that appellants\u2019 infringement was \u201cboth deliberate and wilful\u201d. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Motion for New Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence was denied by the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>for lack of diligence. The motion is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court and is not ordinarily reviewable except where that discretion has been abused.<footnotemark>15a</footnotemark> We do not find such abuse here. Over seven months had elapsed between the filing of the action and the date of trial, and another four months elapsed prior to judgment, without the production of new evidence. In? deed, new evidence was not offered until after new counsel had been substituted by appellants at a time when, as the district court pointed out, appellants had already had their day in court. Further? more, the alleged new evidence consists of an affidavit of', a doctor who used a corneal type lens, which from its description in the affid\u00e1vit may be similar to the article in suit, for eye operations from 1932 to 1937,-together, with, an article in a professional publication which refers to unsuccessful experimentation with, the corneal type lens. So long, as the prior public use of an invention is experi? mental, it will not defeat the validity of a. patent. Research Products ,Co. v. Tretolite Co., 9 Cir., 1939, 106,.F.2d 530, 534-5. - \u2022 ~ ;- ;</p>\n<p id=\"Apx\">Unfair Competition</p>\n<p id=\"ADl\">- Appellants have been enjoined from marketing infringing lenses under- the terms \u201cCorneal\u201d and \u201cCornea\u201d. The district court holds the \u00fase of thosq terms \u00fay appellants to be unfair compet\u00ed? tipn .with, 'appellee\u2019s designation' of its \u00ed\u00e9i\u00eds \u00e1s' \u201cCorneal\u201d or \u201cTuohy Corneal\u201d, In order to prove a claim of unfair competition, \u201cit is necessary to establish [among oth\u00e9r things] that the name or appearane,e; of .the injured- product has acquired either a technical trade-mark \u00f3r \u00e1 secondary meaning * * *1\u201d Ross-Whitney Corp. v.
