The finished product was a pellet which when dropped into water expanded into a piece of cotton about four inches wide by six inches long. The process and utility of thus compressing sheets of unwoven fiber had been known to the art since at least 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In early 1951, plaintiffs commenced experiments with the similar compression of woven fibers, and by September of that year had produced the product here in issue, a perfumed face cloth, compressed into the shape of a small drum which when immersed in water opened up to its original shape. The product was put on the market in October, under the name \u201cQuettes,\u201d and sales multiplied rapidly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In December of that year defendant Wiltschek, having seen the product in a New York store, called plaintiffs and sought an interview, representing that he and his partner, defendant Blatt, were interested in selling the item. Plaintiffs initially were not interested, but Wiltschek persisted and after several more calls a meeting was arranged between plaintiffs and Wiltschek and Blatt. The latter came to the plant and discussed the question of representing plaintiffs. In order to persuade plaintiffs of the desirability of the arrangement they claimed a sales force of thirteen men, though in fact they had none other than themselves. As the parties neared agreement, these defendants, at their own solicitation, were shown the process (thereby also learning its cost), the capacity of the plant, and some of plaintiffs\u2019 sales records in order to help them in effecting sales and assure them that supply would be adequate and the product attractive. Shortly thereafter, in late December, an agreement was reached whereby Wiltschek and Blatt were .to represent plaintiffs for a trial period while they tested the appeal of the product with their clientele. Compensation was agreed upon and they were given samples, displays, and signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">By mid-February these defendants had terminated the agreement and returned some of the sales equipment, stating that the line would not sell. It is doubtful whether they ever in good faith intended to sell plaintiffs\u2019 product, but the trial court found on ample evidence that by the end of January they had resolved to copy the product and market it for their own profit. In March, defendant Betti Pearson, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation of which Blatt and Wilts-chek were directors and vice-presidents (their wives holding half of the issued stock), resolved by its board of directors to copy and market plaintiffs\u2019 product. The first lot of the product was put on the market in April under the name \u201cFacelettes\u201d at a lower price than \u201cQuettes.\u201d This action was instituted in June, 1952, against the corporation and the individuals both as such and under three different trade names under which they had- done business.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Our jurisdiction rests upon diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, and accordingly we must draw the controlling principles of substantive law from the law of the forum, New York, Pecheur Lozenge Co. v. National Candy Co., 315 U.S. 666, 62 S.Ct. 853, 86 L.Ed. 1103; Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, 114 A.L.R. 1487; Smith v. Dravo Corp., 7 Cir., 203 F.2d 369, 373, including New York\u2019s rules of the conflict of laws. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Electric Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477; Smith v. Dravo Corp., supra, 7 Cir., 203 F.2d 369. Happily we need not attempt answer to the troublesome question whether a New York court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>would look to the law of New Jersey, where the confidential relationship arose, the law of Massachusetts, where the accused product was manufactured, or that of New York, where it was sold,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or would merely content itself in any event with its own law of remedies, for all three jurisdictions subscribe to the same general principle. Where defendants obtain secret information by means of a confidential relationship, they shall be held accountable for its use to their own advantage at the expense of the rightful possessor. See authorities collected below.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Defendants argue that the heart of plaintiffs\u2019 process was revealed by an expired patent, and that the improvements thereon were unpatentable applications of mechanical skill. This totally misconceives the nature of plaintiffs\u2019 right. Plaintiffs do not assert, indeed cannot assert, a property right in their development such as would entitle them to exclusive enjoyment against the world. Theirs is not a patent, but a trade secret. The essence of their action is not infringement, but breach of faith. It matters not that defendants could have gained their knowledge from a study of the expired patent and plaintiffs\u2019 publicly marketed product. The fact is that they did not. Instead they gained it from plaintiffs via their confidential relationship, and in so doing incurred a duty not to use it to plaintiffs\u2019 detriment. This duty they have breached. Junker v.

Hoffman, supra, 118 N.Y. 30, 36, 37, 23 N.E. 12, 13, 16 Am.St.Rep. 740:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201cIf a valuable medicine, not protected by patent, is put upon the market, any one may, if he can by chemical analysis and a series of experiments, or by any other use of the medicine itself, aided by his own resources only, discover the ingredients and their proportions. If he thus finds out the secret of the proprietor, he may use it to any extent that he desires without danger of interference by the courts. But, because this discovery may be possible by fair means, it would not justify a discovery by unfair means, such as the bribery of a clerk who, in course of his employment, had aided in compounding the medicine, and had thus become familiar with the formula.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">\u201cThe fact that one secret can be discovered more easily than another does not affect the principle. Even if resort to the patterns of the plaintiff was more of a convenience than a necessity, still, if there was a secret, it belonged to him, and the defendant had no right to obtain it by unfair means, or to use it after it was thus obtained. We think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the patterns were a secret device that was not disclosed by the publication of the pump, and that the plaintiff was entitled to the preventive remedies of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">To the same effect is the opinion of Garrison, J., speaking for the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey in reversing a defendants\u2019 decree, in Vulcan Detinning Co. v. American Can Co., supra, 72 N.J.Eq. 387, 67 A. 339, 343, 12 L.R.A.,N.S., 102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\u201cLooking, now, a little more closely at the nature of the relief called for * * * we shall see, I think, that too much emphasis has perhaps been placed upon the element of absolute secrecy in the process, and that not enough stress has been laid upon the inequitable character of the defendants\u2019 conduct in making a use of such process that was inimical to the complainant\u2019s interests. * * * It is proper to say here that the plea that absolution should be granted by courts of equity from the observance of such private obligations whenever the public will thereby be the gainer cannot for a moment be entertained. The language of Justice Brown, cited in the brief of counsel, namely, \u2018It is as important to the public that competition should not be repressed by worthless patents as that the pat-entee of a really valuable invention should be protected in his monopoly,\u2019 has, as I read the case of Pope Manufacturing Company v. Gormully, 144 U.S. 224, 12 S.Ct. 632, 36 L. Ed. 414, no such import in the context in which it stands in Mr. Justice Brown\u2019s opinion. The notion that the multiplication of worthless patents inflicts as great an injury upon the public as the multiplication of worthless citizens would do, can never, I fancy, be accepted by a court of equity as a sound proposition on which to base a doctrine absolving trustees from the observance of their trusts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">It is clear that these principles apply to the case at bar, and plaintiffs are entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The court below after making appropriate findings of fact granted an-injunction and ordered an accounting by defendants of the profits received. D.C.. S.D.N.Y., 115 F.Supp. 28. The authorities cited <em>supra </em>show that this relief, in both its branches, is appropriate and' indeed compelled by the facts proven and found by the court below. Although the point was not made or briefed by counsel, it is now suggested that relief should be limited either to damages or to&gt; an injunction only during the period until the trade by legitimate means has caught up with the plaintiffs and their secret has become general. And the-reason assigned is that the novelty here-is said to be slight and discoverable by a good mechanic. But even if defendants should seek it, the authorities do not justify the award of such uncertain, but. presumably limited, relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">In examining the authorities governing the remedies, we are again met with the situation earlier noted, namely, some doubt as to the appropriate law to be-followed, but no controversy as to the ultimate result. Remedies might be held procedural and thus subject to the law of forum except for the reminder that the question is not merely that, but rather \u201cdoes it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?\u201d Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 1470, 89 L.Ed. 2079, 160 A.L.R.. 1231. And there is obvious truth in this observation in Restatement, Conflict of Laws, ch. 12, Introductory Note (1934): \u201cThe means provided for compulsion, or limitation upon the compulsion, which may be brought against the alleged wrongdoer are, in many cases, of almost equal practical importance to the declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tion of the validity of a plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">It appears, however, that the New York courts have not expressly considered whether local or foreign law should determine the propriety of an injunction in a given case. Nevertheless they have granted injunctions on foreign causes without discussion of the foreign rule, e. g., Niagara Falls International Bridge Co. v. Grand Trunk R. Co. of Canada, 212 App.Div. 705, 209 N.Y.S. 79, affirmed on this point 241 N.Y. 85, 148 N.E. 797; Madden v. Ros-seter, 114 Misc. 416, 187 N.Y.S. 462, affirmed without opinion 196 App.Div. 891, 187 N.Y.S. 943, and there is every indication in their discussion of related issues that the issuance of an injunction should be treated as relating to the remedy, and hence governed by the <em>lex </em>fori, e. g., Reilly v. Steinhart, 217 N.Y. 549,112 N.E. 468, reargument denied 218 N.Y. 660, 112 N.E. 749; Buffalo Forge Co. v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 142 Misc. 647, 651, 256 N.Y.S. 329, 333. And if New York does apply its own rule it appears that we are bound; for a local rule which itself holds a legal principle to be procedural may for us be binding as substantive. Sampson v. Channell, 1 Cir., 110 F.2d 754, 128 A. L.R. 394, certiorari denied Channell v. Sampson, 310 U.S. 650, 60 S.Ct. 1099, 84 L.Ed. 1415, as approved in Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 63 S.Ct. 477, 87 L.Ed. 645, 144 A.L.R. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It would appear, therefore, that New York law governs on this point. But the question'remains largely academic; for the only way in which New York law seems at all unique is in the number and force of the pertinent decisions. The leading case not only for that jurisdiction, but \u2014 in view of its extensive citation \u2014 for the country, is still Tabor v. Hoffman, supra, 118 N.Y. 30, 37, 23 N.E. 12, 13, 16 Am.St.Rep. 740, where the court held a plaintiff \u201centitled to the preventive remedies of the court,\u201d without respect to whether \u201cone secret can be discovered more easily than another\u201d or that a defendant\u2019s resort to the secret \u201cwas more of a convenience than a necessity.\u201d That decision is particularly in point because there defendant\u2019s counsel and a dissenting opinion took special exception to the grant of an injunction, as distinguished from the award of damages at law. See 118 N.Y. 30, 32, 33, 38, 23 N.E. 12. Among recent cases which follow and apply it the following may be cited: Spiselman v. Rabinowitz, supra, 270 App.Div. 548, 61 N.Y.S.2d 138, appeal denied 270 App.Div. 921, 62 N.Y. S.2d 608; Biltmore Pub. Co. v. Grayson Pub. Corp., 272 App.Div. 504, 71 N.Y. S.2d 337; Petnel v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 280 App.Div. 706, 117 N.Y.S.2d 294, 295; Sachs v. Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., 177 Misc. 695, 31 N.Y.S.2d 718, per Shientag, J.; Smith v. Dravo Corp., supra, 7 Cir., 203 F.2d 369; Schreyer v. Casco Products Corp., D.C.Conn., 97 F.Supp. 159, 168, affirmed on this issue, 2 Cir., 190 F.2d 921, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 913, 72 S.Ct. 360, 96 L.Ed. 683; International Industries, Inc. v. Warren Petroleum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Corp., D.C.Del., 99 F.Supp. $07, 914; Schavoir v. American Rebonded. Leather Co., 104 Conn. 472, 133 A. 582, 583; and see also Nims, The Law of Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks \u00a7\u00a7 141, 143a, 148 (4th Ed. 1947); Note, Protection and Use of Trade Secrets, 64 Harv.L. Rev. 976, 982. Thus apt in its facts and citation, of authorities is the late case of Extrin Foods, Inc. v. Leighton, supra, 202 Misc. 592, 115' N.Y.S.2d' 429, where Justice Hart enjoined the use of a discoverable formula for the preparation of certain flavoring products and ordered an accounting of profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">As the several cases cited earlier in this opinion show, there is nothing singular in this aspect of New York law. In citing a multitude of cases to the point that an inventor or discoverer \u201cwill ordinarily be granted an injunction\u201d against use of a formula or trade secret, the editors of a lengthy annotation of eases in 170 A.L.R. 449, 488-490, say that in fact \u201cmost of the cases are injunction cases\u201d and cite only two insignificant or inapposite cases to the contrary. See to like effect Spiselman v. Rabinowitz, supra, 270 App.Div. 548, 61 N.Y.S.2d 138, appeal denied 270 App. Div. 921, 62 N.Y.S.2d 608. We have found no case authority to throw doubt on this law. So, indeed, if a search be made for \u201cfederal law\u201d so-called, the result must be the same on existing authorities, as we have pointed out above; see, for example, the discussion below and in our court in Schreyer v. Casco Products Corp., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The suggestion for a more limited remedy appears to come from a single sentence at the end of comment 6 of 4 Restatement, Torts \u00a7 757 (1939). There, after a lengthy discussion of protection for trade secrets in unexceptional form and definitely in accord with the cases cited above, with indeed stress upon the protection as \u201cagainst breach of faith\u201d rather than \u201creward to the inventor,\u201d as in the case of the \u201cpatent monopoly,\u201d the suggestion is added that, if \u201cthe secret consists of mechanical improvements that a good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the wrongdoer\u2019s liability may be limited to damages, and an injunction against future use of the improvements made with the aid of the secret may be inappropriate.\u201d The tentative and conditional nature of the suggestion is obvious on its face. Though its precise meaning is not clarified by reference'to any precedent, we are convinced that it is pressed beyond its intent if employed to restrict or limit relief on facts such as are disclosed in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">We have already called attention to the earlier precise statement of principles in both comments <em>a </em>and 5 of 4 Restatement, Torts \u00a7 757, with their careful and discriminating contrast between the protection for an invention, where novelty and inventiveness are requisite, and for a trade secret, where breach of faith and reprehensible conduct justify the relief. It could hardly have been the intent of the restaters to take back 'or nullify this careful formulation by an offhand repudiation at its end. And the language seems but the statement of the rather obvious principle that equity will not attempt an injunction when it would be vain and foolish, when in truth the supposed secret is known or knowable to the world. See also Note, Protection and Use of Trade Secrets, supra, 64 Harv.L.Rev. 976, 983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">There may, it seems, be considerable danger in stressing in this branch of the law the assumed ability of a \u201cgood mechanic,\u201d a concept often useful in highlighting the lack of novelty of an alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>patent. Even as to patents the capability of that ubiquitous genius has been questioned and his destructive effect on the law of inventions somewhat deplored. Be that as it may, there is positive danger in resort to the same device to justify the marauding instincts of trust violators, since thereby the carefully built law of trade secrets may be destroyed as a practical matter and such business assets be left open to hijacking from all sides. In practice the complicated and novel device is likely to be patented, leaving protection of simpler devices wrongly exploited to this branch of the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And since the ability of a \u201cgood mechanic\u201d is quite an imprecise concept, its destructive potentialities in this area under the natural tendency of restrictive precedents to accumulate can be forecast. So here the idea of pressing a face cloth into a small mass by use of an hydraulic or other press may seem (and perhaps be) a simple idea, easily conceivable. But actual experience demonstrated that the idea was not so readily understood, even with the teaching at hand of an expired patent as to the compressing of sponges. The entire conception, involving the type, size, and actual method of compressing the cloths, together with the apparently attractive touch of adding some perfume at a chosen stage of the process, was obviously not apparent to such markedly interested observers as the defendants until they obtained all the details by pretending to be ready to market the product for plaintiffs. Also no more apparent to them were either the low cost of production or plaintiffs\u2019 sales records, knowledge of which may well have been primary factors in defendants\u2019 decision to violate their duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">This in any practical sense is not the type of \u201cimprovement\u201d possible \u201cwithout resort to the secret\u201d to which the restaters had reference. At any rate there is nothing in the precedents suggesting that this breach of trust is legally permissible upon payment of limited damages assessed for a time by a court. However \u201croguish\u201d equity may have been in the past,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in modern law, courts of equity sit, as do courts of law, to protect rights and enforce duties by means of the remedies which they administer. Pomeroy, Specific Performance \u00a7 46 (3d Ed. 1926) ; 5 Corbin on Contracts \u00a7 1136 (1951); Walsh on Equity \u00a7\u00a7 8, 53 (1930); 4 Restatement, Torts \u00a7\u00a7 933, 938 (1939).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is to be noted that we do not have here the issue as to a trial judge\u2019s power, on occasion, to withhold injunctive relief; rather the issue is whether we should force the judge to the exercise of a \u201cdiscretion\u201d which his opinion shows he would abhor; see 115 F.Supp. 28, 30, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">At the outset of their restatement of this subject, the distinguished authors made an acute observation on the trend of the law which has since been often quoted. They said: \u201cBut the tendency of the law, both legislative and common, has been in the direction of enforcing increasingly higher standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>fairness or commercial morality in trade. The tendency still persists.\u201d 3 Restatement, Torts, ch. 35, p. 540 (1938), quoted with approval in Q-Tips, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 3 Cir., 206 F.2d 144, 145, per Goodrich, J., and Ross-Whitney Corp. v. Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories, 9 Cir., 207 F.2d 190, 196 note 17, per Stephens, J. The present case surely is not one where we are disposed to attempt to reverse the trend.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. From the record it might be inferred, though it is quite unclear, that it was sold in other jurisdictions as well. But no claim has been made that any applicable local law is materially different from that of the jurisdictions considered. Cf. Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 805 U.S. 111, 113, note 1, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">. Of <em>course it has long been </em>clear <em>that the </em>current rule, pressed to its dryly logical extreme, might have a vastly deleterious effect on the operation of the federal rules; this has been discussed at considerable length by many text writers, including the author of this opinion. See, <em>e.g., </em>Clark, <em>State Law in the Federal Courts, </em>in Jurisprudence in Action 59, 89-93, 106-109, with articles and texts cited in notes 138-144 (1953). But the solution of this problem is for the Supreme Court; and we cannot turn our backs upon the result, particularly when it has been strongly re-emphasized in the late cases, Ragan v. Merchants Transfer &amp; Warehouse Co., 337 U.S. 530, 69 S.Ct. 1233, 93 L.Ed. 1520; Woods v. Interstate Realty Co., 337 U.S. 535, 69 S.Ct. 1235, 93 L.Ed. 1524, and Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528, with only Justice Rutledge dissenting on the point at all pertinent here, 337 U.S. 557, 69 S.Ct. 1231. And certainly there is little reason to expect a reversal of current trends in a case where the issue is, as noted below, substantially academic because of lack of difference in the underlying law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">. If an injunction actually proves useless in practice or becomes out of date, that situation can be taken care of through the ordinary processes of equity, without need of insertion of any confusing caveat in the original decree. See F.R. 60(b), subd. (5); United States v. Swift &amp; Co., 286 U.S. 106, 114, 115, 52 S.Ct. 460, 76 L.Ed. 999; Moore &amp; Rogers, Federal Relief from Civil Judgments, 55 Yale L.J. 623, 643, citing cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-5\">. \u201cIndeed, the fact that the discoverer of a process -or formula may not be able to secure property rights in it by means of the patent law may be the very reason why he seeks the protection of secrecy.

I think money damages will be wholly adequate. To make my position clear, I must first high-light the facts of this case which I think indisputable :</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">(1) When defendants first came on the scene, plaintiffs were already marketing their wash-cloths publicly, so that anyone could buy them. (2) A previously expired patent (not owned by plaintiffs) revealed all the elements of plaintiffs\u2019 process for making these cloths, excepting only two nonpatented and non-patentable features, <em>i. e., </em>(a) plaintiffs compressed a perfumed wash-cloth instead of a perfumed rectangle of woolen material or ball of absorbent cotton, described in the patent, and (b) plaintiffs made some mechanical changes in the hydraulic press described in the patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) Those two slight, added features any ordinary, moderately adept workman \u2014 not necessarily a \u201cskilled mechanic\u201d \u2014 could easily have discovered in a short time from a study of plaintiffs\u2019 publicly-marketed wash-cloths. (4) But without such a study, defendants learned of these features through establishing a confidential relation with plaintiffs. (5) By breaching the obligations of that relation, defendants wrongfully used what they had learned from plaintiffs. (6) All that plaintiffs lost, however, from defendants\u2019 misconduct was plaintiffs\u2019 advantage over competitors for the brief period which would end when such competitors discovered those unpatented features of plaintiffs\u2019 process through a study of plaintiffs\u2019 washcloths.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">On these facts, my colleagues conclude that the trial court lacked all discretion concerning the relief to be accorded plaintiffs, and was obligated to enjoin defendants \u201cperpetually\u201d from making or selling wash-cloths like plaintiffs\u2019.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In reaching that conclusion, my colleagues assert that the New York courts have adopted an inflexible rule that, in cases of this class, they must always issue a perpetual injunction, that those courts have no discretion whatever to grant any lesser relief, such as a decree for money only. I think this is not the New York rule (as I shall try to show later). But what makes my colleagues\u2019 decision important and deeply disturbing is that they assert the following proposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">If the highest court of a State rules that, in a certain class of cases, equity is stripped of all discretion and must always grant, automatically, a perpetual injunction, then (say my colleagues) thanks to Guaranty Trust Company of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99 [65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079], a federal court, sitting in that State in a diversity case falling within that class of cases, must likewise surrender all discretion and mechanically issue a perpetual injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">My colleagues base this proposition on but a portion of a sentence in Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, at page 109, 65 S.Ct. 1464, at page 1470, 89 L.Ed. 2079. But I quote, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>as follows, the entire sentence, in its context, which shows, I think, that my colleagues have overlooked precisely that part of the Court\u2019s opinion which applies to the case at bar: \u201cAnd so the question is not whether a statute of limitations is deemed a matter of \u2018procedure\u2019 in -some sense. The question is whether such a statute concerns <em>merely the manner and the means by which a right to recover, as recognized by the State, is enforced, </em>or whether such statutory limitation is a matter of substance in the aspect that alone is relevant to our problem, namely, does it significantly affect the result of a litigation for a federal court to disregard a law of a State that would be controlling in an action upon the same claim by the same parties in a State court?\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor was this a casual comment. For the Court also said:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cState law cannot define the remedies which a federal court must give simply because a federal court in diversity jurisdiction is available as an alternative tribunal to the State\u2019s courts. Contrariwise, a federal court may afford an equitable remedy for a substantive right recognized by a State even though a State court cannot give it. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">When, because the plaintiff happens to be a non-resident, such a right is enforceable in a federal as well as in a State court, the forms and mode of enforcing the right may at times, naturally enough, vary because the two judicial systems are not identic.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">My colleagues\u2019 opinion in this respect conflicts directly with two rulings of the Third Circuit uttered since Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York; Anheuser-Busch v. DuBois Brewing Co., 3 Cir., 175 F.2d 370, 373; Campbell Soup Co. v. Wentz, 3 Cir., 172 F.2d 80, 81-82. See also Black &amp; Yates v. Mahogany Ass\u2019n, 3 Cir., 129 F.2d 227, 233, 148 A. <em>L.R. 841. </em>Until today no other Circuit has disagreed with the Third. And it is perhaps not amiss to note that when once before this court extended the York case doctrine, purporting with marked confidence to apply its \u201cclear implications,\u201d the Supreme Court reversed. See Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743, reversing, 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 829, 832.<footnotemark>5a</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">My colleagues\u2019 present interpretation of Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York is noteworthy for, under it, in diversity cases, many of the Federal Rules of Procedure, 28 U.S.C. would go down the drain, since they do \u201csignificantly affect the result of litigation.\u201d Consider, for instance, Rule 43(a) providing that evidence excluded in a state court is admissible if previous federal rulings in equity cases would admit it; the application of that Rule may lead to a federal decision not possible if the case had been tried in a state court. What of Rule 38 in a state where, in a suit of an equity character, a jury is demand-able as of right? Think, indeed, of Rule 2, as to the joinder of \u201clegal\u201d and \u201cequitable\u201d claims in a diversity suit in a federal court in New York. Will not Ring v. Spina, 2 Cir., 166 F.2d 546, 550, often yield a markedly different result than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>would eventuate if DiMenna v. Cooper &amp; Evans Co., 220 N.Y. 391, 115 N.E. 993, governs ? The sensible approach to such problems, suggested by Judge Clark in 1941, is surely that the federal Rules should be followed \u201cunless some very vital interest of state law is being set aside.\u201d<footnotemark>5b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">If my colleagues are right about the New York rulings, a correct reading of the York case is distinctly relevant, as my colleagues recognize. For if my interpretation of the York case is correct, then, regardless of the New York rulings, we should carefully consider the discussion in \u00a7 757 of the Restatement of Torts, Comments a and b, for it almost literally describes the facts of this case. It is there said that the duty of persons in a position like defendants does not stem from the ownership by plaintiffs of any \u201cproperty right\u201d in the secret.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It derives from a \u201cgeneral duty of good faith\u201d which calls for legal \u201cprotection * * * against breach of faith and reprehensible means of learning another\u2019s secret.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, so the Restatement reports (\u00a7 757, Comment b), while a protected trade secret \u201cmay be a device or process which is patentable,\u201d it \u201cneed not be that. It may be a device or process which is clearly anticipated in the prior art or one which\u201d \u2014 as here\u2014 \u201cis merely a mechanical improvement that a good mechanic can make. Novelty and inventiveness are not requisite for a trade secret as they are for patent-ability. These requirements are essential to patentability because a patent protects against unlicensed use of the patented device or process even by one who discovers it properly through independent research. The patent monopoly is a reward to the inventor. But such is not the case with a trade secret.\u201d The legal protection given such a secret is so limited that \u201cit is not appropriate to require * * * the kind of novelty and invention which is a requisite of patentability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">But, significantly, the Restatement at once continues as follows: \u201cThe nature-of the secret is, however, an important factor in determining the kind of relief that is appropriate against one who-is subject to liability under the rule stated in this Section. Thus, if the secret consists of a device or process which is a novel invention, one who acquires the secret wrongfully is ordinarily enjoined from further use of it and is required to account for the profits derived from his past use. If, on the other hand, the secret consists of mechanical improvements that a good mechanic can make without resort to the secret, the-wrongdoer\u2019s liability may be limited to-damages, and an injunction against future use of the improvement made with the aid of the secret may be inappropriate.\u201d It is this statement which my 'colleagues lightly call \u201coffhand\u201d and reject. I cannot agree. Professor Harry Shulman, the Reporter of this portion: of the Restatement,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is a scholar known for his acumen, his poise and care. The-Advisers included two eminent federal judges, Learned Hand and Augustus N_ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Hand, and two lawyers, later to become federal judges, highly respected for their learning and thoughtfulness, Goodrich and Wyzanski.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> None of these men was likely to endorse a careful formulation and carelessly follow it by \u201can offhand repudiation at its end.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Their differentiation as to remedies makes much sense, for these reasons: (a) The harm done by a defendant\u2019s breach of a plaintiff\u2019s confidence is the use of the secret to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201closs\u201d or \u201cdetriment.\u201d (b) By defendant\u2019s wrong he deprives plaintiff of a trade secret defined as something which gives plaintiff \u201can opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors.\u201d (c) Where the device or process consists of a \u201cnovel invention,\u201d the plaintiff may have chosen not to patent it \u2014 which would limit the period of his monopoly \u2014 but to keep the invention to himself with the expectation that no one, except those in his confidence, will discover the secret, so that his monopoly will endure for an unlimited time. If the defendant comes to know the secret of such an invention by improper means his use of this knowledge will cause a loss to plaintiff for an indefinite future period during which plaintiff will lose his \u201copportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors.\u201d Wherefore a perpetual injunction affords a proper protection \u2014 a protection as enduring as the monopoly grounded on the secret invention, (d) But where the secret involves only a slight, non-patentable and easily-discoverable improvement, competitors will soon, in all probability, legitimately learn how to contrive this improvement. Consequently, defendant\u2019s wrong has caused a loss of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cadvantage over competitors\u201d which, at most, would not have lasted long. Perpetually to enjoin defendant in such circumstances would be to harm him without regard to the loss or detriment suffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">In short, such an injunction \u2014 continued beyond the time when, in all likelihood, the trade, by legitimate means will catch up with the plaintiff \u2014 is sheer punishment, nothing else. In a closely related tort field, when a defendant has knowingly copied plaintiff\u2019s trade-name, a court will not issue a perpetual injunction against defendant\u2019s doing business but will allow defendant to continue in business if he adopts a revised name that is not likely to confuse:<footnotemark>9a</footnotemark> When the damage to plaintiff ceases, the restraint of defendant ends; the restraint does not continue thereafter for the purpose of punishing the wrongdoer.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">So here, I think no injunction should issue. True, these defendants have done a legal wrong and acted unethically. But that is also true in many a tort case where there is no punitive or deterrent element in the judgment except that contained in the exaction of damages that will roughly compensate the plaintiff;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> when, in such a case, damages achieve the end of thus compensating plaintiff, the possibility that they do no more to punish the defendant is not regarded as showing that damages are so \u201cinadequate\u201d as to justify equitable relief; nor has the failure to issue injunctions in such cases been regarded as encouragement to wrongdoers. No more should it be so regarded in the case at bar. To say that a denial of a perpetual injunction in a case like this will be to destroy any real requirement of good faith in business-trust relations is to assert confidently that the grant of such an injunction would serve, punitively, to deter breaches of good faith in such relations. But as there is no basis in our present state of ignorance, about the deterrent effect of judgments in civil suits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>such an assertion, I think we ought not rely on it to justify punitive injunctions. The courts in civil suits do not attempt to punish breaches of duty even by express trustees unless the misconduct \u201chas the character of outrage frequently associated with crime,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in which event the punishment takes the form of punitive damages. I think defendants\u2019 misconduct here was not so heinous as to render appropriate the imposition of such damages.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">And so I come back to the federal rulings as to equitable remedies. Repeatedly, the Supreme Court has underscored their flexible, discretionary character; has said that equitable relief should turn on the necessities of the particular ease; has repudiated the notion that equitable remedies, including injunctions, should be used punitively. Thus in Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 591, 88 L.Ed. 754, the Court said concerning an injunction: \u201cWe are dealing here with the requirements of equity practice with a background of several hundred years of history. Only the other day we stated that \u2018An appeal to the equity jurisdiction conferred on federal district courts is an appeal to the sound discretion which guides the determinations of courts of equity.\u2019 Meredith v. City of Winter Haven, 320 U.S. 228, 235, 64 S.Ct. 7, 11, [88 L.Ed. 9], The historic injunctive process was designed to deter, not to punish. The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power of the Chancellor to do equity and to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case. Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See, e. g., Di Giovanni v. Camden Fire Ins. Association, 296 U.S. 64, 71-72, 56 S.Ct. 1, 5, 80 L.Ed. 47: \u201cEquity not infrequently withholds relief which it is accustomed to give where it would be burdensome to the defendant and of little advantage to the plaintiff. See Harri-sonville, Mo. v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., 289 U.S. 334, 335, 338, 53 S.Ct. 602, 77 L.Ed. 1208, and cases cited; cf. Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557, 19 L.Ed. 501; Hennessey v. Woolworth, 128 U.S. 438, 9 S.Ct. 109, 32 L.Ed. 500; McCabe v. Matthews, 155 U.S. 550, 553, 15 S.Ct. 190, 39 L.Ed. [253] 256.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AaFq\">The New York rulings are to the same effect: Equitable relief is to be adapted, in the sound discretion of the Chancellor, to the circumstances or exigencies of the particular case; such relief will not be granted if it will work hardship and injustice to the defendant and very little-if any benefit to the plaintiff;<footnotemark>14a</footnotemark> there-is no absolute right to an injunction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In a trade secret case, in particular, an injunction will be granted only if plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">My colleagues, however, cite Tabor v.. Hoffman, 118 N.Y. 30, 23 N.E. 12, as. holding that, whenever a defendant misuses a confidential relation by exploiting-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>a secret process, invariably the defendant will be permanently enjoined, no matter how easy it would have been to discover the secret without any confidential disclosure by the plaintiff. I think that is a mistaken version of the facts of that case, which were as follows: The plaintiff had invented and patented a pump. After the patent expired, he manufactured and sold a pump containing improvements on the original which he did not patent. These improvements were incorporated in patterns which he kept secret. An independent contractor, hired by the plaintiff to repair these patterns, secretly made copies of them which the defendant used to manufacture pumps he sold in competition with plaintiff. The trial court found that, only with great difficulty, could anyone, merely from a study of the pump and the expired patent, learn to make a pump like plaintiff\u2019s. On these facts the trial court granted the injunction which was affirmed by the upper courts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The dissenting opinion in the highest court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>maintaining that there was no case for equitable relief, admitted the difficulty of discovering the secret but relied on the following untenable arguments: The invention did not consist of the patterns but of the idea represented by them; and the defendant had no contractual relation with plaintiff. The majority opinion turned on the particular facts of the case, which differed markedly from those of the case at bar. Neither in the Tabor case nor elsewhere have the New York courts (or, for that matter, have any other courts) ruled that, regardless of the particular facts, in a trade-secret case, an injunction must always issue, and money damages will never suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">My colleagues\u2019 treatment of the New York trade-secret cases is, I think, an illustration of a practice to which Chafee has called attention:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In an opinion in an equity suit, \u201cobservations on the facts are often intermingled with observations on the law. Hence, the judge may formulate what looks like a general proposition, which may be entirely correct as to the facts before him but is really inappropriate to other (\u2018though somewhat similar) facts. If his opinion is printed in the reports, a judge in another case may use this proposition as a precedent, without realizing that in large measure it is really like a jury verdict and ought to decide nothing as to future cases. In an appellate decision in equity, also, the same infusion of the facts into apparent propositions of law may occur with like consequences.\u201d Thus Lord Halsbury, in Colls v. Home &amp; Colonial Stores [1904], A.C. 179, 184, said: \u25a0 \u201cI think that the whole subject has been confused by certain- decisions which were dependent on the facts proved, and were incautiously reported as laying down principles of law, when they were, in my view, only intended to be findings of fact in that particular case.\u201d <footnotemark>17b</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Even assuming, then, that Guaranty Trust Co. of New-York v. York has the meaning my colleagues ascribe to it, there is nothing, I think, in the New York cases to require a muscle-bound decision here. Nor does anything in the Restatement<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or in Corbin\u2019s Contracts <footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>suggest any such rigidity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>True, there is a judicial \u201ctrend in the direction of enforcing increasingly higher standards of fairness or morality in trade.\u201d But the enforcement of those standards does not call for mechanistically issued decrees based on a concept of punishment for past misdeeds. It would be strange if today, when punishment of crime is becoming ever more flexible, individualized,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> equity, in a stereotyped manner, were to use injunctions punitively and without regard to the particular facts of the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">I fail to comprehend my colleagues\u2019 reason for twice referring to the fact that, through the confidential relation, defendants obtained a knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s cost of production and sales records. My colleagues say that this knowledge may have stimulated defendants to violate their duty. But that fact has no bearing on the propriety of issuing an injunction when money damages will afford adequate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">I think that defendants should be obliged to do no more than to account to plaintiffs for damages and profits for the short period in which plaintiffs would have been free of competition, if defendants had not violated their duty. To be sure, this time limitation entails some conjecture. So, however, do many other measures of damages in cases where the presence of the conjectural element does not lead to equitable relief. Moreover, in a case like this, the rule applies that the proof of damages need not be too precise and that a considerable measure of conjecture is proper, because defendants\u2019 own wrong caused whatever difficulties of computation exist. See, e. g., Package Closure Corp. v. Sealright Co., 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 972, 979; Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 264-265, 66 S.Ct. 574, 90 L.Ed. 652.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">Difficult to reconcile with my colleagues\u2019 decision here is Foundry Services, Inc. v. Beneflux Corp., 2 Cir., 206 F.2d 214, 216, opinion by Judge Chase. There, but a few months ago, this court reversed a temporary injunction order restraining defendant from violating an agreement with respect to a secret process owned by plaintiff, saying of the injunction: \u201cIt serves to prevent the appellant from competing or from aiding others in competing with the appellee in the United States. The ordinary and natural result of such competition would be to dampen the sales of the appellee; but since any loss so caused could, if a wrong, be adequately redressed by money damages ascertainable upon proof, it does not constitute the irreparable injury necessary to justify an injunction <em>pendente lite.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To be sure, there the injunction was not permanent; but the views expressed as to the adequacy of damages seem fully applicable here. The case shows also (contrary to what my colleagues seem to suggest) that a reversal of an injunction order for \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion on the ground that damages are adequate \u2014 although (as my colleagues say) the reversal \u201cforces\u201d the trial judge not to grant equitable relief\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>is not at all inconsistent with the notion that equity is always flexible.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Appendix</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\n<em>The expired patent:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">\u201cUnited States Patent Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cHenry Casevitz, of Paris, France.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201cHygienic Textile Sponge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">\u201c1,074,245.

Subjected, in fact, to the simultaneous action of heat and moisture, the microbes that the sponges contain are placed under the most favorable conditions for their development just as they would be in a culture designed for such purpose. To remedy these drawbacks the applicant proposes to replace the ordinary sponge by a woolen material or a little ball of absorbent cotton, which would be only used once in a toilet operation and can be thrown away on account of its small cost. It is convenient to incorporate in this cloth or in the small cotton ball a perfumed antiseptic substance, mixed preferably with a soap-like product so that when the cotton is thrown into cold or tepid water, that is used for the toilet, a liquid is formed pleasant to the skin and consistent with hygienic principles. It is not indispensable to incorporate in the sponge an antiseptic product to give it the desired hygienic qualities. The sponge in question can be rendered antiseptic by simply passing it through a stove, and for all ordinary purposes it is sufficient if it be</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-17\">manufactured with care and cleanliness without the necessity for placing it in a liquid really antiseptic or aseptic. Moreover, the preparation and the compression of the sponge can be attained either by pressure by means of some suitable press or by blows. To impart to the cotton a form more suitable for sale, and transport, it is convenient to compress it by means of a hydraulic or other press to obtain thus small packets of a useful shape, which, placed in water, will rapidly and easily regain their original size.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-18\">\u201cIn the accompanying drawings:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-19\">\u201cFigures 1, 2, and 3 are views illustrative of successive steps in the formation of the hygienic sponge of this invention; Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the swelling of the sponge of Fig. 3 when saturated with water.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-20\">\u201cIn forming my hygienic sponge of cotton for example, I preferably take a piece of hydrophil cotton of rectangular form, Fig. 1, and give it a double fold as shown in Fig. 2. The piece of cotton thus folded is then placed in a tubular matrix and subjected to pressure, by a piston working in the cylinder, sufficient to compress the cotton to the form of a circular disk or cylinder as shown in Fig. 3. The sponge or sponges thus formed may be packed in cases or cartons or wrapped in paper. Each disk constitutes a sponge intended for toilet use. When-in using such a sponge it is plunged into water; it rapidly lengthens to approximately the form shown in Fig. 4, and then further swells and spreads to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>form shown in Fig. 5, to a volume which may be approximately twenty times the volume of the compressed disk.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">\u201cWhat is claimed is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201c1.

See the opinion of the General Term of the New York Supreme Court, 41 Hun 5, 7-8: \u201cThis action was brought to restrain the defendant from manufacturing and selling pumps made from patterns copied and designed from the patterns designed by the plaintiff, and for damages. The trial court found as facts that the plaintiff is the inventor and owner of what is known as Tabor\u2019s rotary pump, and that he manufactures the same for sale; that he had spent a good deal of time, study, thought, labor and money to make and perfect patterns from which to manufacture the pump. * * * These improvements have never been patented and, consequently, the plaintiff is unable to \u2022claim any protection through the patent laws. He has invented and constructed patterns from which he has manufactured the improved pump. The pump so manufactured has been sold, and in that way given to the public; but the patterns from which it was manufactured have never been sold, but have always been kept subject to his own control and \u2022management. The sale of the machine \u2022does not amount to a publication of the patterns, plans and specifications from which the machine was constructed. It is possible that an individual may be able to procure plans and specifications and \u2022construct patterns from the machine that has been sold, and yet there are doubtless instances in which machinery is so complicated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, so to do. In such a case the sale of the machine and its publication to the world would not enable \u2022others to manufacture and sell the same machine for the reason that the plans, specifications, patterns and devices by which the same was manufactured still remained a secret, locked up in the inventor\u2019s manufactory. Suppose, for instance, that the successful operation of the machine required it to be constructed of a composition or combination of metals, which was the device and invention of the manufacturer; could it be said that the sale of the machine, to be devoted to the uses for which it was constructed, carried with it the right to the secret formula by which the inventor had compounded the material out of which it was constructed, or the manner in which the material had been treated and prepared for use?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The Court of Appeals, 118 N.Y. 30, 35-36, 23 N.E. 12, said: \u201cThe precise question, therefore, presented by this appeal, as it appears to us, is whether there is a secret in the patterns that yet remains a secret, although the pump has been given to the world? The pump consists of many different pieces, the most of which are made by running melted brass or iron in a mold. The mold is formed by the use of patterns, which exceed in number the separate parts of the pump, as some of them are divided into several sections. The different pieces out of which the pump is made are not of the same size as the corresponding patterns, owing to the shrinkage of the metal in cooling. In constructing patterns it is necessary to make allowances, not only for the shrinkage, which is greater in brass than in iron, but also for the expansion of the completed casting under different conditions of heat and cold, so that the different parts of the pump will properly fit together and adapt themselves, by nicely balanced expansion and contraction to pumping either hot or cold liquids. If the patterns were of the same size as the corresponding portions of the pump, the castings made therefrom would neither fit together, nor, if fitted, work properly when pumping fluids varying in temperature. The size of the patterns cannot he discovered by merely using the different sections of the pump, but various changes must be made, and those changes can only be ascertained by a series of experiments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>involving the expenditure of both time and money. Are not the size and shape of the patterns, therefore, a secret which the plaintiff has not published and in which he still has an exclusive property? Can it be truthfully said that this secret can be learned from the pump, when experiments must be added to what can be learned from the pump before a pattern of the proper size can be made?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">a.

In such cases decisions must be made in the exercise of a sound judgment upon all the circumstances and such decisions can furnish rules for new cases, only where the same circumstances occur, yet there is a constant striving to treat them as precedents, and to regard the expressions used by the courts in stating the grounds of their decisions, and which are true perhaps in regard to the case in hand, as universally true.
