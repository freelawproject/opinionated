As the taxpayer wisely conceded on oral argument in this court, the 1929 agreement, made some 35 days before the divorce suit began, was \u201cincident to\u201d the divorce.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">2. If, without more, Ross, in May 1946, had paid Jane Grant the $10,-720 of arrears due under the 1929 agreement, it would have been indisputable that that sum constituted \u201cperiodic payments,\u201d taxable to her under the statute, notwithstanding they were paid in a lump. For delay in making several periodic payments does not change their original character.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We think the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>is true here, since the 1946 agreement plainly describes the $10,720 as \u201cthe amount due and owing to her up to January 1, 1946 pursuant to the separation settlement agreement dated April 1, 1929.\u201d As the government contends, by its very terms the agreement of May, 1946 did not undertake to supersede the 1929 agreement previous to January 1, 1946, by which time the $10,720 had become Ross\u2019 fixed obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The taxpayer, however, stresses the fact that, pursuant to the 1946 agreement, Ross paid her \u201cthe $10,720 as consideration for the full discharge of Ross\u2019 future, as well as past obligations to supplement\u201d the \u201cdividends on the stock,\u201d and \u201cfor a reduction in Ross\u2019 insurance policy.\u201d The $10,720, she argues, was therefore a lump sum, and the Tax Court erroneously \u201cignored the unitary nature\u201d of the May 1946 agreement which \u201cgave Ross far more than a mere receipt for what he owed up to that point.\u201d Although the stipulation of facts states that she received nothing except the $10,-720, and although in her briefs in this court she makes no mention of the item of $1,500 for her attorney\u2019s fees, we shall assume, arguendo, that Ross paid that item. On that assumption, taxpayer\u2019s argument may be augmented thus: By the 1946 agreement, she received $12,-<em>220 </em>\u2014 i.e., $10,720 plus $1500 \u2014 for her release of (a) Ross\u2019 obligation to pay the $10,720 of arrears of alimony and (b) other important obligations due from Ross under the 1929 agreement. Even so, we think the Tax Court\u2019s decision correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Corbin, great master of the \u201claw of contracts,\u201d deems the distinctions between \u201centirety\u201d and \u201cdivisibility\u201d of a single contract largely mirage-like, creative of \u201cconfusion and obscurity,\u201d and expressing \u201cno clear and usable concept.\u201d He demonstrates that, in judicial opinions which voice the distinction, actually \u201cthe solutions vary with the purposes in view and with the character of the problem to be solved\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and he shows how in some instances courts held that separate suits may be brought for breaches of separate promises given in one contract for a single consideration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nevertheless we shall assume, arguendo, that the courts of New York, where the 1946 contract was made and was to be performed, would hold that that contract was wholly unitary for the purpose of determining the rights and obligations of the parties as between themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">But here we must apply a provision of the federal Revenue Code with due regard to the congressional purpose it embodies, <em>i. e., </em>to lessen the tax burden of a divorced husband by allowing him to deduct from his gross income, in computing his taxable net income, periodic alimony payments. We have in mind Supreme Court decisions that dwell on the peculiar perspective of many tax laws, telling us that the legal significance (relevance) of facts from the angle of those laws is often not identical with their usual legal (\u201cprivate law\u201d) significance. Thus the Supreme Court holds that the niceties of legal rules governing private rights and obligations in respect to trust estates or remainders must yield to the purpose of the revenue statutes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we have said: \u201cIncome tax \u2018law\u2019 is not a matter of pure reason. It is a composite of constitutional doctrine and interpretations of changing statutory provisions each having its history. In ascertaining the meaning of those provisions, we must be guided by the light of Supreme Court decisions. We are merely a reflector, serving as a judicial moon.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nor is it merely our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>moon-like function that induces us to include that, just as elsewhere the meaning of a fact \u2014 indeed what is a fact\u2014 often varies with the purpose in hand\u2014 <em>e. g., </em>a hammer is not the same fact to a carpenter, a painter, a physicist and a murderer \u2014 so in the legal realm what is a fact often depends on the special legal context in which the question arises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> More particularly, in applying tax statutes, the Supreme Court frequently turns away from the interpretations of conduct under \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cprivate law,\u201d and remarks that it is \u201cspeaking with reference to taxation\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or dealing with an event \u201cfor tax purposes.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When, in tax cases, the Court says that, because \u201ctaxation * * * is eminently practical,\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it regards \u201csubstance\u201d rather than \u201cform,\u201d or looks through a \u201csham\u201d or \u201cdisguise\u201d or \u201cmasquerade\u201d to the \u201crealities,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is saying, in effect, that it treats as mere \u201cform\u201d or as a \u201csham\u201d that which in a different legal setting represents \u201csubstance\u201d or \u201creality.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For thinking in the domain of \u201ctax law\u201d is necessarily contextual. It operates in a specialized \u201cuniverse of discourse.\u201d Any such specialized talk-world (or think-world) has its own restricted \u201cattentional attitudes,\u201d and confers the accent of reality on some matters (and the accent of unreality upon others) whereas in another alternative talk-world (that of decedent\u2019s estates for example) some of the reals of the \u201ctax-law\u201d world become unreals, ghosts or phantoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Consequently, we think that the ordinary rules, relative to private rights and duties growing out of the facts of a particular contract, must give way to the paramount aim of the revenue statute before us here. See, e. g., Lucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111, 114, 50 S.Ct. 241, 74 L.Ed. 731, where the Court (per Holmes, J.), when applying a section of the Revenue Act, disregarded the legal consequences of a contract under state \u201claw.\u201d Accordingly, in applying Section 22 (k) to this case, we take the payment of the arrears of periodic sums due under the 1929 contract as the nub of the 1946 contract and whatever was done in carrying it out.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI9J\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>MEDINA, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">. -See Izrastzoff v.

As the government suggests, it was natural for taxpayer, in the May 1946 contract, because of her improved earning capacity and financial condition, to make concessions as to the future, but she did this only as to the period after January 1, 1946, at which time $10,720 was owing to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">We are not to be understood as laying down a rigid rule governing all contracts in which a husband agrees to pay a sum, regardless of its amount, for (1) arrears of periodic payments and (2) other very substantial consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b483-4\">SWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Av0x\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">I agree that the 1929 separation agreement was \u201cincident to\u201d the divorce thereafter obtained. This is indicated by paragraph vi which provides that the payments shall continue during the wife\u2019s life \u201cirrespective of any change in the status of either party.\u201d I agree also that the dividend-deficiency payments which the husband was obligated to <em>malee </em>were \u201cperiodic payments\u201d within section 22 (k) of the Internal Revenue Code. I am unable to agree that the sum of $10,720 paid to her in 1946 was paid pursuant to the 1929 agreement. That agreement was superseded by the 1946 agreement as expressly therein stated, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201c1. This agreement is in lieu of and supersedes as of January 1,1946 all other previous agreements between the parties, and Grant shall have no claim or claims of any kind upon Ross and Ross shall have no further obligations to Grant to make any payments or disbursements to or for her use or benefit except as herein expressly provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The obligations Ross undertook by executing the 1946 agreement were to maintain the insurance policy and pay the premiums thereon (paragraph 5), and to pay Grant $10,720 and her attorney $1,500 (paragraph 7). It is true the payments required by paragraph 7 were to be made \u201cupon the execution of this instrument.\u201d It is true also that the $10,720 sum payable to Grant was described as \u201cthe amount due and owing to her up to January 1, 1946 pursuant to the separation agreement dated April 1, 1929.\u201d But neither the description of the sum nor the fact that it was payable contemporaneously with executing the agreement militates, in my opinion, against the view that the obligation which the payment satisfied was the obligation Ross assumed in the 1946 agreement. The later agreement was to supersede the earlier and to put an end to Grant\u2019s claims under the earlier. \u201cAn existing claim can be instantly discharged by the substitution of a new executory agreement in its place.\u201d Cor-bin, Contracts, \u00a7 1293. Hence I think the payment was made pursuant to the later agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">This conclusion, however, is not itself dispositive of the case. It may well be, as the Commissioner\u2019s brief suggests as an alternative argument, that the 1946 agreement was itself \u201cincident to\u201d the divorce since it superseded one which was. See Mahana v. United States, 88 F.Supp. 285, 290, 115 Ct.Cl. 716, cer-tiorari denied 339 U.S. 978, 70 S.Ct. 1023, 94 L.Ed. 1383; Smith v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1 Cir., 192 F.2d 841, 842. Granting that the 1946 contract was incident to the divorce, the question then arises were the payments made pursuant to that agreement \u201cperiodic\u201d payments. I do not think they were; they satisfied all Ross\u2019 obligations except his promise to pay insurance premiums. Cf. Frank J. Loverin v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 T.C. 406; Gale v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 79, 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">I am unable to follow my brothers\u2019 conclusion that here the ordinary rules relative to private rights and duties growing out of a particular contract must give way to the paramount purpose of the tax statute to lessen the tax burden of a divorced husband. In my opinion that states the purpose of the statute too broadly. Section 22 (k) and section 23 (u) tax the recipient of alimony payments and give the payor the privilege of deduction provided the payments are \u201cperiodic\u201d; otherwise not. For all we know the parties may have purposely drawn the 1946 contract so that the husband would have to pay the tax on the 1946 payment; he might well have been willing to do that in order to be relieved of future dividend-deficiency payments to the divorced wife and to obtain favorable modifications with respect to the $50,000 insurance policy. I think the decision of the Tax Court should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
