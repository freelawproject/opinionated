Jerry Rossman Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 175 F.2d 711, 714.</p>\n<p id=\"an7-dedup-0\">In Rossman, we said that \u201cin every case the question must be decided <em>ad hoc.\u201d </em>There, the taxpayer\u2019s overcharge resulted from errors made by his supplier ; on discovering the errors, taxpayer immediately reported the overcharges to the OPA official who accepted payment of that amount and gave taxpayer a full discharge. In those circumstances, we said \u201cthere was positive and compelling evidence that to allow\u201d the deduction for tax purposes \u201cwould not \u2018frustrate\u2019 the policies of the\u201d OPA statute; and we added that the Administrator\u2019s acceptance of the overcharge was not a final decision for tax purposes but that, on the evidence, \u201cit stands uncontradicted.\u201d Here there is no such evidence; an inference favorable to taxpayer which otherwise might be drawn is here flatly contradicted by the evidence. Here the taxpayer\u2019s action in raising its prices, after its cursory investigation had revealed that there was no new price amendment, amounted to recklessness. And the government\u2019s settlement of the suit for one-twelfth of the amount claimed as single damages is not alone, we think, the equivalent of an administrative determination of innocent violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">The settlement means very little since, at the time it was effectuated, the OPA had expired (on June 30, 1947 \u2014 50 U.S. C.Appendix, \u00a7 901), and we may surmise its staff of lawyers and investigators had been disbanded. On that account, the investigation necessary to prove the case at trial against the taxpayer may have been unavailable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Had taxpayer been sued by OPA, and had there resulted in that suit a judicial decision that taxpayer had successfully defended under the so-called Chandler Amendment, 50 U.S.C.Appendix, \u00a7 <em>925(e) </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that the recoverable amount \u201cshall be the amount of the overcharge or overcharges if the defendant proves that the violation of the regulation, order, or price schedule in question was neither willful nor the result of failure to take practicable precautions against the occurrence of the violation\u201d- \u2014 the result here might have been different. See Utica Knitting Co. v. Shaughnessy, D.C., 100 F.Supp. 245. But the mere fact of a settlement cannot be deemed the same as a judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>determination; nor (for reasons already stated) can it be given the rank of an administrative determination of innocence. Accordingly, we think the taxpayer, absent proof of such innocence, cannot deduct the settlement payment as a business expense, because to do so would be to frustrate the clear policy of the OPA statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-13\">. It is said that the OPA, during its wartime existence, settled 70% of all the treble-damage suits it brought. See Note 59 Yale L.J. 561, 567. If this be correct, it seems to indicate that the mere fact of settlement does not add up to an administrative determination of innocent violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-24\">.
