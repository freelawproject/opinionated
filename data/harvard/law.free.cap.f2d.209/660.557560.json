Almost immediately thereafter, the government filed a reclamation petition asserting title to certain property in\u2019the hands of the trustee, which it averred it had supplied to'the bankrupt on contract for the purpose of having the latter manufacture therefrom army clothing. The petition prayed that the property, the \u201cpurchase price\u201d of which was said to have been $302,500, and which, if completed in pursuance of the contract, would have been worth much more, be surrendered to the government in order that it might proceed to procure completion of the contract by other manufacturers. Inasmuch as it appeared that the Defense Department was badly in need of the material in order to satisfy the pressing needs of the military forces, the court, with the trustee\u2019s consent, directed that it be surrendered to the government, without prejudice, however; to the rights of the trustee or- any other claimant therein, Later the government filed also ;a claim for damages. for failure on the part of \u2022the bankrupt to complete the' contract, in -the 'amount of $68,279.72. In due course the trustee filed counterclaims asserting \u00a1certain liens arid unsecured money demands against the property and the government's general claim, which'he asserts aggregated $155,593.49. Thus the government was asserting a\u00a1 demand for property presumably of the value of at least $302,000 and a claim for damages in the amount of $68,279.72, the money value of its total claim being, so far as we can ascertain, at least $370,000, whereas the trustee sought to set off against these demands, a total of some $150,000. The government objected to the court\u2019s entertainment of jurisdiction of the counterclaims upon the premise that it was immune from suit. The court held that it had jurisdiction and the government appeals from this interlocutory order-</p>\n<p id=\"AlJc\">At the threshold we are confronted with the trustee in bankruptcy\u2019s motion to dismiss. He insists that the order \u2122 . Th\u201c \u00bb' \u2014 ** a ^queut^ recurring and often vexatious question of whether the order was entered \u2122 a Proceeding m bankruptcy or ina controversy arising in a proceed-m bankruptcy Under Section 24, aub- a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U S C\u2018A- \u00a7 5\u2019 Sub\u2018 a\u2019 T are vestfd \u2122\u00edh Jurisdiction m appeals from orders \u201cm Proceedings m bankruptcy, either mterloc:utory or final and m controversies arismg m proceedings m bankruptcy, to review affirm revise or reverse, both <em>f </em>\u201cattars of Ia^ and \u201c matters of faf \u2022 Consequently if the order was entered m the proceedings m bankruptcy&gt; ,e\u2122n tbouSh interlocutory, it is apfalable\u2019 whereas, if entered m a controversy arismg m bankruptcy, it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"auu-dedup-0\"> We think that, under the facts related, there can be no question but that the order of which complaint is made was entered, at least in part, in the bankruptcy proceedings. As we have' heretofore held, such proceedings cover questions arising between the bankrupt or his representative, the trus&gt;tee, on. the one hand and the creditors, as such, on the other, and other well known steps in bankruptcy proceedings, including \u201callowance and disallowanc\u00e9 \u00b0f claims and the like,\u201d all of which naturally occur in the settlement of the \u00e9state. \u2022 In re Breyer Printing Company, 7 Cir., 216 F. 878, at page 880. See also In re Manufacturers Trading Corp., 6 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 948, 952-953; In re National Finance &amp; Mortgage Corp., 9 Cir., 1939, 96 F.2d 74; Broders v. Lage, 8 Cir., 1928, 25 F.2d 288; 2 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th Ed.) Section 24.12. In the present case the government, in addition to seeking recovery of certain property, asserted a general claim against the estate. The trustee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>whose duty it is to conserve the assets, objected to the allowance of each of these claims and sought to defeat them by counterclaims demanding substantia sums by way of set-off. The disposition of the issues arising upon the government\u2019s general claim and the trustees counterclaim thereto had to do with the allowance and disallowance of claims, which is a part of the proceedings m bankruptcy. We conclude, therefore, that the order was entered m proceedings in bankruptcy and that, under the Act, the appeal was properly taken from the interlocutory order. As the government had a right to appeal from the order, inasmuch as it covered issues upon the government\u2019s general claim and the trustee\u2019s counterclaim, the validity of the entire order is before us. The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"Arbv\">On the merits of the order, the government concedes that a party sued by the United States may recoup damages arising out of the same transaction, or where authorized, set off other claims, so as to reduce or defeat the government\u2019s claim. That this is a correct conception of the law is apparent from United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, at page 511, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894; Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, at page 262, 55 S.Ct. 695, 79 L.Ed. 1421; United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 163-164, 8 L.Ed. 899, though no affirmative judgment over and above the amount of its , . , \u2022 . \u00bfi tt -x j claim can be rendered against the United , tt x oao tt o States, United States v. Shaw, 309 U.S. 495, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888. The \u2019 , , , . decision that the District Court had jurisdiction, then, is admittedly correct, in so far as it permitted the trustee to set off against the government\u2019s general claim in order to defeat it or reduce it, his counterclaim for breach of the contract on the part of the government. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions, irrespective of any question of immunity of the sovereign from suit, by filing its general claim the government consented .that anything growing out of the same transaction might be interposed by way of set-off to lessen or defeat its claim,</p>\n<p id=\"AQQ\">However, there remains the further question of whether the trustee may a\u00a1so&gt; by way 0f set-off, reduce the propeldy wj1icl1 the government has received without prejudice to and without adjudication of the trustee\u2019s rights. The g0Vernment\u2019s position in this respect is ^\u00edat, though it intervened in the bankruptcy proceedings in order to obtain property to which it held legal titlej it d\u00a1d ncd thereby consent, (1), that the trugtee migM get off ag againgt the property\u2019s value any damages alleged to bave been incurred by the bankrupt on account 0f the government\u2019s alleged breach in performing its part of the contract or&gt; (2); that the bankrupt estete might aggert lieng ariging under state law against that property, either in its own ri\u00bbht or in behalf of em\u201c Ployees claiming liens for labor or in any other resPect- :t insists that to allow any such a^ainst the ProP\u2019 erty m satisfaction of the trustee s demands violates the rule of immunity of the sovereign from suit and the subordinate rule forbidding perfection of liens a\u00aeamst Property of the United States- The trustee in bankruptcy, on the other hand\u2019 ar^ues that&gt; inasmuch as the Property was in possession of the trustee and m the custody of the court&gt; when the government invoked the jurisdlct!\u00b0n, 1 tblcourt \u201c \u00b0fder rec\u00b0vf it, it clothed the court with authority to entertain and allow the trustee s coun- , , . \u00ab , . , ,, terclaim of set-oix against the property trustee\u2019s , \u201c , ^ f, satlsiy tae trustee s demand on both its general claim and its a\u00a1]eged \u00a1jeng</p>\n<p id=\"aqx-dedup-0\">^be referee and the District Court beld that the court had jurisdiction to entertain this counterclaim against the property, for two reasons: (1), inasmuch as the court had custody of the property, by filing the reclamation petition, the United States consented to the jurisdiction of the court to determine the rights of all parties in the property, and (2), the court had jurisdiction by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>virtue of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"ark-dedup-0\">Apparently the trustee has abandoned his reliance on the Tucker Act. Clearly jurisdiction here cannot be based on its provisions, which restrict the jurisdiction of district courts over claims against the United States to those \u201cnot exceeding $10,000\u201d. Although that Act\u2019s category of permissible claims, namely, \u201cfor liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort\u201d, may be broad enough to include actions such as this, the trustee asserts a right of set-off in excess of $155,000. This is clearly beyond the consent granted in that Act 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\"> N0l;,Cai! COnsen\u201c\u00b0 b\u00ae sfd be implied from the terms of the Bankruptcy Act. The trotee insists that the Act applies to the United States just as it does to any other person. But the United States, as a sovereign, is not bound by a statute which m its general terms would divest it of pre-existing rights or 1406; United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884. Moreover, the Supreme Court has specifically held that the United States is not subject to the general provisions of the Bankruptcy Act unless specifically named therein. Guarantee Title &amp; Trust Company v. Title Guaranty &amp; Surety Company, 224 U.S. 152, 155, 32 S.Ct. 457, 56 L.Ed. 706; United States v. Herron, 87 U.S. 251, 260-264, 22 L.Ed. 275. The sovereign immunity from suit is a right and privilege which can be divested only by specific congressional enactment so providing. United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894.</p>\n<p id=\"A0OL\">The question remaining, therefore, is whether, by its intervention in the proceeding below, the United' States consented to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the counterclaim against the property. In tire language of the Supreme Court, speaking in United States v. Shaw, 309 U.S. 495, 500-501, 60 S.Ct. 659, 661, 84 L.Ed. 888, \"As a foundation for the examination of that question we may lay the postulate that without specific statutory consent, ^ no su^ may be brought against the United States. No officer by his action can eonfer jurisdiction. Even when suits are authorized they must be brought only in designated courts. The reasons for this immunity are imbedded in our legal Philosophy. They partake somewhat of dignity and decorum, somewhat of practical^ administration, somewhat of the Political desirability of an impregnable citadel where _ government as dis-from its functionaries may operate undisturbed by the demands of litigants.\u201d Again, in Nassau Smelting &amp; Refining Works v. United States, 266. U.S. 101, 106 45 S.Ct. 25 69 L.Ed. 190, the court said; \u00abThe objection to a suit against the United stateg ia fundamen_ tal&gt; whether it be in the form of an orig_ inal action&gt; or a set.off or a counterclaim. Jurisdicti0n in either case does: not exist&gt; uniess there ig specific con.</p>\n<p id=\"AvcS\">The postulate to be distilled from the cases is, as we have observed, that the United States, by initiating an action as a plaintiff, consents to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain any defensive plea including the right of set-0ff to the extent of the government\u2019s claim, but does not thereby consent to an affirmative judgment on a counterclaim. stated differently, this consent empowers the court to decide all issues necessary to dispose of the general claim initiated by the government, but doesnotf as in the case of private litigants under the Federal Rules, extend to power to decide separate affirmative claims -which the defendant may have by way of counterclaim.

United States, 8 Cir., 66 F.2d 573, 92 A.L.R. 1484, certiorari denied 291 U.S. 672, 54 S.Ct. 457, 78 L.Ed. 1061; Jones v. Watts, 5 Cir., 142 F.2d 575,163 A.L.R. 240; United States v. National City Bank of New York, 2 Cir., 83 F.2d 236.</p>\n<p id=\"AaFr\">In United States v. Alabama, supra, the government sought to quiet title to certain real estate against which the state asserted liens. The state court had entered a decree of sale and directed a certificate of purchase to issue to the state. The government sought to have the liens declared invalid and to set aside the judgment of the state court. The Supreme Court sustained the validity of the liens, inasmuch as they had attached before the government acquired the real estate but held them unenforcible so long as the land remained the property of the United States. The judgment of sale was accordingly set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"AUtP\">In United States v. Ansonia Brass &amp; Copper Co., 218 U.S. 452, 31 S.Ct. 49, 54 L.Ed. 1107, the United States had entered into separate contracts with Trigg, a Virginia corporation, for the construetion of three vessels. While the ships were in various stages of construction, creditors of Trigg filed an action in the state court asserting a lien on its property under the state statute. A receiver took possession of Trigg\u2019s property, in-eluding the three vessels. The United States intervened, asking that the ves-seis and material on hand be released to it. A judgment holding the creditors\u2019 lien superior to the government\u2019s title was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed as to the Benyuard, under the contract for the construction of wnich title to all equipment and parts of the vessel upon which progress payments had been made passed to the United States immediately. The court ruled that no lien could attach against the vessel by operation of state law, without the express consent of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">In North Dakota-Montana Wheat Growers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. United States, 8 Cir., 66 F.2d 573, 92 A.L.R. 1484, certiorari denied 291 U.S. 672, 54 S.Ct. 457, 78 L.Ed. 1061, the United States filed a bill to foreclose a mortgage on real estate, The mortgagor did not deny the averments of the bill, but asserted a right to an accounting for a quantity of wheat, allegedly delivered to agencies of the Federal Farm Board, for the purpose of setting off against the money due the mortgagee sufficient sums to satisfy the note and mortgage. This was declared attempt to sue the United States without its^ consent. See also Jones v. Watts, 5 Cir., 142 F.2d 575, 163 A.L.R. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"Agl\">ln United States v. National City Bank of New York, 2 Cir., 83 F.2d 236, the United States, as assignee of the Government of Russia, asserted title to certain funds deposited in a bank to the use of Russia. The bank\u2019s answer admitted Russia\u2019s title, but averred that the bank held overdue promissory notes of that government in excess of the amount of the deposits and asserted a right to set-off its claim. The court approved this position, but only to defeat the government\u2019s claim,</p>\n<p id=\"Ag9\">in In re Read-York, Inc., 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 313, the bankrupt had agreed to build three gliders for the United States, The contract provided that upon makjug progress payments, the title to the material to which the payments were applicable would vest in the United States, The District Court held that creditors 0f the bankrupt could assert title against the property. This court reversed, holding that the laws of the state could not operate to defeat the government\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"aqa-dedup-1\">The cases cited by the trustee do not impinge upon the soundness of these decisions. United States v. The Thekla, 266 U.S. 328) 45 S.Ct. 112, 113, 69 L.Ed. 313, grew out of a collision between the Thekla and the steamship Luckenbach, opera'ced by the United States. The United States filed a libel against thii Thekla. Her owners answered by a cross-libel against the Luckenbach. The court allowed the cross-libel and\" entered judgment in admiralty against the Unit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ed States, on the theory that the collision, not the vessel first libeled, was the subject matter of the action. By bringing the original libel the United States had consented to the jurisdiction of the court \u201cthat justice may be done with regard to the subject matter\u201d, viz., the adjudication of fault in the collision, See United States v. Shaw, 309 U.S. 495, 502, 503, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888.</p>\n<p id=\"ang-dedup-0\">The Siren, 7 Wall. 152, 19 L.Ed. 129, also arose in admiralty. There the United States filed a libel seeking to condemn the Siren as lawful prize. Before this proceeding was instituted and while the vessel was in the hands of a prize crew and in the possession of the United States she collided with and sank the sloop Harper. The court allowed a claim by the owners of the Harper against the proceeds of sale of the Siren in the hands of the admiralty court on the theory that title to the vessel was not perfect in the United States until the judgment of condemnation had declared the vessel lawful prize. Therefore, the United States, having placed the vessel and its proceeds in the course of judicial administration, was held to have consented to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over any claims against the vessel, which arose prior to that of the government, See Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, 438-439, 25 L.Ed. 209.</p>\n<p id=\"A7i2\">t, , t~&gt; i ttt i \u2022 . t, j. Brent v. Bank of Washington, 10 Pet. ... . T . . . ,. \u201e 596, 9 L.Ed. 547, involved a question of . .. \u201e , . , , ,, , priority of claims only, not an attempt f , , . . \u2019 i to assert a claim against property which . , . , ,, TT concededly belonged to the United States. In United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 1 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed. 171, the <em>. . . i </em>,. . . court treated an action for possession of lands m the hands of certain officials of the United States as one against the officials, not against the government itself. This decision, rendered shortly after the Civil War, is explainable, we think, as an application of a firm judicial hand extended to exert a calming in-fiuence over the hysteria, and oftentimes injustice, prevailing in relations between the Nation\u2019s Government and the citizens of the defeated Confederate States. At any rate, the Court expressly denied that it was condoning an action against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"AYUO\">United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 8 L.Ed. 899, was an action in assumpsit by the United States against a former federal marshal for $345 received by him by virtue of his office. The defendant answered, claiming an amount due him by the government of some $1100 as poundage fees under the laws of the State of Maryland on a body execution against one Gates at the suit of the United States. Gates had been released ^rom_ defendant s custody by order of the President. The defendant s claim was allowed only to the extent necessary to defeat the unsecured claim of the government, the court treating this as a defensive set-off, although there is no intimation that the claims arose out of same transaction. Nothing in this case however persuades us that, when considered with the later pronounce-ments of the Supreme^ Court in the Fidelity, Shaw, Ansonia and United States v. Alabama cases, the trustee in bankruptcy may assert liens or demands ngninst the title of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"A01p\">We are of the opinion that a distinction must be drawn between the two aspects of the government\u2019s claims, namely, its reclamation petition and its claim on the contract. This is necessary because, under the contract, title .. to the materials m question was express- , , . TT ., , ly reserved m the United States. The , . , ,. . trustee, standing m the shoes of the , . . \u00b0 ,, , ,. bankrupt, concedes that title remained . ,, \u201e , g , , United States, but argues that, \u201d T\u00ae \u201c custody of the court, when the government filed itfl reclamation petition, it consented to the jurisdiction of the court to Betfle all daims against the itBdf.</p>\n<p id=\"ayn-dedup-0\">We think that the fact that the property was in the custody of the court is not decisive. Our inquiry must turn on a determination of the extent of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the United States. We conclude that, since the latter retained title to the property, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>lien or claim on behalf of the bankrupt or its creditors could attach thereto by operation of state law while the prop\u25a0erty was in the hands of the bankrupt. United States v. Alabama, 313 U.S. 274, 282, 61 S.Ct. 1011, 85 L.Ed. 1327; United States v. Ansonia Brass .&amp; Copper Co., 218 U.S. 452, 31 S.Ct. 49. 54 L.Ed. 1107; In re Read-York, Inc., 7 Cir., 152 F.2d 313. The rights of the trustee in this respect are no more extensive than those of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors, and the court\u2019s jurisdiction extended, therefore, to only one issue, viz., the question of title. Having found title to be in the United States, it had no jurisdiction to entertain demands .against the same for damages or for liens. United States v. Ansonia, etc., supra; Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433 25 LEd 209</p>\n<p id=\"azx-dedup-1\">The receiver argues that immunity was waived by the action of offi\u25a0cers of the United States. This result is said to grow out of the fact that no \u25a0answer to the counterclaim denying jurisdiction was filed. The argument, as we understand it, is that the government, by bringing suit, consented to the resolution of all questions that might be put in issue, as to the property owned by the government, and that, if the court did not have jurisdiction initially, failure of the government to answer acts as a waiver of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"axq-dedup-0\">This argument ignores the settled rule that the government cannot lose its immunity by any act or omission of its agents, and that consent to be sued cannot be implied from the action or inaction of its officers. United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 309 U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894 (failure to appeal an adverse judgment does not work an estoppel against the government); Minnesota v. United States, 305 U.S. 382, 59 S.Ct. 292, 83 L. Ed. 235 (stipulation by the United States Attorney for removal of a cause to a federal court does not give the court jurisdiction, where the state court in which the action was brought had none, notwithstanding the fact that the action might properly have been filed initially in the federal courts); Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, 25 L.Ed. 209 (The Secretary of the Treasury could not waive the immunity of the United States from suit by participating in actions in state courts for possession of lands); North Dakota-Montana Wheat Growers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. United States, 8 Cir., 66 F.2d 573, 92 A.L.R. 1484, certiorari denied 291 U.S. 672, 54 S.Ct. 457, 78 L.Ed. 1061. Cf., United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 8 L.Ed. 899. The fact that the property here involved was in the custody of the bankruptcy court initially did not, we think, defeat the application of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"AGE\">We conclude that the District Court had jurisdiction to entertain and determine the trustee\u2019s counterclaims in so far as they ran against and asserted set-offs to lessen or defeat the government\u2019s unsecured claim for damages, but not to allow any part thereof, over and above the amount of the government\u2019s general claim, as an affirmative judgment against the United States, and, further, that the court had no jurisdiction to allow the trustee\u2019s counterclaim as a set-off against the government\u2019s title to property which belonged to it and which it was compelled to come to the court to reclaim. Against such a reclamation, we think, the bankrupt had no right to assert its general claim for damages, or any claims for liens. A claim of title made by the government in eourt is not a concession that its title may be subjected to demands or liens without congressional consent. The order from which the appeal is taken is affirmed in so far as it allows the trustee to off-set its demand for damages, to lessen or defeat the government\u2019s unsecured claim. In so far as it contemplates jurisdiction to allow the trustee\u2019s counterclaim for damages or for liens in such a manner as to defeat or lessen the title of the United States to the property involved, it is reversed. The cause will be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
