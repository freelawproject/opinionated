With reference to the liability under \u00a7 102,1.R.C. 26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 102, taxpayer had the burden of overcoming the effect not only of the Commissioner\u2019s determination but also the additional burden created by \u00a7 102 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the basis of the Tax Court\u2019s findings, which are amply supported by the evidence, taxpayer did not meet those requirements. Especially, as a considerable part of the evidence consisted of oral testimony of witnesses seen and heard by Judge Murdock, we cannot upset his findings, and we accept his logically inferred legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-21\">We agree with the decision, and Judge Murdock\u2019s reasoning, that the margin contract with the broker did not constitute indebtedness within I.R.C. \u00a7 719(a) (1), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 719(a) (1) and 35.719a of Regulation 112. We need only add that we think the decision not at odds with Brewster Shirt Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 159 F.2d 227, 229. For there, in holding that a factoring agreement constituted a \u201cmortgage\u201d within \u00a7 719(a) (1), we said that to hold otherwise would be \u201cto subject Factoring Agreements to burdensome excess profits taxes\u201d, and added: \u201cFactoring Agreements are common enough but are frequently entered into by persons of only moderate financial strength who cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>obtain the money they need from commercial banks and must borrow at higher cost from institutions having greater freedom in the risks they may take when making loans. We cannot suppose that it was the intention of Congress to subject security given under Factoring Agreements to a form of taxation which would in effect discriminate against those arrangements in favor of secured bank loans, especially when borrowers from Factors are a class frequently least able to bear the burden.\u201d Obviously, such a rationale has no application to a margin transaction with a broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-22\"><em>. </em>Section 102(c) reads: \u201cThe fact that the earnings or profits of a corporation are permitted to accumulate beyond the rea,sonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the purpose to avoid surtax upon shareholders unless the corporation by the clear preponderance</p>\n<p id=\"aas-dedup-1\">of the evidence shall prove to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAU\">See also \u00a7 102(b) which reads: \u201cThe fact that any corporation is a mere holding or investment company shall be prima facie evidence of a purpose to avoid surtax upon shareholders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
