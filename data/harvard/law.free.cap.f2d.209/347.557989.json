United States, 10 Cir., 1952, 201 F.2d 118. The government, however, contends that our conclusions in that case are erroneous and asks us to reexamine the question and overrule our former decision. Suffice it to say we have given further consideration to the question presented and a majority of the court adheres to the views expressed in our former decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The judgment appealed from is, therefore, Affirmed on authority of United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. United States, 10 Cir., 201 F.2d 118. See, also, General Casualty Co. of America v. United States. 5 Cir., 205 F.2d 758.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
