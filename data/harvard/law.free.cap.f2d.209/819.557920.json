The drug was seized during a search of his room without a warrant. Seeds were found in a paper bag in a chest of drawers, and cigarettes in the pocket of a coat hanging in a closet. The seeds and cigarettes were introduced in evidence. The present question is whether appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence, on the ground that the search was unlawful, should have been granted. The trial court, sitting without a jury, found that appellant consented to the search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-25\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, a police sergeant testified: \u201c * * I identified myself to him as a police officer and asked him if I couldn\u2019t talk to him in his room. * * * He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>that that was all right and asked me to accompany him to his room. * * * I told him then about the information that I had, that I had received from the various sources, and he denied this information, denied that he was engaged in any narcotic drug traffic. I asked him then if I could look around. He stated that I could, was perfectly welcome to look anywhere in his room that I wanted to.\u201d Another policeman gave similar testimony. All this was repeated in substance at the trial. Appellant testified at the trial that the officers arrested him in the street, took him to his room, and searched it without asking or receiving permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We assume for present purposes that the officers\u2019 testimony was true and the appellant's false. Even so, we think the record does not support the finding that appellant consented to the search. We think the motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Words or acts that would show consent in some circumstances do not show it in others. \u201cNon-resistance to the orders or suggestions of the police is not infrequent * * *; true consent, free of fear or pressure, is not so readily to be found.\u201d Judd v. United States, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 66, 190 F. 2d 649, 651. If a valid confession' precedes a search by police, permission may show true consent to the search. That was the situation in United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, 64 S.Ct. 896, 88 L.Ed. 1140, on which appellee relies. But no sane man who denies his guilt would actually be willing that policemen search his room for contraband which is certain to be discovered. It follows that when police identify themselves as such, search a room, and find contraband in it, the occupant's words or signs of acquiescence in the search, accompanied by denial of guilt, do not show consent; at least in the absence of some extraordinary circumstance, such as ignorance that contraband is present. No such circumstance is shown here.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436, illustrates the principle. There policemen knocked on a door and \u201ca voice inside asked who was there. \u2018Lieutenant Belland,\u2019 was the reply. There was a slight delay, some \u2018shuffling or noise\u2019 in the room and then the defendant opened the door. The officer said, T want to talk to you a little bit.\u2019 She then, as he describes it, \u2018stepped back acquiescently and admitted us.\u2019 \u201d 333 U.S. at page 12, 68 S.Ct. at page 368. The Supreme Court held that the search which followed was unlawful and the evidence seized should have been suppressed. The Court said: \u201cEntry to defendant\u2019s living quarters, which was the beginning of the search, was demanded under color of office. It was granted in submission to authority rather than as an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right.\u201d 333 U.S. at page 13, 68 S.Ct. at pagn 368. Cf. Gibson v. United States, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 81, 149 F.2d 381; Judd v. United States, supra; Nelson v. United States, 1953, 93 U.S.App.D.C.--, 208 F.2d 505, certiorari denied 346 U. S. 827, 74 S.Ct. 48; Catalanotte v. United States, 6 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 264. We do not agree with United States v. MacLeod, 7 Cir., 1953, 207 F.2d 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-26\">. The government does not contend that there was probable cause for the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
