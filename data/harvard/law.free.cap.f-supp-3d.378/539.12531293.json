Count One plainly alleges that Defendants \"knowingly and willfully conspire[d], combine[d], confederate[d], and agree[d] together\" to violate the Anti-Riot Act. (Dkt. 8 \u00b6 9). The indictment further alleges numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)-(o) ). Moreover, Count One plainly alleges the elements of the underlying Anti-Riot Act offense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Although Defendant may be dissatisfied with the level of factual detail provided in Count One, \"[t]he Supreme Court has held that where conspiracy is the 'gist of the crime' all that is necessary in the indictment is that the object of the conspiracy be set forth sufficiently to identify the offense which the defendant is charged with conspiring to commit.\"\n   <em>\n    Matzkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530280\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/14/1014/#p1019\">\n    14 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1019 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wong Tai v.

Here, the charged conspiracy involves four defendants, (dkt. 8 \u00b6 1), but the substantive offense under \u00a7 2101 can be committed by a single person, so the third party exception applies and precludes application of Wharton's Rule.

This argument is without merit, as the indictment plainly alleges Defendants possessed \"intent ... to incite a riot,\" (dkt. 8 \u00b6 13), and includes factual allegations that could bear on whether Defendants intended to incite a riot, such as Defendants' alleged purchase of athletic tape and baseball helmets prior to the alleged August 11, 2017 riot on the grounds of UVA, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10(i) ), and alleged \"wrapping [of] their hands with athletic tape\" prior to the alleged August 12, 2017 riot in and around Emancipation Park, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10(l) ). Moreover, as discussed in the next subsection, the Government is not required to define terms like \"incitement\" in exquisite detail, and the indictment's factual allegations of incitement are sufficient to give Defendants notice of the charges against them. Finally, because the Court rejects Defendants' as-applied arguments with respect to \u00a7 2101, it also rejects Defendants' cursory as-applied argument regarding Count One's conspiracy charge under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . (Dkt. 72 at 25).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Specifically, Defendants opine that the factual allegations in Count Two do not \"identify the contours of the 'riot' that is alleged to be at the heart of these charges,\" contain \"any specific facts\" regarding acts of violence Defendants committed, \"establish\" that Defendant \"did or said anything\" to incite a riot, \"sufficiently allege that [Defendants] participated in or carried on in a riot,\" allege that that Defendants traveled in interstate commerce with the requisite intent, or specifically allege that Defendants aided or abetted anyone in relation to a riot. (Dkt. 72 at 9- 10). As described above, many of these conclusory arguments are belied by a plain reading of the indictment, which specifically alleges that Defendants travelled in interstate commerce with the requisite intent, (dkt. 8 \u00b6 13), as well as when and where the alleged riots and overt acts occurred, (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n     \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)-(b) ). The Government need only provide the \"essential facts\" of the charged offense under Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1), and the indictment here meets that standard.
