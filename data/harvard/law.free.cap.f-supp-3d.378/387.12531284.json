The question before me is whether, once a jury has unanimously agreed that a firearm was brandished, it must also unanimously agree that the firearm employed was the specific weapon identified in the indictment. Because I conclude that the type of firearm used is not an element of the offense defined by \u00a7 924(c), and because in this case the variance between the Government's proof at trial and the language of the indictment cannot be said to have prejudiced any substantial right of the Defendant, his Motion to Vacate his conviction for brandishing a weapon will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The charges against Defendant Terrance Hill arose from his participation in an armed robbery of a Subway sandwich shop on Lancaster Avenue in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia on January 18, 2014. Along with three accomplices, Hill took cash from the store's register, and in the process brandished a firearm in the presence of a Subway employee. The robbery was one of a series in which Hill had participated, together with another perpetrator, Shyheem Williams\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , who, like Hill, also had access to a handgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   With respect to the \u00a7 924(c) offense, the Indictment charged Hill with carrying and brandishing a particular firearm, a SAR ARMS 9mm handgun, Model SARB6P, with an obliterated serial number. As the case proceeded, the Government eventually concluded that the weapon brandished by Hill during the Subway robbery was a different one, a weapon that was in fact later confiscated from his accomplice, Shyheem Williams. At trial, the Government then presented evidence suggesting that the gun brandished by Hill actually belonged to Williams, from whom it was ultimately seized. During its deliberations, the jury astutely recognized that the Government's evidence at trial differed from the terms of the Indictment. It communicated a question to the Court, as follows: \"To be found guilty of brandished [sic] a firearm does the firearm have to be SAR ARMS 9 mm? Can it be any gun?\" Def.'s Ex. B, ECF No. 56-2. Because the correct answer required a nuanced analysis of competing opinions from the Court of Appeals, rather than delay the jury's deliberations, I reserved ruling on the legal question, and submitted a supplemental interrogatory that would provide clarity as to the factual basis for whatever verdict the jury reached. The jury was asked: \"If you found defendant TERRANCE HILL guilty on Count 2 ... please answer the following interrogatory as well: Do you unanimously find that the firearm that was brandished was an SAR ARMS 9 mm handgun?\" The jury answered this question in the negative, leading to Defendant's Motion to Vacate. Supplemental Jury Interrog., ECF No. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defense relies upon\n   <em>\n    United States v. Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the jury can only convict based on the\n   weapon specified in the indictment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529905\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/587/#p597\">\n    866 F.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597 (3d Cir. 1989),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Government responds that the language from\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   forming the basis for Defendant's argument was later characterized as dicta in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Wise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644159\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/207/#p214\">\n    515 F.3d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (3d Cir. 2008), where the Court of Appeals reached a contrary result. Having carefully studied these competing decisions, I am persuaded that the Government is correct that\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   sets the controlling standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   was a prosecution for conspiracy, including a \u00a7 924(c)(1) charge for using a firearm to further drug trafficking. The evidence included a shotgun found inside an apartment used by the defendants, where drugs and drug paraphernalia were also found, and three additional weapons found outside in a trash can on the porch of the property, which were not recovered until after the defendants had been taken into custody. The jury returned a conviction, but its verdict did not identify the specific weapon that formed the basis for its verdict. The Court of Appeals vacated the conviction because an element of the offense was the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of a firearm in furtherance of trafficking.\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529905\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/587/#p597\">\n    866 F.2d at 597-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it was confident that the shotgun inside the property where the drugs were found could be deemed to have furthered unlawful dealing, the court was concerned that the presence of guns on the porch did not rise above mere possession, which the statute did not criminalize. In the course of its analysis, the Court remarked that the trial judge had correctly instructed the jury it must be unanimous as to which firearm was involved.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529905\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/587/#p597\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529905\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/587/#p597\">\n    at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   , a separate panel of the Third Circuit deemed this language from\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   was also a prosecution for drug trafficking, in which the Government presented eyewitness testimony that both of the defendants brandished weapons during the course of their dealing-one a machine pistol, and the other a shotgun. Following conviction, Wise argued that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it must be unanimous as to which weapon he brandished. The Court of Appeals characterized this argument as one that did not merit \"extensive discussion\" because \"a specific type of firearm is not an element of a violation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A).\"\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644159\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/207/#p214\">\n    515 F.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   cited precedent from three sister circuits, and language from a Supreme Court case,\n   <em>\n    Richardson v.

In discussing whether unanimity as to the underlying criminal acts was required, the Court focused on the difference between the elements of an offense, and the means by which it is carried out, as follows: \"Where, for example, an element of robbery is force or the threat of force, some jurors might conclude that the defendant used a knife to create the threat; others might conclude he used a gun. But that disagreement-a disagreement about means-would not matter as long as all 12 jurors unanimously\n   concluded that the Government had proved the necessary related element, namely, that the defendant had threatened force.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133882\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/813/\">\n    526 U.S. at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133882\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/813/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In following\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   rather than\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   , I agree that the language on which Defendant relies was not essential to the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   , and is therefore dicta.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question of unanimity was squarely presented for decision in\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   , and the Court of Appeals answered it by adopting the rule followed in other circuits, with further consideration of the Supreme Court's approach in\n   <em>\n    Richardson.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, the substantive analysis in\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Theodoropoulos\n   </em>\n   because in each, the principal focus of the courts' discussion was on the elements of the offense defined by \u00a7 924(c). Moreover, as the Government points out, the comment to the Third Circuit's Model Instruction for \u00a7 924(c)(1) cites\n   <em>\n    Wise\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the jury need not be unanimous as to the type of gun possessed by the defendant. 3d Cir. Model Crim. Jury Instructions \u00a7 6.18.924A cmt. (2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, with respect to the type of harm \u00a7 924(c) is meant to deter, any display of a firearm in connection with threatened force exacts a toll upon those confronted with it. In sum, proof of a specific type of firearm is not an element of the offense set forth in \u00a7 924(c)(1). I therefore hold that the jury's unanimous conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Hill brandished\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   firearm is sufficient to sustain his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hill next argues that this court constructively amended the Indictment by allowing a conviction without jury unanimity as to the specific weapon used, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Under the Fifth Amendment, a Grand Jury must review and approve of criminal charges. It is therefore unlawful for a defendant to be convicted of a crime beyond what was charged in the Indictment.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Centeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278018\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/378/#p389\">\n    793 F.3d 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 (3d Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The supplemental interrogatory submitted here did not amount to a constructive amendment because the elements of the offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1) remained the same. There is no risk that the interrogatory modified \"the essential terms of the charged offense in such a way that there [was] a substantial likelihood that the jury may have convicted the defendant for an offense differing from the offense the indictment returned by the grand jury actually charged.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Daraio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2781495\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/445/253/#p259\">\n    445 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259-60 (3d Cir. 2006). On its face, Count Two of the Indictment charged Mr. Hill with brandishing \"a firearm,\" and the jury unanimously found that he did so. Indictment, Def.'s Ex. A, ECF No. 56-1. The Indictment went on to supply supplemental details concerning the weapon, but the difference between those identifying details and the evidence at trial did not have the effect of \"broadening\" the charge because the essence of the offense as defined by the statute was the act of brandishing\n   the firearm, not its specific characteristics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
