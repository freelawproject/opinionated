The Amended Complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Exchange Act\") and Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Rule 10b-5 by Vale, its Chief Executive Officers Murilo Ferreira (\"Ferreira\") and Fabio Schvartsman (\"Schvartsman\"), and its Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani Pires (\"Pires\").

(\n   <em>\n    Vale II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 12). On January 25, 2019, another tailings dam owned by Vale, at Feij\u00e3o, collapsed, killing hundreds of\n   people. (\n   <em>\n    Vale I\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    Vale II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ferreira served as Vale's CEO from 2011 to May of 2017, and Schvartsman has served as CEO since May 2017.
