As the determination of Plaintiff's exempt status under the FLSA turns on mixed issues of law and fact regarding Plaintiff's primary duties, her duties' relation to the general business operations of Silverton, and the amount of discretion those duties involved, the Court omits the parties' argumentative language and legal conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   What the parties do agree on is that Plaintiff was employed to review loan applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. [85-1], \u00b6 4; [100-2], \u00b66. Plaintiff did not play any role in the creation, development, or sale of residential loan products, nor did she communicate with prospective borrowers or advise customers on loan products. Doc.

No. [85-1], \u00b66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When determining whether a borrower qualified for a particular loan, Plaintiff would review the application in the context of various lender guidelines and criteria. Doc. No. [100-2], \u00b617. Plaintiff considered information such as the borrower's income,\n   assets, liabilities, and credit history, as well as the title, purchase contract, and appraisal associated with the property to be purchased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b67.

[86-1]; [86-3]; [120-6]. Plaintiff reviewed loans to ensure they fit the criteria set by the guidelines. Doc. No. [85-1], \u00b69;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [100-2], \u00b617. Plaintiff first reviewed loan applications under the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. Doc. No. [85-1], \u00b610. If the loan did not meet these guidelines, Plaintiff reviewed the loan under Silverton's Standard Operations Policy and Procedure Manual and Silverton's Selling Guide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The guidelines tell underwriters how to determine a customer's creditworthiness, including what factors to review, what documentation to review to determine those factors, and how long of an income/employment history to gather for the customer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b618;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [120-6], pp. 346-612, 386. When reviewing employment history, underwriters learned from the guidelines what information to look for and when it was necessary to get a letter of explanation from the customer. Doc. No. [85-1], \u00b622;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [120-6], pp. 358-453. The guidelines provide detailed instructions regarding numerous factors, including how to assess a borrower's eligibility, how to assess a property's eligibility, how to assess income, assets, liabilities, and credit history, and how to select appraisers and evaluate appraisals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [120-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Silverton's Policy and Procedure Manual and its Selling Guide are not limited to specifying when an underwriter can issue exceptions on a loan application, nor do they specify all cases when an underwriter can issue exceptions. Doc. No. [100-2], \u00b619. Rather, Silverton's Policy and Procedure Manual and Selling Guide provide, among other things, additional considerations the underwriter should consider in evaluating loan applications over and above what may be contained in other lender guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b620.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although Plaintiff considered the guidelines when underwriting loan applications, the guidelines do not specify or dictate all courses of action an underwriter must undertake to evaluate a loan application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b621. Sometimes these guidelines are very specific as to what they require.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Other times, however, they are silent on issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, the Fannie Mae guidelines require that an underwriter review the appraisal of a subject property to ensure that the property provides adequate collateral for the requested loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b622. In particular, the underwriter must review the appraisal to ensure that the appraiser has provided an accurate and reliable opinion of value that reflects the market value, condition, and marketability of the subject property in compliance with Fannie Mae's Selling Guide requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b623.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As another example, the underwriter might perform her own research to assess the soundness of the appraiser's reliance on certain comparable sales and request that the appraiser explain why he or she selected or excluded certain properties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b627. The Fannie Mae guidelines further require that the underwriter pay particular attention and institute extra due diligence for those loans in which the appraised value is believed to be excessive or when the value of the property has experienced\n   significant appreciation in a short time period since the prior sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b630. The Fannie Mae guidelines do not specify what constitutes an \"excessive\" appraised value or \"significant appreciation\" over a \"short time period,\" nor do they detail the \"extra due diligence\" that must be conducted in evaluating such loan applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31. While the Silverton Policy and Procedure Manual references \"excessive\" collateral, it leaves it up to the underwriter to decide whether to require an additional appraisal or additional documentation to support the property's value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b632. If an underwriter determined that an appraisal was deficient, the Fannie Mae guidelines suggest possible approaches to addressing this, including discussing the deficiencies with the appraiser, obtaining a desk or field review of the appraisal, or obtaining a new appraisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b633.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An underwriter could require borrowers to satisfy certain stipulations or conditions before the underwriter would approve the loan. Doc. Nos. [85-1], \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20; [100-2], \u00b612. However, the parties dispute whether underwriters could grant exceptions and approve loans that did not meet the guidelines without manager approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. [85-1], \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13; [100-2], \u00b6\u00b613, 14, 41, 42. The guidelines do not prescribe what stipulations the underwriter can demand and in what circumstances they can be demanded, or under what circumstances an underwriter can issue an exception or counter-offer. Doc. No. [100-2], \u00b643. Thus, while an underwriter's review and evaluation of a loan application is influenced by various guidelines, the guidelines do not dictate all course of action the underwriter must take in reaching a decision on the loan application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b645.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Work Hours\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant offers a multitude of facts regarding the hours of overtime that Plaintiff alleged in her complaint and discovery responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [84-2], \u00b6\u00b66-11. Defendant offers these facts in attempt to show that Plaintiff's claims have changed and, therefore, are not credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [61]. However, as credibility issues are for the jury, the Court finds these facts immaterial to determining whether there is evidence in the record to support Plaintiff's claims. Defendant also offers facts designed to show that particular statements in Plaintiff's deposition testimony are contradicted by other evidence in the record. Again, such contradictions are credibility issues for the jury. Ultimately, Plaintiff claims that she worked overtime hours for which she was not paid and her manager knew she worked such hours. Therefore, the Court only includes facts relevant to determining if there is a genuine dispute of fact (i.e. competing pieces of evidence in the record) regarding these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 24, 2016, Silverton's Operations Manager, Jen Burns, sent an email to Plaintiff's manager, David Freas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

She went on to suggest that he \"implement no authorized OT/or all OT must be prior approved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the ensuing exchange, both Burns and Freas acknowledged it would be unlikely that they could eliminate all overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.

Therefore, the Ninth Circuit concluded the underwriters were not \"administrators who manage, guide, and administer the business,\" but were engaged in production of the business's service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275987\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/847/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the absence of contrary precedent within this Circuit, the Court agrees with the Second and Sixth Circuits' analyses. Like the underwriters in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McKeen-Chaplin\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff analyzed loan applications utilizing pre-determined guidelines for risk provided to her by her employer and arrived at a yes-or-no decision on the application. There is no dispute that she never advised customers or marketed Silverton's loans. Furthermore, the fact that Silverton paid underwriters bonuses based on the amount of loans they \"turned\" and the accuracy of those decisions, indicates that Silverton viewed the underwriters' role as one related to production. Therefore, this Court determines that Plaintiff's job did not relate to management or to general business operations as contemplated by the Code of Federal Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Discretion and independent judgment on matters of significance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's job duties satisfy the third prong because she exercised discretion and independent judgment to ultimately decide whether Silverton should assume the risk of a particular loan. Doc. No. [85], pp. 23-25. Defendant also argues that her work involved matters of significance because her choices bound Silverton \"on substantial financial matters without seeking prior approval or signoff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   But, in light of the guidance provided in the Code of Federal Regulations, the Court does not find this to be the type of discretion and independent judgment envisioned by the exemption. First, Plaintiff's discretion and judgment regarding Silverton's risk was not truly independent: the guidelines prescribed the parameters of risk that Silverton would be willing to take on and Plaintiff had to work within those parameters. Plaintiff had no authority or discretion to independently decide to revise Silverton's risk tolerance. While Plaintiff could decide to require additional conditions of a customer or to investigate a suspicious appraisal value, she could not decide to expand the scope of defined risk that the lender was willing to take on. Rather than truly \"independent\" judgment, Plaintiff's job involved using her\n   training and years of experience to arrive at decisions that comported with, and were guided by, the guidelines. Furthermore, as the Code of Federal Regulations explicitly noted, it is not enough that Silverton would experience financial consequences if Plaintiff made errors in judgment. Therefore, the Court determines that Plaintiff did not exercise discretion and independent judgment on matters of significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment regarding Plaintiffs' claims on two grounds: (1) Silverton lacked any knowledge of Plaintiff working overtime for which she was not paid, and (2) Plaintiff cannot meet her burden of showing she performed work for which she was not paid. Doc. No. [61], p.13. Additionally, Defendant seeks summary judgment on any claim for overtime prior to March 1, 2017, when Silverton's new overtime policy was communicated to the underwriters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Knowledge of Plaintiff Working Overtime For Which She Was Not Paid\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff's claims regarding Silverton's overtime policy are \"flatly contradicted by the record, and no reasonable jury could believe Plaintiff's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. However, Defendant's own argument demonstrates that there are competing pieces of evidence in the record, creating a dispute of fact to be resolved by the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, Defendant asserts that there is no dispute that Silverton did not limit the number of overtime hours that Plaintiff could report and be paid for.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. However, the email from Freas to the underwriters regarding Silverton's overtime policy is open to a contrary interpretation. While Defendant asserts that it \"simply required underwriters to request pre-approval for overtime and to try not to work more than 7 overtime hours each week,\" a reasonable jury could find otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The email does not say underwriters should\n   <strong>\n    try\n   </strong>\n   not to work more than 7 hours of overtime; it says \"Max OT is 7 hours per week.\" Doc. No. [119-42]. A jury could find that the policy placed a hard limit on overtime. Also, the email says \"[t]o justify OT, the pipeline must exceed the minimum 2 new loans and 3/4 conditions without extenuating circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A reasonable jury could conclude that overtime, regardless of whether it was being worked or not, would not be approved unless the required amount of loans and conditions were completed. Furthermore, in the April 25, 2017 email, Plaintiff indicated that she was working overtime hours which she was not reporting and for which she was not getting paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [111-53]. A reasonable jury could, in conjunction with the email regarding the overtime policy, find that Freas knew Plaintiff was working overtime that under Silverton's policy she was not allowed to report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant points to Plaintiff's timesheets and those of other underwriters as proof that the policy did not prohibit underwriters from reporting and receiving more than seven hours of overtime. Doc. No. [61], p. 14. However, the fact that on some occasions Plaintiff reported (or was allowed to report) overtime, and was paid for it, does not defeat her claim that there were other hours that she worked that she was not allowed to report and was not paid for. Likewise, the fact that other underwriters were paid for overtime hours they reported (even in excess of seven hours), does not conclusively demonstrate the falsity of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, Defendant also argues there is no dispute that Silverton did not instruct Plaintiff to underreport her overtime hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Defendant contends Plaintiff's deposition testimony about her conversations with Freas regarding changing her timesheets occurring by phone on Monday mornings is \"conclusively contradict[ed]\" by the phone logs which do not show any phone calls between Plaintiff and Freas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. However, Plaintiff also testified to in-person conversations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [111], pp. 206-07, 300-01, 411-12. The believability of Plaintiff's testimony is a question for the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Establishing Hours Worked\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant first argues that the burden-shifting scheme laid out in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    328 U.S. 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    66 S.Ct. 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"377256\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/328/680/\">\n    90 L.Ed. 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1946), does not apply because Silverton kept accurate and adequate time records. Doc. No. [61], pp. 16-17. However, Plaintiff's claims are that Silverton did just the opposite. Plaintiff is claiming that the records Silverton maintained are not accurate because she was instructed not to report all of her hours on her time sheets. If there were no evidence in the record to support that claim, applying the burden-shifting framework might be inappropriate. However, the March 1, 2017 and April 25, 2017 emails provide enough evidence to suggest that Silverton's time records may be inaccurate. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Mt. Clemens Pottery's\n   </em>\n   burden-shifting scheme does apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant then contends that even under the burden-shifting framework, Plaintiff's claims fail as a matter of law. Defendant argues that Plaintiff cannot rely on mere speculation, and she cannot proffer sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude that she worked overtime hours or the extent of those hours. Doc. No. [61], p. 20-21. According to Defendant, \"Plaintiff's claims concerning the hours she purportedly worked have varied dramatically over the course of discovery and are based on bare assertions and rank speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court previously addressed Defendant's argument about the evolution of Plaintiff's claims in its order on Defendant's motion for sanctions. The same rationale applies here. There is no doubt that Plaintiff's estimation of her hours changed from the one given in her complaint and initial disclosures. However, most FLSA plaintiffs have to start with a reconstruction of their hours from memory. Revision of that estimate after a plaintiff receives materials from her employer through discovery is common. Even if her revision was \"dramatic,\" as Defendant describes it, that does not automatically make it speculative or false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As for support for Plaintiff's approximations, her amended interrogatory responses show that her revised estimates are based on Silverton's computer activity logs and parking records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. [119-40].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendant, again, asserts that these records are contradicted by the record. Doc. No. [61], p. 25. It is true that Defendant has evidence that, during some of the times Plaintiff estimates she was working, she was actually at doctor's appointments or other engagements. But, that does not necessarily negate all of Plaintiff's estimate. In addition to Silverton's computer and parking logs, Plaintiff cites evidence of emails sent outside of work hours. It is for the jury to determine how credible Plaintiff's claims and testimony are, and whether she has adequately demonstrated that she worked hours for which she was not paid. To be sure, Plaintiff has an uphill battle. Defendant has plenty of impeachment evidence with which to undermine Plaintiff's credibility. But, such a determination is for the jury to make; not for this Court to make at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Overtime Hours Prior to March 1, 2017\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant also presents a cursory argument that it is entitled to summary judgment on any overtime claims prior to March 1, 2017, because \"Plaintiff has not presented any evidence that Silverton knew prior to its implementation of the new overtime policy that Plaintiff was working overtime.\" Doc. No. [61], p. 26. Plaintiff provides, if possible, an even more cursory response which asserts that a reasonable jury could infer employer knowledge from the numerous emails Plaintiff sent to her manager outside of work hours. Doc. No. [84], p. 25. The Court provides an appropriately cursory ruling. Defendant pointed to a lack of evidence in the record, and Plaintiff responded by pointing to evidence in the record. Therefore, summary judgment is inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Doc. No. [60]. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . Doc. No. [61]. The parties are\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to file their consolidated pre-trial order within\n   <strong>\n    thirty (30) days\n   </strong>\n   of the entry of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court does not attempt to resolve objections that do not comport with the Local Rules.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    NDGa LR 56.1(B)(2), (3) (requiring \"concise, nonargumentative responses\" that either (1) directly refute the fact with concise responses supported by specific evidence, (2) state a valid objection to the admissibility of the fact, (3) point out that the citation does not support the fact, or (4) object that the fact is not material). The parties frequently provide voluminous, argumentative responses, spanning multiple pages, which do not simply refute a given fact, but attempt to introduce new facts or to argue for a different characterization of a fact.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. Nos. [85-1], \u00b6 4 (response spans eight pages); [100-2], \u00b66 (response spans four pages). The parties also frequently use phrases in their responses such as \"subject to the foregoing ...\" or \"by way of further clarification ...\" as a precursor to the introduction of new facts or an argument for a different characterization of a fact.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. Nos. [84-2], \u00b6 1; [85-1], \u00b65; [100-2], \u00b64. The Local Rules do not allow for the introduction of facts through a party's response. Therefore, the Court only considers facts laid out in the parties' statements of fact or statements of additional fact, and does not consider those introduced in the parties' responses. The Local Rules also do not provide for argument in a party's response; the parties should reserve argument for their briefs. Therefore, the Court ignores argumentative responses. Defendant Silverton frequently objects to a fact on the grounds that it is \"vague and ambiguous.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Doc. No. [85-1], p. 16. As this is not a proper objection under LR 56.1, and as the stated facts with supporting evidence speak for themselves, the Court overrules these objections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The conflicting evidence in this case is very different from that cited by Defendant in\n    <em>\n     Scott v.

The videotape from the police cruiser showed the driver going \"shockingly fast,\" swerving, crossing the center line, running red lights, and forcing other vehicles to the shoulder of the road. The Court concluded that the Court of Appeals should have viewed the facts in light of the videotape and not accepted the version of facts proffered by the driver. Based on the indisputable video evidence, no jury could believe the driver was not endangering human life.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n     at 380\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555943\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/372/#p378\">\n     127 S.Ct. 1769\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
