Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. (Dkt. 38.) For the reasons addressed below, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are current and former doctoral students of Capella University that hail from Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. Defendants are Capella Education Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Capella University, Inc. (collectively, \"Capella\"), both of which are Minnesota corporations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Capella offers multiple online doctoral degree programs. Before enrolling in Capella's doctoral programs, Plaintiffs received information from Capella via emails, website content, or conversations with Capella recruiters. Through each of these sources, Plaintiffs contend, Capella represented its doctoral programs as shorter and less expensive than the programs actually were. Plaintiffs purportedly relied on Capella's representations of the time and cost to complete the programs when deciding to enroll. Plaintiffs allege that, after enrolling in Capella's doctoral programs, Capella created obstacles so as to prolong the programs and collect more tuition. These alleged obstacles include high faculty turnover rates and inconsistent and delayed feedback to students from professors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this putative class action lawsuit on April 20, 2018, and filed an amended complaint on August 20, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert claims of common-law and statutory fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Capella moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In part, Capella argues that Plaintiff Lois Mason's claims are \"premature\" and that Plaintiff Jacqueline Carter has not suffered an injury. Although Capella makes these arguments in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the question of whether Mason or Carter has been injured implicates their standing to bring this lawsuit. As a jurisdictional prerequisite, standing must be resolved before reaching the merits of a lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    City of Clarkson Valley v. Mineta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563754\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/567/#p569\">\n    495 F.3d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (8th Cir. 2007). For this reason, the Court addresses Capella's standing arguments first and then addresses Capella's remaining arguments as to the merits of Plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Capella argues that Mason and Carter cannot bring claims because neither Mason nor Carter had suffered an injury when Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint. Mason enrolled in Capella's Doctor of Information Technology (DIT) program in 2016. The 2.5-year timeline that Capella allegedly promised her had not yet elapsed when Plaintiffs filed the amended complaint. Carter enrolled in Capella's Doctor of Social Work (DSW) program in 2015, but she withdrew before her projected graduation date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal jurisdiction to actual cases or controversies.

They lost time and money, Plaintiffs contend, by enrolling and participating in a program in which they otherwise would not have enrolled. The alleged time and money that was lost began to accrue when Mason and Carter enrolled in their programs and paid tuition for them. As alleged, the injury is particularized and actual. Accordingly, the Court rejects Capella's argument that Mason and Carter need to wait until their projected graduation dates in order to bring claims against Capella.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For this reason, Mason and Carter have standing to bring this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Capella next contends that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted. A complaint must allege sufficient facts such that, when accepted as true, a facially plausible claim to relief is stated.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    173 L.Ed.2d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). If a complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, dismissal is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When determining whether a complaint states a facially plausible claim, a district court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    Blankenship v. USA Truck, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225274\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/852/#p853\">\n    601 F.3d 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853 (8th Cir. 2010).

Each of Plaintiffs' causes of action is addressed in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Common-Law Fraud (Counts 1, 7, 11, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38 and 44)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Capella contends that Plaintiffs have neither alleged a misstatement of fact nor pleaded their fraud claims with particularity. Alternatively, Capella argues that the educational-malpractice doctrine bars Plaintiffs' claims. Each argument is addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Misstatement of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Capella argues that Plaintiffs' common-law fraud claims do not sufficiently allege an actionable misstatement of fact. To state a claim for common-law fraudulent misrepresentation under Minnesota law, a plaintiff must allege that (1) a party falsely represented a past or existing material fact that is susceptible of knowledge,\n   (2) the party made the representation either knowing that it was false or without knowing if the representation was true or false, (3) the party intended to induce another to act in reliance on the representation, (4) the plaintiff acted in reliance on the representation, and (5) the plaintiff consequently suffered pecuniary damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Angeles v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879858\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/863/404/#p422\">\n    863 N.W.2d 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 422 (Minn. Ct. App. 2015). Capella challenges the first element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiff Wright\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff Carolyn Wright, who enrolled in Capella's Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program, alleges that she relied on a statement on Capella's website that claims, \"[i]n just two years you can earn your DNP.\" Wright also alleges that she relied on a 2-year recommended timeline contained within materials that Capella sent to her. According to Wright, the DNP program is not, in fact, a 2-year program. Rather, Capella's Gainful Employment report\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   states that only 13 percent of Capella students who graduated with a DNP degree between 2013 and 2014 were able to finish in 30 months or fewer. And, between 2014 and 2015, 84 percent of students who graduated with a DNP degree from Capella did so within 39 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wright fails to allege a false statement of material fact. Although Capella's website and course catalogue suggest that it is possible for a student to complete a DNP degree within 2 years, neither source represents that the average student completion rate is within that time period. Nor do these sources guarantee that Wright will complete the DNP degree within 2 years. For this reason, Wright's experience at Capella and the statistics presented in the Gainful Employment report are not incompatible with the representations on Capella's website and course catalogue. Nothing in Wright's allegations suggests that it would be\n   <em>\n    impossible\n   </em>\n   to complete a DNP degree in 2 years. Consequently, there is no allegation of a false representation of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, Count 1 is dismissed as asserted by Wright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiffs Kennedy, Brannen, and Matelski\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs Debbra Kennedy, Sherry Bailey Brannen, and Shauna Matelski enrolled\n   in Capella's Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) program. Each of these Plaintiffs alleges that she was induced to enroll in this program based on Capella's website, which represented that the Ed.D. program is \"designed to be completed in less than 3 years.\" In contrast to this representation, Capella's Gainful Employment Report states that no student who graduated with an Ed.D. degree between 2014 and 2015 completed the program within 3 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   These three Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege a false representation. Accepting Plaintiffs' allegations as true for the purpose of this motion, Capella represents that the Ed.D. program is \"designed\" to take less than 3 years. Capella does not represent that an\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   student would complete the degree in 3 years, nor did Capella guarantee that Kennedy, Brannen, or Matelski would complete the Ed.D. program in fewer than 3 years. Neither the statistics contained in the Gainful Employment report nor the experiences of the Plaintiffs contradict the representation of a 3-year \"design\" time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For these reasons, Kennedy, Brannen, and Matelski have not stated a claim for common-law fraud. Count 1 is dismissed as asserted by these Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Plaintiffs Mason and Norris\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mason enrolled in Capella's DIT program, allegedly relying on a recruiting email, which stated that \"DIT is a structured three year program; 2.5 years with transfer credit for you.\" Mason maintains that the DIT program was longer than Capella represented, as indicated by Capella's Gainful Employment report, which discloses a program length of 39 months. Similarly, Plaintiff Candace Norris enrolled in Capella's Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program after a recruiter informed her that it was a 3-year program and that it would be \"possible\" to finish the program in 2.5 years. Norris contends that the DBA program was longer than Capella represented, as evidenced by the Gainful Employment report, which discloses a program length of 45 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mason and Norris fail to sufficiently allege a false representation of a material fact, however. The recruiter's email to Mason states that the DIT program is a structured 3-year program. A program's structure is distinct from its average length, however. The email's reference to \"2.5 years with transfer credit for you\" also misses the mark as a false representation of a material fact. Although this statement is tailored to Mason, it represents only the structured length of the program as it applies to Mason. It does not represent how long it will actually take Mason to complete the program. Likewise, the recruiter's purported statements to Norris do not indicate what the\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   length of the DBA program is. Although the recruiter told Norris that completing a degree in 2.5 years was \"possible,\" that statement does not convey that a 2.5-year timeline was guaranteed or common for DBA students. For these reasons, Mason and Norris\n   do not sufficiently allege that Capella misrepresented the\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   length of the DIT or DBA programs, nor do they allege that the programs were not, in fact,\n   <em>\n    structured\n   </em>\n   as 3-year programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accordingly, as asserted by Mason and Norris, Count 1 is dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Plaintiff Ornelas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff Maurice Jose Ornelas enrolled in Capella's PhD in Public Safety program, with a specialty in Criminal Justice. He alleges that he enrolled in this program in reliance on an email from a Capella recruiter that stated, \"[o]ur typical learner will complete their PhD program in 3 years, plus or minus one quarter, by averaging 2 courses per quarter.\" This statement, Ornelas contends, falsely represents the average time-and, because tuition is tied to the number of semesters, the average cost-of the PhD in Public Safety program. Capella discloses in its Gainful Employment report that the length of the PhD in Public Safety program is 75 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The report also states that only 68 percent of students who completed a PhD in Public Safety between 2014 and 2015 were able to do so within 75 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Unlike Capella's representations of design times or program structures, here, Capella represents how long it takes a \"typical learner\" to complete the PhD in Public Safety program. The typical learner's 3-year length is contradicted by Capella's disclosure in the Gainful Employment report, which states that the program is, on average, 6 years and 3 months. This reported length is more than twice as long as the length that Capella represents in its recruiting email. Ornelas has adequately alleged that Capella made a false representation of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The other elements of a common-law fraud claim also are sufficiently alleged. Ornelas alleges that Capella knew its representation was false, as Capella could make the necessary calculations for the Gainful Employment report. And, Ornelas alleges, Capella made the false representation with the intention to induce Ornelas's reliance, because the information was provided in a\n   <em>\n    recruiting\n   </em>\n   email. Ornelas relied on this representation, he alleges, and would not have enrolled in the program had he known its true length and cost. Finally, Ornelas's alleged damages are the time and tuition he lost by enrolling in a program that he otherwise would not have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Ornelas has stated a claim for common-law fraud, Capella's motion to dismiss is denied as to Count 1 as asserted by Ornelas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Plaintiff Carter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Carter enrolled in Capella's DSW program purportedly in reliance on an email from a Capella recruiter. The email stated that the DSW program is \"designed to be completed in three years,\" and Capella's course catalogue included a 3-year and 1-quarter recommended course schedule. In contrast to this information, Capella reports that only 19 percent of students who graduated with a DSW degree between 2014 and 2015 were able to do so within 42 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Like Kennedy, Brannen, and Matelski, Carter does not sufficiently allege a false representation of material fact. That a program is \"designed\" to be completed in a certain amount of time is not false merely because the average student takes longer to complete that program. And the course catalogue displays only a\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   schedule; it does not represent the actual or guaranteed length of the program. Moreover, the course catalogue expressly disclaims that the \"completion time for the dissertation courses varies.\" This disclaimer also undermines Carter's allegations that the course catalogue was a false representation of the time to complete the DSW degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For these reasons, Count 1 is dismissed as asserted by Carter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Plaintiff Goldstein\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff Geoffrey Goldstein enrolled in the PhD in Business Management program after a recruiter allegedly informed him that he would graduate within 3 years \"if he enrolled in consecutive quarters.\" Although Goldstein enrolled in consecutive quarters and received top grades during those quarters, two years into the program Capella told Goldstein that he must either \"voluntarily withdraw from the program or restart the entire dissertation process from the beginning.\" Whether these allegations amount to misstatements of fact is a close call. But assuming without deciding that Goldstein sufficiently alleges a misstatement of fact, Goldstein's fraud claim nonetheless fails because he does not plead his claim with particularity, as addressed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In particular, Capella argues that Goldstein has failed to allege the \"who\" of the fraud, and that both Goldstein and Ornelas have failed to allege the \"why\" of the fraud-namely, facts that give rise to an inference of fraudulent intent. Goldstein alleges that a Capella recruiter told him that he would graduate from the PhD in Business Management program in 3 years if he enrolled in consecutive quarters. But the amended complaint does not identify the Capella recruiter with whom Goldstein spoke or indicate when the conversations occurred. These generalized allegations do not sufficiently enable Capella to respond and prepare a defense to charges of fraud.\n   <em>\n    Commercial Prop.

But Ornelas's allegations go beyond a mere desire to have progressed through his PhD program more quickly. Ornelas alleges that Capella misrepresented the average time and cost of a Capella degree so as to induce Ornelas to enroll in the program. Such allegations, accepted as true for the purposes of this motion, support an inference that Capella acted with a fraudulent intent. Moreover, Ornelas pleads his claims with sufficient details for Capella to be able to adequately respond to and prepare a defense against Ornelas's allegations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11315344\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/639/#p644\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, Ornelas has pleaded his fraud claim with sufficient particularity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, only Goldstein's common-law fraud claim, Count 44, is dismissed for failure to plead the fraud claim with particularity.

Ornelas alleges that Capella misrepresented the average time and cost of its PhD in Public Safety program. To assess this claim, the Court need not assess the general quality of Ornelas's instructors nor the effectiveness of Capella's programs. Instead, the relevant inquiry would be tied to objective enrollment statistics. For this reason, Ornelas's common-law fraud claims are not barred by the educational-malpractice doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Statutory Fraud (Counts 4, 5, 10, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41 and 42)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In addition to alleging common-law fraud, Plaintiffs also allege statutory fraud. Capella again argues that Plaintiffs have not pleaded these fraud claims with sufficient particularity, that Plaintiffs have failed to allege an actionable misstatement of fact, and that these claims are barred by the educational-malpractice doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Minnesota Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act prohibits the misrepresentation of goods or services being sold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325D.44, subd. 1(5) (prohibiting a person from representing that \"goods or services have ... characteristics ... that they do not have\"); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325D.44, subd. 1(13) (prohibiting a person from engaging \"in any other conduct which similarly creates a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding\"). Similarly, the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act prohibits misrepresentations and misleading statements in conjunction with goods sold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325F.69, subd. 1 (\"The act, use, or employment by any person of any fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, misleading statement or deceptive practice, with the intent that others rely thereon ... is enjoinable ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs' statutory fraud claims are based on the same allegations as their common-law fraud claims. As such, the analysis in Part I.A. applies with equal force here. As explained, only Ornelas sufficiently alleges that Capella made a false representation concerning the time and cost of its doctoral programs. And, consistent with the educational-malpractice doctrine analysis in Part I.A.3, Ornelas's statutory fraud claims do not require an inquiry into Capella's educational decisions or pedagogy. Accordingly, Ornelas states a claim for statutory fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For these reasons, Capella's motion to dismiss is denied as to Counts 4 and 5 only to the extent that these nationwide claims are asserted by Ornelas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Capella moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claims for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Under Minnesota law, contract formation requires communication of a specific and definite offer, acceptance of that offer, and consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pine River State Bank v.

But the allegations in the amended complaint do not support the existence of any such promises. Capella's representations on which Plaintiffs rely include statements of how long the degree programs are \"designed\" to take, how the program is \"structured,\" what a recommended sequence of courses is, or the length of time it takes a \"typical learner\" to complete the program. None of these allegations supports the assertion that Capella made a specific and definite offer to any of the Plaintiffs that students would be in control of the length of the program or that degrees would be obtainable within a set timeframe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs' nationwide breach-of-contract claim, Count 3, is dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
