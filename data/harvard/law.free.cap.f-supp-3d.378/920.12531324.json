Dkt. 17. First, does the test for facial constitutional challenges outlined by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) apply to the case at bar? Second, if\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   applies, is there a set of circumstances in which IC \u00a7 39-4510 can be applied in a manner that comports with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution? Because the Court concludes that the answer to both questions is yes, it will grant Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, but with leave to amend to assert an as-applied challenge. In granting leave to amend, the Court does not encourage or discourage such a filing, and does not offer an opinion as to whether such a challenge can be successfully stated by an existing plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Idaho's Medical Consent and Natural Death Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2039-4501\">\n    Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 39-4501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , \"recognize[s] the right of a competent person to have his or her wishes for medical treatment and for the withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining procedures carried out even though that person is no longer able to communicate with the health care provider.\" I.C. \u00a7 39-4509(2). The Act accomplishes this goal, in part, by providing a model \"Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care\" forms (combined, the \"Model Form\"), that Idaho citizens may fill out. I.C. \u00a7 39-4510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Model Form is available for download on the Idaho Secretary of State's health care directory registry webpage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Idaho citizens are not required to use the Model Form, in order for an Idaho citizen to register their Living Will and Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care with the Idaho Secretary of State, the document submitted must be \"substantially ... [similar to, or] contain[ ] the elements set forth\" (hereinafter, the \"Incorporation Clause\") in the Model Form. I.C. \u00a7 39-4510(1). A health care directive that fails to meet this requirement will not be registered by the Idaho Secretary of State. I.C. \u00a7 39-4510(2). But, the statute also provides that \"[f]ailure to register the health care directive shall not affect the validity of the health care directive.\" I.C. \u00a7 39-4510(2). Obviously, this provision of the Act raises some question about whether a non-compliant, unregistered health care directive would be enforceable. However, for purposes of the pending motion, the Court will assume that it would not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This litigation stems from a single provision in the Model Form stating that \"[i]f I have been diagnosed as pregnant, this Directive\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   shall have no force during the course of my pregnancy\" (hereinafter, the \"Pregnancy Exclusion\"). I.C. \u00a7 39-4510. As discussed above, due to the Incorporation Clause, this provision is a necessary component of all health care directives in Idaho. The Idaho Secretary of State, in apparent reliance on the Pregnancy Exclusion, has issued the following guidance regarding health care directives on its \"Frequently Asked Questions\" webpage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Question] 13. What happens if I am pregnant when I become incapacitated?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [Answer:] Life sustaining measures will continue regardless of any directive to the contrary until the pregnancy is complete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Finally, if an individual (1) does not have an executed version of the Model Form or a document that satisfies the Incorporation Clause and (2) cannot consent to care due to age or health, then the Idaho Code provides that a \"surrogate decision maker\" may make health care decisions for the individual. I.C. \u00a7 39-4504(1). The \"surrogate decision maker['s]\" authority to consent to treatment on behalf of an individual is limited by statute in the following ways: \"the surrogate decision maker shall not have authority to consent to or refuse health care contrary to such person's advance directives, POST or wishes expressed by such person while the person was capable of consenting to his or her own health care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Idaho%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2039-4501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Salerno\n    </em>\n    Applies to Plaintiffs' Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

According to Plaintiffs, the Pregnancy Exclusion limits a woman's ability to terminate her own life, and, by extension, the life of her unborn child. Dkt. 26 at 10-11.

Second, the language of the Act simply does not regulate abortion procedures. Third, Plaintiffs fail to point the Court towards any precedent applying\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   's \"large fraction\" test to statutes containing provisions similar to the Pregnancy Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Absent Instruction from the Supreme Court or the Ninth Circuit, the Court Will Not Create a New Exception to\n    </em>\n    Salerno\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs appear to be urging the Court to create a new exception to\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   's \"no\n   set of circumstances\" test. Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, under the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   dicta the FDPA would be constitutional if 99 times out of 100 it resulted in the execution of an innocent individual because there would be one case in which a guilty person would be executed.

The Court finds that such circumstances exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     A Potential Set of Circumstances Exists Under Which the State of Idaho May Limit a Woman's Ability to Prospectively Dictate Her Healthcare Choices\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that state laws limiting a pregnant woman's ability to prospectively dictate her healthcare choices are not rare. As of the Spring of 2018, thirty-four states had laws \"either mandat[ing] that a pregnant woman's advance directive be disregarded entirely due to her pregnancy or require[ing] a woman to take some further affirmative step beyond creating an advance directive in order for her wishes to be carried out.\" Nikolas Youngsmith,\n   <em>\n    The Muddled Milieu of Pregnancy Exceptions and Abortion Restrictions\n   </em>\n   , 49 COLUM. HUM. RTS. L. REV. 415, 424 (2018). Though this fact does not, of course, answer the question of whether such laws are constitutional, it is nevertheless true that a majority of state legislatures have seen fit to pass laws that are at least nominally similar to Idaho's Pregnancy Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Even though at least thirty-four states have laws limiting a pregnant woman's ability to prospectively dictate their healthcare choices, Plaintiffs fail to point the Court to a single case in which a law similar to Idaho's Pregnancy Exclusion has been struck down pursuant to a facial challenge. Plaintiffs cite a series of cases in which courts have wrestled with the question of whether, in essence, it was appropriate for the state to dictate the healthcare choices of one person in order to save the life of another.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391030\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/573/1235/#p1244\">\n    573 A.2d 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1244 (D.C.

But, those cases provide no support for the proposition that Idaho's Pregnancy Exclusion is unconstitutional in all circumstances. Indeed, the very case on which Plaintiffs principally rely,\n   <em>\n    In re A.C.\n   </em>\n   , is all but fatal to their case; \"[w]e do not quite foreclose the possibility that a conflicting state interest may be so compelling that the patient's wishes must yield, but we anticipate that such cases will be extremely rare and truly exceptional.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391030\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/573/1235/#p1244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391030\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/573/1235/#p1244\">\n    at 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     A Potential Set of Circumstances Exists Under Which the State of Idaho Is Constitutionally Entitled to Dictate the Medical Care that a Woman Receives\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs make the conclusory allegation that \"even under the\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   standard\" there are no set of circumstances in which the State of Idaho may dictate the healthcare choices of a pregnant woman.

The baby was delivered without complication, but plaintiff nevertheless sued the hospital alleging a variety of substantive challenges under the Constitution.

Simply put, there are circumstances under which a pregnant woman's right to autonomy in her health\n   care decisions can be circumscribed by the state's right to protect a third party. Those situations may very well be rare, but they exist. Under\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   , that is all Defendants must show.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Today's decision is limited in scope. Plaintiffs have only pursued a facial challenge to the Pregnancy Exclusion. This challenge is subject to\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   's \"no set of circumstances\" test, which Plaintiffs have failed to meet. But, the Court hastens to add that it has little difficulty imagining circumstances in which the Pregnancy Exclusion is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Indeed, it is at least possible that one or more of the existing plaintiffs may be able to make an as-applied challenge. The briefing in this case casts the constitutional injury as occurring when a woman who is pregnant and incapacitated is, despite her express wishes to the contrary, denied the right to forego further medical treatment. As the Court pointed out during oral argument, the constitutional injury could, alternatively, be described as occurring at the moment the state limits a woman's right to prospectively dictate the healthcare she receives in the event she becomes incapacitated. Under this view a woman who has executed a healthcare directive which the state has indicated it will not permit to be enforced, suffers an immediate constitutional injury which can be redressed in an as-applied challenge to the statute. The Court does not offer any opinion as to whether such a view will prevail, but it would appear to be an approach worthy of consideration - given the important constitutional rights at play here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   1.

Counsel for Defendants conceded that at this phase of the litigation, the Court should evaluate the constitutionality of the statute with the background assumption that a pregnant woman with a healthcare directive that does not contain the Pregnancy Exclusion would not have her care terminated in accordance with the express wishes of her healthcare directive.

It necessarily follows that the Supreme Court's modified view of the requirements for a facial challenge to an abortion statute, should apply here.
