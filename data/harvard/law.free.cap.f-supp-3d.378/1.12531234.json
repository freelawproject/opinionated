Plaintiff answered \"yes,\" and McBride told her that the Hotel's cameras had captured her \"luggage unattended.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. \"Plaintiff ... explained, what was clearly obvious to all, that with [her] open disability Plaintiff was not able to manage [her] luggage as well as a beverage therefore, as numerous past previous acts allowed[,] Plaintiff placed the luggage beside the chair and proceeded to utilize the 'Starbucks' and immediately returned to claim [her] luggage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McBride then asked Plaintiff if she was a paid guest of the Hotel, \"to which [she] responded she was not a paid guest[;] however, she was a paid patron of the businesses located within\" the Hotel,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Starbucks and the U.S. Postal Service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McBride \"immediately informed Plaintiff in a condescending and loud tone that she would not be allowed to access her postal box\" and \"demanded Plaintiff leave the hotel immediately or he would call the police to have [her] removed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff asked if \"all other patrons in the room would be questioned [about] their guest status\" or whether the \"demand\" for her \"to exit the hotel or be arrested\" was \"a targeted discriminatory act[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff then \"sat down and waited for the police as\n   [she] had committed no Criminal act to have her lawful rights removed or threatened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When MPD officers arrived, Plaintiff \"refused\" their request to produce identification and was \"advised\" that \"if she continued to refuse to leave,\" she would be arrested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.
