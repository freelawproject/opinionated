For the reasons stated below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Protective Order and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises out of an incident on December 29, 2016, during which Andrew Spencer was shot outside of the QuikTrip store located at 4050 Buford Highway, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. This Motion for Protective Order concerns Plaintiffs' Second Request for Production of Documents to Defendant QuikTrip. Among the requests are requests for documents and other materials concerning events and incidents at two other QuikTrip stores. Defendant QuikTrip (\"Defendant\" or \"QuikTrip\") objects to these requests, and the parties have not been able to resolve the dispute concerning these requests. Accordingly, Defendant moves the Court to enter a protective order with respect to the following three requests, which Defendant contends are over broad and seek information that is not relevant to any party's claim or defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \u2022 Request No. 1: The customer activity report for QuikTrip store located at 3292 Buford Highway, Brookhaven, GA between January 1, 2012 and December 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Request No. 2: The customer activity report for the QuikTrip store located at 5500 Buford Highway, Doraville, GA between January 1, 2012 and December 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \u2022 Request No. 3: Any and all incident reports and documents relating to criminal incidents occurring at 3292 Buford Highway, Brookhaven, GA and 5500 Doraville, GA between January 1, 2012 and December 29, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1) provides the following regarding the scope of discovery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.

All of the discovery requests at issue are overbroad. They seek information regarding QuikTrip locations that are not relevant to any claims or defenses in this case, and they also are not properly limited with respect to content or time. Based on this Court's review of the law applicable to this case, the conditions, events, and incidents at these other two QuikTrip locations could not be used to show that Defendant had knowledge of a dangerous condition at the QuikTrip location that is the subject of this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCoy v. Gay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"598328\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/165/590/\">\n    165 Ga.

Indeed, courts have held that criminal incidents taking place in different locations on a property were insufficient to put defendants on notice of a foreseeable risk of harm to customers by third parties at a different location on that same property.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Heinzmann v. Simon Prop. Grp., LP\n   </em>\n   , CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:08-cv-1847-ODE,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010668931\">\n    2009 WL 10668931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (N.D. Ga. Oct. 27, 2009) (holding that robbery that occurred in parking lot near one store at mall was not substantially similar to robbery that occurred in parking lot near another store nine months later at the\n   same mall). Given that the information sought concerns completely different QuikTrip locations and for the many reasons set forth by Defendant as to how those QuikTrip locations differ from the location at issue in this lawsuit, the Court finds that the discovery sought is irrelevant and not discoverable under Rule 26. The requests are not narrowly tailored to seek information about \"substantially similar\" incidents as to place, time, or type of incident, and these simply is no justification for these overbroad requests. Accordingly, even if this case were allowed to proceed to trial, Defendant would be entitled to entry of a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    1. Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As mentioned above, this is a premises liability case arising out of a criminal incident where a violent criminal gang member, Leroy Copney, shot Andrew Spencer in the parking lot of a QuikTrip at 4050 Buford Highway in Chamblee, Georgia, resulting in Andrew Spencer's death. (Defendant QuikTrip Corporation's Statement of Material Facts in Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment \"DSMF\" [Doc. No. 81-2] \u00b6 1; Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts \"PSMF\" [Doc. No. 90] \u00b6 1.) The subject QuikTrip was in the area of multiple clubs. (PSMF \u00b6 2.) It was an every-night thing for sometimes-intoxicated customers to come to QuikTrip after leaving Follies, one of the nearby clubs, between 3:00 am to 4:00 am. (Deposition of Rhamses Reyes \"Reyes Dep.\" [Doc. No. 93] at 47: 16-24.) Gang members hang out at several clubs in the area, including at Follies. (Deposition of Alex Cushenan \"Cushenan Dep.\" [Doc. No. 103-1] at 27:5-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On Thursday, December 29, 2016, Spencer arrived at QuikTrip around 3:20 am, with his friend Quintin Heard, after leaving Follies. (DSMF \u00b6 2; PSMF \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16.) Spencer was Defendant's invitee. (PSMF \u00b6 17.) Spencer was on the premises for close to five minutes. (DSMF \u00b6 3; Surv. Video POS 1&amp;2 and Gas Left.) Spencer walked into the subject QuikTrip and to the hotdog stand where Copney was standing. (PSMF \u00b6 18.) Spencer did not say anything to or touch the shooter. (PSMF \u00b6 19.) Copney and Spencer were together in the store, near the hotdog grill, for less than a minute. (DSMF \u00b6 3.) Surveillance video shows that Copney said something to Spencer before exiting the QuikTrip and then proceeded to his motor vehicle, placed a gun in his waistband, and openly paced in the parking lot near the front entrance of the store until Spencer exited. (PSMF \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Copney shot Spencer after Spencer exited the store within a couple of minutes after the two had been standing together near the hotdog grill. (DSMF \u00b6 4; Surv. Video Gas Left.) As Spencer and his friend exited the store, Copney stated, \"what's popping,\" and then said \"you guys were looking at me funny in the store. You know, y'all got any problems?\" (PSMF \u00b6 21.) He then said, \"y'all out here fake reppin'.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Heard understood these to be gang-related statements regarding gang affiliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Neither Spencer nor Heard was in a gang nor did either represent the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Heard described Copney's posture as a \"fighting posture.\" (PSMF \u00b6 24.) Heard indicated he was in a defensive stance himself because he assumed that the shooter was going to attack him, but then he relaxed when he saw a random Chamblee police officer pull into the parking lot as he assumed \"that someone had called the police or they were just doing a regular routine in that area\n   because of knowing what Follies is.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Chamblee officer Gaetano Antinozzi testified that at the time of the incident he went to the QuikTrip to get gas. (PSMF \u00b6 27.) As he was pulling into the parking lot, Officer Antinozzi \"pretty immediate[ly]\" saw what appeared to be a \"negative encounter, and I would say confrontation\" between the shooter and Spencer. (PSMF \u00b6 28; Deposition of Gaetono Antinozzi \"Antinozzi Dep.\" [Doc. No. 103-2] at 46:4-47:1.) Heard testified that he did not think Copney knew that a police officer was in the parking lot. (Deposition of Quintin Heard \"Heard Dep.\" at 57:17-21, 63:1-7.) The shooting occurred, and Spencer later died at the QuikTrip. (PSMF \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   QuikTrip employees were supposed to follow panic alarm guidelines pursuant to which employees were instructed to push an alarm upon seeing, among other things, a fight, suspicious loitering, a personal threat to a QuikTrip employee or customer, or larceny. (PSMF \u00b6 30; Deposition of Charles Andrew Tennison \"Tennison Dep.\" [Doc. No. 102] at 111:3-13.) Employees \"pay attention to what is happening in the parking lot\" and hit the alarm if they feel or think a situation is going to escalate. (PSMF \u00b6 31; Deposition of Gregg Romero \"Romero Dep.\" [Doc. No. 94] at 46:9-19.) Upon hitting the alarm, security contacts police and police can be at the QuikTrip within seconds. (PSMF \u00b6 32; Romero Dep. at 46:17-19.) Belt alarms were an extension of the hardwired panic system. (Tennison Dep. at 34:8-11.) The belt alarms did not deter crime themselves, other than if a customer saw it and knew what it was. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:12-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the night of the incident, the on-duty manager, Rhamses Reyes, pressed his panic alarm after hearing gunshots. (PSMF \u00b6 33; Reyes Dep. at 24:19-25:3.) Mr. Reyes testified that his \"duties were just inside the store\" and that he was not responsible for conducting any sort of patrol of the parking lot. (PSMF \u00b6 42; Reyes Dep. at 75:18-21, 76:5-7.) Nothing was done to actually physically monitor the parking lot on the night of the subject incident. (PSMF \u00b6 33; Reyes Dep. at 80:18-20.) Store manager Gregg Romero testified that Mr. Reyes paid attention to the situation and that Mr. Reyes was watching the guys through the window and could see the situation clearly. (Romero Dep. at 44:7-21.) Romero also indicated that if Mr. Reyes didn't pay attention to the situation, that would have been a mistake on his part. (PSMF \u00b6 46; Romero Dep. at 44:12-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite having outdoor cameras, the cameras at the QuikTrip were not constantly monitored and Mr. Reyes did not have the ability to view the cameras covering the parking lot areas. (PSMF \u00b6 44; Reyes Dep. at 77:5-8, 103:17-19; Tennison Dep. at 37:1-3.) A group of people at the corporate security office in Tulsa, Oklahoma, would access and view video footage of the store if an employee hit the panic alarm. (PSMF \u00b6 44; Romero Dep. at 18:12-23, 132:9-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant QuikTrip had in place a policy relating to security guards. (PSMF \u00b6 34.) This policy indicated that \"[i]t may become necessary to place a security guard in a store to provide safety for employees and customers or as a deterrent in areas where crime or the chance of crime is prevalent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Ex. BB, Security Guards Policy.) Defendant relies on its store team, including the store manager and store supervisor, to request the addition of security guards if they feel a need for security in the store. (PSMF \u00b6 35; Deposition of Marc Milburn \"Milburn Dep.\" [Doc. No. 99] at 13:2-11.) Division Manager Marc Milburn has the ultimate approval for a security guard request in\n   Atlanta. (Milburn Dep. at 17:20-22.) Mr. Milburn has placed security guards at stores based on his own determination that they were needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:15-19:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Mr. Reyes testified that he had no training on security or security matters. (PSMF \u00b6 36; Reyes Dep. at 41:9-12, 72:20-22.) It was his opinion that having a security guard may increase the likelihood of a crime occurring because the criminals get scared and may act more violently. (PSMF \u00b6 37; Reyes Dep. at 72:8-15.) Mr. Reyes testified that he had no training on how to spot the need for increased or decreased security. (PSMF \u00b6 37; Reyes Dep. at 72:23-73:1.) Mr. Milburn testified that there is no policy or procedure or any sort of training that would guide employees on how to exercise their discretion in requesting security changes \"other than the security guard policy ... that suggests that if they have a situation where they would feel like there is a need for a security guard, to direct that information towards the store manager for the initiation of that conversation.\" (PSMF \u00b6 36; Milburn Dep. at 27:18-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant QuikTrip's head of security, Mr. Tennison, testified that he has periodically throughout his seven-year tenure recommended that QuikTrip undertake a crime analysis for each existing store because he thinks \"it would be a criteria that one would use to determine whether or not you would want to employ security or not....\" (Tennison Dep. at 96:16-99:25, 101:21-25.) QuikTrip has not done an assessment of specific crime levels at each individual store because \"[i]t's a significant amount of time to do that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:6-8.) Mr. Tennison could not remember whether he had done an individual store level assessment for the subject store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:15.) According to Plaintiffs' expert, failure to conduct such an assessment is a violation of industry standards and guidelines for assessing and mitigating risk of crime. (PSMF \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Among other allegations, Plaintiff alleges in this lawsuit that if there was a security guard outside the QuikTrip store on weekday nights, specifically the Thursday morning when this incident occurred, this incident would not have happened. (DSMF \u00b6 8.) The Wednesday night/Thursday morning of this incident there were three employees in the QuikTrip store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) There was not a security guard at the store at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The store did have security guards on Friday night/Saturday mornings from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am and Saturday night/Sunday mornings from 10:30 pm to about 5:00 am or 5:30 am. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11; PSMF \u00b6 12; 30(b)(6) Deposition of Kevin Thornton \"30(b)(6) Thornton Dep.\" [Doc. No. 101] at 11:9-13:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The role of security guards on the premises was to deter crime and step in if criminal activity occurred. (PSMF \u00b6 48; Deposition of Alex Chang \"Chang Dep.\" [Doc. No. 96] at 11:7-16, 12:15-20.) One of the security guards, Officer Chang, testified that he had intervened in a verbal altercation in the parking lot one time and that his intervention de-escalated the situation. (Chang Dep. at 13:15-14:5.) Officer Bothwell, another security guard, testified that if he saw a negative confrontation outside in the parking lot, he would observe it and then walk outside to see what he could hear. (Deposition of Chris Bothwell \"Bothwell Dep.\" [Doc. No. 95] at 24:19-23.) If it was a negative confrontation, he would approach it cautiously and would observe and investigate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:23-25:2.) He testified that he had done that on prior occasions and that de-escalated the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:3-8.) He also testified, however, that if people were going to fight, \"they was going to fight regardless.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:14-17.) He could not recall a specific incident where there was a\n   physical fight out there because it's such a rare occurrence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:19-26:8.) Officer Antinozzi testified that if a security guard had been present at time of the subject incident on December 29, 2016, the security guard would be obligated to intervene. (Antinozzi Dep. at 47:14-18.) He further testified that \"if any alert police officer had seen what I seen - what I saw, they would have recognized it as a potential - as a negative confrontation that they should have least investigated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:24-48:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The following incidents occurred at the subject QuikTrip between August 4, 2012 and December 19, 2016.

More detail regarding these three incidents is below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, on an early Sunday morning on April 6, 2014, there was a report of \"shots fired\" made at the QuikTrip. (DSMF \u00b6 14.) QuikTrip was not aware of any injuries after reporting shots were fired in the parking lot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) This incident occurred on a Sunday morning, and QuikTrip added an additional security guard for the Saturday evening/Sunday morning overnight shift, beginning the very next weekend, making security guards there on both weekend nights (Friday and Saturday). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) However, the additional security guard was added for the purpose of \"crowd control\" rather than employee and customer safety in response to the subject shooting. (Deposition of Kevin Thornton \"Thornton Dep.\" [Doc. No. 100] at 33:11-18; 30(b)(6) Thornton Dep. at 38:4-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, on an early Sunday morning on November 9, 2014, there was a report of \"shots fired\" where the police responding to the call stopped a vehicle and found an assault rifle. (DSMF \u00b6 17.) A security guard was at the QuikTrip at this time and described this incident as \"basically a shooting in the air.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, there was a Saturday night event on October 1, 2016, where a taxi driver held at gunpoint drove to the QuikTrip at gunpoint, was in the parking lot for a little over one minute (never leaving her vehicle), and then left, still at gunpoint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) She did gesture and yell for help from inside her car, and a fellow cab driver followed her, calling 911 for help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) The woman was found dead later that night.

Mr. Harrison stated that \"[t]he spike between 3:00 am and 5:00 am becomes more pronounced if one focuses on violent or gun-related crimes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:14-18.) However, the observed spike is only on weekends. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:11-34:7.) Analyzing the data and analysis of Plaintiffs' expert, Mr. Harrison testified that Thursday was one of the top three or four most prevalent days for crime and that Thursday had the third highest rate of violent or gun-related crimes, but he qualified that statement by clarifying that it is not a big day at 3:00 am. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:67-17; 49:20-50:9.) Mr. Harrison did not specifically look at gun-related, outdoor crimes occurring on Thursdays, as the sample size would have been so small that one would not be able to describe the data reliably. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68:10-69:14.) Nor did Mr. Harrison assess crime rates by month of the year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert, John C. Villines, opines that in the immediate area of the subject QuikTrip, between January 1, 2015 and December 29, 2016, the highest incidence of reported criminal activity occurred between 3:00 am and 4:00 am. (Pl.'s Rule 26 Expert Report [Doc. No. 56] at 10.) Looking at the days of the week, Mr. Villines indicated that Thursday tied with Tuesday for having the second highest rate of incidents, and looking at months of the year, December had the third highest rate of incidents.

Plaintiffs allege several claims, including the following: (1) a premises liability claim under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 51-3-1 for a variety of alleged negligent acts (i.e., failure to keep the premises safe; failure to maintain, inspect, secure, patrol, and manage the premises; failure to warn of latent dangers on the premises; failure to maintain adequate patrols, security, policies, lighting, and security devices to permit proper use of the property; failure to remove loiterers; failure to inspect, patrol, monitor, and protect the parking lot and approaches to the gas station; failure to train and supervise employees in regard to the maintenance and safety of said premises; failure to properly retain, entrust, hire, train, and supervise employees; failure to ensure business policies, systems, and security were being adequately followed and implemented; failure to provide adequate lighting in the parking lot and employ other appropriate security measures; failure to remediate a very long history of crime at the subject property and others nearby in the area; failure to maintain a policy, procedure, or system of investigating, reporting, and warning of the dangerous condition of the subject property; failure to act on knowledge of prior crimes and the dangerous condition of the property; and failure to deter, correct, or warn of prior criminal activity, loitering, trespassing, and the dangerous condition of said property); (2) a claim for negligence per se; (3) a claim for punitive damages, and (4) a claim for attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation. The case was removed to this Court on June 22, 2017. BJS QT, LLC, the out-of-possession landlord of the subject premises, was dismissed from the case on October 24, 2017, based on a finding that there was no possibility Plaintiff could establish a cause of action against it.

There had been no prior violent crime incidents involving a gun outside the store, in the parking lot/gas pump area where the incident in question occurred, on weekday nights. As to the three violent crime incidents involving a gun of which QuikTrip had knowledge that occurred on weekends outside of the store, two of them took place over two years prior to the killing of Mr. Spencer and thus were too remote in time to constitute \"substantially similar\" incidents that would make Mr. Spencer's killing reasonably foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padgett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206802482\">\n    2016 WL 6802482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (holding that a criminal incident that occurred 18 months prior to the criminal incident that was the subject of the lawsuit was too remote in time to make the attack on the plaintiff reasonably foreseeable);\n   <em>\n    Heinzmann v.

The latter of those two incidents, which occurred on November 9, 2014, also was not \"substantially similar\" because it was\n   \"basically a shooting in the air\" and actually occurred while a security guard was present. The third incident, which did happen closer in time to the incident involving Mr. Spencer, still was not \"substantially similar\" because the victim of that incident was not a QuikTrip customer but was a taxi driver who had driven to the QuikTrip at gunpoint and who was killed after leaving the QuikTrip. Therefore, in addition to these incidents having occurred on weekends, as opposed to weekday nights, there are independent reasons why the incidents cannot be considered \"substantially similar.\" The Court agrees with QuikTrip that there were no prior incidents that were sufficient to put QuikTrip or any of its employees on notice of the allegedly dangerous condition of not having a security guard on weekday nights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The incident involving Mr. Spencer was not foreseeable, and QuikTrip therefore had no duty to guard against injury that might be inflicted by third parties on weekday nights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   b.

For example, Plaintiffs point out that QuikTrip employees were supposed to follow a panic alarm system where they pushed an alarm upon observing a fight, someone loitering, a threat to a customer or employee, or larceny. Plaintiffs also emphasize that employees were supposed to watch the parking lot and engage this panic alarm system if they saw a fight or threat to a customer. Plaintiffs argue that the failure of any employee on the night in question to watch the parking lot, using cameras or otherwise, and to engage the panic alarm system before the shooting took place creates a genuine issue as to QuikTrip's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Here, even if the on-duty manager negligently failed to monitor the parking lot and to press the panic alarm upon observing\n   a threat to a customer and/or even if QuikTrip was negligent with respect to the monitoring of the cameras, Plaintiffs point to no evidence that Mr. Spencer was even aware of the cameras or of Mr. Reyes's ability to press a panic alarm such that Mr. Spencer relied on those security undertakings while on the premises of QuikTrip. Moreover, Plaintiffs have not pointed to evidence that there was an increased risk of harm arising from the undertaking of security measures. Therefore, in addition to the Court's finding above that there was no initial duty that QuikTrip could have breached, the \"mistake\" by Mr. Reyes in not paying attention to the parking lot at the time of the incident in question and the inability of QuikTrip employees to view video footage onsite provide no basis to impose liability against QuikTrip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   c.
