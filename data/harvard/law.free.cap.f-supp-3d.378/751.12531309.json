Defendants sought dismissal of Hazley's complaint, and Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Cowan Wright issued a Report and Recommendation concluding that Defendants' motion should be granted in part and denied in part.

Defendants argue these cases are distinguishable because the pretrial detainees were in the custody of the sheriff who unlawfully interfered with the constitutional right, whereas Hazley was in custody at Hennepin County Jail and Dooley and Cisar, MCF-Moose Lake officials, \"had no authority over the Hennepin County Jail detaining [Hazley].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 7. To be sure, Defendants' role in the causal chain was not to open the gates of freedom and release Hazley. But Defendants' role was no less important: to release Hazley's funds, whether to Hennepin County or Hazley or his lawyer, so that he could be released on bail. A reasonable official at MCF-Moose Lake would understand that inhibiting Hazley's access to his funds would prevent him from being released on bail (even if it was Hennepin County that would actually release him).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On a related note, Defendants object to the fact that\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dodds\n   </em>\n   are \"mere persuasive authority\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that there is no binding Eighth Circuit case on point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Obj. at 6-7 (\"[T]he Tenth and Eleventh Circuits [sic] decisions in\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dodd\n   </em>\n   [sic] did not establish a clear precedent sufficient to put Defendants Dooley and Cisar on notice that their alleged conduct was clearly unconstitutional.\").
