Meagher, and Emma G. Meacher's (\"Existing Parties\") joint motion to add defendants (Doc. 48); (2) Plaintiff's motion to exclude expert testimony (Doc. 24); and (3) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 25). The joint motion to add defendants is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . Plaintiffs' motion to exclude expert testimony is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . Finally, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Underlying State Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts alleged in the underlying state court tort action,\n   <em>\n    Meagher v. Xytex Tissue Services, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2017RCCV00492, Superior Court of Richmond County, Georgia (\"Underlying Lawsuit\"), giving rise to the present coverage action are largely undisputed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Lawsuit Compl., Doc. 1-2.) Defendant Xytex Tissue Services, LLC (\"Defendant Xytex\") stores biological material at low temperatures. (St. of Mat. Facts, Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   25-2, \u00b6 1 (admitted).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To keep the material cooled to the appropriate temperature, Defendant Xytex employs cryogenic storage freezers \"cooled by an on-site liquid nitrogen delivery system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3 (admitted).) If the pressure in the delivery system exceeds the permissible limits, the relief valves open to release liquid nitrogen and lower the pressure in the system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10 (admitted).) Once released, the liquid nitrogen vaporizes into nitrogen gas. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14 (admitted).) On February 5, 2017, the pressure release process occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10 (admitted).) The system released the liquid nitrogen - which subsequently vaporized - into Defendant Xytex's warehouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7 (admitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The discharge of the nitrogen into the warehouse set in motion a series of unfortunate events. At the outset, the oxygen level in the warehouse began to drop, triggering the warehouse's oxygen sensor alarm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (admitted).) The accumulation of gaseous nitrogen in the warehouse formed a dense fog setting off the warehouse's motion detectors and burglar alarms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15 (admitted).) A Defendant Xytex employee first responded to the alarms, then collapsed in the warehouse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Underlying Lawsuit Compl., \u00b6 30.) Next, Deputy Greg Meagher entered the warehouse. (St. of Mat. Facts, \u00b6 23 (admitted).) He, too, succumbed to the conditions in the warehouse and died as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24; Underlying Lawsuit Compl., \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following Deputy Meagher's passing, Lindsey Meagher, Mary Margaret Meagher, and Grace Meagher (\"Meagher Defendants\") filed the Underlying Lawsuit against Defendant Xytex and other defendants. (Underlying Lawsuit Compl.) Plaintiff, disputing its duties to indemnify and defend, is defending Defendant Xytex in the Underlying Lawsuit under a reservation of rights. (Reservation of Rights Letters, Docs. 22-1, 22-3, 22-4, 22-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Declaratory Judgment Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Believing coverage is excluded under two insurance policies, Plaintiff filed the instant declaratory judgment suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Doc. 1.) Defendant Xytex is an additional named insured under commercial general liability policy number 3AA116895 (\"Primary Policy\") and named insured on commercial excess policy number EZXS1005877 (\"Excess Policy,\" and collectively with Primary Policy, \"Policies\"). (St. of Mat. Facts, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34 (factual assertions admitted).) Plaintiff asks that the Court grant summary judgment, thereby declaring that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Defendant Xytex in connection with the Underlying Lawsuit. (Mot. for Summ. J., Doc. 25, at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Insurance Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The General Policy contains the following coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I - COVERAGES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE A - BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

But:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) The amount we will pay for damages is limited as described in Section III - Limits Of Insurance; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) Our right and duty to defend ends when we have used up the applicable limit of insurance in the payment of judgments or settlements under Coverages A or B or medical expenses under Coverage C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   No other obligation or liability to pay sums or perform acts or services is covered unless explicitly provided for under Supplementary Payments - Coverages A and B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Primary Policy, Doc. 1-3, at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   agree that the Primary Policy is modified by a Total Pollution Exclusion Endorsement that provides, in relevant part: \"This insurance does not apply to: ... (1) 'Bodily injury' ... which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants' at any time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.) As defined by the Primary Policy, \"pollutants\" are \"any solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Punitive or Exemplary Damages Exclusion in the Combination General Endorsement further modifies the Primary Policy: \"This insurance does not apply to: ... Fines, penalties, and punitive or exemplary damages, or any expenses or any obligation to share such damages or repay another.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59.) The Combination General Endorsement also contains a Hazardous or Toxic Materials exclusion: \"This insurance does not apply to: ... 'Bodily injury' ... or any injury, loss, or damage, including consequential injury, loss or damage, arising out of, caused or contributed to by 'hazardous or toxic materials' ...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.) \"Hazardous or toxic materials\" is defined as \"asbestos, lead, silica dust, toxic dust, 'fungi', bacteria, organic pathogens, bio-organic growth or systemic chemical poison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Excess Policy insured Defendant Xytex beyond the limits of the Primary Policy. (St. of Mat. Facts, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41 (factual assertions admitted).) As with the Primary Policy, the Excess Policy contains a Pollution exclusion: \"This policy does not apply to ... [a]ny liability arising out of actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal,\n   seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants' at any time.\" (Excess Policy, Doc. 1-4, at 37.) \"Pollutants,\" in relevant part, is defined the same in the Excess Policy as the Primary Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Primary Policy, at 44.) The Excess Policy additionally contains a Punitive or Exemplary Damages exclusion. (Excess Policy, at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Reservation of Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff drafted and sent Defendant Xytex several \"Reservation of Rights\" letters. The first letter, dated February 13, 2017, explained that Plaintiff was investigating the incident and reserved the right to supplement the letter in the future. (Doc. 22-1.) At the time of the second Reservation of Rights letter, dated June 12, 2017, no lawsuit had been filed, and Plaintiff notified Defendant Xytex that it was continuing to investigate the matter. (Doc. 22-3.) The third Reservation of Rights letter confirmed Defendant Xytex's receipt of notice of the Underlying Lawsuit. (Doc. 22-4.) In relevant part, the third letter \"reserve[d] the right to seek reimbursement of any defense costs paid on Xytex's behalf if a court finds that [Plaintiff] has no duty to defend Xytex for all of the claims in the Lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Plaintiff sent a final letter (Doc. 22-6) in response to a letter from Defendant Xytex's counsel. Plaintiff again expressed it would \"continue to defend Xytex for the Lawsuit, but that defense will be subject to the full reservation of rights set out in the\" third Reservation of Rights letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Testimony of Dr. Eric J. Zuckerman\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant Xytex offers the testimony of Dr. Eric J. Zuckerman as an expert in chemistry. (Resp. to Mot. to Exclude Test., Doc. 31, at 2, 7.) Dr. Zuckerman is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Physics at Augusta University. (Zuckerman Curriculum Vitae, Doc. 16-1, at 1.) Dr. Zuckerman holds bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in chemistry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Xytex tenders Dr. Zuckerman's testimony to support its position that liquid nitrogen is not an irritant, contaminant, or systemic chemical poison. (Zuckerman Expert Report, Doc. 16; Resp. to Mot. to Exclude Test., at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to exclude Dr. Zuckerman's testimony entirely or, in the alternative, exclude portions of his testimony interpreting the insurance contract. (Br. Supp. Mot. to Exclude Test., Doc. 24-1, at 11-21.) Plaintiff argues that Dr. Zuckerman's testimony is improper because interpreting the contract is a matter of law for the Court and he is unqualified to testify as an expert regarding matters of insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Joint Motion to Add Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After completing summary judgment briefing, the Parties filed their joint motion to add Lindsey Meagher, as Executor for the Estate of Greg Meagher\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Xytex Cryo International, LTD.; and Xytex Properties LLC as party defendants in this action pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 19 and 21 (\"Joinder Defendants,\" and collectively with Defendant Xytex and Meagher Defendants, \"Defendants\"). (Joint Mot. to Add Defs., Doc. 48.) The Parties represent that the Underlying Lawsuit was recently amended to add Lindsey Meagher, as Executor for the Estate of Greg Meagher, as a plaintiff and the remaining Joinder Defendants as defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) The joint motion further: (1) Requests that the Joinder Defendants\n   be treated as if they were parties from the commencement of this action; and (2) States that the Joinder Defendants agree to be bound by the rulings on Plaintiff's motions for summary judgment and to exclude expert testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JOINT MOTION TO ADD DEFENDANTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Parties agree that with the addition of the Joinder Defendants to the Underlying Lawsuit, they are necessary defendants in this action. (Joint Mot. to Add Defs., \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 4-5.) The Court agrees that adding the Joinder Defendants is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MOTION TO EXCLUDE EXPERT TESTIMONY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the admission of Dr. Zuckerman's testimony pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   .

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Dr. Zuckerman's testimony will not assist the trier of fact, that Dr. Zuckerman is not qualified to testify as an insurance expert, and that Dr. Zuckerman's methodology is unreliable. The Court addresses each contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Fit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff's primary objection to the admission of Dr. Zuckerman's testimony is that his testimony does not \"fit\" the issue the trier of fact will decide. The Court understands Plaintiff's \"fit\" argument to be multifaceted. First, Plaintiff argues that Dr. Zuckerman's testimony does not assist with interpreting the Pollution and Hazardous or Toxic Materials exclusions. Second, Plaintiff contends Dr. Zuckerman offers impermissible legal conclusions. The Court addresses Plaintiff's positions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff's argument that, as discussed in Section IV(B),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , determining the plain language of the contract and applying rules of construction when necessary is a matter of law for the Court. But Plaintiff does not address whether Dr. Zuckerman's testimony fits in the event the Court determines the Policies' language is ambiguous and the rules of contract construction do not resolve the ambiguity as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that point, the contracting parties' intended meaning of the terms contained in the Policies becomes a fact issue for the jury.\n   <em>\n    RLI Ins.

Where any matter of fact is involved, the jury should find that fact.\"); O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-2-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff takes the position that if the Court refuses to conclude that the policy unambiguously excludes coverage Plaintiff is obligated to provide a defense under Georgia law. At that point, the issue is resolved, and Dr. Zuckerman's testimony will be useless to a jury. Again, the Court agrees with Plaintiff's interpretation of Georgia law on this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BBL-McCarthy, LLC v. Baldwin Paving Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3369263\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/285/494/\">\n    285 Ga.App. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3369263\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/285/494/\">\n    646 S.E.2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685 (2007). Of course, Plaintiff's complaint contends that it has no duty to defend or indemnify under the Policies. (Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, 44-45.) Plaintiff also moves for summary judgment on both issues: the duties to defend and indemnify. In the event the Court concludes that the allegations in the complaint of the Underlying Lawsuit do not unambiguously exclude coverage, Plaintiff will have a duty to defend. But, if ambiguity remains regarding Plaintiff's obligation to indemnify, a jury will resolve the intent of the Parties. Said another way, upon a finding of ambiguity, Plaintiff's duty to defend will be decided, but a jury in this declaratory judgment action will analyze fact issues ultimately determining if Plaintiff has a duty to indemnify. Consequently, if Dr. Zuckerman's testimony meets the other\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   requirements, his testimony is admissible to assist the jury in resolving the remaining fact issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, Plaintiff offers authority stating that the expert may not simply reiterate Defendant Xytex's contract interpretation or the legal arguments of its\n   counsel. (Br. Supp. Mot. to Exclude Test., at 12.)

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Zuckerman Expert Report, Doc. 16, \u00b6 7) (\"Liquid nitrogen is not a 'pollutant' as defined in section (ii) below because it is neither an irritant nor a contaminant under the facts of this case.\"), \u00b6 14 (\"In addition, liquid nitrogen is not a 'hazardous or toxic material' as defined in section (ii) below.\") However, to the extent fact issues remain as to the intent and understanding of ambiguous terms - i.e., irritant, contaminant, or systemic chemical poison - Dr. Zuckerman is permitted to testify regarding the nature of liquid nitrogen, its classification as one of the ambiguous terms in the science community, and any other opinions he is qualified to offer that are not merely a legal conclusion or legal opinion. Ultimately, the contracting parties' intended meaning of ambiguous terms is a question of fact. Dr. Zuckerman's opinions regarding these ambiguous terms are not excluded simply because his opinions may embrace an ultimate issue for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook ex rel. Estate of Tessier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9180963\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/1092/#p1113\">\n    402 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1112 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Qualified to Testify\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff next disputes Dr. Zuckerman's competency to testify under the \"qualified\" prong of\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   , and the cases in the Eleventh Circuit interpreting it, claiming that he is unqualified to testify as an insurance expert. First, the Court agrees that Dr. Zuckerman is not qualified to testify as an insurance expert, and Defendant Xytex concedes that it is not offering Dr. Zuckerman for his insurance expertise. (Resp. to Mot. to Exclude, at 7.) Authority does not require an expert to be qualified as to all issues that may arise in a particular case. Before his testimony may be admitted, the expert must be \"qualified to testify competently regarding the matters\n   <em>\n    he intends to address.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11670161\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/548/#p562\">\n    158 F.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 (11th Cir. 1998) (emphasis added). Insurance is undoubtedly a large element of this dispute, but Dr. Zuckerman is not proffered to opine on the interpretation of these terms generally in the insurance industry. Dr. Zuckerman intends to offer testimony as to terminology in the field of chemistry and the nature of liquid nitrogen, both subject matters within his expertise. Defendant Xytex's business is science oriented. Should the contracting parties' intent become an issue of fact, Defendant Xytex's understanding of certain terms could become relevant to resolving that fact issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scholer Decl., Doc. 32-3, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 5, 6.) Plaintiff does not dispute whether Dr. Zuckerman is qualified as a chemistry expert, and the Court sees no issue with his qualifications as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With that said, the Court reaches the following conclusions. Although the Court finds little, if anything, in the record that needs to be excluded as outside the\n   scope of Dr. Zuckerman's expertise,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court agrees with Plaintiff that Dr. Zuckerman is not permitted to testify as an expert on insurance matters. To the extent he intends to testify regarding matters requiring insurance industry experience, that testimony is excluded. This exclusion, however, does not apply to Dr. Zuckerman offering his opinion on the meaning or intent of ambiguous, technical words in the relevant exclusions from the perspective of a chemistry expert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-2-2(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Methodology\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff moves to exclude Dr. Zuckerman's testimony because his methodology is unreliable. The record shows that Dr. Zuckerman applied his knowledge in the field of chemistry to certain terms at issue in this case. Dr. Zuckerman has studied the nature of liquid nitrogen over the course of his career. Through that time, he gained a sufficient familiarity and expertise with liquid nitrogen to reliably classify liquid nitrogen under certain scientific terminology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff first takes issue with the fact that Dr. Zuckerman did not conduct on-site testing or recreate an oxygen-deprived environment before arriving at his conclusions. The Court finds this argument unavailing. The Eleventh Circuit has recognized the existence of experience-based methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155932\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/1244/#p1262\">\n    387 F.3d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dr. Zuckerman's scientific opinion is that vaporized liquid nitrogen is never an irritant, contaminant, or poison under the facts presented based upon the meaning of those terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had he performed any number of tests, his opinions would be the same because they are based on his experience evaluating the nature of nitrogen and vaporized liquid nitrogen's interaction with the human body and natural air. To the extent Plaintiff disputes the factual accuracy of this opinion, it will have the opportunity to challenge it on cross examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Furthermore, although applying \"common knowledge\" to \"fundamental definitions\" in the scientific world does not easily lend itself to peer review or an error rate, Dr. Zuckerman consulted additional sources to confirm his understanding of the issue. (Zuckerman Dep., Doc. 23-1, at 8-11, 41.) There is little left for Dr. Zuckerman to do when relying on his own expertise and experience with nitrogen and scientific terminology. For this reason, district courts are given flexibility to determine which, if any, of the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors apply in a particular case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Quiet Tech.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9321196\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/1333/#p1340\">\n    326 F.3d at 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Courts consider\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   reliability factors \"to the extent possible.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under these circumstances, Plaintiff's reliance on the reliability factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. Although Dr. Zuckerman's opinions are scientific, his opinions do not rely on experimental testing or scientific methodology. As stated in\n   <em>\n    Valdes\n   </em>\n   , when the methodology involves \"mere identification and comparison\" utilizing the expert's years of experience on that particular subject, the factors outlined in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   are generally inapplicable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12397977\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/681/874/#p881\">\n    681 F. App'x at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Dr. Zuckerman is asked to provide the meaning of certain terms in his field and compare those terms with his knowledge of liquid nitrogen. Dr. Zuckerman's testimony explains how his experience leads to his conclusions, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinions, and how the experience is reliably applied to the facts. (Zuckerman Dep., at 15, 29-30, 36-44.) His years of studying and teaching chemistry provided him the expertise needed to provide his opinion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, Dr. Zuckerman's significant experience as a chemistry scholar and professor and his involvement with liquid nitrogen satisfy the Court that his opinions are reliable in the scientific community. Because the Court concludes (1) Dr. Zuckerman is qualified to testify as a chemistry expert; (2) his methodology for his opinions as to the meaning of terms in the scientific community is sufficiently reliable; and (3) his testimony will assist the trier of fact, except as otherwise limited herein, Dr. Zuckerman's testimony is admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Upon reviewing several definitions, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's definitions, applied in\n   <em>\n    Lake Hills\n   </em>\n   , do not render nitrogen's status as an \"irritant\" or \"contaminant\" unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Lake Hills\n   </em>\n   , citing the Random House Unabridged Dictionary (2d ed. 1987), defined \"irritant\" as \"anything that annoys\" and \"contaminant\" as \"something that makes 'impure or unsuitable by contact or mixture with something unclean, bad, etc.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 438, 1010;\n   <em>\n    Lake Hills\n   </em>\n   , at 5-6. These definitions do not demand the conclusion that nitrogen is an \"irritant,\" and resultingly, a \"pollutant.\" The Parties agree that nitrogen is present in large quantities in the ambient air. (St. of Mat. Facts, \u00b6 13; Resp. to St. of Mat. Facts, \u00b6 13.) On the one hand, if nitrogen is inhaled in large quantities, with no adverse effect, it cannot be said to annoy. On the other hand, if it can create an oxygen-deprived environment leading to asphyxiation, the Court understands how nitrogen could be considered something that annoys. Contaminant also yields multiple interpretations. If nitrogen was an unclean or bad substance, the human population would be unable to inhale the substance in such large quantities. Similarly, the air is not considered unclean or impure because it contains nitrogen. However, in an enclosed environment, it is possible to interpret that nitrogen makes the air unsuitable for breathing by forcing down the oxygen concentration. With multiple, plausible interpretations, \"irritant\" and \"contaminant\" do not decidedly encompass vaporized liquid nitrogen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   If the plain language of the policy does not result in a finding that the terms are unambiguous, Georgia law requires the reviewing court to apply rules of contract construction.\n   <em>\n    Geiger v.

'Bodily injury' ... which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of 'pollutants' at any time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court discusses Defendant Xytex's \"arising out of\" argument below, the provision must be read in its entirety in an attempt to determine the meaning of \"pollutant.\" The language is clear that coverage is excluded when the release of \"pollutants\" causes bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant Xytex argues that because the Underlying Lawsuit fails to allege that inhalation of nitrogen caused the health issue, it is not a \"pollutant.\" Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that a substance as \"innocuous\" as storm water run-off meets the pollutant exclusion. (Br. Supp. Mot. for Summ. J., Doc. 25-1, at 12.) Although true, when reading the provision in its entirety, the type of injury sustained is essential to analyzing the exclusion. Where property damage is the injury, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Lake Hills\n   </em>\n   , water run-off that has \"significant detrimental effects on the quality of waters into which they flow\" is unambiguously a \"contaminant.\" The same is true for carbon monoxide and lead poisoning caused bodily injury. The adverse health affects of lead poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning are well known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782431\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/298/716/\">\n    784 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   426 n.1 (\"[T]oxic effects of lead have been known for centuries.\") Therefore, when bodily injury results from the migration, release, or escape of lead-based paint or carbon monoxide, the substances unambiguously meet the definition for \"pollutant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782431\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/298/716/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 425-26 ;\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636837\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/284/286/\">\n    667 S.E.2d at 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same cannot be said for nitrogen. The facts of this case more closely resemble\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Lake Hills\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   remains good law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   When read as a whole, the provision is susceptible to multiple meanings. Plaintiff reasons that because nitrogen displaces oxygen in the air, it is an \"irritant\" to persons attempting to breathe the air and is a \"contaminant\" to the breathable air; the resulting bodily injury arose from that pollution. Defendant Xytex responds that the Underlying Lawsuit alleges that lack of oxygen caused the injury and there is no contamination or irritation of the body in the way carbon monoxide and lead contaminate and irritate the body or water run-off contaminates a lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, the Court cannot ignore the mandate to construe ambiguities against the insurer and that insurance exclusions are to be strictly construed. There is evidence in the record that, considering Defendant Xytex is in the business of storing tissue at low temperatures using liquid nitrogen, Defendant Xytex reasonably expected\n   that liability related to a nitrogen leak would be insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Scholer Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.) After reviewing the plain language of the insurance contract, analyzing the applicable law, and applying Georgia's rules of contract construction, ambiguity remains. There is an issue of fact as to whether the Parties intended for nitrogen to be considered an \"irritant\" or \"contaminant,\" and the Court may not guess or speculate as to the Parties' intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RLI Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824067\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/280/798/\">\n    635 S.E.2d at 171-72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Hazardous of Toxic Materials Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiff's argument that the Hazardous or Toxic Materials exclusion unambiguously excludes coverage less convincing than its Pollution exclusion argument. Again, reviewing the plain language, \"hazardous or toxic materials\" is defined as \"[a]sbestos, lead, silica dust, toxic dust, 'fungi', bacteria, organic pathogens, bio-organic growth or systemic chemical poison.\" Nitrogen is not enumerated. Instead, Plaintiff argues that nitrogen is undoubtedly a \"systemic chemical poison.\" (Br. Supp. Mot. for Summ. J., at 14.) Because systemic chemical poison is not defined, Plaintiff combines definitions of \"systemic\" and \"poison.\" The Parties appear to agree that \"systemic\" is intended to mean \"affecting the body generally\" or something similar. The issue, like under the Pollution exclusion, becomes whether the plain language of the exclusion is read to include nitrogen as a poison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Here, nitrogen is not certainly a poison, and the Court is faced with equally plausible interpretations of poison. \"Poison\" carries either its broad meaning as a substance that inhibits the activity of another substance or the course of a chemical reaction or process, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14) or more narrow meaning as a substance that causes illness or death when absorbed. (Def.'s Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J., at 21.) The plain language of the Policies does not require a finding that Plaintiff's definition prevails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that based on the underlying allegations - namely, Defendant Xytex's failure to advise or warn of the presence and storage of hazardous gas in the warehouse (Underlying Lawsuit Compl., \u00b6 10) - that nitrogen must be hazardous. (Br. Supp. Mot. for Summ. J., at 15.) However, as noted in footnote eight,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court may not substitute another definition for \"hazardous or toxic materials.\" The term \"hazardous or toxic materials\" is plainly defined in the Primary Policy. Consequently, for the purposes of this exclusion, the meaning of \"systemic chemical poison\" is determinative, and the Court concludes \"systemic chemical poison\" carries plausible meanings that do not necessarily encompass liquid nitrogen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Turning to the rules of contract construction, the ambiguity is not resolved. Extrinsic evidence on the issue is limited, and the traditional rules of construction do not materially aid in resolving the ambiguity. For this and other reasons discussed in the contract construction analysis for the Pollution exclusion, a fact issue as to the intent of the Parties remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Exclusions' Causation Requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Defendant Xytex further contests summary judgment because it contends a fact\n   issue exists as to whether the nitrogen release caused the injuries complained of in the Underlying Lawsuit. According to the relevant exclusions, to succeed on summary judgment, Plaintiff is required to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact that nitrogen is a \"pollutant\" or \"hazardous or toxic material\" and that the release of the \"pollutant\" or \"hazardous or toxic material\" caused Greg Meagher's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Primary Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In relevant part, the Primary Policy excludes coverage for \" 'bodily injury' ... which would not have occurred in whole or part but for the ... release ... of 'pollutants' at any time.\" The plain language of the Policy, \"would not have occurred in whole or part but for,\" is unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   concluded that when an exclusion provision contains causation language such as \"arising out of,\" courts apply a \"but for\" or \"cause-in-fact\" analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134600\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/304/314/\">\n    696 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Parties dispute whether the release of nitrogen was, in part, a but for cause of the bodily injury. In light of\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff has failed to make a showing that the release of nitrogen was a partial but for cause as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Court agrees with Plaintiff that, according to the plain language, Plaintiff is not required to show the release of nitrogen was the sole cause. The record demonstrates that whether the release of nitrogen was a partial but for cause of the injuries is in dispute because nitrogen is naturally harmless. Moreover, as\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   instructs, an evaluation of the Underlying Lawsuit complaint reveals that several actions attributed to Defendant Xytex beyond the release of liquid nitrogen are alleged to have caused the injury. (Underlying Lawsuit Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 40-44.) These factual disputes make it improper for the Court to determine which, if any, of the alleged causes constitute a partial but for cause of the bodily injury as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Although the language differs slightly, the Court reaches the same conclusion for the Hazardous or Toxic Materials exclusion: \"This insurance does not apply to: ... '[b]odily injury ... arising out of, caused or contributed to by 'hazardous or toxic materials' ....\" Because the language of the provision includes the words \"contributed to,\" Plaintiff is not required to show that the release of a \"hazardous or toxic material\" was the only cause. However, Plaintiff still must satisfy the but for causation requirement. For the reasons set forth above, a jury must resolve the remaining fact issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Excess Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The Pollution exclusion in the Excess Policy requires Plaintiff to make a greater showing than the Primary Policy: \"This policy does not apply to: ... [a]ny liability arising out of the ... release of 'pollutants' at any time.\" The \"arising out of\" language is unambiguous and precisely tracts the language in\n   <em>\n    Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134600\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/304/314/\">\n    696 S.E.2d at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the language mandates a but for causation showing. Furthermore, the Excess Policy does not permit a showing that the release of the \"pollutant\" was a partial cause. Succeeding at the summary judgment stage on the causation requirement under the Excess Policy demands that the release of a \"pollutant\" was the single, undisputed cause-in-fact of the alleged injuries as a matter of law. Again, Plaintiff has not met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages Exclusions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Defendant Xytex concedes that the Primary and Excess Policies exclude\n   coverage for punitive damages in the Underlying Lawsuit. (Def.'s Resp. to Mot. for Summ. J., at 7 n.3.) Because Defendant Xytex does not oppose that the language excluding coverage for punitive damages is unambiguous, summary judgment is proper as to Plaintiff's claim that it has no duty to indemnify for punitive damages pursuant to the Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Reimbursement of Defense Costs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment asks the Court to order the reimbursement of defense costs upon reaching the conclusion that it had no obligation to defend the Underlying Lawsuit. \"Whether an insurer has a duty to defend depends on the language of the policy as compared with the allegations of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    HDI-Gerling Am.

The Court is not determining, nor is it tasked with determining, whether \"poison\" or \"poisoning,\" or the absence thereof, places a substance within or outside the definition of \"pollutant.\"\n    <em>\n     Reed\n    </em>\n    found that carbon monoxide, which poisoned the plaintiff in the underlying litigation, unambiguously qualified as an irritant or contaminant, and therefore, a pollutant.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636837\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/284/286/\">\n     667 S.E.2d at 92\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court here must decide whether, based on the allegations in the Underlying Lawsuit that the accumulation of nitrogen created an oxygen-deprived environment, \"irritant\" or \"contaminant\" unambiguously incorporate nitrogen. Even if \"poison\" or \"poisoning\" is not required to classify a substance as an \"irritant\" or \"contaminant,\" it does not necessarily follow that all non-poisons or non-poisonous substances meet the definition of \"irritant\" or \"contaminant.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Defendant Xytex provided several more restrictive definitions in support of its position as well.

However, because the Court concludes that the broader definitions supplied by\n    <em>\n     Lake Hills\n    </em>\n    do not render the plain language unambiguous, the Court need not supply analysis on other definitions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    Plaintiff directs the Court to the history of pollution exclusions in general liability contracts.

The Court further recognizes that the insurance industry's removal of \"toxic\" before \"chemicals\" in \"absolute pollution exclusions,\" such as those present here, expanded the number of chemicals qualifying as pollutants.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6782431\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/298/716/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Court is not disregarding this history or\n    <em>\n     Smith\n    </em>\n    's interpretation of it. The Court is not concluding that because the vaporized liquid nitrogen was not an environmental pollutant it cannot be a \"pollutant\" as defined in the relevant exclusions. The Court is, however, determining that the nitrogen in this case is not unambiguously a \"pollutant\" according to the plain language of the exclusions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    The Court notes that the Excess Policy contains the words \"[a]ny liability\" in the place of \"bodily injury.\" However, because the \"bodily injury\" remains the injury allegedly triggering coverage, the Court analyzes the Pollution exclusions in the Primary and Excess Policies together.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Defendant Xytex argues that the Pollution exclusion violates Georgia public policy.

Relying on\n    <em>\n     Barrett\n    </em>\n    , Defendant Xytex claims that liquid nitrogen qualifies as a \"main product\" of its business and excluding coverage for the release of nitrogen gas defies Defendant Xytex's reasonably held expectations for coverage.
