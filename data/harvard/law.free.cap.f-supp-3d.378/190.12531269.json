For the reasons described below, the Court grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration and to stay these proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Vargas and Rivera are both residents of Jackson Heights, New York and former employees of Bay Terrace, a restaurant corporation doing business as Allora Italian Kitchen &amp; Bar. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10). Both Vargas and Rivera served in miscellaneous positions at Bay Terrace, including as food runners, bussers, and cleaners, from around April 2017 to July 2017 and November 2016 to July 2017, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bay Terrace is a New York corporation located at 210-35 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Avenue, Bayside, New York 11360. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). According to the Complaint, it is \"an enterprise engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the FLSA\" because its annual gross sales exceed $ 500,000 and its employees are engaged in commerce or otherwise work with goods that have been moved in or produced for commerce. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Menexas and Steinberger are both owners and officers of Bay Terrace with power to \"hire and fire employees ..., establish and pay their wages, set their work schedule, and maintain[ ] their employment records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 18-21, 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Complaint alleges that Defendants failed to pay Plaintiffs for hours worked and overtime wages in violation of FLSA and NYLL, failed to provide written notice of their rate of pay in violation of NYLL, and failed to provide wage statements in violation of NYLL. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66, 71, 74, 79, 82, 85). They seek a declaratory judgment, unpaid and overtime wages, liquidated damages, interest, and attorney's fees and costs. (Prayer for Relief, attached to Compl., at 10). Defendants answered the Complaint on April 19, 2018 asserting 26 affirmative defenses, none of which involved arbitration. (Answer dated Apr. 19, 2018, Dkt.

(Defs.' Mot. at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreements and Waivers of Class/Collective Actions, attached as Ex. E to Defs.' Mot., Dkt.

Mot. at 3;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreements). In relevant part, the Agreements provide that claims subject to arbitration include those \"arising under ... the Fair Labor Standards Act[,] ... the New York Minimum Wage Act, the New York Payment of Wages Law, any other applicable New York wage and overtime laws, ... and any other claims ... arising out of or related to Employee's employment with, and/or the termination of his or her employment by, Employer.\" (Arbitration Agreements at 1). The agreements also contain a class and collective action waiver-requiring that the claims be arbitrated individually. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any arbitration must be initiated within one year from the date the claims arose, to the extent permitted by law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon any ruling by the arbitrator, costs and attorney's fees are to be awarded to the prevailing party, again to the extent permitted by law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants also request the current proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of arbitration. (Defs.' Mot. at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Agreements are unenforceable under FLSA and general contract principles.

Instead, Plaintiffs make a series of general attacks on the Arbitration Agreements, making no mention of the delegation provision. For example, they assert that the Agreements are invalid because the Plaintiffs do not speak English, that they were given an unconscionable choice between signing the agreement or not being able to work, and that the Agreement contains provisions that are inconsistent with FLSA. Nowhere do Plaintiffs even mention the delegation provision. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp.).
