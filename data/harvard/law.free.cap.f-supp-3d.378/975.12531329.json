The plaintiff Black &amp; Veatch Corporation (\"B &amp; V\") has filed a motion for partial summary judgment (ECF# 337) and a motion to amend the pretrial order (ECF# 339). The defendants Aspen Insurance (UK) Ltd. and Lloyd's Syndicate 2003 (collectively \"Aspen\" or \"Excess Insurers\") have filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF# 340. The motions are fully briefed and ripe for decision. For the sake of brevity and convenience, the court will incorporate by reference from its prior order the summary judgment standards (ECF# 230, pp. 2-3) and general New York law governing interpretation of insurance contracts and the respective burdens of establishing coverage, exclusions and exceptions (ECF# 230, pp. 11-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiff B &amp; V is suing the defendants who are first layer excess umbrella liability insurers under a manuscript commercial general liability (\"CGL\") policy for coverage of B &amp; V's claimed liability for damages to seven Jet Bubble Reactors (\"JBRs\"). B &amp; V contracted with American Electric Power (\"AEP\") \"to engineer, procure and construct [\"EPC\"] wet flue gas desulfurization systems (JBRs) for eight installations.\" (ECF# 294, \u00b6 1, PTO). \"Under an EPC contract, B &amp; V delivers services under a single contract. It supervises the project and typically subcontracts most-if not all-of the actual procurement and construction work.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516019\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/952/\">\n    882 F.3d at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   B &amp; V procured CGL policies to cover its JBR work. Zurich American Insurance Company (\"Zurich\") provided the primary layer of coverage having the following limits: $ 2,000,000 per occurrence and $ 4,000,000 for general and products-completed operations aggregate limits. Aspen provided the first layer of excess/umbrella liability coverage with per occurrence and aggregate limits of $ 25,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As for the property damage claim made against B &amp; V, the Tenth Circuit summarizes it in these terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   For at least seven of these JBRs, which were located at four different power plants in Ohio and Indiana, B &amp; V subcontracted the engineering and construction of the internal components to Midwest Towers, Inc. (\"MTI\"). Deficiencies in the components procured by MTI and constructed by MTI's subcontractors caused internal components of the JBRs to deform, crack, and sometimes collapse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   After work on three of the JBRs was completed, and while construction of four others was ongoing, AEP alerted B &amp; V to the property damage arising from MTI's negligent construction. AEP and B &amp; V entered into settlement agreements resolving their disputes relating to the JBRs at issue here. Under the agreements, B &amp; V was obligated to pay more than $ 225 million in costs associated with repairing and replacing the internal components of the seven JBRs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516019\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/952/\">\n    882 F.3d at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties also stipulate in the pretrial order to the following facts\n   that are relevant to these motion proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   11. After Black &amp; Veatch completed construction of the Cardinal 1 and 2 and Conesville JBRs, the Owners alleged deficiencies in the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   12. Cardinal 1 was completed and began operating in March 2008. Deficiencies in the JBR components were discovered as early as August 2008, and Cardinal 1 had to be shut down and repaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   13. Cardinal 2 was completed and began operating in December 2007. Deficiencies in the JBR components were discovered as early as May 2008, and Cardinal 2 had to be shut down and repaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   14. Conesville was completed and began operating in January 2009. In the fall of 2009, it was determined that the gas risers installed at Conesville, as well as the gas risers installed at each of the other six JBRs, were deficient and required removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   15. Because of defective gas risers and other deficiencies in the JBRs, the Owners demanded that Black &amp; Veatch make repairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   16. At the time the Owners made their demands on Black &amp; Veatch, the Cardinal 1 and 2 projects, and the Conesville project were completed operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   17. During the summer of 2010, Black &amp; Veatch and the Owners of the JBRs, entered into settlement agreements resolving their disputes relating to eight JBRs, including the seven at issue here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   18. As part of the settlements, Black &amp; Veatch agreed, among other things, to replace most internal components of the JBRs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   19. In replacing the internal components, Black &amp; Veatch has obtained contribution from various parties responsible for the costs incurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Dk. 294, pp. 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As it did in the prior summary judgment order, the court sets out the general nature of the plaintiff's claims deferring to its characterization. The plaintiff is claiming coverage for property damage resulting directly from the work of the subcontractors on behalf of B &amp; V and from B &amp; V's failure to deliver professional services both of which resulted in the installation of defective risers. For the\n   <em>\n    three completed and operating JBRs\n   </em>\n   , Cardinal 1 and 2 and Conesville, B &amp; V's claim is for the property damage resulting from alleged deficiencies with the installation and errors with the design and supervision of the risers that \"resulted in excessive mineral deposits accumulating on the decks and other internal components of the JBRs, the weight of which in turn caused those components to deform, crack, and, in some cases, collapse entirely.\" ECF# 294, Pretrial Order, p. 7. Cardinal 1 and 2 JBRs were so badly damaged that the owners no longer considered them viable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8. The owners demanded complete replacement of the badly damaged internal components.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, B &amp; V is making a coverage claim for its liability incurred to repair or replace the property damaged from the occurrence of the continual, ongoing and unforeseen buildup of deposits in the JBRs. ECF #297-3, Wood Dep. pp. 14-17. For the\n   <em>\n    uncompleted JBRs\n   </em>\n   , B &amp; V's claim is for property damage to other non-defective internal components that resulted from work done to access, remove and replace the installed defective gas risers. Thus, B &amp; V is making a coverage claim for its liability for the damage done to non-defective internal components from being removed based on the occurrence of the defective gas risers being installed and then needing to be torn out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 297-3,\n   pp. 29-30; ECF# 297-8, Miller Dep. p. 157-158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ASPEN'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (ECF# 340)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Aspen advances numerous arguments, and the court will follow the order used by Aspen in its original memorandum. At the outset, some of Aspen's arguments trigger deciding whether these matters were resolved by the Tenth Circuit on appeal and are subject to the law of the case doctrine or the mandate rule.

Aspen singles out the Tenth Circuit's opinion at page 960 as no more than a comment on one treatise writer's opinion about this exclusionary language in CGL policies. Aspen also argues the Tenth Circuit's discussion of Endorsement 4 was not a final ruling but was only to show how this provision would be rendered superfluous if the insuring agreement could not \"cover damage to the insured's work in the first instance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516019\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/952/\">\n    882 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For the court to rule in favor of Aspen on this argument, the district court would have to interpret \"particular part\" contrary to the appellate court's opinion. The Tenth Circuit's narrow reading of \"particular part\" was important in drawing its conclusion on surplusage. A broader reading of \"particular part\" would have certainly weakened the surplusage rationale behind its ruling. The law of the case doctrine forecloses the court's consideration of Aspen's argument on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Property Damage to Cardinal 3 Occurring During Policy Period\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Under the basic insuring agreement, Aspen is to pay B &amp; V for its legal obligations to pay \" 'Property Damage' occurring during the Policy Period stated in Item 4 of the Declarations.\" ECF# 284-1, p. 7. Declaration Item 4 specifies a policy period from November 1, 2007, to November 1, 2008. Citing the testimony of B &amp; V's corporative representative, Sheldon Wood, Aspen argues that the \"property damage\" for the Cardinal 3 plant was the removal and replacement of JBR internal components and that the rebuilding of Cardinal 3 did not begin until 2010 or after the policy expired.

The Tenth Circuit here did reserve for remand the trial court's consideration of exclusions and exceptions. Still, the question is whether the panel's findings of an occurrence and accidental damages, as not \"expected or intended\" by B &amp; V, are so closely related to the intentional act exclusion as to involve no additional consideration and as to be a matter that could\n   have been resolved on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dobbs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223289\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1275/#p1280\">\n    600 F.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Policy's definition of \"occurrence\" is \"an accident, ..., that results in 'Bodily Injury' or 'Property Damage' that is not\n   <em>\n    expected or not intended by the 'Insured.\n   </em>\n   ' \" ECF# 284-1, p. 10 (italics added).

Both require the same determination: what damages did the insured expect or intend? The Tenth Circuit expressly found that the property damages here \"were caused by an 'occurrence,' as that term is defined in the Policy, because (1) B &amp; V neither intended nor expected that its subcontractor would perform faulty work, so the damages were accidental.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516019\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/952/\">\n    882 F.3d at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The unpublished decision in\n   <em>\n    Big-D Construction\n   </em>\n   involved Utah and Minnesota law, and its analysis does not address how these provisions are typically read and applied.

Before that time, however, the standard CGL policy contained an exclusion intended to address claims that losses were incurred as a result of the insured's failure to perform its obligations. Exclusion m of the 1973 CGL form, known as the \"failure to perform\" exclusion, precluded coverage for loss of use damages where no physical injury was present resulting from: (1) a delay in or lack of performance by the insured or (2) the failure of the insured's products or work to meet a level of performance, quality, fitness or durability warranted or represented by the insured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   The 1973 \"failure to perform\" exclusion addresses the \"loss of use\" aspect of \"property damage.\" ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   Given the interpretation challenges posed by the 1973 form exclusion, many hoped that the revisions to the exclusion would provide a clearer picture. Unfortunately, the exclusion has not become simpler. The introduction of the concept of \"impaired property\" has created a new set of challenges. Commentators have opined that the new exclusion is \"too complex to receive a uniform interpretation.\" Others have found the new exclusion to be \"tricky.\" One commentator has gone so far as to conclude that the exclusion is subject to attack as \"unintelligible or at least ineffective to overcome the insured's reasonable expectations of coverage.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   The \"impaired property\" exclusion applies to two classes of property. The first, \"impaired property\" means tangible\n   property, other than \"your product\" or \"your work,\" that cannot be used or is less useful because your defective work has been incorporated into it where such property can be restored through the repair or replacement of your work. The second class of property is \"that [which] has not been physically injured. Therefore, if there is physical injury to tangible property, the second class of property implicated by the impaired property exclusion does not come into play.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   \"Impaired property\" denotes property that is different from the insured's work. In the normal case, the exclusion would have no application where the damage, including the loss of use, occurs to the construction performed by the insured or its subcontractors. In addition to not applying where usefulness may not be restored by the repair of the insured's work, courts have held the exclusion inapplicable where the repair or replacement of the insured's work would cause physical injury to other property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   4 Pt. 2 Philip L.

Aspen takes the general position that, \"[a]ny non-damaged product is either 'Impaired Property' (as defined above) or 'property which has not been physically injured' and is therefore excluded under the 'Impaired Property' exclusion (assuming that the replacement of such non-damaged product even involves 'physical harm' to the property of a third party).\" ECF# 342, p. 52. Aspen, however, fails to show how any of the JBRs' \"non-damaged property\" is \"tangible property other than ... [B &amp; V's] 'Your Work' ....\" ECF# 284-1, p. 9 (Definition of \"Impaired Property\"). The policy defines \"Your Work,\" to be B &amp; V's \"work or operations performed by\" B &amp; V or on behalf of B &amp; V. ECF# 284-1, p. 12. Thus, Aspen fails to show that the first class of property covered by this exclusion, \"Impaired Property,\" meaning tangible property other than \"Your Work,\" is involved here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scott C.

Aspen applies the exclusion saying, \"the JBR replacement claim is excluded in its entirety because the removal of\n   <em>\n    undamaged product\n   </em>\n   was caused by a defect in the risers. That is exactly the nature of the claim being made here.\" ECF# 342, p. 52. Again, Aspen's argument runs up against the actual wording and the general meaning of this exclusion. First, the wording of the exclusion actually says there is no coverage for property damage to property \"that has\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   been physically injured arising out of\" a defect in \"Your Work.\" ECF# 284-1, p. 14. In arguing the removal (the damage) of the undamaged product was caused by a defect in the risers, Aspen appears to be showing the physical injury here did arise out of a defect in B &amp; V's \"work or operations by ... [it] or on [its] ... behalf.\" ECF# 284-1, p. 12 (Definition of \"Your Work\").

Insurance companies ... developed [this exclusion] to make clear that, while they intended to pay for damages caused by a product that failed, they did not intend to pay for the costs of recalling products containing a similar defect that had not yet failed.... The exclusion is designed to limit the insurer's exposure in cases where because of the actual failure of the insured's product, similar products are withdrawn from use to prevent the failure of those other products, which have not yet failed but are suspected of containing the same defect. Thus, the exclusion is limited to the costs of withdrawing sister products of work for precautionary purposes and does not apply to claims involving property damage to product or work that has already failed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   This is a terribly significant distinction for construction claims, where very little work has a sister piece of work. Thus, the vast majority of construction claims are unaffected by the exclusion on this ground alone. Thus, one insurance industry commentary concludes, although many insurers cite this exclusion in response to a defective work claim on a construction project, it usually does not apply because a construction product is regarded as unique completed operation and not a mass-produced product subject to a recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Scott C.

Windt's commentary adds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   The most significant restriction on the applicability of the sistership exclusion is that although, according to its terms, the exclusion applies whether the insured's product is withdrawn from the \"market or from use,\" the courts have, in general, not applied the exclusion if the insured's product has already been put to use. In fact, there are a few cases that have explained that the exclusion applies only to recalls. The theory behind the incorporation cases is that (a) the sistership\n   exclusion applies only to preventative or curative actions, and (b) once incorporation has taken place, the damage has already taken place, so the withdrawal is not merely a preventative measure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   3 Allan D.

Mar. 30, 2018) (\"excess policy unambiguously required exhaustion of underlying limits through payment by the insurers rather than payment by the insured\"). Believing these authorities support the blanket application of this rule here, Aspen argues its excess policy has not been triggered because the underlying Zurich policies were not exhausted by actual payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Conceding there is not exhaustion by actual payment here, B &amp; V contends the excess policy here allows it to use \"gap filling\" between the Zurich settlement and the underlying insurance limits found in Schedule A to calculate the triggering point for coverage. B &amp; V argues this is not contrary to New York law. Unlike the case law cited by Aspen, the excess policy here does not expressly require actual payment by the underlying insurer for exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Specifically, the policy provides that Aspen will pay \"those sums in excess of the 'Retained Limit,' \" ECF# 284-1, p. 7, that is defined, in part, to mean \"with respect to any 'Occurrence' that is covered by 'Underlying Insurance' or any other insurance, the total of the applicable limits of the 'Underlying Insurance' plus the applicable limits of any other insurance,\" ECF# 284-1, p. 11. Noticeably absent from these terms is any language requiring full payment of applicable limits. Instead, the policy refers generally to \"applicable limits\" and does not expressly require the insurer's payment of those limits.

Condition G of Aspen's policy not only confirms there is no triggering requirement of actual payment by the underlying insurer, but it can be read even to allow the insured's gap filling: \"(1) We will have liability for any one 'Occurrence' only when the amount of the 'Retained Limit' with respect to such 'Occurrence' has been paid by: (a) the 'Insured'; (b) us on behalf of the \"insured' (other than under this policy); or (c) the 'Insured's' underlying insurer.\" ECF# 284-1, p. 18. Thus, the court grants partial summary judgment for B &amp; V on the issue of the Aspen policy permitting a below-limits settlement with the underlying insurer and the insured filling the gap for exhaustion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    Amount of Coverage Credited under the Zurich Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Aspen argues that should the court rule against the actual payment requirement then the court alternatively should find that Aspen is \"entitled to the following\" credits under the Zurich policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   (1) an attachment credit of $ 16 million in underlying insurance for the course of construction claims per the Zurich policies; (2) an attachment credit of $ 4 million in completed operations claims relating to the Zurich policies; (3) a credit equal to the $ 15 million received from the MTI insurers which is allocated across all covered plants; and (4) a minimum attachment credit of $ 5 million for the Clifty Creek and Kyger Creek plants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   ECF# 342, p. 62.

Aspen observes that Zurich issued two CGL policies, one for 2007/2008 and one for 2008/2009, and each has the same schedule of limits. Aspen summarily proposes first that the limits for both Zurich policies must be exhausted before coverage under its policy is triggered. Aspen then wants the aggregate limit of $ 4 million applied to each of the four uncompleted plants resulting in a $ 16 million credit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   B &amp; V articulates its position both in opposing Aspen's motion and in seeking its own partial summary judgment on this issue. To Aspen's argument that multiple years of Zurich policies are applicable, B &amp; V counters that \"its claim is limited to one Policy period for Occurrences at each JBR, which are subject to a single policy period.\" ECF# 345, p. 84.

From the Zurich policy, B &amp; V first notes that the insuring agreement fixes Zurich's liability to property damage occurring during the policy period and \"includes any continuation, change or resumption of that ... 'property damage' after the end of the policy period.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   ECF# 338-2, p. 20. Zurich's policy defines \"occurrence\" as meaning \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" ECF# 338-2, p. 33. B &amp; V maintains \"the triggering events for B &amp; V's general liability are in one policy.\" ECF# 345, p. 86. Finally, B &amp; V further points to what it calls the \"anti-stacking\" provision in the Zurich policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   If this Coverage Form and any other Coverage Form or policy issued to you by us or any company affiliated with us apply to the same \"occurrence,\" the maximum Limit of Insurance under all the Coverage Forms or policies shall not exceed the highest applicable Limit of Insurance under any one Coverage Form or policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   ECF# 338-2, p. 16, \u00b6 14. B &amp; V's position is that Zurich's coverage was limited to the one policy period because B &amp; V's liability was triggered by one occurrence, and while the damages may have continued, Zurich's coverage could not be stacked and cannot \"exceed the highest applicable Limit of Insurance under any one Coverage Form or policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524928\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/433/#p472\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Hoping to evade these plain terms in Zurich's policy, Aspen also argues that B &amp; V's claim really asserts two occurrences. Not only does the record not support this argument but it runs counter to the Tenth Circuit's holding in this case.\n   <em>\n    Black &amp; Veatch Corp. v. Aspen Ins.

It is uncontroverted that B &amp; V is contending \"that the covered 'occurrence' was the installation of defective gas risers.\" ECF# 345, p. 23, \u00b6 251. The court finds no support for Aspen's argument for multiple occurrences at each plant. As Aspen points out in its reply, ECF# 348, p. 30, there remains an open coverage question because B &amp; V recognizes a question of material fact as to \"the date of the Occurrence at Cardinal 3.\" ECF# 345, p. 70. This does not impact the court's ruling that Zurich's anti-stacking provisions preclude involving two policies for the same occurrence here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   As for Aspen wanting an aggregate limit credit of $ 4 million applied to each of the four uncompleted plants, B &amp; V argues this is contrary to the Zurich policy's terms which set an aggregate limit as the most to be paid for damages per location/project while, in contrast, the occurrence limit is the most the insurer will pay for damages arising out of any one occurrence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zurich policy, Section III-Limits of Insurance, ECF# 338-2, pp. 28-29. New York law certainly recognizes this common understanding as to the difference between the two limits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    Aggregate Limit\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   The maximum sum the insurer can be called upon to pay, regardless of the number of occurrences. Insurance policies typically include a \"per occurrence\" limit, which is the maximum sum the insurer can be called upon pay, regardless of the number of persons injured in a given accident. Absent an 'aggregate limit,' there is no limit on the number of times the insurer can be called upon to pay the 'per occurrence' limit for different accidents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   33 Sarah B.

Because B &amp; V's claim is for one occurrence per plant (location/project), the court agrees with B &amp; V that the occurrence limit credit of $ 2 million per location/project for the 4 uncompleted JBRs or $ 8 million fulfills the underlying insurance part of the Retained Limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <em>\n    $ 15 Million Credit from \"Other Insurance\" MTI's Insurers and $ 5 million attachment credit for the Clifty Creek and Kyger Creek plants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   MTI was B &amp; V's primary subcontractor for the internal components at each JBR project. B &amp; V was a named additional insured on MTI's general liability policies. The court's holding above that actual exhaustion is not required but that the insured can fill the gap on any retained limits applies with equal force here for \"Other Insurance.\" The parties advance several related arguments as to what is the retained limit, \"the applicable limits of any other insurance.\" ECF# 284-1, p. 11. The parties' briefing reveals that some of the issues are not ripe for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Aspen's motion summarily requests the full $ 15 million credit for B &amp; V's settlement with MTI's insurers and an additional $ 5 million credit under Endorsement 35 as underlying insurance for the two plants having a contract value exceeding $ 50 million. For the \"other insurance,\" B &amp; V asserts it has properly credited Aspen for its $ 14.5 million settlement with MTI's insurers representing \"the exhaustion of two full aggregate limits under both MTI's primary and excess policies for two policy periods, plus an additional $ 500,000 contribution from MTI's primary insurer.\" ECF# 338, p. 15; ECF# 307-1. B &amp; V states these settlement amounts \"were first allocated to cover legal fees and costs in the amount of $ 5,278.567 and the remaining amount credited to Retained Limit.\" ECF# 338, p. 16. B &amp; V moves for summary judgment arguing that the actual amounts recovered from the MTI's insurers constitutes \"the full amount of 'other collectible insurances available\" as to meet the \"Retained Limit\" requirement or that Endorsement 35 sets the bar for other insurance to meet the \"Retained Limit.\" ECF# 338, pp. 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   In its summary judgment motion, B &amp; V explains that the subcontractor MTI's primary and excess liability policies gave coverage with limits of $ 6 million per occurrence and $ 7 million general aggregate. Because it aggressively pursued coverage under three policy periods with multiple occurrences, B &amp; V made a claim for $ 22 million coverage against MTI's insurers, asserting coverage under a third policy period (2009-2010) for damages at Cardinal 1. ECF# 338, p. 16. B &amp; V ultimately settled for two full general aggregate limits, plus $ 500,000, or $ 14.5 million. B &amp; V also discusses having kept Aspen informed of all settlement efforts, having asked Aspen to participate and assist in these recovery efforts, and having received from Aspen only a reservation of rights and a refusal to participate. B &amp; V explains that its likelihood of recovery under the MTI's third policy was remote and so it accepted the settlement for the two policies. Since Aspen refused to participate in those settlement negotiations, B &amp; V argues Aspen cannot now argue for a different outcome and for benefits from its own refusal to engage. \"Insurers that refuse to participate in settlement should not receive a windfall for their intransigence.\" ECF# 338, p. 17.

B &amp; V rightly responds this rule of judicial estoppel only applies if the asserting party \"succeeds in maintaining that position.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v.

The court agrees that Aspen's argument for judicial estoppel cannot prevail here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Aspen argues that\n   <em>\n    E.R. Squibb\n   </em>\n   applies only when the settlements are reached while the insured is still facing contingent liabilities that could reduce the risk of the insured receiving a double recovery or windfall. While Aspen's reading of\n   <em>\n    E.R. Squibb\n   </em>\n   is too narrow, the court agrees that the decision involves circumstances which are certainly different from the question here of calculating retained limits in the absence of any outstanding contingent liabilities. Aspen also argues the Policy releases it from the obligation to negotiate, settle, or defend when the insured has collectible underlying insurance or other insurance. The decision in\n   <em>\n    E.R.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Squibb\n   </em>\n   does not factor in such a policy provision in its rule of equity. The parties have not presented the court with the facts or analysis for evaluating the possibility of coverage under the third policy or for concluding that the settlement with MTI's insurers was reasonable. The summary judgment record is insufficient to find and apply the rule from\n   <em>\n    E.R. Squibb\n   </em>\n   here. Thus, there are questions of material fact precluding summary judgment on the applicable limits of the \"other insurance\" involving MTI's insurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   B &amp; V also looks to Endorsement 35 as providing some guidance for determining the \"applicable limits\" of \"other insurance.\" On its face, Endorsement 35 provides coverage for certain named projects including, Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and Conesville, subject to certain conditions. It expressly provides coverage subject to an additional premium based on the projects' \"Full Contract Value.\" It further states: \"The following projects sit in excess of: Sub Contractors' own limits of USD5,000,000 on which Black and Veatch are an additional insured, when Black and Veatch self perform Engineering, Procurement and Construction contracts where Full Contract Values are greater than USD50,000,000.\" ECF# 338-1, p. 59. B &amp; V argues this Endorsement \"requires only one $ 5 million limit applicable to all Named Projects to meet the defined \"other insurance requirement for such projects.\" ECF# 338, p. 19, n. 7. Aspen responds that it is \"entitled to a\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   underlying limit of subcontract insurance of $ 5 million, in addition to the underlying coverage required by the Policy.\" ECF# 343, p. 25. The court reads Endorsement 35 as separately creating a $ 5 million limit applicable as one limit for all named projects together. B &amp; V also argues this Endorsement sets the bar for the \"other insurance to be collected in order to meet that component of Retained Limit under the Policy\" which was cleared either by MTI's insurers having coverage in excess of $ 5 million or by B &amp; V's settlement with MTI's insurers exceeding $ 5 million. ECF# 338 at p. 18. Neither the wording of this endorsement nor any argument offered by B &amp; V would support an interpretation that this endorsement operates as a bar on the applicable \"other insurance\" limits for JBR units not subject to this Endorsement. The Endorsement expressly recognizes insurance \"specifically purchased to apply in excess\" of Aspen's policy which under New York law is construed as designating the subcontractors' insurance as \"underlying insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bovis Lend Lease LMB, Inc. v.

As for the subcontractors' liability coverage in excess of $ 5 million for the named projects and for all other plants, there remains the determination of the applicable limits of this \"other insurance\" which this court finds, for the reasons already stated above, cannot be decided on this summary judgment record. Consequently, a summary judgment ruling on the retained limit of \"other insurance\" is not possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    Invoices Paid by B &amp; V's Professional Liability Insurers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Citing the \"one-satisfaction\" rule and relying on the deposition testimony of Dennis Frostic, the claims reviewer for B &amp; V's Professional Liability Insurers, Aspen asserts that these liability insurers already reimbursed B &amp; V on specific subcontractors' invoices for which B &amp; V now seeks payment again from Aspen. Consequently, Aspen wants a summary judgment order that subcontractors' invoices already paid by others cannot be included as part of B &amp; V's claim against Aspen. B &amp; V does not controvert that it periodically submitted invoices to Frostic who reviewed them and advised the insurers on what reimbursements to make. Nor does B &amp; V controvert that its $ 98 million claim to the Professional Liability Insurers was supported by invoices and was paid to the limit of the professional liability tower. ECF# 345, pp. 39-40. B &amp; V, however, denies that the Professional Liability Insurers \"paid on specific invoices submitted by B &amp; V for subcontractor work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 40, \u00b6 300. B &amp; V understands Frostic to testify that the submitted invoices were paid upon but that the payments were not directed to specific invoices. In support of this reading, B &amp; V submits a declaration from Frostic which is dated after his deposition and states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   3. ... On behalf of the Professional Liability Insurers providing coverage to Black &amp; Veatch, I negotiated a settlement of the JBR Internals claim with Black &amp; Veatch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   4. Pursuant to the settlement, the Professional Liability Insurers agreed to pay a percentage of all costs incurred in connection with the rebuild of the JBR internals as they were incurred by Black &amp; Veatch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   5. Recognizing that a portion of the costs as incurred may not be covered by the professional liability policies, the Professional Liability Insurers agreed to reimburse Black &amp; Veatch 75% of rebuild costs submitted-on an as incurred basis-up to the remaining limits of liability for the professional liability tower of approximately $ 59 million.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   6. At my deposition in this matter, Exhibit 116 was identified as documents produced by my law firm pursuant to a subpoena issued by attorneys representing Aspen.... That exhibit contains numerous references to and documents concerning the settlement of the claim made to the Professional Liability Insurers, including invoices Black &amp; Veatch submitted to the Professional Liability Insurers to support its claim for reimbursement as costs were incurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   7. In issuing reimbursements, the Professional Liability Insurers reviewed a subset of the invoices submitted by Black &amp; Veatch to confirm they related to the rebuild of the JBRs at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   8. In issuing reimbursements, the Professional Liability Insurers did not designate or determine specific invoices or portions of invoices for rebuild costs that were being reimbursed, but simply paid 75% of the total submission. The Professional Liability Insurers did pay specific invoices for covered attorney fees and costs of consultants. The attached summary\n   taken from Exhibit 116 reflects the general and not specific invoice by invoice payments made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   ECF# 299-2, pp. 2-3. B &amp; V also looks to the testimony of Stuart Shaw, B &amp; V's vice-president of risk management and dispute resolution, who testified to an agreement with Mr. Frostic whereby the insurers would pay 75% of what was submitted without payments being allocated among specific invoices. ECF# 310-3, pp. 182-185. With this evidence, B &amp; V controverts Aspen's proposed statement of facts over whether the insurers actually reimbursed B &amp; V for specific subcontractors' invoices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF# 345, pp. 40-54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The court agrees with B &amp; V's position that there are genuine issues of material fact here over which, if any, specific invoices were actually paid by the insurers. The evidence certainly indicates invoices were submitted and reviewed, but to say that the record is uncontroverted that B &amp; V's claim for some of those same invoices is necessarily double-dipping assumes facts disputed by those who negotiated and executed the settlement agreement between B &amp; V and its Professional Liability Insurers. The court disagrees with Aspen that Frostic's subsequent declaration plainly contradicts answers given in his earlier deposition. Aspen is denied summary judgment on this issue. Having found a question of material fact, the court will not take up B &amp; V's alternative arguments for applying the \"made whole\" doctrine outside of a subrogation context under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <em>\n    B &amp; V Claim Is Moot\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Aspen's last issue assumes it has prevailed on all arguments for credits (actual and settlement) from other and underlying insurance and then calculates the total of these to exceed B &amp; V's claim against Aspen, which would moot B &amp; V's claim. Because Aspen has not prevailed on all its positions, including those that follow, and because questions of material fact remain as to some of these issues, the court summarily denies this argument for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <strong>\n    B &amp; V'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ECF# 337\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The court has already addressed most of B &amp; V's arguments above in ruling on the issues common to the parties' respective motions. Thus, the court has granted B &amp; V's motion for partial summary judgment that the retained limit for the underlying Zurich insurance has been met by payment or credit for the applicable limits as determined above. Finding there to be genuine issues of material fact and an insufficient record, the court denied summary judgment that the retained limit for the other insurance component has been met by crediting the actual net settlement with MTI's general liability insurers or by application of Endorsement 35. B &amp; V's motion raises a related issue not decided earlier, that is, what constitutes \"other insurance\" under the Policy. The court also will take up B &amp; V's remaining summary judgment request that Endorsement 27 requires Aspen to indemnify B &amp; V for property damage arising from professional service errors and exceeding $ 2 million per occurrence but not more than the $ 8 million sublimit of each $ 25 million general aggregate limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Other Insurance\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   Noting that the Policy does not define this term of art, B &amp; V argues it is \"[i]nsurance that covers the same property against the same risk and in favor of the same party,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Western Heritage Ins.

Appx. 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2nd Cir. 2016). Under this rule, B &amp; V argues the only \"other insurance\" applicable here is MTI's general liability policies which listed B &amp; V as an additional insured. B &amp; V argues the following insurance is not \"other insurance\"--its Professional Liability coverage for errors and omissions by its own professions and the first-party property damage policies issued to the JBR owners on which B &amp; V was an additional insured-because they insure \"different risks and provide recovery for a different range of damages.\" ECF# 338, p. 8. According to B &amp; V, only subcontractor MTI's general liability insurers insured the same risk as Aspen's liability policy. B &amp; V distinguishes its Professional Liability Policy as insuring \"against any economic loss arising from negligent acts, errors or omissions in design, supervision or other professional activities, and does not require bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to be triggered.\" ECF# 338, p. 12. As for the JBR owners' property insurance, it provided \"first-party, no fault coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Thus, neither of these policies qualifies as \"other insurance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   B &amp; V clarifies that its argument as to \"other insurance\" and exhausting the \"retained limits\" of \"collectible other insurance\" does not address the allocation of recoveries from different lines of insurance and the rule against \"double-dipping.\" For allocation, B &amp; V stands on its Exhibit 338-6 which shows unrecovered costs of remediation exceeding $ 53 million, a sum greater than B &amp; V's property damage claim submitted to the defendants. ECF# 338, p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Aspen responds that if the court accepts B &amp; V's argument that Endorsement 27 provides some form of professional liability coverage then B &amp; V's Professional Liability insurance is \"other insurance\" under the retained limits provision. Absent that holding, Aspen apparently concedes B &amp; V's argument on the meaning of \"other insurance\" under the retained limits. Aspen certainly challenges B &amp; V's Exhibit 338-6 as including unrecoverable costs and double-dipping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The court agrees, as Aspen apparently concedes, that \"other insurance\" does not include the property damage policies issued to the JBR owners on which B &amp; V was an additional insured. B &amp; V also asks the court to restrict any determination of \"excess\" coverage to the express terms of Endorsement 27 and to conclude that it \"does not refer to any other insurance or to any underlying insurance or to the definition of Retained Limit.\" ECF# 346, p. 18. In short, the court is being asked to determine if the scope of the \"other insurance\" provisions in the main policy necessarily include consideration of that coverage provided in the policy's endorsement. B &amp; V argues for reading only the express terms of Endorsement 27, while Aspen argues for reading Endorsement 27 as part of the whole policy. Neither side cites any authority for their respective positions. The parties' positions beg the question whether the coverage in Endorsement 27 is distinct as to require its own \"other insurance\" clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contract Marine Carriers, Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20106374\">\n    1993 WL 106374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-*7 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 1993). This endorsement does not require a separate or additional premium but\n   does have its own limits of liability. The endorsement coverage is of a unique and distinct character in covering professional services specific to B &amp; V's capacity as an Engineering/Procurement /Construction Contractor (\"EPC\"). The endorsement, however, expresses this coverage in being an exception to an exclusion under the CGL. In effect, the endorsement makes this loss coverable under the main policy. The court cannot find in the policy any justification for reading the coverage provided in Endorsement 27 in isolation of the other coverage provided by the CGL in determining what is \"other insurance.\" The court will follow the general rule of construing the policy as a whole, giving meaning to all related provisions, and thereby reaching a reasonable conclusion that Endorsement 27's coverage is part of the main policy. Thus, the court denies B &amp; V's request for summary judgment that its Professional Liability insurance necessarily covered a different risk as to not qualify as \"other insurance.\" The court will limit its summary judgment decision to the arguments specifically advanced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <em>\n    Endorsement 27\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   B &amp; V asserts it acted as an EPC on each JBR project and contends this endorsement affords coverage for property damage resulting from professional services performed by or on behalf of B &amp; V subject to a sublimit of $ 8 million per occurrence in excess of $ 2 million. This endorsement reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY EXCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   This policy does not apply to any act, negligence, error or omission, malpractice or mistake arising out of \"Professional Services\", committed or alleged to have been committed by or on your behalf in the conduct of any of your business activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   This exclusion shall not apply to \"Bodily Injury\" or \"Property Damage\" that results from such \"Professional Services\" in connection with your capacity as an Engineering/Procurement/Contractor (EPC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   A sub limit of USD 8,000,000 will apply in excess of USD 2,000,000 each and every \"Occurrence\" in respect of such \"Bodily Injury\" or \"Property Damage\" except where coverage is provided under policy number LB0710358. The sub limit of USD 8,000,000 will form part of the USD 25,000,000 General Aggregate referred to in Item 6b) of the Declarations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   \"Professional Services\" wherever used in this endorsement means the preparation or approval of audits, accounts, maps plans, opinions, reports, surveys, designs or specifications and supervisory, inspection, engineering or data processing services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   ECF# 338-1, p. 48. B &amp; V also submits AEP's 2009 letters to B &amp; V alleging B &amp; V's errors in design and material selection resulted in defective internal JBR components. ECF## 338-8 and 338-9. B &amp; V contends these allegations trigger the basic insuring agreement for a claim under Endorsement 27 for EPC projects. In its reply, B &amp; V recognizes that \"aspects of its Endorsement 27 claim present fact issues about which the parties disagree\" and clarifies that its motion is not seeking a judgment on coverage of its professional services claim. ECF# 346, p. 17. Instead, B &amp; V wants the court only to determine now, \"based on the undisputed Policy language, that the Endorsement 27 sublimit of coverage is not limited to one general aggregate (as argued by Aspen) but that the sublimit applies to each 'separate and distinct' aggregate for each Named Project in accordance with Endorsement 36.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Based on this \"clarification\" in B &amp; V's reply, the court will address only this issue over interpreting the policy language on the applicability of the sublimit to one general aggregate or also to each general aggregate for the named projects in Endorsement 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   B &amp; V asks the court to read Endorsement 27's provision of the sublimit \"form[ing] part of the USD 25,000,000 General Aggregate referred to in Item 6b) of the Declarations\" as subject to Endorsement 36 which amends item 6 of the Declarations. Specifically, Endorsement 36 provides for \"a separate and distinct aggregate for each project\" named in Endorsement 35. ECF# 284-1, p. 60. It also expressly amends \"Items (4) and (6) of the Declaration Page.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Declarations Page accordingly reflects a \"General Aggregate Limit\" of $ 25 million and a \"Per Project Aggregate, in respect of the 13 Named Projects Only, for the project period (see endorsements no. 35 and 36)\" of $ 25 million. ECF# 284-1, p. 2. B &amp; V further points to Section V of the Policy discussing Limits which includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   If there is a limit stated in Item 6(b) of the Declarations for the General Aggregate Limit (other than the per Project Aggregate in respect of the 13 named Projects and the Products/Completed Operations) that amount is the most we will pay for all damages under INSURING AGREEMENT 1 except for: ... (2) injury or damage included in the \"Products/Completed Operations Hazard\" (3) injury or damage in respect of the 13 named Projects and (4) coverages included in the \"underlying Insurance\" to which no underlying aggregate limit applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   ECF# 338-1, p. 12. So that each of these provisions have meaning, B &amp; V argues that, \"a separate $ 8 million sublimit for damages in excess of $ 2 million is available for each Occurrence at each Named Project as well as for each Occurrence at each remaining project.\" ECF# 338, p. 22. In effect, this interpretation would mean \"$ 8 million of coverage (in excess of $ 2 million) per occurrence but not to exceed the $ 25 million General Aggregate at each JBR listed in Endorsement 36, and separate sub limited coverage for the Cardinal projects (under the base Policy as such projects are not listed in Endorsement 36).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Aspen argues that the \"Per Project Aggregate Limit\" specified in Item 6(c) of the Policy as amended by Endorsement 36 is distinct from the \"General Aggregate Limit\" specified in Item 6(b) and that Endorsement 27 says it is only a \"sublimit\" or \"part of\" the \"General Aggregate Limit\" in Item 6(b) and is not stacked. Aspen argues that Endorsement 27 does not use or refer to \"Project\" but only the \"General\" aggregate limit. Aspen concludes the $ 8 million is a sublimit per occurrence and is subject to the policy's General Aggregate Limit. Aspen reads, \"[t]he effect of Endorsement 27 is to cap the professional liability exposure to the General Aggregate limit of $ 25 million, depending on the number of occurrences.\" ECF# 343, p. 35. Aspen does not address the Section V provision that explicitly addresses the limits in Item 6(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Section V is significant here, because this provision essentially makes the \"General Aggregate Limits\" in Item 6(b) subject to \"Per Project Aggregate Limit\" in 6(c). For the projects named in Endorsement 36, there is stated a separate and distinct aggregate limit along with an exemption from the general aggregate limits in Item 6(b). The court agrees with B &amp; V that the reasonable conclusion giving effect to all relevant provisions is that the professional services sublimit applies to each\n   \"separate and distinct aggregate for each project\" named in Endorsement 36. B &amp; V is entitled to partial summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO AMEND PRETRIAL ORDER\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <strong>\n    ECF# 339)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   In its order of May 1, 2018, the district court stated, \"Should a party believe administration of this case would be enhanced by amendment of the pretrial order based on the Tenth Circuit's ruling, any motions to amend should follow the same briefing schedule above.\" ECF# 335, pp. 5-6.

The court did so because of its familiarity with the parties' tendency in prior motion proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   At this juncture, the court's partial summary judgment ruling has mooted much of the parties' briefing on this motion.
