The court then addresses the arguments regarding the application of partial AFA, the decision to include import data with reported zero quantities in the calculation of surrogate values, the exclusion of Trina's debt restructuring income in its calculation of Trina's U.S. indirect selling expense ratio, and the rejection of Qixin's separate rate application in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The court addresses each of these challenges in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Module Glass\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Trina argues that Commerce's selection of tempered glass under Thai HTS 7007.19.90000 over float glass under Thai HTS 7005.29.90001 to value Trina's module glass was unsupported by substantial evidence because the float glass classification specified the thickness of module glass consumed by Trina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trina's Br. at 2, 12-14. SolarWorld argues that Commerce's selection of Thai import data for tempered glass over laminated glass was unsupported by substantial evidence because tempered glass fails to account for the additional surface treatments of module glass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Br. at 3, 19-21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Canadian Solar argues that Commerce's selection of the Thai data for tempered glass is unsupported by substantial evidence because the Thai data used by Commerce was aberrational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Canadian Solar's Br. at 3, 19-31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant responds that Commerce's decision is reasonable, as the Thai import data for tempered glass satisfied all of Commerce's surrogate value criteria and was not aberrational.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. J. Agency R. at 6, 12-21, July 30, 2018, ECF No. 71 (\"Def.'s Br.\"). For the reasons that follow, Commerce's selection of tempered glass over float glass and laminated glass is reasonable. Commerce's decision to use the Thai import data for tempered glass, however, is unsupported by substantial evidence and is remanded to Commerce for further consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Where the subject merchandise is exported from a nonmarket economy\n   country, Commerce calculates normal value based on FOPs. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1).

The record contained Thai import data for tempered glass (HTS 7007.19.90000), float glass (HTS 7005.29.90001), and laminated glass (HTS 7007.29.90).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Fed.%20Reg.%2027%2C296\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, Commerce reasonably selected tempered glass as the best available information to value the respondents' module glass inputs because record information and the respondents' descriptions indicated the module glass consumed by the respondents was tempered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 45-46. Commerce reasonably determined the laminated glass subheading was not the best available information because laminated glass is composed of \"multiple layers of glass and plastic\" and there was no evidence that such properties are present in the respondents' module glass inputs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SolarWorld maintains that Commerce's choice of tempered glass as a surrogate value substantially undervalued the module glass input because only laminated glass captures the additional costs associated with the surface treatments used on the respondents' module glass to increase its strength, safety, and durability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Br. at 19-21. SolarWorld's argument fails, however, as SolarWorld does not provide any evidence establishing that this surface treatment is comparable to the layering of laminated glass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Commerce also reasonably selected tempered glass over float glass to value Trina's module glass input because, although the float glass subheading more closely aligned with the thickness of Trina's input, the tempered glass subheading's lack of specification as to thickness indicated that it covered all thicknesses, including that consumed by Trina. Final Decision Memo at 46. Trina maintains Commerce failed to weigh the comparative importance of thickness against other factors in favor of selecting tempered glass.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trina's Br. at 13. However, it is clear from Commerce's explanation that Commerce gave significant weight to the description by the parties that their module glass was tempered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 45-46. It is also clear that Commerce gave weight to the fact that the tempered glass subheading did not exclude the products with\n   a thickness matching Trina's input.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 45-46. The court will not reweigh the evidence, and Trina's argument thus fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   However, while Commerce's choice of the tempered glass subheading to value Trina's and Canadian Solar's module glass is supported by substantial evidence, Commerce failed to provide a reasonable explanation as to why the Thai import data for tempered glass was not distorted by a small quantity of unusually costly imports from Hong Kong.

The plain meaning of the statute, as confirmed by\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   , does not provide for an adverse inference against a cooperative respondent under subsection 1677e(b). It is undisputed that Canadian Solar cooperated in the administrative review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Canadian Solar's Br. at 10; Def.'s Br. at 34-41; Oral Arg. at 00:14:45-00:15:00 (Defendant agreeing that Canadian Solar was a cooperative respondent);\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Unreported [FOPs] Mem. at 5, PD 517, CD 585, bar code 3533043-01 (Dec. 16, 2016) (stating that Commerce may apply AFA in determining a cooperative respondent's dumping margin to induce cooperation of the uncooperative party). As discussed, the statute allows Commerce to select facts available under subsection (a), not apply an adverse inference against a cooperating party under subsection (b). Commerce may consider inducement and evasion rationales in selecting amongst facts available under subsection (a), so long as accuracy remains the predominant concern.\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    753 F.3d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   explained that Commerce is not prohibited \"from drawing adverse inferences against a non-cooperating party that have collateral consequences for a cooperating party,\" but that was not the set of facts presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Generally, Commerce's decision to rely on subsection (a) versus (b) (or vice versa) is critical, as the two subsections involve varying levels of review and trigger separate lines of jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    at 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]hese two subsections have different purposes.\"), 1234 (discussing the jurisprudence under subsection (b) separately). In the case of a cooperating party, selection of facts available under subsection (a) where Commerce considers an inducement or evasion rationale necessarily involves a more searching review. Commerce must conduct \"a case-specific analysis of the applicability of deterrence and similar policies,\" placing a \"greater emphasis on accuracy\" where the decision affects a cooperating party.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1234 (citing\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Wujin Fine Chem.

As explained,\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   addressed a determination Commerce made under subsection (a), and its lessons thus apply to the selection of facts available under subsection (a). Commerce's application of an adverse inference-purportedly under subsection 1677e(b)-is therefore contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To the extent Commerce purports to rely on 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a) for its application of partial AFA, its determination that Canadian Solar could have potentially induced its uncooperative suppliers to cooperate is unsupported by substantial evidence. Commerce cites both subsections 1677e(a) and (b) in its determination, but found, \"pursuant to [ section 1677e(b) ] of the Act, that the application of partial AFA is warranted.\" Final Decision Memo at 18. The statute makes clear that Commerce must invoke subsection (a) to reach subsection (b). Therefore, Commerce's invocation of subsection (a) would seem to be solely in service of its subsection (b) analysis. Nonetheless, in its determination Commerce discusses and purports to rely upon\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   throughout,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 16-17, a case that relies on a subsection (a) analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    753 F.3d at 1230, 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is therefore possible that Commerce also attempts to rely upon subsection (a) or some combination of subsection (a) and (b). In any event, the record does not support Commerce's determination pursuant to an analysis under subsection (a), as Commerce fails to show that Canadian Solar had the type of long-standing relationships with its suppliers that would give it leverage in the marketplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   does not expound upon what constitutes an \"existing relationship,\" surely more is required than what is present here.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    753 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1235 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711081\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/1367/#p1379\">\n    701 F.3d at 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that there was no justification for an AFA rate based in deterrence where the rate would affect only the cooperating party). Here, Commerce based its determination that Canadian Solar has long-term relationships with its suppliers on the fact that it maintains \"supplier-specific accounts in the accounting system\" and corporate divisions dedicated to the purchasing of solar cells. Final Decision Memo at 16. Such facts do not reasonably indicate the presence of a long-term relationship creating leverage. Indeed, corporate practices such as those listed by Commerce are equally consistent with short-term, unimpactful business relationships falling short of the type that would indicate that one party holds undue influence. Without more evidence showing leverage, Commerce's determination that Canadian Solar could have induced cooperation is unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendant argues that\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   does not require certainty-but mere potentiality-that the cooperating respondent could induce cooperation, and that Canadian Solar's relationships with its suppliers meet the relevant bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Br. at 36 (citing\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    753 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1235 ). Defendant asserts that Commerce made three conclusions that demonstrate Canadian Solar's ability to potentially induce cooperation: 1) that \"Canadian Solar is a significant producer in the solar market with significant sales in 2014\" and that it was one of the largest two exporters of subject merchandise to the United States during the relevant period; 2) that Canadian Solar continues to grow rapidly; and 3) that Canadian Solar \"purchased a substantial quantity of solar cells and solar modules from its suppliers.\" Def.'s Br. at 37-38 (citing Final Decision Memo at 16). Such observations hardly establish that Canadian Solar possessed leverage over its suppliers, particularly under the more searching subsection (a) analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mueller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n    753 F.3d at 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that unlike\n   <em>\n    Changzhou\n   </em>\n   , Mueller potentially had a mechanism to force the non-cooperating parties to cooperate);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Xiping Opeck Food Co., Ltd. v.

[the cooperative respondent's] statement that it dominated and set prevailing prices in the U.S. market\"). Further, as Commerce noted, the record contains no information regarding Canadian Solar's share of its uncooperative suppliers' business. Final Decision Memo at 16. Commerce stated that, although the record contained no such information, it could not conclude, \"based on the lack of such information, that Canadian Solar's refusal to do business with its uncooperative suppliers would not serves [sic] as a mechanism to induce cooperation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271090\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1141/#p1158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Commerce may be able to avoid further inquiry where it acts pursuant to its authority under subsection (b), it cannot point to a lack of evidence to satisfy its obligations under a subsection (a) analysis. Under the more searching \"case-specific analysis of the applicability of deterrence and similar policies,\" Commerce's reasoning here cannot support its determination. Accordingly, Commerce's application of partial AFA in calculating Canadian Solar's antidumping margin is remanded for further explanation or reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Commerce's Decision to Include Zero Quantity Import Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In its final determination, Commerce opted to include in the average unit surrogate value calculations import data with quantities of zero, finding \"no basis to conclude that the zero quantity import data included in our [surrogate value] calculations are errors or that these zero quantity imports result in unreliable and distortive [surrogate values].\" Final Decision Memo at 86. Rather, Commerce found these imports attributable to rounding small import quantities down to zero. Final Decision Memo at 86. Trina argues the record contains no evidence that shipments of low quantities were rounded down to zero, and that including such data is distortive. Trina's Br. at 14-17. Defendant responds that Commerce reasonably determined that the record lacked any basis to conclude that the zero quantity data were the result of errors. Def.'s Br. at 41-42. For the reasons that follow, Commerce's determination is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Commerce found in its final determination that the zero quantity imports in the data set were attributable to rounding small import quantities down to zero. Final Decision Memo at 86. Commerce addressed Trina's counter argument that if the zeros were attributable to rounding that one would expect a greater number of quantities rounded to one than to zero because quantities from 0.5 units to 1.49 would round to one. Trina's Br. at 16 (citing Trina's Administrative Case Br. at 21-22, PD 531-532, CD 588, bar code 3538943-02 (Jan. 25, 2017) ). Commerce found no reason to expect such a neat distribution of data as Trina describes. Trina's argument regarding how the data points should distribute does not detract from Commerce's otherwise reasonable determination that the zero quantity data are the result of rounding. Further, Commerce explained that if the zero quantity entries constituted error, it would expect similar errors to occur with respect to the reported import values, and the record contained no such errors. Final Decision Memo at 86. Additionally, if the entries were error, Commerce reasoned, such errors would suggest serious flaws with the GTA data Commerce utilized, and no party suggested that such fundamental flaws existed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271090\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1141/#p1158\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce's explanation is reasonable and its determination is thus sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Consolo v.

In AR2, Commerce applied partial AFA to value Trina's unreported FOPs from Trina's unaffiliated solar cell suppliers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decision Mem. for the Final Results of the 2013-2014 [ADD] Administrative Review of Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Assembled into Modules, From [the PRC] at 52, A-570-979, (June 13, 2016),\n    <em>\n     available at\n    </em>\n    https://enforcement.trade.gov/frn/summary/prc/2016-14532-1.pdf (last visited Apr. 11, 2019) (\"AR2 IDM\"). Trina argued that Commerce's determination was arbitrary and unsupported by substantial evidence because Commerce did not explain what percentage of a respondent's FOPs must be unreported for Commerce to consider the missing information significant enough to warrant AFA.\n    <em>\n     SolarWorld I\n    </em>\n    , 41 CIT at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418684\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/1254/#p1263\">\n     273 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1276 ; Mem.

The CIT sustained Commerce's determination, noting that Commerce reasonably explained that the percentage of solar cell inputs provided by Trina's unaffiliated suppliers was significant, and thus could not be excused.\n    <em>\n     SolarWorld I\n    </em>\n    , 41 CIT at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418684\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/1254/#p1263\">\n     273 F.Supp.3d at 1277-78\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoting AR2 IDM at 52). Trina thus did not challenge Commerce's determination as contrary to law, as Canadian Solar does here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Canadian Solar's Br. at 10. Second, the facts of\n    <em>\n     SolarWorld I\n    </em>\n    differed from those of the present action. There, the CIT upheld Commerce's determination that Trina could induce cooperation from its suppliers based on \"what Trina acknowledged were long-standing business relationships between Trina and the suppliers.\"\n    <em>\n     SolarWorld I\n    </em>\n    , 41 CIT at ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418684\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/1254/#p1263\">\n     273 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1278 (citing AR2 IDM at 56). Here, by contrast, Canadian Solar disputes that it has long-term relationships with the uncooperative suppliers, and Commerce's determination on this issue is unsupported by substantial evidence, as explained above. Defendant's reliance on this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     SolarWorld I\n    </em>\n    is therefore unavailing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Defendant points out that \"Canadian Solar does not aver that it ever threatened to end its business relationship with any of these suppliers.\" Def.'s Br. at 37. Although the Court of Appeals in\n    <em>\n     Mueller\n    </em>\n    contemplated a threat to end business as a mechanism for exercising leverage, the Court did not require it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mueller\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n     753 F.3d at 1235\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Canadian Solar attempted to induce the cooperation of its suppliers. Indeed, Canadian Solar contacted the suppliers in question repeatedly over a period of up to four months, requesting FOP data from each supplier, in some cases up to eleven times. Canadian Solar's Br. at 10 (citing Canadian Solar's June 8, 2016 Sec. A Suppl. Questionnaire Resp. at Ex. SA-14 &amp; SA-16, PD 263, CD 281-285 (June 8, 2016); Canadian Solar's July 8, 2016 Sec.

Canadian Solar even expressed that cooperation was an \"urgent\" matter but was unable to persuade the suppliers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5922226\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1227/#p1233\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Moreover, Defendant correctly acknowledges that Commerce did not base its decision on Canadian Solar not threatening its suppliers, but rather on the three conclusions listed below. Def.'s Br. at 37. Canadian Solar's lack of a threat to cease doing business is therefore not dispositive of the issue at hand-its ability to induce cooperation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    Trina further argues that it was arbitrary of Commerce to acknowledge that debt restructuring income can be used to offset indirect selling expenses, but then to disallow the offset in the entirety. Trina's Br. at 18. This argument fails for the same reason that Commerce's determination is supported by substantial evidence. Commerce acknowledged that Trina's debt restructuring income could potentially be used to offset its indirect selling expenses. Final Decision Memo at 85. However, Commerce did not have sufficient record evidence to determine what portion, if any, of the recorded income from debt restructuring related to the period of review.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Trina's Sec. C Questionnaire Resp. at Ex. C-10. It is not inconsistent or arbitrary of Commerce to recognize it would make an offset for debt restructuring income, but to decline to do so where there is insufficient evidence to determine that deduction in a particular instance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
