He contends that his own investigative efforts indicate that this witness may have been compelled or coerced into giving statements regarding Ameen's involvement in the murder. ECF No. 116 at 22. Specifically, Ameen claims that this witness may have a \"close family tie\" to a member of ISIS in Iraqi custody.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ameen surmises that Person A \"may have been compelled to speak to Iraqi or U.S. investigators out of fear that he/she would be implicated with ISIS through his/her close family member.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He argues that the government is in possession of information indicating what benefits, coercion, or compulsion were brought to bear on this witness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ameen also states that a complete understanding of the circumstances of Person A's initial FBI interview is critical to contextualizing subsequent investigative discrepancies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. He points out that the FBI 302\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   from October 23, 2017 - the date the FBI interviewed Person A in Iraq - contains no mention of photographic identification.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen's counsel asked the government what photograph, if any, was shown to Person A in the October 23, 2017 interview.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The government indicated a specific photograph was shown to the witness, and Ameen has reproduced that photograph as an exhibit to the current motion. ECF No. 116-1 at 28 (Exhibit K, line 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In April of 2018, Person A went to an Iraqi court and was shown an array which contained photographs of Ameen and other men. ECF No. 116 at 30. Those photographs were reproduced in the extradition request where, Ameen notes, two of the photographs of other men are dated May 2018 - one month after the alleged identification in the Iraqi court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 22-1 at 64-67. Also in May of 2018, the FBI produced a new report which memorialized Person A's October 23, 2017 interview. ECF No. 116 at 30. Ameen questions why the report was composed months later and only after the witness testified in the Iraqi court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The report states, for the first time, that the witness was shown multiple photographs in October 2017 and picked Ameen out of an array (the photograph the witness chose is the same one identified\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in Exhibit K).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen states that the other array photographs used by the FBI have never been produced to the defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, Ameen argues that Person A's statement to the FBI in October of 2017 is, in many respects, inconsistent with their later statement to the Iraqi court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. The court finds it unnecessary to reproduce all of the alleged discrepancies here. Suffice it to say, Ameen believes Person A's October 2017 statement is wholly unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He re-emphasizes his theory that Person A gave the statements under some form of coercion. With that predicate, Ameen argues that \"[e]vidence possessed by the U.S. Government supporting the investigation into [Person A] or their close family member as a member\n   of ISIS or any other terrorist organization explains his/her inconsistent statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Prudential Search\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second and more broadly, Ameen demands that the government - represented in this case by the United States Department of Justice - request a \"prudential search\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the United States Intelligence Community (\"IC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. He claims that \"[t]here is reason to believe that the Intelligence Community (IC) has exculpatory material regarding Mr. Ameen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen goes on to assert that \"the government has repeatedly conceded, now on the record, that the [intelligence community] has exculpatory evidence corroborating Mr. Ameen's alibi.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. In specific terms, Ameen seeks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   IC information rebutting claims that he is an ISIS or Al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist, and any information rebutting the Iraqi filing are clearly exculpatory. If the IC has no information to show that Mr. Ameen is a member of ISIS or an Al-Qaeda in Iraq terrorist, that is likewise exculpatory, and the defense requests a statement to that effect, a stipulation, or a certificate of no record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Iraqi Government Material\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Third, Ameen contends that the government's burden to produce favorable information extends to any documents it has obtained from the Iraqi government or Iraqi law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. He argues that the government's investigation into him is \"intermingled\" with the Iraqi investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen claims that the FBI spoke with \"at least four witnesses from various branches [of] Iraqi law enforcement\" in the course of its own investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also claims that the FBI received \"statements and documents\" relevant to this matter which were generated by Iraqi law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Ameen argues that, even if the government does not currently possess exculpatory information derived from the Iraqi state, this court has the authority to order the government to obtain it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Government Evidence that Ameen was in Turkey in June 2014\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ameen states that his argument against a finding of probable cause will rest, in\n   part, on a witness who will testify that he was in Mersin, Turkey at the time of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Ameen anticipates that the government will argue that this witness (who, owing to visa issues, is unlikely to testify in-person in this matter) lacks credibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also anticipates that the government will, based on the foregoing credibility attack, move to exclude the witness testimony as \"uncorroborated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a consequence, Ameen argues that the government must provide any clear corroborative material in its possession. Specifically, Ameen contends that \"[t]he Government possesses a corroborating statement by the witness that possesses indicia of reliability, because it would appear to have been made when the witness was unaware that he was being surveilled.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ameen also requests any other evidence of Ameen's presence in Turkey during the relevant time-period. He references \"global surveillance run by the [National Security Agency] and others with cooperation of international telecommunications companies\" and contends that this surveillance could prove Ameen's presence in Turkey at the time of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36. To that end, Ameen states that he would gladly provide the government with his Turkish cell phone number to facilitate a search for records that would place him in Turkey on the date of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Documents that Rebut Page Seventy-One of the Extradition Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The extradition request, at page seventy-one, asserts that Ameen is a founding member of al-Tawhid Wa al-Jihad - an organization whose founding is ultimately attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. ECF No. 22-1 at 71. The request further states that Ameen was a \"close associate\" of Zarqawi.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen notes that defense investigations have failed to uncover any evidence linking him to Zarqawi. ECF No. 116 at 37-38. Ameen states that, if he was in fact a close associate of Zarqawi (who was one of the most wanted men in the world prior to his death in 2006), it is \"inconceivable\" that the government would have no evidence of that association.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. He argues that, if the government does not have such evidence, it should be compelled to state as much.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Ameen also notes that the same page of the extradition request alleges that he worked under the terrorist leader Ghassan Muhammad Ameen al-Rawi in 2007. ECF No. 22-1 at 71. He argues that this information is obviously suspect insofar as al-Rawi was arrested in 2005 and has been in custody since that date. ECF No. 116 at 38. And al-Rawi has, since entering custody, provided information leading to the capture and killing of other insurgents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen argues that, if al-Rawi has failed to provide any information confirming their affiliation, that is exculpatory information and must be disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Ameen points to the extradition request's claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, in 2006, \"he launched an armed attack against the army headquarters in Al-Karablah Area in Al-Qa'im, where he took soldiers as prisoners and executed them at the same time.\" ECF No. 22-1 at 71. The request also alleges that \"in the same year [2006], he launched an armed attack against the army headquarters where several soldiers were killed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He claims that, despite the sensational nature of these alleged terrorist operations, the defense has been unable to uncover any evidence that either actually occurred. ECF No. 116 at 39. Ameen argues that \"[i]f [the attacks] did in\n   fact happen, the U.S. government would have proof that they had occurred and may have an investigation related to them. If the attacks did occur, and others were deemed responsible, that is exculpatory information. If no such attacks occurred, that is likewise exculpatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Person B\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ameen states that \"[m]ost of the inflammatory accusations against [him] are from an individual who will be referred to herein as \"Person B,\" who allegedly received immigration benefits from the government in exchange for their statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39. This witness alleged that Ameen was, in the mid-2000s and in Iraq, often seen in the company of a known terrorist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Person B also alleged that Ameen's family had numerous terrorist connections that pre-dated the 2014 murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But Ameen's counsel could find no indication that there was any government evidence corroborating the foregoing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-40. As best the court can discern, the motion seeks any exculpatory material the government possesses with respect to accusations by this witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Whereabouts of Abu-Anas al-Samirra'I and Muhammad 'Abid Manaf\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ameen states that the information in the extradition request potentially places two confirmed ISIS members at the scene of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Abu-Anas al-Samirra'I (\"al-Samarra'I\") was a high-level ISIS militant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen references conflicting, unidentified sources which offer differing accounts of al-Samarra'I's fate: (1) he was killed in June of 2014 near Ramadi; (2) he was killed or injured and captured at some point in December of 2014; or (3) he was killed or injured and captured in April of 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen reasons that, if the first account is true and confirmable by the government, that information would be exculpatory insofar as it would contradict the extradition request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ameen states that Muhammad 'Abid Manaf was also a known ISIS member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Person A mentioned 'Abid Manaf as an accomplice to the murder in his/her statement to the Iraqi court in April 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen argues that the government tracks the movements of ISIS fighters and must disclose any information it possesses which would rule out the presence of 'Abid Manaf (or al-Samarra'I) at the scene of the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Information Concerning Ahmad Badir\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ameen claims that his own investigation by his defense team points to another man as the killer - Ahmad Badir.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41. He asserts that his investigation has also revealed a possible motive - Badir's brother was purportedly killed by the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen demands that the government provide any evidence it possesses regarding this individual and his possible involvement in the murder.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   9.\n   <em>\n    Kidnapping of the Victim's Brothers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The extradition request contains allegations tying Ameen to the kidnapping of three of the victim's brothers. ECF No. 22-1 at 61. Ameen notes that the kidnappings are alleged to have occurred in November of 2016 (ECF No. 116 at 41 ) - after he had relocated to the United States. He argues that this obvious discrepancy\n   underscores a general lack of credibility of the statements in the extradition request. ECF No. 116 at 41. He requests any information held by the government concerning the kidnappings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   10.\n   <em>\n    Ameen's A-File\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ameen's counsel were provided with an \"extensively redacted\" copy of Ameen's immigration A-file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He argues that, among the redacted information, is evidence of vetting which would undercut any contention that he was involved in terrorist activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ameen states that production of the redacted pages is necessary because they \"would show that the U.S. Government had no evidence that he was involved in AQI or ISIS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   11.\n   <em>\n    All Documents Discussed in the Government's Memorandum of Extradition Law and Request for Detention Pending Extradition\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ameen requests all documents and evidence discussed, cited, or relied upon in the government's Memorandum of Extradition Law and Request for Detention Pending Extradition Proceedings (ECF No. 6 ), including all statements taken by the FBI from Iraqi witnesses. ECF No. 116 at 42-43. He states that \"[t]he Government relied on Government 6 [i.e., ECF No. 6 ] to have the Court detain Mr. Ameen. It sent a strong message about what it believed was the strength of this extradition proceeding. Documents produced by the Government began to undermine that message.

ECF No. 120 at 8. As discussed further below, it also contends that the scope of his requested discovery is unprecedented, legally insupportable, and risks exposing sensitive information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. The government also asserts is not in possession of the sort of alibi-supportive information as Ameen contends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Alibi Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The government states that it has reviewed the materials in its possession and, having done so, \"ma[kes] the representation that it has no additional evidence related to the claim that Ameen has an alibi. Specifically, the United States has represented that it has no evidence in its possession as a result of its criminal investigation that would prove Ameen was in Turkey at the time of the alleged murder, nor any evidence that would prove Ameen has an alibi for the alleged murder.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The government also specifically states, with respect to Ameen's request that it geo-locate him by using his cell-phone number, that the FBI searched fourteen cellular phones, one iPad, and one laptop it obtained during a search of Ameen's residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The FBI obtained a \"voluminous amount of data\" therefrom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It thoroughly analyzed that data in \"an attempt to geolocate Ameen while these devices were in use,\" but could not geolocate Ameen during the relevant time frame.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.

And our government, by virtue of its global presence, will often be engaged in the exercise of power - diplomatic, military, intelligence-gathering - abroad.

In\n   <em>\n    Drayer\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    Demjanjuk\n   </em>\n   obliged the government \"to turn over any exculpatory materials in its possession that would undercut\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   a finding\n   that there was probable cause to believe that petitioner committed the murder with which [the country requesting extradition] had charged him.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11570974\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/190/410/#p414\">\n    190 F.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (6th Cir. 1999).

In refusing to accept the government's representation to the court that it possesses no evidence that would negate probable cause, Ameen invites this court to issue rulings based on the theory - again, unsupported by the record - that the government is simply proceeding in bad-faith and that its representatives have shirked their duty, as officers of the court, to be truthful in their filings. A natural consequence of accepting this theory is that no government denial would ever be sufficient - the government's repeated protestations that it had no evidence negating probable cause would be read only as further indication of its attempt to conceal the same. The court recognizes the value of zealous representation and does not raise this point lightly. But counsel for Ameen has repeatedly - and, in the court's view, improperly - imputed ill-intent to the government and its representatives in these proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Discovery\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The scope of discovery in matters of extradition also counsels against granting Ameen's motion. \"[D]iscovery in an international extradition hearing is limited and lies within the discretion of the magistrate.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition of Kraiselburd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1556623\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/786/1395/#p1399\">\n    786 F.2d 1395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1399 (9th Cir. 1986). The Ninth Circuit has noted that, \"[i]n exercising discretion, the magistrate should consider both the well-established rule that extradition proceedings are not to be converted into a dress rehearsal trial and whether resolution of the contested issue would be appreciably advanced by the requested discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Quinn v.

Here, the scope of Ameen's discovery request is expansive and would risk turning these proceedings into a rehearsal trial. Many of Ameen's discovery requests concern evidence that is necessarily contradictory rather than explanatory. For instance, he requests government information on ISIS fighter movements to show that ISIS fighters Abu-Anas al-Samirra'I and Muhammad 'Abid Manaf were not - as the extradition request alleges - present at the scene of the murder. ECF No. 116 at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Even if such evidence were found and produced, it would not negate the witness statements relied upon by the extradition petition. Similarly, Ameen requests evidence establishing that a known terrorist never mentioned him as a close associate, also contradicting the extradition request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. This too, if proved, would not negate probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Thus, the court concludes that the requested discovery would not appreciably advance resolution of the contested issue - whether probable cause exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, Ameen's motion to compel is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Motion for Production of Search Warrants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Ameen requests, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and his Fourth Amendment pre-indictment rights, (1) all search warrants executed against him; (2) all search warrant inventories for search warrants executed against him; (3) all supporting affidavits for search warrants executed against him; and (4) any oral testimony or other materials relied upon by the magistrate judge in issuing search warrants issued against him.

And there are undeniable risks in expanding the number of individuals to whom witnesses' identifying information is known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v.

The government has represented that \"[t]he threat of ISIS retribution was clear to the United States in its investigation [and] was communicated by representatives of the Republic of Iraq in the transmission of the extradition request....\" ECF No. 120 at 20. The court is ill-positioned to second-guess either government on this issue and, thus, elects not to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Additionally, the likely utility to these proceedings of lifting the protective order on this information does not outweigh the potential risk to the witnesses. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Ameen states that he intends, through his defense team, to review statements with witnesses to determine their accuracy. ECF No. 112 at 4. He suspects that the statements were altered to implicate him without the witnesses' consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Assume, for the sake of argument, that Ameen succeeds in securing new testimony from witnesses which adheres to his theory. He presents\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   this testimony at his hearing - likely in the form of a new affidavit which disavows the older testimony. Now, the court is faced with a question of credibility that will almost certainly prove impossible to resolve without a trial. This hypothetical situation is not unlike the one faced by the extradition court in\n   <em>\n    In re Extradition of Singh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473260\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/170/982/\">\n    170 F.

The government opposes such exemption and argues that the information contained therein is inadmissible in this matter and \"[p]rotecting sensitive materials in an ongoing criminal investigation is a legitimate reason for the use of a protective order....\" ECF No. 120 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Ameen states his desire to file these FBI reports on the public docket, but offers no reason why public disclosure of documents - even redacted documents - related to an on-going criminal investigation is necessary at this juncture. The court previously denied Ameen's motion to\n   unseal other information related to an on-going criminal investigation. ECF No. 107. It does so here as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   At a previous motion hearing, the court informed Ameen's counsel that, if they found it necessary to rely on documents related to an on-going investigation during litigation, they could refer to it by line and page (if the document is in the court's possession or is submitted to chambers). The court also noted that, if it determined that further argument was necessary, it could hold an\n   <em>\n    in-camera\n   </em>\n   hearing if an appropriate basis were established for doing so. As before, the court recognizes the importance and value of maintaining public access to as much of the case docket as is feasible and practical. However, as the Supreme Court has held, documents not normally within the public purview - like FBI records in an active investigation - are not transformed into a matter of public record merely because of their involvement in the discovery process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branzburg v.

ECF No. 120 at 21. Thus, the only items still in contention are Ameen's A-file, the jail call and written translation thereof, and the FBI interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With respect to the A-file, the government argues that it understands that the defense has requested the file via the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") process from the administrative agency\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that agency is \"the better source for that information.\" In his reply, Ameen states that his FOIA request produced only \"a few pages of the A-File scrubbed of the relevant vetting information\" and argues that \"[t]he Government has Ameen's complete A-file, and it must provide the information sought to the extent that it is favorable as set forth in the Motion to Compel.\" ECF No. 123 at 13. Those arguments concern production of the A-file, however, rather than whether it should remain subject to the protective order. It is the latter question that is before the court. The government has not stated that the A-file - in the redacted state which Ameen possesses - reveals sensitive information that would be inappropriate\n   for the public docket. Thus, the court will grant modification of the protective order to exempt Ameen's A-file.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The court will not order modification of the protective order with respect to Ameen's FBI interview.

The pleadings, as best the court can discern, are entirely lacking in contextual details as to this item. Indeed, the government's opposition makes no mention of this item. ECF No. 120 at 21 (Discussing the other items in this section, but omitting any mention of the \"jail call.\"). Absent some indication that it contains sensitive information, the court is inclined to grant modification of the protective order as to this item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The Sacramento Bee\n    </em>\n    's Joinder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On May 1, 2019, the\n   <em>\n    Sacramento Bee\n   </em>\n   (\"the\n   <em>\n    Bee\n   </em>\n   \") filed a partial joinder (ECF No. 133 ) to Ameen's motion to modify the protective order (ECF No. 112 ). The\n   <em>\n    Bee\n   </em>\n   expresses two primary concerns. First, it notes that its counsel spoke with government counsel and sought \"a written stipulation that the protective order is insufficient on its own to justify excluding the press and the public from the extradition hearing.\" ECF No. 133 at 1 n. 1. The government declined to enter such a stipulation. Second, and more broadly, the\n   <em>\n    Bee\n   </em>\n   argues that the current protective order \"improperly reverses\" the standards for sealing material insofar as it \"makes secrecy the rule, and transparency the exception....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.

By way of a solution, the\n   <em>\n    Bee\n   </em>\n   argues that the following language should be added to the protective order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   This protective order does not alter or alleviate the burden on the government, the defense, or any third party to prove that the First Amendment and common law prerequisites for filing materials under seal or closing the courtroom have been met in order to file records under seal or close these proceedings.

But Ameen has not, by way of his reply, raised any argument that these terms are legally distinct for the purposes of this proceeding. Nor is this court aware of any subsequent decision (either within the Sixth Circuit or elsewhere) that has assigned a legally specific meaning to \"undercut.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Ameen\n    <em>\n     does\n    </em>\n    argue that \"[the government] has never stated it holds no exculpatory evidence. Much of the explanatory evidence discussed [in the motion to compel] may fall outside the Government's narrow view of its ethical and due process duty.\" ECF No. 116 at 43. The court interprets this argument as invoking a broader definition of \"exculpatory\" which encompasses more than evidence that would actually serve to negate probable cause. Otherwise, Ameen could not reasonably claim that the government has never denied having such evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 120 (\"The government does not possess evidence that would negate probable cause ...\"). The court reads\n    <em>\n     Drayer\n    </em>\n    as standing in consonance with the bedrock principle that \"explanatory evidence\" - that is, evidence which \"explains away\" probable cause - is admissible in an extradition hearing and evidence which merely controverts, or raises a defense (i.e., so called \"contradictory evidence\") is not.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mainero v.
