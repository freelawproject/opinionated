At the first step, she determined Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date of September 12, 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. At the second step, she found Plaintiff had severe impairments of ulnar nerve damage, cervical impairment, and right shoulder impairment, all of which caused significant vocational limitations in Plaintiff's ability to perform basic work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the third step, the ALJ found, after review of the record, the combination of Plaintiff's impairments failed to meet or medically equal the severity of one of the listed impairments in Appendix 1 of 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.

Plaintiff told Dr. Skeene \"he is able to shower, bathe, dress independently,\" and \"do limited cooking, cleaning, laundry, and shopping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242. Citing Dr. Skeene's medical source statement, the ALJ noted Dr. Skeene \"opined that the claimant had moderate limitation for reaching and heavy lifting.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The ALJ gave Dr. Skeene's opinion \"some weight\" even though it was \"not supported by any clinical diagnostic testing in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the ALJ evaluated form reports prepared by Dr. Bronfin, a neurologist, for Plaintiff's insurance company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ALJ noted: \"Dr. Bronfin precluded the claimant from lifting and carrying anything or operating heavy machinery, as well as an up to 25%[ ] limitation in overhead reaching. Dr. Bronfin's opinion is supported by notes and reports spanning from July 17, 2013 through July 16, 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In form statements containing different fields for assessing the functioning of upper extremities, Dr. Bronfin opined Plaintiff could not lift objects up to ten pounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262. Dr. Bronfin also concluded Plaintiff could \"never\" perform fine finger movements, hand-eye coordinated movements, or pushing and/or pulling with both his left and right arms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Bronfin further opined Plaintiff is \"unable to use [his right] hand due to weakness and loss of dexterity\" and that his condition was \"progressive and nonreversible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262, 266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ALJ did not find Dr. Bronfin's opinion entirely persuasive because it was supported\n   by only \"check-off form assessments\" that do not contain explanations of the bases of those conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. The Court agrees. Like the multiple-choice assessments submitted by the treating physician in\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   , the multiple choice, check-off form submitted by Dr. Bronfin in this case is not particularly informative. Ultimately, the ALJ properly afforded \"little weight\" to Dr. Bronfin's \"check-off\" form opinions because they were inconsistent with the record as a whole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, Dr. Bronfin's findings conflict with the medical source statement and physical examination of Plaintiff's other treating physician, Dr. Skeene. Plaintiff reported to Dr. Skeene he experienced difficulty only with lifting objects greater than ten pounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 241 (\"[R]ight arm pain is aggravated by reaching and lifting greater than 10 1b.\"). In contrast, Dr. Bronfin concluded Plaintiff did not have the ability to lift objects no matter their weight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 262. And while Dr. Skeene noted Plaintiff's hand and finger dexterity were intact and that he retained full grip strength bilaterally, Dr. Bronfin reported Plaintiff had suffered a \"loss of dexterity\" in his right hand. Indeed, throughout the period at issue, Plaintiff reported performing volunteer work for an ambulance service, lecturing at his synagogue several times a week, driving a car, and engaging in light chores and personal care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40, 48-49, 53, 159-60, 168. Moreover, no other evidence or testimony on the record supports Dr. Bronfin's finding that Plaintiff has limitations in his left arm. Because the Court finds substantial evidence supports the ALJ's decision, the ALJ was not required to re-contact Dr. Bronfin for further information as Plaintiff would have her do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1512\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Thus, the Court concludes the ALJ appropriately assigned little weight to the check-off form opinions of Dr. Bronfin because \"they are not consistent with the record as a whole and the findings are not supported by any clinical diagnostic testing in the record.\" Tr. at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, ECF No. 11 is DENIED, Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, ECF No. 13, is GRANTED, and Defendant's determination denying Plaintiff SSDI and SSI benefits is affirmed. The Clerk of Court is directed to close this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    During the administrative hearing, Plaintiff amended his alleged onset date to September 12, 2013.

Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. If someone can do light work, we determine that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods of time.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n     20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
