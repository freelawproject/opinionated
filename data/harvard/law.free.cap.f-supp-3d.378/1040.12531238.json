After carefully considering the motions, briefs, parties' arguments and relevant law, the Court rules as described herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 30, 2011, Marcellino Morris, Jr. was tragically was killed in an automobile collision with Defendant Andy Ray Denny. Plaintiff Mr. Franklin J. Morris, Personal Representative of the Decedent's estate, contends that Defendant Giant is liable for Decedent's death under two theories of negligence - specifically, negligent entrustment based on Defendant's\n   sale of gasoline to Mr. Denny, who was allegedly visibly intoxicated, and negligent hiring, training, and supervision of the employees who sold the gasoline to Mr. Denny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff originally filed a lawsuit in the District Court of the Navajo Nation in Crownpoint, New Mexico. In that court, Defendant moved for and obtained summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff's suit was time-barred under the Navajo Nation's two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims, 7 N.N.C. \u00a7 602(A)(1). Plaintiff appealed the Navajo district court's decision to the Navajo Nation Supreme Court and that appeal is still pending. Before the Navajo district court issued its decision, Plaintiff filed an identical wrongful death complaint in New Mexico state district court against Defendant alleging vicarious liability for negligent entrustment of a chattel (Count I) and direct liability for negligent hiring, training, and supervision (Count II). Plaintiff also asserted a cause of action for negligence and negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   against Mr. Denny (Count III). However, Mr. Denny was dismissed as a party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 9. In January 2015, Defendant removed the state case to this Court based on the parties' diversity of citizenship under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2015, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), or, in the alternative to stay the case pending Plaintiff's exhaustion of tribal court remedies, arguing the case should be precluded under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   During the same period, Plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on Count I of his complaint (negligent entrustment), arguing that Plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law that Defendant negligently entrusted gasoline to Mr. Denny because he was intoxicated. The Court stayed the case for one-year - until November 29, 2016 - when, although the Navajo Nation Supreme Court had not yet issued a decision, the parties asked the Court to lift the stay and decide the pending Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2017, the Court issued its ruling on the Rule 12(b)(6) motion against Defendant, concluding that the Navajo district court's dismissal on statute of limitations grounds had no preclusive effect on the federal case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 64. In March 2018, the Court denied Plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgment on negligent entrustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79. In that Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court assumed without deciding that Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty of care to refrain from selling gasoline to an intoxicated Mr. Denny, but concluded that genuine disputes of material about whether Ms. Gloria Pine, Defendant's employee who sold Mr. Denny gasoline, knew Mr. Denny was intoxicated precluded entry of summary judgment in Plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About two months later, in May 2018, Defendant filed the pending two motions now before the Court. In its motion for judgment on the pleadings on Plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim, Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because New Mexico law imposes no duty of care on Defendant to refrain from selling gasoline to intoxicated third-persons. And in its motion to compel Plaintiff to elect remedies, or, alternatively to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for improper claim splitting, Defendant contends that under the doctrine of election of remedies Plaintiff is barred from carrying this and the Navajo Nation lawsuits to judgment. Because Plaintiff has no right to \"double recovery\" of damages in two courts on two identical complaints, Defendant contends that \"Plaintiff must elect the forum in which he will proceed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Def.'s Mot. to Compel at 6. Alternatively, if the Court denies Defendant's motion to compel Plaintiff to elect remedies, then Defendant asks the Court to dismiss the federal complaint on the theory that Plaintiff has impermissibly engaged in \"claim splitting\" of his claims between federal and tribal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court will first address Defendant's motion for election of remedies, or, alternatively, to dismiss for improper claim-splitting and then analyze Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding Plaintiff's claim for negligent entrustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION FOR ELECTION OF REMEDIES OR TO DISMISS FOR CLAIM SPLITTING\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Election of Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Defendant, Plaintiff's tribal and federal complaints have both asserted \"money damages ... in an amount to be determined at trial to be both just and reasonable.\" Def.'s Mot. to Compel at 2 (citing Plaintiff's complaint in the District Court of the Navajo Nation, ECF No. 38-1 at 15 \u00b6 80 and Plaintiff's federal complaint, ECF No. 1-1 at 12 \u00b6 76 ). Defendant contends that \"[i]f Plaintiff is permitted to maintain both the present case and the pending Navajo Nation lawsuit and carry them both to judgment, then he would be attempting to secure two awards for the same wrong,\" and therefore asks the Court to \"compel Plaintiff to choose the forum in which he intends to proceed.\" Def.'s Mot. to Compel at 1, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The election of remedies doctrine \"refers to situations where an individual pursues remedies that are legally or factually inconsistent,\" and operates to \"prevent[ ] a party from obtaining double redress for a single wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Defendant believes the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning that a merchant should not be held for a third-party's misuse of chattel should apply in this case. Otherwise, the \"floodgates\" would open to \"lawsuits against drive-thru restaurants for accidents caused when a driver gets distracted with eating while driving; hot beverage providers for accidents caused when a driver becomes preoccupied with spillage or drinking while driving; or drug stores that sell cosmetics for accidents caused when a driver is inattentive when applying makeup while driving.\" Def.'s Mot. to Compel at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Turning to Plaintiff's arguments, Plaintiff identifies no New Mexico caselaw specifically establishing a duty owed by gasoline vendors to third-parties. But according to Plaintiff's survey of New Mexico negligent entrustment cases, the key idea gleaned from these cases is that liability arises from the act of entrusting chattel to an intoxicated person - whether that chattel be a car or gasoline.

Aside from these two cases, Plaintiff cites no binding or persuasive legal precedent concluding that negligent entrustment arises from sales of gasoline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Turning to legislative enactments and general principles of law that Plaintiff believes create a duty, Plaintiff argues that the State's drunk driving statute clearly evinces a policy of keeping dangerous drunk drivers off the roadways and cites the New Mexico Court of Appeals' statement that \"the public's interest in deterring individuals from driving while intoxicated is compelling.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Entrustment liability on gasoline vendors like Defendant dovetails with and even furthers this policy, Plaintiff says, since the tort particularly applies in cases of intoxicated drivers. That the New Mexico Legislature has not imposed dramshop-style liability on gasoline vendors does not undercut the general idea that an owner of chattel has a duty to others to not give control of a dangerous instrumentality\n   to an incompetent person, says Plaintiff. Finally, Plaintiff argues that if the Court were to find a duty on Defendant to refrain from selling alcohol to intoxicated drivers, it would not open the courthouse doors to a \"flood of lawsuits\" or result in fault being unfairly assigned to gasoline vendors because New Mexico's pure comparative negligence principles reduce a plaintiff's proportionate recovery by his or her degree of fault.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armenta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362354\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nmca/2015/092/4362354/\">\n    2015-NMCA-092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=356%20P.3d%2017\">\n    356 P.3d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995-NMCA-126\">\n    1995-NMCA-126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566557\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/133/#p140\">\n    121 N.M. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1566557\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/121/133/#p140\">\n    909 P.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (stating that policy questions of duty can be answered by relevant statutes). Although Plaintiff has identified a strong public policy of removing dangerous drunk drivers from the road as evidenced by the State's drunk driving statute, the DWI statute was enacted to protect the motoring public by imposing criminal liability on offending drivers. Plaintiff has identified no policy making gasoline vendors civilly liable for accomplishing that same interest. By way of contrast, New Mexico's Liquor Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2041-11-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41-11-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E) evinces a public policy of creating tort liability for liquor licensees and social hosts who sell, serve, or provide alcohol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delfino v. Griffo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251393\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/97/\">\n    2011-NMSC-015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251393\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/97/\">\n    150 N.M. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251393\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/150/97/\">\n    257 P.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923. The Court recognizes that Defendant sold Mr. Denny gasoline, not alcohol, and thus the Liquor Liability Act would not have applied to that transaction. However, the Court cites the Liquor Liability Act to demonstrate that the legislature is capable of imposing liability on parties for alcohol-related accidents, and that the legislature imposed no liability on gasoline vendors. In the absence of a civil liability statute, Plaintiff effectively asks this Court to impose judicially crafted liability on vendors for sales of gasoline to intoxicated persons where neither the State's courts, legislature, or even Plaintiff offer guidance on the scope and nature of that duty. As Defendant correctly points out, its sale of gasoline to Mr. Denny violated\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   law. If Mr. Denny legally purchased gasoline, then Defendant had no duty to refrain from making that sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has failed to identify binding or persuasive legal precedent, statutes, and other principles of law demonstrating that Defendant owed a duty of care to Plaintiff to refrain from selling gasoline to an intoxicated person. Having determined that Defendant owed no duty of care to Plaintiff in this case, the Court grants Defendant's Rule 12(c) motion to\n   dismiss Plaintiff's claim for negligent entrustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. NOTICE TO PLAINTIFF OF POSSIBLE\n    <em>\n     SUA SPONTE\n    </em>\n    DISMISSAL OF COUNT II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant failed to move to dismiss Count II, Plaintiff's claim for negligent hiring, training, and supervision stemming from its employee's sale of gasoline to Mr. Denny. In light of the Court's foregoing discussion of Plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim, the Court is skeptical about the viability of such a claim because presumably the two causes of action are predicated upon the same legal duty that the Court found lacking as a matter of law on Plaintiff's negligent entrustment claim. In instances where a district court is contemplating dismissing a claim\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit has said that \"the preferred practice is to accord a plaintiff notice and an opportunity to amend his complaint before acting upon a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinney v. State of Okl., Dep't of Human Servs., Shawnee OK\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789166\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/363/#p365\">\n    925 F.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 365 (10th Cir. 1991) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbas v. Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895821\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/636/#p640\">\n    480 F.3d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640 (2d Cir. 2007) (stating that it is \"bad practice for a district court to dismiss without affording a plaintiff the opportunity to be heard in opposition,\" unless the complaint lacks merit.). But a trial court may dismiss a claim\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   without notice to the plaintiff \"when it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged and allowing [her] an opportunity to amend [her] complaint would be futile.\"\n   <em>\n    Knight v. Mooring Capital Fund, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064084\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/1180/#p1190\">\n    749 F.3d 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1190 (10th Cir. 2014). The Court finds no good cause to permit Plaintiff to amend his complaint at this late stage in the litigation. However, the Court affords Plaintiff notice and an opportunity to submit an optional written response to the Court's contemplated dismissal of Count II. Plaintiff's optional memorandum is due with 14-days of entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order. If Plaintiff files a memorandum, then Defendant must reply to Plaintiff's memorandum within 14-days of Plaintiff's filing. If Plaintiff files no response to this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court will dismiss with prejudice all claims against Defendant and enter a final judgment in favor of Defendant on Plaintiff's claims. The parties' briefs shall not exceed 12-pages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant's motion for election of remedies, or, in the alternative to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint for improper claim splitting is denied because neither of those doctrines apply to this case. However, the Court grants Defendant's Rule 12(c) motion because Defendant had no legal duty to the motoring public to refrain from selling an intoxicated driver gasoline. Finally, the Court is considering dismissing Plaintiff's cause of action for negligent hiring, training, and supervision (Count II). Plaintiff and Defendant are afforded an opportunity to respond to the Court's contemplated dismissal in the sequence described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Giant Four Corners, Inc. d/b/a Giant # 7251's Opposed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 90 ]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and that Giant's Opposed Motion to Compel Election of Remedies or Dismiss for Improper Claim Splitting\n   <strong>\n    [ECF No. 91 ]\n   </strong>\n   is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Defendant did not move to dismiss Count II, Plaintiff's claim for negligent hiring, training, and supervision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2066-8-102\">\n     N.M.
