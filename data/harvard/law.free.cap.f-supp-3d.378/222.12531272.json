LLP and Midland Funding LLC d/b/a Midland Funding of Delaware, LLC (collectively, \"Defendants\") sought to collect a debt from Plaintiff and others in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FDCPA\"). (Dkt. 1). On September 16, 2013, United States District Judge William M. Skretny granted Plaintiff's motion for class certification and appointed Brian Bromberg Law Office, P.C. and the Law Offices of Kenneth Hiller, PLLC as class counsel. (Dkt. 110). This action then proceeded through many years of discovery and additional motion practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 14, 2017. while discovery was still pending, this Court referred this action to a mediation session during the Court's concentrated \"Settlement Week.\" (Dkt. 352). The mediation session was held on November 8, 2017, at which time Class Counsel and Defendants' counsel negotiated a possible resolution of the matter with the assistance of an experienced federal mediator. (Dkt. 365). As a result, the parties were able to reach a settlement in principal. (Dkt. 366).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 4, 2018, Plaintiff filed a consent motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement. (Dkt. 373). The Court held a preliminary fairness hearing on May 24, 2018, and preliminarily approved the class action settlement. (Dkt. 375; Dkt. 376). The Court subsequently held a final fairness hearing on November 27, 2018. (Dkt. 384). On November 30, 2018, the Court issued a Decision and Order approving the class action settlement, but reserving decision on Class Counsel's request for attorneys' fees and costs until further briefing was filed. (Dkt. 385;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 386 (Supplemental Order of Final Approval of Class Action Settlement)). On January 11, 2019, Cohen &amp; Slamowitz, LLP filed a letter indicating that they \"will not be submitting any affirmative opposition to the motion at this time and will defer to the Court's review and determination with respect to the request for attorney's fees and costs, subject to the negotiated cap of $ 400,000.\" (Dkt. 387 at 1).

(Dkt. 382 at 15). Although Class Counsel's calculated attorneys' fees and costs amount to $ 396,672.50 and $ 22,187.41, respectively, this total value exceeds the \"agreed-upon amount of $ 400,000\" (Dkt. 382-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48), and thus, only $ 400,000.00 is sought on this motion (Dkt. 382 at 26 (\"Plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to cap their fees and costs to facilitate settlement and guarantee a meaningful recovery for the class members.\")). Class Counsel's calculations utilize certain hourly fee rates that are greater than those usually applied by courts in this District when determining the reasonableness of a fee award in an FDCPA case. For example, Mr. Brian L. Bromberg, Esq., of the Bromberg Law Office, P.C., requests that this Court apply a $ 375 per hour rate to his billable hours. (Dkt. 382-1 at \u00b6 34). Mr. Bromberg also requests that the Court apply a $ 300 per hour rate to the billable hours accrued by Mr. Michael N. Litrownik, Esq., and Mr. Jonathan R. Miller, Esq., while they worked on this case as associate attorneys with his law office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40). Mr. Litrownik also submitted an attorney declaration requesting that the Court apply a $ 300 per hour rate to the billable hours he accumulated while employed by Mr. Bromberg's law practice. (Dkt. 382-7 at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Miller has submitted a separate set of contemporaneous time records associated with his work on this matter after leaving Mr. Bromberg's law office in 2017, to start his own practice at the Law Office of Jonathan R. Miller, PLLC d/b/a Salem Community Law Office, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. (Dkt. 382-3 at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 33; Dkt. 382-6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 382-1 at \u00b6 40 (\"Mr. Miller is also submitting a separate declaration and records for the time he worked on this case after he left my office.\")). Mr. Miller requests that the Court apply a $ 300 per hour rate to the billable hours accumulated after his departure from Mr. Bromberg's law practice. (Dkt. 382-3 at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Kenneth R. Hiller, Esq., of the Law Offices of Kenneth Hiller, submits an attorney declaration acknowledging that he \"generally charge[s] $ 350.00 per hour in cases [he] handle[s] in consumer cases or other litigation where a Court does not determine [his] fee,\" and that \"[c]ourts in this district have awarded [him] $ 215.00 per hour in attorneys fees in routine FDCPA cases in which the [d]efendant has defaulted.\" (Dkt. 382-9 at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24). Mr. Hiller states that \"[t]his case is much more complex, involving the FDCPA, Bankruptcy Law, and Class Action law,\" and was \"fiercely opposed by capable counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). As such, Mr. Hiller requests that the Court apply a $ 350 per hour rate for his billable hours in this case for the same reasons this Court set forth in its recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Godson v. Eltman, Eltman, &amp; Cooper, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=328%20F.R.D.%2035\">\n    328 F.R.D. 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.N.Y. 2018). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Lastly, Mr. Seth J. Andrews, Esq., of the Law Offices of Kenneth Hiller, also submits an attorney declaration requesting that the Court apply a $ 300 per hour rate to the billable hours accrued by him during his work on this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 382-11 at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). Mr. Andrews states that this is the amount he generally charges \"in consumer cases or other litigation where a Court does not determine [his] fee\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13), and that a rate of $ 300 per hour is warranted in this case \"[g]iven [his] years of legal experience, the difficulty and complexity of this case, [and] the fact that competent class action counsel for consumer cases other than the undersigned, does not exist\" in Western New York (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16). Mr. Andrews notes that this Court previously applied a $ 250 per hour rate in awarding him attorneys' fees in\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20). However, he contends that a $ 300 per hour rate is appropriate in this\n   case because his \"attorney declaration was inadvertently omitted for submission\" in\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   , and his experience is commensurate with Mr. Miller, who was awarded an hourly rate of $ 300 in\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A review of recent FDCPA cases decided in this District suggests that a reasonable hourly rate for attorneys' fees ranges from about $ 200 to $ 300 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eades v.

Furthermore, the Court recognizes that Mr. Bromberg and Mr. Hiller have extensive experience handling consumer protection litigation, and that Mr. Miller, Mr. Litrownik, and Mr. Andrews, while perhaps not as seasoned in this field, are certainly accomplished in their own right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The hourly rates requested in this case are almost the same as those awarded in\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   , which involved the same plaintiffs' attorneys. In\n   <em>\n    Godson\n   </em>\n   , the Court granted a fee award for Mr. Litrownik's and Mr. Andrews' billable hours at a rate of $ 250 per hour because neither attorney had submitted attorney declarations on their own behalf.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=328%20F.R.D.%2035\">\n    328 F.R.D. at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without such declarations, the Court was unable to accurately compare the experience of these attorneys with Mr. Bromberg, Mr. Hiller, and Mr. Miller. However, a review of Mr. Litrownik's and Mr. Andrews' declarations in this case reveals that their experience is commensurate with that of Mr. Miller. Accordingly, considering the complex nature of this case, the fact that Defendants not only appeared, but vigorously opposed Plaintiff's action, and the tremendous skill brought to bear by all attorneys involved, the Court finds that for the unique work performed in connection with this case, Mr. Bromberg should be granted a fee award at a rate of $ 375 per hour, Mr. Hiller should granted a fee award at a rate of $ 350 per hour, and Mr. Miller, Mr. Litrownik, and Mr. Andrews should each be granted a fee award at a rate of $ 300 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
