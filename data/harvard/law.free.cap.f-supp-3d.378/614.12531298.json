(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 72 at 2, PageID 2036.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 8-9, 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Furthermore, AFT alleges that Jorge \"employed a hidden camera [in a private office] to covertly record a private conversation with an AFT Michigan staff representative\" during which they discussed the resolution of a matter related to teacher discipline with the goal of teaching Jorge how staff members provide assistance in those matters. (Sec. Am. Comp. \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 32, ECF No. 72 at 7, PageID 2041.) Defendant Project Veritas later published portions of the recorded conversation (along with some of AFT's confidential documents) on YouTube, editing the conversation to provide a false narrative as to AFT's staff member's role for the specific purpose of disparaging AFT Michigan.

This Court unequivocally concurs with Judge Brennan's dissenting opinion and adopts its rationale, which reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   On its face, the statute does not state that a person who is a party to the conversation cannot violate the statute. Rather, if the Legislature had intended that the statute not apply to participants, I think that it would have stated that intention in clear language. As a matter of fact, the very first phrase of the statute indicates that participants to the conversation can violate the statute: '\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   person who is present ...' (emphasis added). If the Legislature intended to exclude participants, I think that it would have stated any person not a party to the conversation. Moreover, the statute also states that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   participants in the conversation must consent to the overhearing, recording, amplifying or transmitting of the conversation. (emphasis added). To me, this plainly prohibits participants, as well as third parties, from the activities designated in the statute without disclosure to the other persons to the conversation that the conversation is being overheard, recorded, amplified or transmitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, I think the fact that the Legislature even defined the word \"eavesdropping\" is significant.... [T]he Legislature did define eavesdropping, using the disjunctive \"or\", as not only overhearing but also recording, amplifying or transmitting the conversation. Thus, to violate the statute, one needs only to overhear or record or transmit or amplify.

This Court disagrees with the former argument and declines to apply the statutory construction that supports the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court finds that AFT has sufficiently demonstrated a violation of the eavesdropping statute, as predicted to be construed by the Michigan Supreme Court. The Court can reasonably infer from the alleged recording of her conversation with an AFT staff representative that Jorge violated the statute. If true, there is little doubt that Jorge willfully used some device to record a conversation reasonably expected to be free from intrusion or surveillance (having taken place in a private office concerning nonpublic information) without the consent of all other parties. Additionally, Defendant PV is found in violation of the statute as a party that \"employ[ed] or procure[d] another person\" to violate it. MCL \u00a7 750.539c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, given that Jorge allegedly carried her cellular phone wherever she went, it is reasonable to infer that she also recorded conversations to which she was present but not a participant. The Defendants' argument to the contrary rests solely on a presumption that Jorge was a participant in all conversations that she possibly recorded. These facts, however, are either wholly unknown or in dispute at this stage. Because the Court must examine claims in a light most favorable to Plaintiff and must draw all reasonable inferences in its favor, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged facts demonstrating a plausible claim against Defendants for eavesdropping under this theory as well. Therefore, the Court denies Defendants' motion as to Count III of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VI: Misappropriation of Trade Secrets\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The actual or threatened misappropriation of trade secrets may be enjoined or affirmative acts may be compelled by court order to protect such secrets. Michigan's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"MUTSA\"), MCL \u00a7 445.1901\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (1998). A trade secret means information that both: (1) derives independent economic value, and (2) is the subject of efforts to maintain its secrecy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 445.1902(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants contend that none of the private, confidential documents that Plaintiff has alleged to be removed from its offices and/or photographed by Jorge constitute trade secrets. Although Plaintiff has alleged that these documents were private, confidential, and kept in private\n   storage, the Court agrees that they do not constitute trade secrets under Michigan law, and Plaintiff has not provided the Court authority demonstrating otherwise. Disclosure of Plaintiff's confidential information and documents likely would cause harm to Plaintiff and its organization's efforts; and Plaintiff has alleged a potential economic impact from the information's disclosure. Still, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that any information has independent economic value and thereby failed to allege facts sufficient to support its misappropriation claim.

The Court agrees with Plaintiff's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Am.

Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Jorge accessed Plaintiff's private offices, computers, and files that were not readily accessible or readily available to either her or the public, and she did so under the guise of her fraudulent misrepresentations.
