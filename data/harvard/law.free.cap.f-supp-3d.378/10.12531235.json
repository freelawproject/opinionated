The Panel transferred these consolidated actions to this Court on October 13, 2015. The Panel subsequently transferred additional related actions to be consolidated into the instant litigation, and at present, there are a total of 105 cases consolidated in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 30, 2015, the Court entered its [4] Initial Practice and Procedure Order Upon Transfer Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Court set out a general outline of how it intended to proceed in this matter. On February 4, 2016, the Court appointed Hausfeld LLP and Cotchett,\n   Pitre &amp; McCarthy LLP as Interim Co-Lead Counsel (\"Settlement Class Counsel\"), and on March 25, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Appointing Plaintiffs' Interim Class Counsel, ECF No. 76 ; Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, ECF No. 91.

The Notice Program proposed direct notice by email, to be supplemented by publication through print and media outlets, as well as additional online services. The Settlement Notice Program was approved by this Court in its [267] Order and [268] Memorandum Opinion, wherein the Court deemed that the proposed notice via email and publication was the \"best notice practicable under the circumstances of this case[,]\" consistent with the standard set forth in Fed.

In analyzing the proposed Settlements, this Court will first address the factors set forth in Rule 23, followed by the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Vitamins\n   </em>\n   that are not duplicative of the Rule 23 factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Looking at the first two factors addressed in Rule 23(e)(2)(A) &amp; (B) - adequate representation of the class and negotiation of the proposal at arm's length - the Court notes that the objections submitted in response to the proposed Settlements do not dispute that the Settlements were reached through arm's length negotiations between experienced, capable counsel after meaningful discovery. Nor does anyone contest that the proposed Settlements treat class members equitably relative to each other. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(D). The final factor - adequacy of the relief proposed in the Settlements, pursuant to Rule 23(e)(2)(C) -was addressed in detail at the Fairness Hearing, and it is discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Adequacy of Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To determine whether relief is adequate, pursuant to Rule 23, courts look at: (1) the costs, risk and delay of trial; (2) the effectiveness of the proposed means of distributing relief to the class, including the processing of claims; (3) the terms of any award of attorneys' fees, including the timing, and (4) any agreements identified in connection with the settlement. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (e)(2)(C)(i)-(iv). The fourth factor - agreements in connection with the settlement - is inapplicable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the March 22, 2019 Fairness Hearing, the Court began its inquiry about the adequacy of the Settlement by noting that Rule 23 contains the following commentary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court would look to the conduct of the litigation and then the negotiations leading up to the proposed settlement. Attention to these matters is an important foundation for scrutinizing the substance of the proposed settlement. The focus on this point is on the actual performance of counsel acting on behalf of the class. The nature and amount of discovery in this and other cases or the actual outcome of other cases may indicate whether counsel negotiating on behalf of the class had an adequate information base.... Another central concern would relate to the costs and risks involved in pursuing a litigated outcome.

The Settlements were negotiated over time, by competent and experienced counsel who had access to a large body of information through discovery. Settlement Class Counsel weighed the costs and risks of continued litigation versus entering into an \"icebreaker\" settlement with Southwest and a subsequent settlement with American, both of which provided Settlement Funds for the Class Members as well as continued cooperation to aid Plaintiffs in their litigation against the Non-Settling Defendants. Furthermore, the Settlements do not limit the Class Members' ability to obtain joint and several liability and treble damages against those Non-Settling Defendants, which would increase the Total Funds Available for Distribution. Accordingly, evaluation of the \"costs and risks\" factor favors finding the Settlements adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Measuring the proposed relief may require an evaluation of any proposed claims process. Often, it'll be important for the Court to scrutinize the method of claims processing to ensure that it facilitates filing legitimate claims. And a claims-processing method should deter and defeat unjustified claims, but the Court should be alert to whether the claims process is unduly demanding and to make sure that those that are part of the class that should make claims, make them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   TR. at 26:9-22. The Court asked Settlement Class Counsel to explain their proposed means of distribution and processing of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Settlement Class Counsel indicated that the distribution of the Settlement Funds will be deferred until the end of the entire case when there is a better indication of the Total Funds Available for Distribution (total money collected based on the resolution of the case against all four Defendants) and amount of damages suffered by Class Members, so that Settlement Class Counsel will be better able to compute \"what value in proportion to the damage [is available] for class reimbursement.\" Tr. at 28:11-20. Class Members will be notified regarding the claims process (and their right to object) in a manner similar to the way in which they received initial notification of the settlement. Information provided\n   to Class Members as to their potential recovery, which is dependent on the number of claims, will help Class Members decide whether to object and/or make a claim. Settlement Class Counsel volunteered that they can \"work with [their] claims administrator in terms of coming up with a range or at least providing guideposts to class members.\" Tr. at 36:13-15. A claims administrator will review any claims made by Class Members, and the distribution method will be \"pro rata,\" Tr. at 30:3-11, with a \"pro rata, per capita return to class members.\" Tr. at 35:4-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Settlement Agreements provide that Defendants Southwest and American \"take no position with respect to such proposed plan of allocation or such plan as may be approved by the Court.\" Southwest Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 196-2 \u00b6 40 ; American Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 248-2 \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Settlement Class Counsel argued that \"it's not an impediment to approval of the settlement that the actual amount to be distributed to class members\" is not known at this time.

The remaining Objections raise issues that fall into the following categories: (1) the settlement amounts are too small (Argie, Baker, Bednarz/Frank, DeMott, Klover, Suessmann, Willett, Zajac); (2) it's not clear how much the class members will receive because of a lack of adequate information (Chen, Bednarz/Frank, DeMott, Harris, Liebich, Suessmann, Weissman, Yazdani, Zajac); (3) the Settlement Funds may be subject to a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distribution (Anaya, Argie, Chen, Bednarz/Frank, Johnson, Klover, Liebich, Nash, Weissman, Yazdani); and (4) the Settlements do not provide for injunctive relief (Yazdani).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 6:3-8. Class Members' Objections regarding attorney's fees were deemed premature because the attorneys' fees issue will not be addressed until the entire case has been resolved. Similarly, uncertainty about the settlement amounts to be received by Class Members is also a premature basis for an objection until such time as the case against the remaining two Defendant airlines has been resolved and the Total Funds Available for Distribution are\n   known. There is a procedure in place whereby Class Members will receive notification of a plan of allocation/distribution, including information regarding the range of settlement, and there will be an opportunity to make claims and/or objections at that time regarding settlement amounts.

The alternative scenario that could lead to a\n   <em>\n    cy pres\n   </em>\n   distribution would be if there are \"so many claims and there's not enough money in this to make it worthwhile to be distributed\" because it would be \"outweighed ... by the cost of disbursing the money.\" Tr. at 37:19-23.

Normally, you ask for injunctive relief where violations that are claimed to have occurred in the past are continuing because there's no change in the behavior or the conduct in the industry. To date, we have no indication that that's true with regard to this matter presently or going forward. So there does not seem to be, you know, a basis for an injunction prohibiting conduct which presently does not exist nor for which there is, particularly given the attention paid to this, should ever rationally be engaged in again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Tr. at 39:7-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that \"courts repeatedly reject the argument that the lack of injunctive relief renders a settlement unfair, particularly where, as here, the injunctive relief provision would require the settling party to simply abide by the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karst Envtl.

Size of Settlement Amounts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court permitted Class Members Theodore Frank (\"Mr. Frank\") and Michael Suessmann (\"Mr. Suessmann\") an opportunity to speak on behalf of the Objectors at the Fairness Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Regarding Procedures for the March 22, 2019 Fairness Hearing, ECF No. 342, at 6. Mr. Suessmann stated his \"concern [that] the notice provided to the class is inadequate\" in part because the notice discusses a \"right to object\" and \"[i]nherent in that is the idea that we're provided information from which we can make decisions about whether to object or not\" but the \"information in the notice that [he] received was not sufficient for [him] to be able to tell whether the settlement was fair and reasonable.\" Tr. at 69:14-24-70:1-2. Mr. Suessmann specified that he was \"not worried about the distribution and allocation\" but was instead worried about \"liability, because there's nothing in there that says how the [Settlement Funds] numbers were arrived at,\" when you look at airline profits. Tr. at 70:12-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DeMott Objection, ECF No. 321, at 38-39 (questioning the relationship of the settlement amounts to the class's damages); Sajak Objection, ECF No. 301, at 11-12, 15 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Mr. Suessmann did not dispute that experienced counsel negotiated an arm's length settlement before arriving at the Settlement Funds amounts, which together with the Defendants' cooperation, provide relief for the Class Members; rather, he appeared curious about any formula that was used to arrive at the $ 15 million and $ 45 million amounts. As explained in Section III (A)(1)(a) herein, these ultimate numbers were derived through extensive negotiations between counsel who all have a great deal of experience in litigating class action antitrust lawsuits. Furthermore, it is unclear if Mr. Suessmann has placed any value on the cooperation provided by Defendants Southwest and American.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Liebich Objection, ECF No. 321, at 13 (where Class Member Jason Liebich, through counsel, asserted that the value of the cooperation by Southwest and American was \"speculative,\" but cited no support for this assertion). At the Fairness Hearing, the Court inquired as to whether the cooperation by the settling Defendants\n   has proven to be valuable, and Settlement Class Counsel indicated that the significant cooperation provided by Southwest and American in \"la[ying] out to [counsel] where they thought [they] should be looking, why [they] should be looking there, how [they] should go about looking\" has been even \"[m]ore [valuable] than [counsel] thought,\" Tr. at 23:2-9; 23:18-24. Nor is it clear if Mr. Suessmann's objection accounts for Southwest's role as an \"icebreaker,\" or the litigation risks and costs of continued litigation, which were discussed in considerable detail in Plaintiffs' Motion for Final Approval and Omnibus Response and at the Fairness Hearing. As previously noted, this Court is satisfied with the explanation of the Settlement Funds amounts, and this objection relating to size of the Settlement Funds is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In a Reply filed by Class Member Paul DeMott, Mr. DeMott, through counsel, notes that even while Settlement Class Counsel cites \"persuasive authority holding that the parties are not required to provide estimates of damages\" he objects to counsel's failure to provide such estimate in this case - where counsel allegedly possesses that information - on grounds that it will hinder this Court in making a reasoned decision. DeMott Reply, ECF No. 339, at 8-10. The Court notes that Mr. DeMott's assumption that Settlement Class Counsel had information reflecting an accurate estimate of damages in this case relies on a footnote in the Omnibus Response that includes the word \"estimates,\" and it is belied by counsel's statements during the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:2-7 (\"It wasn't, for example, looking at the totality of the revenue of affected commerce and saying, what does $ 15 million or what does any amount of money compare as the numerator to a denominator of the total revenue? We weren't quite sure what the total revenue was, nor what [ ] shape [ ] the case might take depending upon discovery advances.\"); Tr. at 24:16-22 (answering the Court's question whether there was \"any particular formula or way of deciding\" to triple the settlement amount for American, counsel stated that \"[i]n terms again of an ultimate damage calculation, you know, through economic regression, no.\") Furthermore, any estimate of damages relevant to the early settlement by one defendant in a multi-defendant case does not give the full picture of all potential damages (especially where such damages from the remaining defendants may be ultimately enhanced through cooperation with the settling defendant) and as noted above, such estimate may not be viewed in a vacuum but rather, it must be weighed against the risks and costs of continued litigation. Accordingly, objections related to counsel's \"failure\" to provide at this time a damages estimate are insufficient to affect approval of the Settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Issues regarding Notice Provided to Class Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   At the Fairness Hearing, Mr. Frank indicated that he was not contesting the settlement amount, Tr. at 63:25-64:1-9, but instead focused on the fact that there was no information about the allocation plan and \"[Settlement Class Counsel] didn't even give a metric, an algorithm for determining, Yes, we're going to give money to the class or No, we're going to give money to\n   <em>\n    cy pres.\n   </em>\n   \" Tr. at 63:19-21. Mr. Frank stated that \"if they're going to have a claims process, they need to disclose what that claims process is.\n   <em>\n    Pro rata\n   </em>\n   is probably fine. But they need to set that forward and bind themselves to it.\" Tr. at 64:17-20. The Court noted that, pursuant to the Settlement Agreements, Defendants Southwest and American are not involved and do not provide input in the claims process and distribution of settlement proceeds. The\n   Court did not view this as a defect in the settlement, instead noting that \"[i]t seems to me that you would want the Plaintiff to be the one to figure it out.\" Tr. at 66:6-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The balance of Mr. Frank's objection regarding the lack of a distribution formula has been addressed previously by this Court in Section III (A)(1)(b). There is a two-stage procedure for notice to Class Members prior to the claims process and distribution of the Total Funds Available for Distribution. The first stage provided notice of the Settlements which was consistent with the notice required pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B), which sets forth seven items that must be clearly and concisely stated. The second stage - which will occur after the entire case is resolved - will provide Class Members with notification of the Total Funds Available for Distribution and information about the claims process, including the manner in which to make an objection and/or a claim, and possible ranges of recovery based on hypothetical claims percentages. Accordingly, Mr. Frank's objection to the lack of information about the claims process and distribution of settlement proceeds is rejected\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Mr. Suessmann alleged a different deficiency in the notice that Class Members received insofar as the notice failed to indicate what documents would have to be provided in connection with the submission of Class Members' claims and whether Class Members or counsel would provide the underlying data to support such claims. Settlement Class Counsel and counsel for Southwest and American explained that Class Members who received the notice are in the database, and there will be provisions made at the time when claims are filed regarding alternative means for submitting claims, such as by affidavit, if certain paper records are not available to Class Members. Accordingly, the Court finds that counsel have provided an explanation in response to Mr. Suessmann's \"objection\" regarding lack of clarity about provision of claims documentation, and this \"objection\" will be rejected at this time. Class Member Stephan Willett objected to one sentence in the class notice, which contained the word \"and,\" when he thought it should be an \"or,\" and some language that he found confusing regarding the postmark/receipt date, Willett Obj., ECF No. 309, at 10-11, but the Court disagrees with this objection which does not affect the validity of the Settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    V. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS - DEFENDANTS' COOPERATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court considered delaying a final approval of the Southwest and American Settlements until after resolution of the case as to all Defendants. In considering this option, the Court inquired as to whether Defendants Southwest and American would continue to cooperate with the Plaintiffs pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreements, if the Court were to delay approval of the Settlements until the entire case was resolved. Counsel for Southwest and American both indicated that a postponement would pose \"[r]eal risks\" to their cooperation, Tr. at 45:13-15, because it would \"deprive the Plaintiffs of the finality of this and it would deprive what [Southwest] bargained for as Defendant in terms of the finality of the settlement.\" Tr. at 44:8-12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 51:15-25 (noting that American paid \"fair value,\" and wanted \"finality\"). \"And we need finality so that we get the releases from the claims, we get the benefit of the settlement to which we bargained for.\" Tr. at 84:8-11. \"[W]ithout having finality, we're really not getting the benefit of our bargain ... to pay a certain amount to get out of this litigation, so we could stop the flow of expenses in terms of, ..., the costs of\n   discovery and the costs of experts [and] [w]e'll continue to have to monitor this litigation and incur significant costs [so] [w]ithout finality, we may also have to consider the rescission provisions in the settlement agreement.\" Tr. at 84:24-85:7. Counsel for Southwest stressed further that, without finality, there could be a \"significant chilling effect on early icebreaker settlements,\" Tr. at 85:8-14, and she noted that \"a really important point here is the fact that all of the sales remain in the case and that they would be available for [ ] a claim for damages against the nonsettling Defendants[,]\" which benefits ultimately the Class Members in terms of the Total Funds Available for Distribution. Tr. at 85:15-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Counsel for American emphasized that if the Settlements are not approved at this time and approval was delayed, it would be \"extraordinarily disruptive\" in light of the payments made and cooperation provided by American and Southwest. Tr. at 54:14-25. A delayed approval of the settlement would \"present[ ] American with an ... immense, practical problem\" because if there is no release, \"then we have to go back to preparing for trial\" since they did not get the \"benefit of [their] bargain.\" Tr. at 86:7-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Settlement Class Counsel asserted that postponing approval of the Settlements would create \"uncertainty [ ] as to whether or not the Defendants will continue to cooperate\" by producing materials informally and permitting informal interview.

Both Southwest and American confirmed at the Fairness Hearing that their cooperation would not be forthcoming in the event that this Court delays final approval of the Settlements, as they would again have to begin litigating this case. Accordingly, this factor of continued cooperation by Southwest and American, which benefits the Plaintiffs in their litigation against the Non-Settling Defendants, further weighs in favor of this Court approving the Settlements at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
