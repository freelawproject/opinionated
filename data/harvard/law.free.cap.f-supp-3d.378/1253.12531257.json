The Motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for review. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves an insurance policy requested by Plaintiff Brazell Holdings, LLC, and obtained with the help of Defendant USI Insurance Services National, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   as an insurance broker. Plaintiff is the owner of nine Subway Restaurants. Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a part of its franchise agreement, Plaintiff is required to maintain insurance on each of its nine restaurants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. The agreement also requires that such insurance satisfy certain \"Gold Standard Insurance Program Requirements,\" such as sufficient personal property and construction or buildout coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. As such, franchise owners are generally required to purchase \"Gold Standard Insurance\" through a \"Gold Standard Broker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 34-1 at 5. Defendant is listed as, and holds itself out as, a \"Gold Standard Broker.\" Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 9. To participate in this program, a Subway franchisee would complete a \"Gold Standard Application\" to three participating brokers. Dkt. No. 33-1 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In August of 2017, an employee of Plaintiff, Katrina Bell, contacted Defendant for an insurance quote. Dkt. No. 33-2. To obtain this quote, Plaintiff submitted its \"Gold Standard Application\" that listed detailed\n   information about each of its nine Subway stores and requested certain types of insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the application, Plaintiff requested wind coverage for all nine locations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, in the application Plaintiff listed its restaurant located at 2903 Glynn Avenue, Brunswick, GA 31520 as \"Store #3\" and its restaurant located at 5008 New Jesup Highway as \"Store #4.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The application also listed each restaurant's \"Subway. Store #\" as a four or five-digit number in each of the nine store's columns in the spreadsheet-formatted application-10623 for the Glynn Avenue location and 14691 for the New Jesup Highway location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleged in the Complaint that the store location numbers such as \"Store #3\" and \"Store #4\" reflected the numbers that Plaintiff used internally to refer to the stores, and Plaintiff used these numbers continuously since those stores came under Plaintiff's ownership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using the information provided by Plaintiff in the \"Gold Standard Application,\" Defendant prepared and submitted, on Plaintiff's behalf, a \"Commercial Insurance Application\" to Nationwide Insurance (\"Nationwide\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14-15; Dkt. No. 20-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On page four of the Commercial Insurance Application, under a section entitled \"Addresses,\" in an unnumbered list, Defendant listed the nine addresses in the same order as the store locations listed on the Gold Standard Application completed by Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 20-2 at 4. However, beginning on page eight of the application, under the section entitled \"Schedule\" in which the application listed the specific details and coverage requests for the different store locations, Defendant renumbered the nine store locations as follows: \"Location 1-1,\" \"Location 2-1,\" etc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-24; Dkt. No 12 \u00b6 19. As a result, the Glynn Avenue location was listed as \"Location 4-1\" and the New Jesup Highway location was listed as \"Location 5-1,\" instead of \"Store #3\" and \"Store #4\" as listed in the Gold Standard Application. Dkt. No. 20-2 at 14, 16; Dkt. No. 33-2 at 4-12. Additionally, on page 27 of the Commercial Insurance Application, under the section entitled \"Additional Interests,\" the Glynn Avenue location was listed as \"Premise 4,\" and the New Jesup Highway location was listed as \"Premise 5.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. At that time, Plaintiff was unaware that Defendant changed the location numbers from the Gold Standard Application to the Commercial Insurance Application. Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 11, 2017, Defendant's account manager, Virginia Dalton, emailed an insurance quote from Nationwide to Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 17. The email summarized the coverage in the quote stating that \"[l]ocations 1,2,3,5,6,7, 8 have a 5% wind/hail deductible, Location 4 Wind is excluded and the last location has no wind deductible.\" Dkt. No. 8-2 at 2; Dkt. No. 33-5. The email also included a copy of the Nationwide quote, the \"Commercial Insurance Proposal,\" stating that \"[w]e are pleased to provide the attached Businessowners Quote.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3. Page nine of the quote listed \"Location 4-1\" as the\n   Glynn Avenue location and described that location's coverage. Dkt. No. 33-5 at 18. Under the description of coverage for Location 4-1, the Glynn Avenue location, the quote listed a \"Windstorm or Hail Exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Despite the actual wording of the quote received by Plaintiff showing Location 4-1 to be the Glynn Avenue location, Plaintiff alleges that it interpreted \"Location 4 Wind is excluded\" in the email to mean that wind coverage would be excluded only for the New Jesup Highway restaurant, instead of the Glynn Avenue location as stated in the policy quote. Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 18. Plaintiff further alleges that because it was unaware that Defendant renumbered the Glynn Avenue store as \"Location 4-1\" in the \"Schedule\" section of the application and the quote, it was also unaware that the Nationwide policy excluded wind coverage for that restaurant instead of the New Jesup Highway Location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19-20; Dkt. No. 34-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   About thirty minutes after receiving the insurance quote, Ms. Bell emailed Ms. Dalton stating that \"I'm not showing contamination covered under the quote you sent me. Can you point me in the right direction to find it?\" Dkt. No. 33-6 at 2. Ms. Dalton responded stating that \"Food Contamination is included in the Plus Endorsement (see attachment 1). On the Proposal see Page 3,\" and she attached the specific page of the policy that included contamination coverage to the email.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that afternoon, Ms. Dalton sent a revised quote explaining that \"[b]ecause #51234 [i.e. Location 9-1 in the policy quote] was included in the wind claim, Nationwide has revised the quote to apply 5% wind deductible to this location. Premium is revised to $ 12,056.\" Dkt. No. 33-8. This second quote was otherwise identical to the first quote in regard to the location numbers and the wind coverage exclusion for the Glynn Avenue location-Location 4-1. Dkt. No. 33-7 at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 28, 2017, Ms. Bell emailed Ms. Dalton asking that Ms. Dalton \"go ahead and bind coverage on the Nationwide quote today, please,\" and Ms. Dalton responded that she would \"bind coverage today and have the certificates prepared and sent out as soon as possible.\" Dkt. No. 33-8 at 2-3. Less than two weeks after Plaintiff purchased the policy and Defendant bound coverage, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to the Glynn Avenue Subway restaurant. Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 22. At the time that the hurricane struck, Plaintiff had not yet received a copy of the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; Dkt. No. 34-1 \u00b6 6. After timely notifying Nationwide of the loss caused by the hurricane, Plaintiff was informed that the wind exclusion applied to the Glynn Avenue location rather than the Jesup Highway location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. As a result, Nationwide denied Plaintiff's claim for damages to the Glynn Avenue restaurant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 33-1 \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently brought causes of action against Defendant for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and negligent misrepresentation for allegedly changing the store location numbers in the insurance application such that Plaintiff was unaware that the policy did not cover wind damage to the Glynn Avenue Subway location when it purchased the policy and when Hurricane Irma damaged the restaurant. Dkt. No. 12. Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss on July 10, 2018, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6) arguing that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Dkt. No. 8. On January 29, 2019, the Court converted Defendant's Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment to allow the parties to supplement the record with additional evidence and briefing. Dkt. No. 29. The Court will now address all of the parties briefs and evidence as part of the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is required where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Page nine of the Nationwide quote that was emailed to Plaintiff lists the coverage for \"Location 4-1.\" Dkt. No. 33-5 at 18. At the top of the page, \"Location 4-1\" is clearly indicated as the restaurant located at \"2903 Glynn Ave,\" and below in the coverage detail for that location, the quote states that \"Location 4-1\" has a \"Windstorm or Hail Exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.

After receiving the quote, Plaintiff purchased the insurance through Defendant from Nationwide.

The point is that the quote clearly stated on page nine that \"Location 4-1\" was the Glynn Avenue location and that, at the top of page ten, wind coverage was excluded for that location. This fact was also highlighted for Plaintiff's benefit by Defendant's email. Plaintiff had a duty to read and reject this insurance quote before agreeing to be bound to it if it objected to the Glynn Avenue location not having wind damage coverage. Therefore, because Plaintiff failed to read the insurance quote and reject the lack of wind damage coverage for the Glynn Avenue location, Defendant is insulated from liability unless an exception applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The only evidence that Plaintiff highlights to show that it relied on Defendant's expertise is Plaintiff's employee asking Defendant's account manager to direct her to where food contamination coverage was located within the policy quote and the fact that Defendant summarized the coverage in the email to Plaintiff that contained the policy quote. This evidence fails to create a genuine issue of material fact on this issue because it does not show that Defendant had discretion to decide what type of insurance to procure for Plaintiff. In other words, the fact that Plaintiff's employee asked to be directed to where certain coverage was located in the quote and the fact that Defendant highlighted a couple of important coverage issues in an email does not show that Plaintiff relied on Defendant to determine, within its discretion, what type of insurance Plaintiff would need and then procure that insurance. Instead, the undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff submitted a standard application specifically listing its stores' information and what specific coverages it wanted.

Here, the fact that \"Location 4-1\" was the Glynn Avenue location and the fact that that location had a wind damage exclusion is readily apparent because a quick reading of the policy quote shows that these facts are plainly and unambiguously displayed on pages nine and ten of the quote.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The main point is that despite Plaintiff's confusion of the locations and even assuming it relied on Defendant as an expert, pages nine and ten of the policy quote plainly and unambiguously delineate that \"Location 4-1\" was the Glynn Avenue restaurant and that that location did not have wind coverage.

The special relationship or unusual circumstance exception does not apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff's reliance on the second exception for a relationship of trust or unusual circumstances also fails. Plaintiff specifically argues that the second exception applies because this case is an unusual circumstance based on the fact that Defendant sent Plaintiff an email and policy quote saying Location 4 had wind damage excluded without explaining to Plaintiff that Location 4 referred to the Glynn Avenue location, which Plaintiff refers to as Store #3 in its Gold Standard Application. In other words, Plaintiff cites its own confusion over the store location number as the unusual circumstance absolving it of its duty to read and reject a policy that did not meet its needs. However, Plaintiff fails to show a genuine dispute of material fact on this point because it does not demonstrate how its confusion or Defendant's allegedly negligent summary of the coverage in the policy quote email warrants a\n   finding of unusual circumstances to justify absolving its duty to read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Traina Enterprises, Inc. v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Traina\n   </em>\n   held that the \"unusual circumstance\" was the insurance agent's \"voluntary practice of preparing a policy summary\" for the insured and that a jury could find that the agent prepared the summary in a negligent manner where he noted in the summary that certain coverage was included in a renewal policy but failed to tell the insured that such coverage had changed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115198\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/289/833/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115198\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/289/833/\">\n    at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115198\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/289/833/\">\n    658 S.E.2d 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Here, Defendant sent a detailed policy quote, or a \"Commercial Insurance Proposal,\" prepared by Nationwide, and in the email sending that quote, Defendant, in two sentences, highlighted the total premium cost and mentioned which locations had a wind and hail damage deductible and that \"Location 4\" had wind damage excluded. These two sentences highlighting a couple of important aspects of the policy quote differ significantly from a detailed program summary and presentation presented to the insured by the same agent each year. Moreover, while the agent in\n   <em>\n    Traina\n   </em>\n   failed to tell the insured about a reduction in a specific type of coverage included in the policy, Defendant in this case accurately highlighted for Plaintiff that wind damage coverage was excluded for Location 4 in the policy quote. The facts of this case do not warrant the label of unusual circumstance to absolve Plaintiff's duty to read. Because\n   <em>\n    Traina\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and because Plaintiff has not presented any other evidence to support its assertion of the unusual circumstance exception, this exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, as no exception applies and because the duty to read and reject coverage falls on Plaintiff, it cannot hold Defendant liable for failing to procure wind damage coverage for the Glynn Avenue location. Construing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that the undisputed facts show that Plaintiff failed to examine the policy quote and see the readily apparent information that the Glynn Avenue restaurant did not have wind damage coverage and reject the policy on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Breach of Fiduciary Duty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based on the foregoing discussion and Plaintiff's duty to read the policy quote and reject the policy, Plaintiff's claim for breach of fiduciary duty fails as a matter of law. Even accepting as true Plaintiff's assertion that Defendant was acting as its agent in procuring insurance coverage, Plaintiff fails to present evidence showing that Defendant breached any duty as a fiduciary to Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirby v.

For this same reason, Defendant did not breach a fiduciary duty to Plaintiff \"[b]y failing to notify Plaintiff that such coverage had not been obtained.\" Dkt. No. 12 \u00b6 36. Rather, Defendant did notify plaintiff explicitly that \"Location 4\" had no such coverage and attached the full policy quote which showed, plainly and unambiguously, that \"Location 4-1\" was listed as the Glynn Avenue location.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Plaintiff's claim under Count One for breach of fiduciary duty fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

First Chatham Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461978\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/338/48/\">\n    338 Ga.App. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461978\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/338/48/\">\n    789 S.E.2d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 308 (2016) (citations omitted). \"[J]ustifiable reliance is an essential element of a claim asserting negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461978\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/338/48/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, Plaintiff fails to provide any evidence that Defendant supplied false information or that Plaintiff reasonably relied upon any alleged false information. Defendant met its summary judgment burden by asserting that no genuine dispute of material fact exists for this claim because it did not provide false information to Plaintiff and Plaintiff did not reasonably rely on that allegedly false information. In response, Plaintiff states that \"Georgia courts have also held that insured may assert negligent-misrepresentation claims in cases similar to the present.\" Dkt. No. 34 at 13. Plaintiff then proceeds to cite three Georgia cases where parties brought negligent misrepresentation claims against insurance agents. Plaintiff concludes that \"[i]n light of that caselaw, this Court should hold that Brazell Holdings has stated a negligent-misrepresentation claim sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The Court cannot so hold without Plaintiff showing some evidence of the Defendant supplying false information and that the Plaintiff reasonably relied on that allegedly false information. Plaintiff points the Court to no such evidence, and therefore it fails to meet its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that the evidence shows that Defendant's email summarizing the policy quote was not false because it accurately stated what was within the policy quote-Location 4, the Glynn Avenue location, did not have wind\n   coverage. The Court also finds that even if the email contained false information, Plaintiff did not reasonably rely on that information because the wind exclusion for the Glynn Avenue location was readily apparent in the policy quote. In other words, Plaintiff did not perform its due diligence to look through the policy and determine if the wind exclusion was for the correct store.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461978\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/338/48/\">\n    789 S.E.2d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]o show justifiable reliance, the plaintiff must establish that he exercised his duty of due diligence.\"). After requesting wind coverage on all stores, being told that one store did not have wind coverage should at least warrant looking to the specific policy quote coverages for that specific store, but here, Plaintiff failed to observe the readily apparent information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461978\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/338/48/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explain that although the question of \"[w]hether a plaintiff could have protected itself by the exercise of due diligence is generally a question for the jury ... an exception occurs when a plaintiff cannot offer evidence that he exercised his duty of due diligence to ascertain the truth and to avoid damage.\" (quotations and citations omitted)). Therefore, without a showing of supplying false information or reasonable reliance, Plaintiff's claim for negligent misrepresentation must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In this case, Plaintiff had a duty to read and reject an insurance policy that did not meet its needs. The information that Plaintiff asserts it was unaware of-that the Glynn Avenue restaurant did not have wind damage coverage-was clearly indicated in the policy quote that it had in its possession from the email sent by Defendant. Plaintiff had a duty to read and reject that quote, but it failed to do so. In light of that fact, Plaintiff cannot now hold Defendant liable under any of these claims. Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion to Amend/Correct Response, dkt. no. 36, and Defendant's Converted Motion for Summary Judgment, dkt. no. 8, are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   , this 20th day of March, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court also\n    <strong>\n     GRANTS\n    </strong>\n    Plaintiff's Motion to Amend/Correct its Response, dkt. no. 36, and considers that amended response in this Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Plaintiff explains that while Wells Fargo Insurance actually served as the broker for the transaction at issue, USI has since acquired Wells Fargo Insurance. Dkt. No. 34 at 1. Both parties refer to the Defendant as \"USI,\" and the Court will do so as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    As the Court converted Defendant's Motion to Dismiss to a Motion for Summary Judgment, the Parties' initial statements of facts are based largely on the Complaint. The Court will cite to the Complaint for some facts recognizing that it must read all facts at this stage in the light most favorable to Plaintiff and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Defendant's account manager, Virginia Dalton, swore that the application's listing of Brown &amp; Brown and LH Brenner, Inc. Insurance in addition to Defendant, indicated that Plaintiff submitted applications to those other brokers as well. Dkt. No. 33-1 \u00b6 5. The application itself says \"[o]nce complete save the document and e-mail the document to all three of the Gold Standard Brokers listed\" next to the names of Brown &amp; Brown, LH Brenner, Inc. Insurance, and USI. Dkt. No. 33-2 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    However, when Defendant's account manager, Virginia Dalton, asked for updated loss runs for the stores, Ms. Bell responded by using the Subway Store numbers \"29069\" and \"51234.\" Dkt. No. 33-5 at 2-3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    A third exception exists where \"an agent intentionally misrepresents the existence or extent of coverage.\"\n    <em>\n     Traina\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4115198\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/289/833/\">\n     658 S.E.2d at 464\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, Plaintiff did not raise this exception, and the Court finds that it is inapplicable here as there is no evidence that Defendant intentionally misrepresented the insurance coverage in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Plaintiff requests that if the Court rules against it on this issue that it be given more opportunity to conduct discovery on this issue because counsel for Plaintiff \"believes that USI (or, more accurately, Wells Fargo Insurance) must have undergone some sort of selection process and likely made representations concerning its level of expertise in order to be approved as a 'Gold Star' broker.\" Dkt. No. 34 at 8. The Court declines Plaintiff's request because more discovery on that issue will not change the Court's finding. First, whether or not Subway corporate chose Wells Fargo Insurance through a selection process because Wells Fargo Insurance potentially held itself out as an expert has no bearing on whether Plaintiff, the Subway franchisee, in this instance relied on Defendant's discretion in deciding what insurance to procure in this case. Second, for the reasons stated below, even if this exception applied, Plaintiff still had a duty to read because the store location numbers and the wind exclusion for the Glynn Avenue location were readily apparent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Also, the fact that Plaintiff's employee emailed Defendant's account manager asking to be directed to where food contamination coverage was included in the policy quote does not make the wind coverage exclusion for the Glynn Avenue location any less readily apparent. Not only was the exclusion highlighted in the email, but if Plaintiff's employee had a question about that coverage, like she did for the food contamination, she could have looked at the policy quote and emailed Defendant's account manager for clarification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    However, it is unlikely that any fiduciary relationship existed in this case because Plaintiff did not give Defendant the discretion to decide what type of insurance to select.
