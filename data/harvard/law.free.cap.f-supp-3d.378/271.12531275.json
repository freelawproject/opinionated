(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Motion to Dismiss,\" Dkt. No. 20.) For the reasons set forth below, OCC's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED as to Counts I and II and GRANTED as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vullo is the Superintendent of DFS, which is the New York State agency charged with enforcing the state's insurance, banking, and financial services laws. DFS has licensed 229 state and international banks, and the agency also regulates and supervises approximately 600 non-bank financial services firms. In total, DFS supervises approximately $ 7 trillion in assets across the insurance, banking, and financial services industries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   OCC is an office of the United States Department of the Treasury that is charged with regulating and supervising federally chartered national banks. Otting is the United States Comptroller of the Currency, a role for which he was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 27, 2017. In his official capacity, Otting is thus the chief regulatory and administrative officer of OCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The National Bank Act (\"NBA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   codified at 12 U.S.C. Section 21 et seq., vests OCC with authority to charter national banks. To receive a national charter, a bank must satisfy certain prerequisites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   If, upon a careful examination of the facts so reported, and of any other facts which may come to the knowledge of the Comptroller, whether by means of a special commission appointed by him for the purpose of inquiring into the condition of such association, or otherwise, it appears that such association is lawfully entitled to commence the business of banking, the Comptroller shall give to such association a certificate, under his hand and official seal, that such association has complied with all the provisions required to be complied with before commencing the business of banking, and that such association is authorized to commence such business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2027\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Section 27\"). A national bank -- i.e., one that is chartered by OCC -- is granted\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking; by discounting and negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt; by receiving deposits; by buying and selling exchange, coin, and bullion; by loaning money on personal security; and by obtaining, issuing, and circulating notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2024\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Seventh) (\" Section 24 (Seventh)\"). OCC also promulgates regulations regarding national banks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2003, OCC amended its regulations to allow it to issue SPNB charters -- i.e., to charter \"a special purpose bank that limits its activities to fiduciary activities or to any other activities within the business of banking.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (1) (i) (\" Section 5.20(e)(1)\" or \"the Regulation\"). Under Section 5.20(e)(1), a so-called special purpose bank \"that conducts activities other than fiduciary activities must conduct at least one of the following core banking functions: Receiving deposits, paying checks, or lending money.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Section 5.20(e) (1) makes an entity eligible for an SPNB charter if it conducts \"at least one\" of those three functions, it contemplates that an SPNB charter could go to an entity that pays checks and/or lends money, but does not receive deposits. The current action concerns whether OCC can lawfully issue SPNB charters pursuant to Section 5.20(e) (1) to fin tech companies that do not receive deposits (\"non-depository fin tech companies\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the Complaint, OCC first began considering whether to accept applications for SPNB charters from non-depository fintech companies in March 2016. At that time, OCC published a white paper in which it \"identifie[d] the impact of fast-paced developments in financial services technology as a much needed subject of regulatory inquiry.\" (Complaint \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-1.) As recounted in the Complaint, OCC subsequently took numerous steps towards deciding whether to issue SPNB charters to non-depository fin tech companies, including: publishing an additional white paper; receiving comments opposing the agency's white paper; issuing a response to the comments on the white paper; and issuing a draft supplement to the Comptroller's Licensing Manual, titled \"Evaluating Charter Applications from Financial Technology Companies.\" Furthermore, OCC reached out to fin tech companies to discuss the possibility of issuing SPNB charters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 31, 2018, OCC announced its allegedly final decision to issue SPNB charters -- namely, OCC, acting under the authority of Section 5.20(e) (1), announced that it would begin to accept and review applications for SPNB charters submitted by non-depository fin tech companies (the \"Fin tech Charter Decision\"). According to DFS, the Fin tech Charter Decision undermines DFS's -- and therefore New York's -- ability to regulate and protect its financial markets and consumers by \"exempt[ing]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ... new fin tech chartered entities from existing federal standards of safety and soundness, liquidity and capitalization.\" (Complaint \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DFS asserts three counts seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Count I asks the Court to find that the Fin tech Charter Decision was unlawful because it exceeded OCC's authority under the NBA, to set that decision aside, and to enjoin OCC from taking any further actions to implement its provisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 55-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Count II asks the Court to find Section 5.20(e)(1) \"null and void\" because OCC exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the Regulation, to set it aside, and to enjoin OCC from taking any further actions to implement its provisions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 59-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Finally, Count III asks the Court to find that the Fin tech Charter Decision violates the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (the \"Tenth Amendment\") because it creates a conflict with state law that Congress did not authorize, and to \"declare it null and void.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 63-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This litigation is not DFS's first action challenging the Fin tech Charter Decision: it previously contested OCC's authority to issue SPNB charters to non-depository fin tech companies by filing a lawsuit in this district on May 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vullo v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. No. 17 Civ. 3574 (S.D.N.Y.). On December 12, 2017, that action was dismissed without prejudice by the Honorable Naomi Reice Buchwald, who granted OCC's motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) (\" Rule 12(b)(1)\") for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because, in her determination, the action was not yet ripe for adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vullo v.

Dec. 12, 2017) (hereafter, \"\n   <em>\n    Vullo I\n   </em>\n   \"). Specifically, Judge Buchwald determined that OCC -- at that time -- \"ha[d] not yet determined whether it will issue SPNB charters to fin tech companies, nor ha[d] it received or reviewed any applications for any such charter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. As a result, Judge Buchwald found both that DFS had not suffered an injury-in-fact and that DFS's claims were not ripe for adjudication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Following OCC's July 31, 2018 announcement, which the Complaint characterizes as \"constitut[ing] the agency's final decision to proceed with the unlawful Fin\n   tech Charter [Decision],\" DFS filed the Complaint in this action on September 14, 2018. (Complaint \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   OCC wrote to the Court, requesting on November 16, 2018 that the Court either endorse the parties' proposed briefing schedule for OCC's contemplated motion to dismiss or schedule a pre-motion conference regarding the contemplated motion. (\"November 16 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 13.) OCC also set forth the bases for its contemplated motion to dismiss the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DFS responded to the November 16 Letter, joining in OCC's request for a pre-motion conference regarding \"not only the Defendants' baseless motion to dismiss, but Plaintiff's anticipated motion for a preliminary injunction.\" (\"November 26 Letter,\" Dkt. No. 15, at 1.) DFS also set forth the bases both for opposing OCC's contemplated motion to dismiss and for its contemplated motion for injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court held a telephone conference on December 10, 2018, during which it directed the parties to update the Court regarding a motion schedule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Minute Entry for 12/10/2018.) On December 14, 2018, OCC again wrote to the Court with a proposed schedule for its motion to dismiss, and further notified the Court that the parties had failed to reach an agreement regarding DFS's contemplated motion for a preliminary injunction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thereafter, on February 12, 2019, the Court held a telephone conference with the parties during which it directed them to submit a proposed motion schedule. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Minute Entry for 2/12/2019.) The Court subsequently So-Ordered the parties' agreed-upon briefing schedule for OCC's motion to dismiss the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   OCC now moves to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\" Rule 12(b) (6)\"), for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss; \"Defs.' Mem.,\" Dkt. No. 21; Dkt. No. 22.) It first argues that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the action on several grounds: (1) DFS lacks standing because it has not suffered an injury-in-fact, as required by Article III of the United States Constitution; (2) this action is not yet ripe for adjudication because OCC has not taken any action to accept, review, or approve applications for SPNB charters for fin tech companies; and (3) the challenge to the 2003 amendment to Section 5.20(e)(1) is time-barred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 7-11.) OCC further argues that, if the Court reaches the merits of the dispute, the Complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted because (1) the statutory term \"business of banking\" is ambiguous and, as a result, OCC's reasonable interpretation of the term is entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   deference; and (2) neither Section 5.20(e)(1) nor any SPNB charter potentially issued under the Regulation violates the Tenth Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   DFS opposes the Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action and that the Complaint adequately states a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Pl.'s Opp'n,\" Dkt. No. 25.) DFS first argues that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the action on several grounds: (1) DFS, as an agency of New\n   York State, has standing to challenge the Fin tech Charter Decision by reason of DFS's allegation of an injury-in-fact; (2) this action is ripe for adjudication because OCC decided on July 31, 2018 to begin accepting applications for SPNB charters from fin tech companies; and (3) the Complaint is timely because the causes of action accrued on July 31, 2018, and, moreover, the intermediate action and reopening doctrines apply to DFS's challenge to Section 5.20(e)(1). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-9.) DFS next argues that the Complaint states a sufficient claim for relief because (1) Congress' intended the statutory term \"business of banking\" to require deposit-receiving; (2) OCC's interpretation of the term \"business of banking\" is unreasonable and therefore not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference; and (3) the Complaint alleges a valid Tenth Amendment claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In reply in further support of the Motion to Dismiss, OCC argues that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because DFS has not suffered an injury-in-fact. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Defs.' Reply,\" Dkt. No. 26.) Moreover, OCC contends that the harms alleged in the Complaint are speculative because OCC has not yet received an application for, nor granted, an SPNB charter to a non-depository fin tech company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.) OCC also repeats its argument that a facial challenge to Section 5.20(e)(1) is untimely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) OCC further argues that the Complaint fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted because Section 5.20(e) (1) reflects a reasonable interpretation of the term \"business of banking\" and therefore is entitled to judicial deference. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-9.) Finally, OCC asserts that the issuance of SPNB charters under Section 5.20(e) (1) would comport with the Tenth Amendment because OCC's envisioned SPNB charters would not supersede traditional state bank chartering authority. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     JUSTICIABILITY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Article III, Section 2, of the United States Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies\" -- a requirement which is satisfied only where a plaintiff has \"standing\" to commence an action in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Sprint Commc'ns Co., L.P. v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"January 2017 DFS Letter,\" Dkt. No. 1-3, at 1-2 (\"States Already Regulate Nonbank Financial Services Companies.\"); Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) DFS alleges that the Fintech Charter Decision upsets the balance of the dual banking system because it extends federal banking law's blanket preemption to numerous areas currently subject to New York laws and supervision. DFS alleges two distinct harms that follow from OCC's actions. First, New York citizens will suffer by losing \"critical financial protections\" that New York banking law and regulatory oversight currently provides. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 45-49.) Specifically, DFS alleges that the removal of state regulations impacts the agency's regulation of \"non-depository money transmitters,\" of payday lenders and their \"usurious trade,\" as well as of the state's safety and soundness standards for non-depository institutions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Second, DFS will suffer direct economic harm because its \"operating expenses are funded by assessments levied by the agency upon New York State licensed institutions\" and the Fintech Charter Decision will deprive DFS of the revenues from future assessments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   These alleged threats to New York and DFS\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   implicate the type of sovereign and\n   direct interests common in cases where states have standing to contest agency action. Unlike the states in Mellon or\n   <em>\n    Cuccinelli\n   </em>\n   , DFS is not merely seeking to protect New York citizens from obligations created by federal law. Rather, like the preemption cases of\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wyoming\n   </em>\n   , New York provides a comprehensive regulatory system for non-depository fintech companies -- a system allegedly threatened by OCC's course of action at issue in this case (i.e., the Fintech Charter Decision). Further, DFS's alleged anticipated financial losses are analogous to the financial harms alleged in\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   regarding the cost of issuing additional driver's licenses. The statutory claims in this action also fall within the\n   <em>\n    parens\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    patriae\n   </em>\n   framework of standing asserted in\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   permitting states to vindicate the congressional will when it comes to federal agencies violating statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The threats to New York's sovereignty are so clear that OCC does not even mention, let alone contest, the state's interests. Instead, OCC focuses exclusively on constitutional and prudential ripeness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 7-10; Defs.' Reply at 2-4.) Yet, even those arguments are necessarily hamstrung by OCC's failure to address the interaction between state standing and ripeness in this complicated area of law, especially in light of\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts v. EPA\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Elec.

The state standing cases discussed above repeatedly make clear that early action by state plaintiffs to combat concerns arising from unlawful federal agency action can be warranted. Thus, a court permitted Oregon expeditiously to challenge -- Oregon sued only one day after the guidance was issued -- the United States Attorney General's' non-final determination opining on whether assisting suicide was a \"legitimate medical purpose,\" despite the lack of any specific reference to Oregon's law or any threatened enforcement actions.\n   <em>\n    Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9449184\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/192/1077/#p1087\">\n    192 F.

Similarly, even though Texas brought suit only two weeks after the Department of Homeland Security issued a memorandum regarding staying deportation proceedings for certain immigrants, Texas established standing based on the financial burden of issuing driver's licenses to additional individuals, even though such issuance required the \"intervening act of a third party\" and case law was unclear whether Texas would be required to issue licenses to those immigrants.\n   <em>\n    Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227854\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/733/#p748\">\n    787 F.3d at 748, 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a result of the Fintech Charter Decision, New York State's regulations for over \"600 non-bank financial services firms\" are all at risk of becoming null and void. (Complaint \u00b6 10.) Of course, certain steps, namely the application for, and then the granting of, an SPNB charter must occur before a fintech firm can flout New York's laws. But those steps do not stymie DFS's standing. For both steps, DFS benefits from the supposition that the government enforces and acts on its recent, non-moribund laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hedges v. Obama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068749\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/170/#p197\">\n    724 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (2d Cir. 2013). Specifically, DFS alleges that OCC has invited fintech companies to its offices to discuss SPNB charters, potentially indicating at least\n   some demand for, and interest in, such charters -- an allegation that the Court takes as true for the purposes of this motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 42.) This alleged interest, coupled with the common-sense observation that OCC spent numerous years developing the Fintech Charter Decision and coordinating its creation with other federal banking regulators (as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part I), indicates that OCC has the clear expectation of issuing SPNB charters. In fact, DFS points to comments Otting made in the press indicating that OCC is in informal discussions with numerous fintech companies for expected SPNB charters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   November 26 Letter at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In light of these expectations, DFS has demonstrated a \"substantial risk that the harm will occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, based on DFS's allegations about the threats of federal preemption and the unique characteristics of the dual banking system, DFS faces the current risk that entities may, at any moment, leave its supervision to seek greener pastures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 2017 DFS Letter at 2-3, 3 n.2 (discussing the benefit to a bank that switched from state to federal oversight and thus avoided the state's special supervision imposed in light of prior failures).) Such risks will color all agency action until this dispute is resolved. And such risks will force DFS to incur costs now to \"mitigate or avoid\" the harms that currently unlawful lending practices might bring under OCC's supervision, for example.\n   <em>\n    Clapper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    568 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   414 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court is not persuaded that such considerations exist here. Chiefly, the Court doubts that additional facts are necessary, or would even be helpful, to resolve the discrete legal question at issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    National Org. for Marriage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864425\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/682/#p691\">\n    714 F.3d at 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For instance, the identity and specific services offered by a given non-depository fintech applicant for an SPNB charter are irrelevant to the Court's determination of whether the Fintech Charter Decision exceeds OCC's authority under the NBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   If anything, the very narrowness of the question raised in this action supports answering it before a fintech company wastes its and OCC's time and money obtaining an SPNB charter. Although the narrowness of the legal issue has not changed since\n   <em>\n    Vullo I\n   </em>\n   , critically, OCC has taken certain small but important steps towards the issuance of SPNB charters since Judge Buchwald's decision. For example, OCC's current Comptroller continued to pursue the SPNB charter program that his predecessor began in 2016. Then, OCC finalized its eighteen-page licensing manual for \"Considering Charter Applications from Financial Technology Companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-13.) Finally, on July 31, 2018, OCC announced its \"decision\" to \"accept[ ] applications for national bank charters from nondepository financial technology (fintech) companies\" after \"extensive outreach ... over a two year-period.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-11.) Before publication of the final materials related to the Fintech Charter Decision, OCC could have made accommodations that would have accounted for the states' interests outlined in the comment letters, justifying OCC's earlier\n   concern for ripeness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vullo I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206512245\">\n    2017 WL 6512245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. However, such concerns no longer exist with the final rules in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that DFS has sufficiently established standing to pursue its statutory and constitutional claims against OCC at this time, and that the claims are ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    TIMELINESS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Apart from its jurisdictional challenges, OCC argues that DFS's claims are untimely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 10-11.) Specifically, OCC argues that, insofar as DFS's claims present a facial challenge to Section 5.20(e) (1), such claims had to be raised within six years of the rule's final promulgation -- a window that closed over nine years ago.

In addition to the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , DFS also points the Court to the reopening doctrine, a longstanding principle applied by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which permits courts to review recent agency action based on prior agency interpretations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Opp'n at 8 (citing\n   <em>\n    CTIA-Wireless Ass'n v.

Since the adoption of Section 5.20(e) (1), OCC concededly has never chartered a national bank that does not take deposits, nor has it pointed to guidance prior to the Fintech Charter Decision regarding what that process might be. Finally, when OCC began the process of seeking feedback on SPNB charters, numerous banks raised concerns about OCC's reliance on Section 5.20(e) (1), concerns to which OCC directly responded in its \"Summary of Comments and Explanatory Statement\" about issuing SPNB charters to fintech companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-8 at 14-15.) The Court also considers application of the reopening doctrine especially appropriate in light of the persuasive reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Responsible Regulation\n   </em>\n   , which explained the need to toll the judicial review period for certain agency actions when the challenging\n   party could not have brought a ripe claim any earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879349,5874918\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/102/\">\n    684 F.3d at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   However, the Court need not delve too deeply into these issues because OCC has not carried its burden as to timeliness. Typically, defendants bear the burden of proof for affirmative defenses such as timeliness, and conversely plaintiffs need not plead to address time bars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

Rather, on the two occasions that OCC began issuing national bank charters to a type of non-depository institution, Congress first amended the NBA explicitly to authorize OCC to do so. First, in 1978, Congress amended Section 27 to allow OCC to charter non-depository \"trust banks\" as national banks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978, Pub.

Second, in 1982, Congress amended Section 27 to allow OCC to charter non-depository \"bankers' banks\" as national banks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, Pub.

If those Congresses had a different understanding of the prerequisites for a national bank charter, it is unclear why they would have acted to confer upon OCC an authority they believed OCC already possessed. To be sure, the actions and views of later Congresses are not necessarily dispositive of an earlier-enacted statutory phrase's meaning, and the Court is mindful not to overweigh anti-surplusage arguments -- for benign statutory redundancies \"are not unusual events.\"\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Nat'l Bank v.

Nonetheless, the NBA's 1978 and 1982 amendments are illuminating on the point at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court is also guided by the canon of construction under which the plausibility of an agency interpretation of statutory text that would confer new power upon that agency bears inverse relation to the size of that putative power and the belatedness of the putative discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utility Air\n   </em>\n   , 573 U.S. at 324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20S.%20Ct.%202427\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When an agency claims to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate a significant portion of the American economy, [courts] typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Here, OCC claimed the power to charter non-depository institutions as national banks in 2003, some 140 years after the adoption of the statutory language that is that power's putative source. The Court finds that a delay of that length provides substantial grounds to cast doubt on OCC's interpretation. This conclusion is only strengthened by what DFS alleges is the impact of this interpretation (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11-12, 35, 43-49) on at least \"a significant portion\" of the national economy,\n   <em>\n    Utility Air\n   </em>\n   , 573 U.S. at 324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20S.%20Ct.%202427\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as on nationwide banking regulation and the proper balance of federal and state functions and powers in our dual system of government and dual-banking structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As one instance of the consequential effects of issuing SPNB charters to non-depository fintech companies, the Court notes that such action would entail federal preemption of the state banking regulatory scheme nationwide as it relates to such fintech entities. Such dramatic disruption of federal-state relationships in the banking industry occasioned by a federal regulatory agency lends weight to the argument that it represents exercise of authority that exceeds what Congress may have contemplated in passing the NBA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

Whether non-depository institutions can qualify as national banks appears to be \"a question of deep 'economic and political significance' that is central to this statutory scheme,\" such that the Court infers that, because of its fundamental regulatory, legislative, and constitutional implications, \"had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly.\"\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.

While perhaps of limited weight, the Court takes note of them as additional data points that further undermine OCC's interpretation. First, the Federal Reserve Act requires national banks to obtain membership in the Federal Reserve System and insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20222\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But a national bank must be \"engaged in the business of receiving deposits\" to obtain insurance under the FDIA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201815\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Chartering national banks that do not receive deposits -- which are ineligible for insurance under the FDIA and therefore unable to join the Federal Reserve System -- would introduce an anomaly into this scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Second, the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) requires companies to obtain prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring a \"bank.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201842\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The BHCA defines a \"bank\" as a deposit-receiving institution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201841\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A), (B). Chartering non-depository national banks would create an exception to the BHCA's regulatory scheme without formally amending the statute: there would be banks in the marketplace that could be acquired without Federal Reserve Board approval. Even OCC implicitly concedes the strained and anomalous role a non-depository bank would play in this statutory scheme, as its licensing manual attempts to ensure that certain FDIA provisions -- which are inapplicable to SPNBs -- nonetheless would apply through specific SPNB chartering requirements in order \"to achieve the goals of a particular statute or regulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-13 at 12 n.35.) The Court finds that these points cast doubt on the notion that OCC could charter non-depository national banks without a further act of Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Turning to OCC's main counterarguments, the Court is not persuaded by the point based on\n   <em>\n    Independent Community Bankers Association of South Dakota, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1704904,4330282\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/820/428/\">\n    820 F.2d 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1987). OCC reads this case to support the proposition that an institution can be in the \"business of banking\" even if it does \"not exercise the full complement of banking powers.\" (Defs.' Mem. at 15.) But even if, as the D.C. Circuit declares in that case, a national bank's \"activities\" may be lawfully \"[r]estricted ... to less than the full scope of statutory authority\" unless that restriction \"undermines the safety and soundness of the bank or interferes with the bank's ability to fulfill its statutory obligations,\" -- and the Court is not certain this test correctly restates the law\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- the proposition that deposit-receiving, specifically, is optional, does not follow.\n   <em>\n    Independent Cmty.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. at 13-15.) It is concededly the case that in\n   <em>\n    NationsBank\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found the phrase \"business of banking\" in Section 24 (Seventh) ambiguous as to whether it encompasses -- in addition to the five enumerated activities (which include deposit-receiving) -- the sale of annuities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   513 U.S. at 256-57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1330761\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/251/#p256\">\n    115 S.Ct. 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that OCC's resolution of that ambiguity was reasonable and therefore deserved judicial deference).

To be sure, Congress has previously chosen to permit OCC to charter non-depository national banks in the specific cases of trust banks and bankers' banks,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2027\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1), and DFS does not contest the constitutionality of those legislative choices. Rather, DFS claims that OCC has violated the Tenth Amendment because federal law preempts state law only when \"Congress has clearly expressed its intent,\" and here \"Congress did not authorize OCC to charter fintech companies that provide non-depository financial services;\" therefore, DFS contends, Congress \"did not intend to preempt state regulation of such entities.\" (Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.) Hence DFS's own pleading indicates that the operative question is not whether the federal government has the power to take the action challenged in this case, but whether Congress has, in fact, exercised that power. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PL's Opp'n at 25 (premising Tenth Amendment claim on the contention that Section 5.20(e) (1) lacks \"legislative authorization\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   For this reason, the Court finds that DFS fails to state a Tenth Amendment claim.
