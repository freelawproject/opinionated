(Docket No. 17.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the FDIC-R's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Doral Bank (\"Doral\") loaned Ben\u00edtez $ 206,400.00 to purchase a property in Gurabo, Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 13, Ex. 1 at p. 56.) Ben\u00edtez defaulted on the loan, prompting Doral to commence a foreclosure action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, Caguas Division, on April 7, 2014 (hereinafter the \"foreclosure action\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doral Bank v.

The Court of First Instance granted Doral's motion for summary judgment, ordering Ben\u00edtez to pay \"$ 180.58.88 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in principal, plus interests [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] at 6.950% annually starting October 1, 2013, as well as the current and future interests [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] accrued beginning on that date until the debt is paid in full.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 45. In the event that Ben\u00edtez failed to comply with the revised payment schedule, the Court of First Instance ordered the \"Marshalls [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] to sell the mortgaged property ... and to apply to the debt monies received from the sale.\" Id.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 31, 2014, Ben\u00edtez commenced an action against Doral, asserting that Doral \"fraudulently alleged that it was the holder by endorsement of the Original PROMISSORY NOTE, which it was not, which constitutes fraud on the Court\" (hereinafter the \"fraud causes of action\").
