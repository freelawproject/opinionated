Plaintiff's Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about April 5, 2016, plaintiff contacted the Fund because no contributions were being submitted on his behalf by District Lodge 1 to the Fund, and he believed that contributions should have been made. AR10. After looking into the matter, the Fund notified plaintiff on September 13, 2016 that he was not a participant in the IAM National Pension Fund or National Pension Plan. AR174. On October 21, 2016, plaintiff requested an appeal of that determination. AR175.

On December 20, 2016, the Fund notified plaintiff of its decision to defer determination pending additional research, and informed plaintiff that it has \"referred this matter to District Lodge 1.\" AR240. The purpose of the referral was to ascertain District Lodge 1's understanding of what job classifications it intended to cover as a Contributing Employer to the Fund under the Participation Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523994\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/92/#p96\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To that end, the Committee reached out to Anthony Armideo, the Directing Business Representative of District Lodge 1.

What job classifications did District Lodge 1 intend to contribute on behalf of as a Contributing Employer during its time as a Contributing Employer to the Fund, in accordance with the attached Participation Agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   2. What job classifications of employees at District Lodge 1 were non-collectively bargained employees of District Lodge 1 during its time as a Contributing Employer to the Fund?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   3. Were any job classifications at District Lodge 1 not employees of District Lodge 1 during its time as a Contributing Employer to the Fund? For example, were any persons or job classifications brought out to District Lodge 1 on lost time? Or were certain job classifications employees\n   of another organization, but District 1 served a pass through for the purpose of pay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   4. Please provide any documents that assist in answering these questions, including but not limited to meeting minutes, notes, letters or email correspondence, Lodge 1 records including payroll records, and the like.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   AR 242.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Armideo responded on January 6, 2017, stating that District Lodge 1 never did, and did not then, intend to contribute to the Fund on behalf of the District Lodge 1 Organizer position. AR258-64. In coming to this conclusion, he examined the history of the Organizer position, prior and current Participation Agreements, past meeting minute records, and payroll audit records of District Lodge 1.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523994\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/92/#p96\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All of these records were attached to his response and submitted to the Appeals Committee for consideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265-312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On January 26, 2017, the Committee met again to consider plaintiff's appeal, and based upon the information presented and the supporting documentation attached to Armideo's letter, the Committee voted to deny plaintiff's appeal. AR316. Plaintiff was notified of the decision on January 31, 2017. Specifically, Tierney wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In support of its position, District Lodge 1 provided District Lodge meeting minutes and various motions dating back to 1978. Those documents evidence that the positions for which District Lodge 1 intended to contribute extended only to Business Representatives (\n   <em>\n    alternatively described as Business Agents\n   </em>\n   ) and the Secretary. Those documents also reflect that the Organizer position was never included among the class of employees for which contributions were intended to be made - whether during, or after your tenure as the District Organizer. District Lodge 1 also provided associated participation agreements. To the extent that the participation agreements include language suggesting that contributions were to be made for all employees other than those in a bargaining unit which has negotiated other pension benefits, there are factors that militate against a strict reading of that provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   First, the [P]articipation Agreement is a boilerplate agreement that was not drafted by District Lodge l. It is a form agreement that is provided to contributing employers such as District Lodge 1. Since District Lodge 1 did not draft any of the participation agreements, it follows that the agreements should not be construed against it. Moreover, the documents illustrate that District Lodge 1 signed separate Participation Agreements for the Business Representative position and the Secretary position. Had District Lodge 1 intended for the \"\n   <em>\n    all employees\n   </em>\n   \" language to apply to it, it would not have utilized separate participation agreements for the business representative and the office secretary positions. One agreement for all covered positions would have sufficed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, the documents do reflect your attendance in at least some of the Lodge meetings where the IAM National pension plan was discussed, including the pension rate for the Business Representative position. Finally, District Lodge 1 presented two payroll audit reports dated July 10, 2007\n   <em>\n    (auditing the period of January 2004 through December 2006)\n   </em>\n   and May 23, 2014\n   <em>\n    (auditing the period of January 2011 through December 2013).\n   </em>\n   Both reports found no discrepancies for the audit periods, including audit periods [when] you were employed as the District Lodge 1 organizer. You have not presented any documentary evidence\n   such as an employment offer letter or employment agreement that commits District Lodge 1 to provide a pension through the Fund. In conclusion, none of the documentary evidence presented specifically and explicitly indicates that the Organizer position was intended by District Lodge 1 to be included in positions for which contributions to the Fund were to be made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   AR317-18 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On June 26, 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint in this Court against the Fund and District Lodge 1 asserting ERISA violations and requesting recovery of his benefits.

Here, the authority to determine eligibility was delegated to the Appeals Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On December 20, 2016, after an initial meeting where the Committee determined that it needed more information to evaluate plaintiff's appeal, AR239, the Committee sent a letter to Anthony Armideo of District Lodge 1 requesting additional information to ascertain its intention as to who would be covered under the Participation Agreements. AR240. Plaintiff takes the position that the request for information was an unauthorized sub-delegation of the powers allocated to the Appeals Committee. Pl.'s Mem. at 7. The Fund maintains that it did not transfer its authority to the union; rather, it sought the input from District Lodge 1 because it needed additional information, and then it evaluated the information provided and came to its own final decision. Fund's Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 33] (\"Fund's Reply\") at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court agrees that no sub-delegation occurred. In responding to the Committee's letter, Armideo provided a number of documents and responses to questions posed by the Appeals Committee. AR258-312. On January 26, 2017, the Appeals Committee convened a new meeting at which they considered plaintiff's appeal. AR313. According to the contemporaneous records, at that meeting, the Fund's Executive Director \"reviewed the facts, including the material provided to the Committee by District Lodge No. 1, with the committee. After discussion, [a] motion was made, seconded and adopted to deny Mr. Anthony's appeal.\" AR316.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   After the decision was made, the Fund's Executive Director, Rick Tierney, advised plaintiff that the Appeals Committee had denied his appeal and did not consider him an eligible participant in the Fund. AR317-19. Tierney explained that the Committee reviewed the documents submitted by District Lodge 1, and it found that they showed that District Lodge 1 did not intend to include Organizers as a job classification covered by the Participation Agreements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR317-18. The Committee also considered the fact that plaintiff did \"not present[ ] any documentary evidence such as an employment offer letter or employment agreement that commits District Lodge 1 to provide a pension through the Fund.\" AR318. The Appeals Committee did not simply adopt the District Lodge 1's findings. Rather, the Committee reviewed the information provided to it by District Lodge 1, evaluated the\n   strength of the evidence, and determined that plaintiff was not entitled to coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court finds that, by merely requesting information from District Lodge 1, the Committee did not delegate its authority to make a determination regarding plaintiff's eligibility. Indeed, it was prudent to request documentation and seek District Lodge 1's input to ascertain whether plaintiff was engaged in \"Covered Employment,\" because the determination of which job classifications are covered depends on what the union intended when it executed the Participation Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Furthermore, the record reflects that District Lodge 1 did not view the request for information as a delegation of decisionmaking authority regarding plaintiff's eligibility. In submitting the information to the Fund, Armideo stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   I hope you agree that the information that I have provided by way of written text above, along with the accompanying attachments[,] support the position of the District Lodge, that the District Lodge Organizer is not now and never has been entitled to have IAMNPF contributions made by the District Lodge on their behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   AR263. Thus, District Lodge 1 plainly understood that the decision would be made by the Appeals Committee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds there was no unauthorized sub-delegation of the Appeals Committee's power to interpret the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    C. It was reasonable for the Appeals Committee to examine extrinsic evidence to determine the meaning of the Participation Agreements.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Plan in this case defines a \"Participant\" as a \"Covered Employee who meets the requirements for participation in this Plan ....\" AR602. The Plan defines \"Covered Employee\" as \"a person employed in Covered Employment.\" AR597. And \"Covered Employment,\" in relevant part, is defined as \"employment in a job classification for which employer contributions are required to this Plan by a written agreement between the Trustees and a Contributing Lodge.\" AR416; AR597. Because the definition of \"Covered Employment\" specifically references a separate written agreement, it is necessary to look outside of the Plan to interpret its terms.\n   <em>\n    US Airways, Inc. v.

The Court agrees. The Appeals Committee considered plaintiff's request twice, first in December 2016 and then again in January 2017. At its first meeting, the Committee acted in a deliberate manner when it determined that it needed additional information before it could render a decision. AR239. The Committee then requested additional information from District Lodge 1, and the union responded with over 50 pages of supporting documentation. AR258-312.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   On January 26, 2017, the Appeals Committee met for a second time to discuss the\n   appeal, and as noted above, the meeting minutes reflect that the Executive Director \"reviewed the facts, including the material[s] provided to the Committee by District Lodge 1, with the Committee.\" AR316. The Committee Members discussed the evidence and voted to deny plaintiff's appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The decision letter details a reasoned and principled determination, based on materials in the record and plaintiff's failure to supply documentation that would support an alternative conclusion. AR317-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition, the Court's review of the underlying materials confirms that the Fund's decision was based on substantial evidence. First, the Fund reviewed the history of the position. When the first Participation Agreement was executed in 1978, there was no position of \"District Lodge Organizer\" (the position that plaintiff held). AR258-59. The only positions at District Lodge 1 were the Secretary and the Business Representative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At a meeting dated December 11, 1978, District Lodge 1 approved a motion that Business Representatives should be allowed to participate in the Fund. AR258; AR268. The Secretary was already participating in the Fund under a separate Participation Agreement. AR259. This supports the Fund's understanding that District Lodge 1, despite the language in the boilerplate Participation Agreement that \"all employees\" would be covered, did not intend to cover all employees, because a vote to cover a particular job classification would have been unnecessary. By virtue of this vote, all of the employees of District Lodge 1 at that time - the Business Representative and the Secretary - were covered by the Participation Agreement. But there was no vote at any subsequent meeting to cover Organizers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Fund also reasoned that because District Lodge 1 did not draft the Participation Agreements - they were form agreements provided to contributing employers - the broad language in the Agreement could not be used against it. This is also reasonable given the fact that there is other language in the Agreements that is inapplicable to District Lodge 1. For example, the Participation Agreements exempts from coverage \"employees in a bargaining unit which has negotiated a Collective Bargaining Agreement,\" but District Lodge 1 never had any employees in a bargaining unit - it only had the Business Representative, Secretary, and Organizer positions. AR261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The record also shows the Organizer position was not consistently filled, and that no Organizer with District Lodge 1 ever had contributions made on his behalf to the Fund. The first District Lodge Organizer, Bill Wheeler, was hired in May of 1988. He worked at District Lodge 1 for two and a half years, and he did not have any contributions made to the fund on his behalf during that time. AR261. District Lodge 1 did not have another Organizer until plaintiff was hired in May 2004. AR261-62. When plaintiff left the position in 2012, District Lodge 1 hired Andy Powell, the current District Lodge Organizer. Powell does not currently have, and never had, any contributions made on his behalf to the Fund. AR262. In 2015, pursuant to an Apprentice Organizer program, Brent Coleman was hired by District Lodge 1 as an Apprentice Organizer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   District Lodge 1 has not made any contributions on his behalf either.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And District Lodge 1 informed the Fund that it was \"never the practice, let alone the intent\" to have Organizers be covered under the pension plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Fund also examined District Lodge 1 meeting minutes and the various motions made at those meetings dating back to 1978. The meeting minutes from May 1999,\n   May 2002, September 2004, and April 2009 show that there were motions made concerning increasing contributions for the Business Representative or Secretary, but never for the Organizer. AR268; AR283; AR295; AR301. Those meeting minutes support the Fund's determination that District Lodge 1 never contributed on behalf of the Organizers, nor did it intend to. The Fund also noted that plaintiff attended some of the meetings where the contributions to the Fund were discussed with respect to the Business Representative position, but the minutes reflect no discussion of his position. AR300; AR302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Furthermore, the Fund considered that for the Business Representative and the Secretary positions, District Lodge 1 executed and signed separate Participation Agreements.
