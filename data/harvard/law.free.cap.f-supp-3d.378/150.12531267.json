(\"WFB\"), First Data Merchant Services, LLC f/k/a First Data Merchant Services Corporation (\"First Data\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"), and certain unknown business entities and individuals, alleging breach of contract, fraud, and negligence in connection with an agreement to provide credit card processing services to Rockaway for use in its beverage sales business. Before the Court is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Tapias serves as the President and CEO of Plaintiff Rockaway, a retail and wholesale provider of beverages opened in August 2014. (Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Dkt. 28, \u00b6 16-17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During a November 2014 visit to another beverage distributor in Yonkers, New York, Plaintiff Tapias met an individual named Lewis Maresca (\"Maresca\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) At this meeting, Maresca told Tapias that he worked as an agent for \"First Data\" and \"Wells Fargo,\" businesses that offered credit card processing services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Tapias advised Maresca that he had recently opened Rockaway and was interested in obtaining credit card processing services to facilitate the business's retail sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, Tapias and Maresca met a second time at Rockaway's place of business in Jamaica, New York on December 12, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) At this second meeting, Plaintiffs allege that Maresca, acting on Defendants' behalf, entered into an implicit (unwritten) agreement (\"the Implied Agreement\") between Rockaway and Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Under the Implied Agreement, Defendants agreed to provide credit card processing services in exchange for a portion of the revenue generated by Plaintiff Rockaway through credit card sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to the Implied Agreement, Plaintiffs allege that at the December 12, 2014 meeting, Tapias also signed a written agreement (\"the Written Agreement\"), on Rockaway's behalf, relating to \"the use and/or provision of credit card processing equipment and/or software.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Plaintiffs have not produced the Written Agreement, as they never received a copy, nor can they recall its terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) According to Plaintiffs, the Written Agreement was never signed by any Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Approximately one week after the December 12, 2014 meeting, Maresca returned to Rockaway's place of business to install credit card processing equipment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) After the equipment was installed,\n   Plaintiffs began establishing accounts with retail customers, including the Jabar Star Deli (\"Jabar\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.) From December 2014 until September 2016, Plaintiffs conducted business using the credit card processing equipment provided by Defendants without incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between September 13, 2016 and September 19, 2016, however, a frequent, large-volume purchaser named Fareek Ali made a series of seven in-person credit card purchases on behalf of Jabar, totaling $ 47,000 (\"the Ali transactions\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.) The Ali transactions were approved by the credit card processing system provided by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59-61.) Despite the apparent approval of the Ali transactions through Defendants' system, Ali's bank later denied payment on the transactions, claiming that they were either erroneous or fraudulent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Tapias then contacted Defendant First Data about the denial of payment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-67.) First Data advised him that Rockaway would not receive payment for the Jabar transactions; rather, First Data was going to charge Rockaway $ 47,000 for the fraudulent transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) On September 28, 2016, First Data informed Rockaway that its account would be closed and First Data would no longer provide credit card services to Rockaway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.) When Tapias attempted to dispute this termination, he was directed to contact Defendants WFMS and WFC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a consequence of terminating Rockaway's account, Defendants reported Plaintiffs to MATCH, a watchlist maintained by Mastercard and utilized by major credit card companies to identify potentially high-risk merchants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.) Plaintiffs became aware of this fact when they attempted to open up a second credit processing account with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"Chase\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Chase initially allowed Rockaway to open an account, but subsequently closed it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In notifying Rockaway that its new account would be closed, Chase informed Plaintiffs that Rockaway had been placed on the MATCH list for \"money laundering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72, 76.) Rockaway also applied to open a credit card processing account with Integrity Payment Systems, LLC, but was similarly denied due to the fact that it was on the MATCH list. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In search of an explanation for why Plaintiffs were placed on the MATCH list, Tapias contacted Defendant WFMS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) In response, Joseph Claybaugh, a WFMS Merchant Service Specialist, informed Tapias that on December 14, 2016 Plaintiffs had been placed on the MATCH list because they had \"forced through\" the Ali transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Claybaugh also informed Tapias that Ali could not be contacted and that Ali's bank was unable to confirm any information about him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following this conversation, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Ali with law enforcement, and criminal charges were later filed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Ali eventually pleaded guilty to petit larceny in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 155.25 and executed a confession of judgment in favor of Plaintiffs in the amount of $ 54,105.57. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Despite obtaining this confession of judgment, Plaintiffs have not collected any funds from Ali. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) Plaintiffs claim they are unable to obtain cost-effective credit card processing services so long as they appear on the MATCH list, and their retail profits have decreased by around $ 5,000 per week due to an inability to process credit card sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.) Mastercard has advised Plaintiffs that only Defendants can initiate a removal of Plaintiffs' names from the MATCH list, but, to date, Defendants have refused to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the initial complaint in this matter in Queens County Supreme Court on December 26, 2017. (Dkt. 1-1, Exhibit A.) Defendants filed a notice of removal on January 26, 2018, invoking this Court's diversity jurisdiction. (Dkt. 1, \u00b6 4.) Defendants filed their first motion to dismiss on February 2, 2018. (Dkt. 5.) In response, Plaintiffs sought, and were granted, leave to file an amended complaint, which was filed on June 26, 2018. (Dkt. 17.) Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss on August 2, 2018. (Defendants' Motion (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), Dkt. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In support of their motion, Defendants submitted an affidavit provided by Lewis Maresca, a sales agent for In-Store Marketing Services, Inc. (Maresca Affidavit (\"Maresca Aff.\"), Dkt. 20-1.) Attached to the Maresca affidavit are two form contracts, both titled \"Merchant Processing Application and Agreement.\" (Dkts. 20-3, 20-4.) The first form contract (\"the Partial Form\") is incomplete and lacks a signature page, but is partially filled out and indicates \"Rockaway Beverage Inc.\" as the subject client. (Partial Form, Dkt. 20-3, at 1.) Maresca's affidavit indicates that he has been unable to locate a complete copy of the Partial Form. (Maresca Aff., \u00b6 5.) The second form contract (\"the Standard Form\") is a blank copy of the same contract as the Partial Form, but with all pages attached, including the signature page. (Standard Form, Dkt. 20-4.) Tapias maintains that the Partial Form was not filled out or executed by him (First Tapias Declaration (\"First Tapias Decl.\"), Dkt. 21-3, \u00b6 2), and he states that he has never seen the Standard Form prior to this litigation (Second Tapias Declaration (\"Second Tapias Decl.\"), Dkt. 25-1, \u00b6 8). (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 (stating that the Partial Form is not the Written Agreement referred to in the SAC).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court held oral argument on Defendants' motion to dismiss on September 20, 2018. Based on the discussion at oral argument, the Court granted Plaintiffs' leave to file a second amended complaint in order to add a claim for fraud and excise any futile claims. (Sept. 20, 2018 Minute Entry.) Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint was filed on October 22, 2018 (SAC, Dkt. 29), and Defendants supplemented their motion to dismiss on November 19, 2018 (Defendants' Supplemental Brief (\"Defs.' Supp.\"), Dkt. 31.) Defendants' motion to dismiss was fully briefed on December 24, 2018.

(SAC, \u00b6 26.) The SAC alleges that the parties operated under the Implied Agreement without dispute for nearly two years. (SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 50-57.) Though Defendants dispute whether an implicit or express contract governed their relationship with Rockaway, they do not dispute that they provided credit card processing services to Rockaway during the nearly two-year period. (Defs.' Mot., at 1.) This alleged course of conduct, accepted as true, suffices to establish the existence of an implied-in-fact contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Bros. Elec.

Though the Partial Form suggests that it was filled out in connection with an agreement for Defendants to provide credit card processing services to Rockaway (Partial Form, Dkt. 20-3), the parties dispute whether Tapias ever saw this form contract, signed it, or agreed to its terms (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br., at 2,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   SAC, \u00b6 36). At the same, while Tapias acknowledges signing a document at the December 12, 2014 meeting, he cannot specify the subject matter of the document he signed (Second Tapias Decl., \u00b6 5), and Defendants are similarly unable to produce the Written Agreement bearing Tapias's signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thus, the issue of what contract existed between the parties relating to the provision of credit card processing services to Plaintiffs turns on issues of fact that cannot be resolved at the pleadings stage.

Supp., Dkt. 31), which leaves the Court with Defendants' arguments primarily addressing earlier versions of the complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkts. 18, 20, 23.) The original complaint and the first amended complaint alleged the breach of a\n    <em>\n     written\n    </em>\n    contract (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 1-1, \u00b6 8; Dkt. 17, \u00b6 27), which Defendants have argued is the Partial Form produced by Maresca (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Defendants' Letter Brief (\"Defs.' Br.\"), Dkt. 20, at 2). Despite maintaining throughout these proceedings that there was a written agreement,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the Written Agreement (First Tapias Decl., \u00b6 2; Second Tapias Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 3-4), Plaintiffs now allege in the SAC that the Written Agreement related only to the use of credit card\n    <em>\n     equipment\n    </em>\n    and that Defendants' provision of credit card processing\n    <em>\n     services\n    </em>\n    was governed by an implied-in-fact agreement,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , the Implied Agreement.

Defendants, however, advance no new arguments regarding the Implied Agreement, but instead refer the Court back to \"the reasons set forth in the previous briefing on Defendants' Motion and at the hearing\" (Defs.' Supp., at 2), namely, in sum and substance, that the Partial and Standard Forms produced by Maresca constitute the governing written contract (Defs.' Br., at 2; Transcript, Dkt. 27, at 71:18-72:13). Accordingly, the Court construes Defendants' supplemental letter brief as challenging Plaintiffs' claims for breach of an implied-in-fact contract based on the alleged existence of a written contract governing the same subject matter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Saeed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5929631\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/606/595/#p597\">\n     606 F.

Though cloaked in the language of negligence, Plaintiffs' allegations of tortious conduct relating to the Ali transactions merely restate Defendants' contractual obligations under the Implied Agreement. Indeed, the factual allegations set forth in Plaintiffs' contract and negligence claims relating to the Ali transactions are virtually identical. (\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 104-106 (stating that Defendants' authorization of the Ali transactions and failure to alert Plaintiffs to their fraudulent nature breached Defendants' obligations under the Implied Agreement),\n    <em>\n     with id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 122-124 (stating that Defendants' breached a duty of care owed to Plaintiff Rockaway by initially indicating that the Ali transactions were approved and failing to alert Plaintiff Rockaway that the transactions were fraudulent).) The gravamen of these allegations is that Defendants failed to comply with their contractual obligations and that Plaintiffs were harmed by those failures. Thus, Plaintiffs' negligence claims relating to the Ali transactions are incompatible with an action to recover for a breach of contract and must be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    However, Plaintiffs' negligence claims relating to Defendants' referral of Plaintiffs to the MATCH list present a different situation. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants \"further breached their duty of care to Plaintiffs by ... placing Plaintiffs on the MATCH list following their careless investigation of the matter.\" (SAC, \u00b6 132.) The SAC states that Defendants took this action intentionally in order to cast blame on Plaintiffs for the fraudulent Ali transactions and to protect the reputation of their credit card processing services. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 180-81.) Plaintiffs also assert that they have been damaged through their inability to obtain affordable credit card processing services. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 101.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    With respect to the placement of Plaintiffs' names on the MATCH list, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged negligence and gross negligence and that these claims are not identical to and consequently foreclosed by Plaintiffs' breach of contract claims. Given the uncertainty regarding the identity and terms of the contract between the parties, the Court cannot find, at this stage, that the contract addressed Defendants' rights and/or obligations with respect to reporting suspected fraudulent activity by one of Defendants' customers to the MATCH list, and thus whether Plaintiffs' negligence claims based on the MATCH list referral implicate a duty that is distinct from Defendants' contractual obligations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dormitory Auth.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550705\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/456/\">\n     70 N.Y.S.3d 893\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12550705\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/456/\">\n     94 N.E.3d at 460\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (negligence claim must be based on a duty distinct from defendant's contractual obligations). If Plaintiffs can show that the Implied Agreement governed the parties' contractual relationship, they may well be able to show that that agreement did not allow or provide for Defendants to report Plaintiffs to the MATCH list based on suspected fraud, and that, by doing so-especially where the fraud was committed by one of Plaintiffs' customers whose credit card transaction Defendants were responsible for screening-Defendants violated an independent duty of care owed to Plaintiffs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In sum, Counts 4 and 13 of the SAC will proceed to discovery, but only on Plaintiffs' negligence and gross negligence claims relating to the MATCH list placement.

Plaintiffs' Fraud Claims\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Following the September 20, 2018 oral argument, Plaintiffs filed their SAC to add claims for fraudulent inducement (Count 9) and fraud (Count 10). (SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 165-186.) Defendants subsequently supplemented their motion to dismiss, seeking to dismiss these new claims for failure to state a claim. (Defs.' Supp., Dkt. 31.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <strong>\n     A. Fraudulent Inducement\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In Count 9, Plaintiffs allege that Maresca, acting as Defendants' agent, falsely told Plaintiffs that Defendants' credit card processing system was secure and capable of identifying fraudulent transactions prior to approval and that Defendants had a policy of investigating fraudulent transactions thoroughly before assigning blame\n    for them. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.) Plaintiffs assert that these misrepresentations were made for the purpose of inducing Rockaway to enter the Implied Agreement and that Defendants are therefore liable for fraudulent inducement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 165-175.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Under New York law, a plaintiff must allege four elements to state a claim for fraudulent inducement: (1) a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; (2) an intent to deceive; (3) reasonable reliance on the misrepresentation by the plaintiff; and (4) resulting damages.\n    <em>\n     Ipcon Collections LLC v.

Additionally, the plaintiff must satisfy Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards, which require a plaintiff to \" 'specify the time, place, speaker, and content of the alleged misrepresentations, ... how the misrepresentations were fraudulent' and 'those events which give rise to a strong inference that the defendant had an intent to defraud, knowledge of the falsity, or a reckless disregard for the truth.' \"\n    <em>\n     Janese v.

The first element is satisfied by the SAC's allegations that, at the December 12, 2014 meeting with Plaintiffs, Maresca represented that \"the credit card services provided by [Defendants] were safe and secure, that the credit card processing system was capable of identifying fraudulent transactions prior to being approved[,] ... and that [Defendants] had a policy of investigating any allegations of fraudulent transactions thoroughly ... before drawing any conclusion about who was responsible for that transaction.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 166-167.) These statements directly implicate the nature and quality of Defendants' services and business practices at the time of the negotiation-information that would have been material to any potential business partner's decision on whether to contract with Defendants. The second element-deceptive intent-is satisfied by the SAC's allegations that Defendants knew that Maresca's statements were false, but nevertheless intended that they be made in order to induce Rockaway to contract with Defendants for credit card processing services. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 168-169.) The third element, reasonable reliance, is satisfied based on Plaintiffs' allegation that they relied on Maresca's representations in deciding to enter into the Implied Agreement and tailoring their retail beverage distribution business around the use and acceptance of credit cards. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 170.) Lastly, Plaintiffs adequately allege the fourth element of injury by stating that they lost $ 47,000 worth of goods due to the fraudulent Ali transactions and have been unable to acquire cost-effective credit card processing services due to the placement of their names on the MATCH list without sufficient investigation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 93, 173.) Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have successfully pleaded facts to establish the elements of a fraudulent inducement claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Furthermore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have satisfied Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading requirements. Plaintiffs have \"specif[ied] the time, place, speaker, and content of the alleged misrepresentations.\"\n    <em>\n     Janese\n    </em>\n    , 692 F.3d at 228. They state that they met with Maresca on December 12, 2014 at Rockaway's place of business at 153-25 Rockaway Boulevard in Jamaica, New York, where Maresca informed Plaintiffs that Defendants' credit card processing services could identify fraudulent transactions and that Defendants had a policy of thoroughly investigating fraudulent transactions prior to assigning blame\n    to any party. (SAC, \u00b6 25.) Plaintiffs have further specified \"how the [alleged] misrepresentations were fraudulent,\"\n    <em>\n     Janese\n    </em>\n    , 692 F.3d at 228, by stating that the Ali transactions would not have been approved if Defendants' credit card processing system performed as Maresca described and that Plaintiffs' names would not have been placed on the MATCH list if a thorough investigation of the Ali transactions had been conducted, as Maresca had promised. (SAC, \u00b6\u00b6 59-66, 83-90.) Finally, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' credit card processing system approved seven fraudulent transactions totaling $ 47,000 over the course of one week and that, prior to any meaningful inquiry, Defendants informed the MATCH list that Plaintiffs were engaged in money laundering. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 58, 72-76.) These allegations raise a sufficiently \"strong inference\" that Defendants exhibited, at least, \"a reckless disregard for the truth\" of Maresca's representations to Plaintiffs.\n    <em>\n     Janese\n    </em>\n    , 692 F.3d at 228.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Additionally, the Court finds that Defendants may be held vicariously liable for statements made by Maresca in negotiating the contract between Rockaway and Defendants. Whether or not Maresca's alleged misrepresentations were within the scope of his authority to negotiate credit card processing contracts, Defendants may be liable if they later ratified an agent's fraudulent statements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dover Ltd. v.

The SAC alleges that Maresca told Plaintiffs that he was Defendants' agent authorized to contract for credit card processing services (SAC, \u00b6 20), and Maresca himself confirms that he sold such services on behalf of Defendant First Data Merchant Services and Defendant WFB (Maresca Aff., \u00b6 2). Though discovery may confirm that Maresca acted solely on behalf of those two Defendants, the Court finds it inappropriate to resolve this discrepancy on a motion to dismiss. Thus, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Maresca acted as Defendants' agent in contracting with Rockaway. Furthermore, based on the allegations that Defendants ultimately provided credit card processing services to Rockaway in exchange for fee payments, Defendants may be found to have ratified any agreement negotiated by Maresca and therefore would be liable for any false statements he made to induce Plaintiffs to enter into the agreement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Banque Arabe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892025\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/850/1199/#p1213\">\n     850 F.
