(\"The conspiracy for which [the defendant] was accused and eventually convicted began in September 1992; henceforth, the precise date to which the Government's\n   title over the properties related back to.\"). The Court recognizes that the rights, title and interests reserved by Subway in the franchise agreements remain the property of Subway. The Final Forfeiture Order pertains solely to Pe\u00f1a's rights, title and interests pursuant to his agreements with Subway, McHale and Swanson.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The United States \"is not interested in operating Subway restaurant locations in Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 81 at p. 3.) Instead, it seeks to \"ensure that Defendant Felix Pe\u00f1a-Fern\u00e1ndez does not retain the right to operate the Subway franchises in question,\" a permissive and appropriate objective pursuant to criminal forfeiture law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9234201\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/321/722/#p729\">\n    321 F.Supp.2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 729 (E.D. Va. 2004) (\"[F]orfeiture generally serves to remove from an offender the fruits and instrumentalities of his crime, and thereby provides a powerful disincentive to commit the crime in the first instance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Subway argues that \"its legal rights and interests ... were\n   <em>\n    superior\n   </em>\n   to those of defendant, Mr. Pe\u00f1a-Fern\u00e1ndez, at the time of the commission of the acts that gave rise to the forfeiture.\" (Docket No. 34 at p. 9.) Subway conflates, however, its property with the rights conferred to Pe\u00f1a pursuant to the franchise agreements. Subway allowed Pe\u00f1a to\n   <strong>\n    access\n   </strong>\n   its proprietary \"system\" to prepare and sell sandwiches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 34, Ex. 3 at p. 3,\n   <em>\n    Franchise Agreement\n   </em>\n   (\"[Pe\u00f1a] want[s] access to the System to establish and operate the Restaurant.\"). The franchise agreements did not transfer ownership of Subway's property rights to Pe\u00f1a. Because the property subject to forfeiture and Subway's property are distinct, amendment of the preliminary forfeiture order is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
