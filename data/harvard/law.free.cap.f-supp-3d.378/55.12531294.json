To this end, the federal rules and courts encourage litigants to bring all related claims in a single lawsuit.

Applying the above principles to the present case, the Court rules that substantial justice is best achieved by allowing Hicks' case against Redd to move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hicks' attempt to sue Redd has taken a circuitous route, which the Court sketches out as it is relevant here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Medina-Padilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States Aviation Underwriters, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146046\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/83/#p85\">\n    815 F.3d 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 85-86 (1st Cir. 2016) (\"Where a motion to dismiss is premised on res judicata, [the court] may take into account, in addition to the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, the record in the original action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 1, 2017, Hicks filed a complaint against Daniel Bennett, the Secretary of the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, and the Massachusetts Department of Corrections (\"the Department\") alleging various violations\n   of the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 1983 of chapter 42 of the United States Code. Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1. After Bennett and the Department moved to dismiss, Defs.' Mot. Dismiss Failure State Claim and Mem. Law Supp. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss Failure State Claim,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 11-12, Hicks voluntarily dismissed Bennett and sought leave to amend to add three additional defendants: Officers \"McGlynn\" and \"Povado\" and Lieutenant \"Redd,\" Notice Voluntary Dismissal Secretary Bennett and Mot. Amend Compl. Add 3 Defs.,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 4, 2017, the Court allowed the Department's pending motion to dismiss \"without prejudice to the filing of a motion to amend setting forth a plausible claim for relief against the individuals sought to be added as defendants.\" Order,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hicks thus once again filed for leave to amend, with one critical error: in his motion to amend, he expressed an intent to \"amend to reflect the identity and the actions of officers McGlynn, Povado, Redd,\" Mot. Leave File Am. Compl. Pursuant Ct.'s Order 4/4/17,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 22, but in the proposed complaint attached to his motion, he named only McGlynn and Polvado, Am. Compl.,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 22-1. This seeming oversight ultimately doomed Hicks' ability to include Redd in his original suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 13, 2017, the Court denied Hicks' motion to file an amended complaint, ruling that there were no allegations \"concerning who, if anyone, is alleged deliberately to have denied the petitioner necessary medical care.\" Order,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On review, the First Circuit affirmed \"the dismissal of all claims except for the Eighth Amendment Claim,\" ruling the allegations \"sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss an Eighth Amendment claim.\" USCA Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Redd contends that Hicks \"did not assign error with the Court's denial of his request to add Lt. Redd as a defendant\" in his appeal to the First Circuit. Def.'s Mem. Claim Preclusion 2. This is not entirely accurate; Hicks' appeal to the First Circuit challenged this Court's dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim, which applied to all of the Defendants without distinction. Notice Appeal Order Dismissing Case,\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 26. This Court infers that the First Circuit made no mention of Redd in its judgment because it considered only Hicks' proposed amended complaint, which named only McGlynn and Polvado, rather than the motion to amend, which named all three officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming that the First Circuit considered only Hicks' proposed amended complaint, the First Circuit's judgment affirming this Court's dismissal of Hicks' complaint with the exception of the Eighth Amendment claims against McGlynn and Polvado does not constitute a final judgment on the merits as to the viability of a claim against Redd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the First Circuit's ruling in June 2018, Hicks refiled his amended complaint (the version naming only McGlynn and Polvado),\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 39, and the case was scheduled for trial on October 1, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants McGlynn and Polvado made their pretrial disclosures on October 1, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 60-62. The Court notes, here, that McGlynn and Polvado did not strictly comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(3)'s requirement that each party make such disclosures at least thirty days before trial. Three days later, Hicks again filed to amend his complaint to include Redd, noting that the Defendants' pretrial disclosures evinced the import of Redd's inclusion in the suit.\n   <em>\n    Hicks I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 65. The Court dismissed this pending motion on the ground of timeliness at the start of the bench trial on October 10, 2018. Tr.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court's denial of the motion to amend (on the day of the trial) does not amount to an adjudication on the merits triggering claim preclusion because the Court's denial relied solely on the risk of disruption to the trial that was about to begin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Integrated Techs.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Biochem Immunosystems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1570938\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/2/97/#p102\">\n    2 F.Supp.2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102-03 (D. Mass. 1998) (noting that a denial of a motion for leave to amend is not an adjudication on the merits when it is based \"only on concern about its disruptive effect on the pending litigation,\" so \"ordinary principles of claim preclusion should determine whether the plaintiff should be permitted to assert such a new claim in a separate lawsuit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Further, nothing suggests that Hicks dawdled when the import of Redd's exclusion became clear to him, as he sought to amend his complaint just three days after the Defendants made their pretrial disclosures, which made frequent reference to the lieutenant.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silva v.

Since the purpose of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   is to prevent duplicative proceedings when the parties already had an incentive and opportunity to litigate all of their claims related to an issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Apparel Art Int'l\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Amertex Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410148\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/576/#p583\">\n    48 F.3d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 583 (1st Cir. 1995), courts assess whether the defendants in the earlier action had the same incentives to defend against the claims as the new defendant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhode Island Hosp.

In fact, the Court's findings following the October 10, 2018 bench trial rested on the absence the evidence that the delay of which Hicks complained was attributable to McGlynn or Polvado. More specifically, the Court found that the delay could not be attributed to McGlynn because he promptly reported Hicks' medical need to Redd. Tr. Bench Trial 86:19-25, 89:10-14. It is quite possible, therefore, that a delay could be attributed to Redd, who, according to the Court's October 10, 2018 findings, learned of Hicks' medical need at approximately 12:35 p.m. Tr.
