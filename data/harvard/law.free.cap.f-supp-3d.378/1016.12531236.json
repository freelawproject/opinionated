Crabtree, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pro se\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   plaintiff Marcia L. Jackson brings two Title VII claims against defendant\n   Kansas City, Kansas Public Schools Unified School District No. 500. One, plaintiff alleges that defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   permitted a co-worker to sexually harass her after she reported to her supervisor that the co-worker had threatened to beat her up. Two, plaintiff alleges that defendant terminated her employment in retaliation for reporting a separate incident of sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the court are three motions. In the first one, defendant moves for summary judgment (Doc. 86). Plaintiff has responded with a Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. 92). And, defendant has filed a Reply (Doc. 105). But, to address defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, the court first must resolve the two other pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The second motion challenges the Pretrial Order (Doc. 84). After Magistrate Judge Teresa J. James entered the Pretrial Order on October 1, 2018, plaintiff filed an Objection (Doc. 85). Defendant then made a two-part filing: the Clerk has categorized this filing as a Response to plaintiff's Objection and a separate Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Objection to the Pretrial Order (Doc. 89). Plaintiff then filed a Response to the defendant's Motion to Strike (Doc. 90). Defendant, in turn, filed a Reply (Doc. 91). And, plaintiff filed a Sur-reply (Doc. 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The final pending motion is plaintiff's Motion to Strike Affidavit and Exhibits (Doc. 94). In short, plaintiff challenges an affidavit-and the attached exhibits-that defendant has included with its Memorandum in Support its Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendant has filed a Memorandum in Opposition to plaintiff's Motion to Strike (Doc. 103).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For reasons explained below, defendant's Motion to Strike (Doc. 89) is granted. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Affidavit and Exhibits (Doc. 94) is granted in part and the rest is denied. And, defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 86) is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendant's Motion to Strike Plaintiff's Objection to Pretrial Order (Doc. 89)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff has objected to defendant's legal defenses listed in the Pretrial Order (Doc. 84). She also argues that defense counsel did not act in good faith after the court ordered defense counsel to revise the Pretrial Order following the pretrial conference on September 20, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 80. In response, defendant contends that its Answer (Doc. 10) contains all the defenses plaintiff has objected to in the Pretrial Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(e), the court may hold a final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan. Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(e). Once approved by the court, the pretrial order supersedes all pleadings and controls the subsequent course of the case.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Defendant included each challenged defense in its Answer, which it filed in March 2018. Doc. 10 at 3-4; Doc. 84 at 8-10. And so, plaintiff cannot argue that defendant amended its previous pleadings by including a new defense in the Pretrial Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437575\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/1207/#p1215\">\n    303 F.3d at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e do not normally expect to see claims or defenses not contained in the pleadings appearing for the first time in the pretrial order[.]\").

But, here, these defenses could not have surprised plaintiff because defendant asserted them in its Answer seven months before the court entered the final Pretrial Order. The court thus overrules plaintiff's objections to the Pretrial Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Affidavit and Exhibits (Doc. 94)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Next, the court addresses plaintiff's Motion to Strike Defendant's Affidavit and Exhibits (Doc. 94).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's motion zeroes in on the affidavit of defendant's custodian of records- Susan Westfahl-and the exhibits submitted with Ms. Westfahl's affidavit. Plaintiff's Motion to Strike advances three arguments. First, plaintiff contends that the court should strike Ms. Westfahl's affidavit because defendant failed to disclose her as a witness under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a). Second, plaintiff asks the court to strike the 18 exhibits attached to Ms. Westfahl's affidavit because defendant failed to produce them in a timely manner. Third, reading plaintiff's motion liberally, plaintiff moves to strike Exhibits 11-14 as inadmissible because plaintiff has failed to authenticate them. The court grants plaintiff's motion in part and denies the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Susan Westfahl's Affidavit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, plaintiff contends that the court should strike Susan Westfahl's affidavit because defendant failed to disclose her as a witness under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a) and (e). Ms. Westfahl's affidavit primarily serves to authenticate documents-specifically,\n   defendant attaches 18 exhibits to Ms. Westfahl's affidavit. Ms. Westfahl avers that she is the Clerk of the Board of Education and that Kansas law charges her with the care and custody of the Board of Education's records, books, and documents. Ms. Westfahl's affidavit certifies each attached exhibit as a \"true and accurate copy.\" Doc. 87-1 at 2-5. So, plaintiff contends, the court must disregard any exhibit relying on Ms. Westfahl's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant's Memorandum in Opposition (Doc. 103) concedes that it did not identify Ms. Westfahl by name in its Rule 26 disclosures. But, defendant contends, the court should excuse this omission because it is harmless and substantially justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Rule 26(a) requires the parties to disclose, in part, the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]he name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable information-along with the subjects of that information-that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(i). If a party fails to identify a witness in its disclosures under Rule 26(a) and (e), the court may prevent the party from using that witness to supply evidence on a motion unless the failure is substantially justified or harmless. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Several factors influence the analysis whether a Rule 26 violation is harmless or substantially justified: \"(1) the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the testimony is offered; (2) the ability of the party to cure the prejudice; (3) the extent to which introducing such testimony would disrupt the trial; and (4) the moving party's bad faith or willfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    Eugene S. v. Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of N.J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3853872\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/663/1124/#p1130\">\n    663 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v.

The party who failed to make or supplement the initial disclosure carries the burden to show the non-disclosure was harmless or justified.\n   <em>\n    Umbenhower v. Copart, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2171319\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/222/672/#p675\">\n    222 F.R.D. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675 (D. Kan. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Resolving this dispute requires a brief retrospective of the case's timeline. Defendant made its initial disclosures on May 18, 2018. Doc. 19. In its initial disclosures, defendant listed \"[a]ll witnesses needed to lay foundation for admission of exhibits.\" Doc. 94-1 at 4. The Scheduling Order gave the parties up to 40 days before the discovery deadline to supplement their initial disclosures. Doc. 17 at 2. The court directed the parties to complete discovery by August 24, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2171319\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/222/672/#p675\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, the Scheduling Order permitted the parties to supplement their Rule 26 disclosures until July 16, 2018. Defendant did not supplement its disclosures until December 21, 2018-more than five months after the deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant avers that it did not disclose Mr. Westfahl in its Rule 26 disclosures because defendant believed that the parties had agreed that authenticating affidavits would not be necessary on summary judgment. Specifically, defendant contends that the parties agreed-for summary judgment and trial-to waive foundation and authentication objections for exhibits marked or used during depositions and any document produced in discovery. Defendant asserts that it decided not to supplement its disclosure with authentication witnesses by the July 16 deadline based on this understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The proceedings conducted at the Pretrial Conference support defendant's contention. The Pretrial Conference was held on September 20, 2018, several months after the supplemental disclosure deadline. Under our Local Rules, the parties must\n   try in good faith to draft a pretrial order that the judge can sign at the pretrial conference. But, should the \"parties disagree on any particulars, they are each to submit proposed language on the points in controversy, for the judge to rule on at the conference.\" D. Kan. Rule 16.2(a). The parties' proposed pretrial order included the exhibits-now contested-as stipulated exhibits. And, the proposed order did not disclose any dispute about the stipulated exhibit list, nor did the parties submit competing proposed language. The revisions made to the proposed pretrial order at the pretrial conference favor the conclusion that plaintiff revoked her consent to waive foundation and authentication objections during the Pretrial Conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the extent defendant has violated Rule 26, the court finds the failure substantially justified. Defendant-as the party who failed to disclose-bears the burden to show its actions were substantially justified or harmless.\n   <em>\n    Estate of McDermed v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-2430-CM-TJJ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201298096\">\n    2016 WL 1298096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D. Kan. Apr. 1, 2016). So, defendant's arguments that plaintiff has failed to articulate how she was surprised or prejudiced incorrectly shifts the burden to plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 103 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   But, burden shifting errors aside, the court considers defendant's failure substantially justified. Several things support this conclusion. First, defendant identified-as a class-witnesses needed to lay the foundation for exhibits. And, in light of the purported agreement between the parties-permitting the parties to offer certain exhibits for summary judgment and trial without additional foundation or authentication-plaintiff revoking the agreement at the final pretrial conference created something of a Catch-22 for defendant. That is, if the parties proceeded with the understanding that authentication and foundation was not an issue, then defendant would not have supplemented its disclosures after the July amendment deadline. And so, the court declines to strike the statements in Ms. Westfahl's affidavit laying the foundation for and authenticating certain documents. The court denies the portion of plaintiff's motion challenging Ms. Westfahl's foundational assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But, importantly, Ms. Westfahl's affidavit isn't limited to foundation testimony. It also includes three fact statements about Eugene Swygert-one of plaintiff's alleged harassers. Those statements address Mr. Swygert's termination from employment. Defendant asserts that it included these statements in the disputed affidavit as background, and that they are not material to its summary judgment motion. Background or not, defendant was required to disclose Ms. Westfahl if it intended to adduce testimony from her. This is the essential precept of Rule 26. Defendant didn't comply with this mandate, so the court will not consider these statements found in paragraphs 13-15 of Ms. Westfahl's affidavit. They go beyond authentication and foundation, and plaintiff reasonably could sustain prejudice from them.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of McDermed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201298096\">\n    2016 WL 1298096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (\"Because Plaintiffs are only identifying Biggler and Northern as foundation witnesses, the Court finds that the late disclosure of these witnesses is harmless to Defendant.\");\n   <em>\n    In re Otero Cty. Hosp. Ass'n, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-11-13686 JL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20184984\">\n    2014 WL 184984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (Bankr. D.N.M. Jan. 15, 2014) (finding no material prejudice to party who objected to Rule 26 disclosures, which failed to name particular individuals, to the extent those individuals would be called solely to authenticate or provide foundation for exhibits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exhibits 1-18: Failure to Produce\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, plaintiff contends the court should strike the 18 exhibits attached to\n   Ms. Westfahl's affidavit because defendant did not produce them in a timely fashion. Plaintiff cites Fed. R. Civ. P. 37.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff argues that defendant did not disclose the exhibits attached to Ms. Westfahl's affidavit as required by Rule 26(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 26(a) directs the parties to provide the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [A] copy-or a description by category and location-of all documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(ii). The court understands plaintiff's motion under Rule 37(c) to make the following argument: defendant failed to identify or disclose the exhibits attached to Ms. Westfahl's affidavit in its Rule 26(a) disclosures. Defendant now has used these exhibits to support its Motion for Summary Judgment. And, because defendant didn't disclose these exhibits, the court-plaintiff says-should strike them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court rejects plaintiff's request. In her motion, plaintiff includes a portion of defendant's initial disclosures. And, in its initial disclosures, defendant identified each of the challenged documents or provided a description by category and location of each document. Defendant complied with Rule 26(a), and the court thus denies plaintiff's Motion to Strike Exhibits 1-18 for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Exhibits 11-14: Failure to Authenticate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Third, plaintiff objects to defendants' Exhibits 11-14. These exhibits are written statements purportedly provided by four of plaintiff's former co-workers. The statements chronicle plaintiff and Mr. Swygert's dispute on December 21, 2016. Plaintiff references D. Kan. Rule 56.1, and, construing her filing liberally, the court understands plaintiff's motion to argue that defendant has failed to authenticate these statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 94-3 at 3 (referring to the exhibits as \"[f]alse statements by coworkers[.] No affidavit or sworn under oath.\"). That is, plaintiff contends that the court must disregard the content of these statements because the co-workers have not filed complementary affidavits, nor do their statements comport with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because they are not sworn \"under penalty of perjury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Kan. Rule 56.1(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant dismisses plaintiff's objection, arguing it has complied with Rule 56 because it attached these exhibits to Ms. Westfahl's affidavit, and, as custodian of records for the District, she properly can authenticate records in the District's possession. While this may be so, Ms. Westfahl's affidavit-the only source defendant relies on for three of the witness statements- fails to establish that these documents are self-authenticating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under Fed. R. Evid. 902, a document is self-authenticating as a \"Certified Domestic Record\" if a custodian or other qualified person certifies that the record meets the three requirements of Fed. R. Evid. 806. These requirements are that the record was (A) \"made at or near the time by...someone with knowledge,\" (B) \"kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business,\" and (C) made as \"a regular practice of that activity.\" Fed.

The affidavit does not establish that the four witness statements were made at or near the time of the altercation. And, as the District custodian, Ms. Westfahl could have explained that witness statements are kept in the District's regularly conducted activities and that the statements were made as a regular practice of that activity. But, Ms. Westfahl does not assert that\n   <em>\n    these documents\n   </em>\n   meet Rule 902's standards.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IBP, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"535502\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/6/1258/#p1263\">\n    6 F.Supp.2d at 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ( \"In neither his affidavit nor deposition testimony did [the employee] give any indication that the records were made contemporaneous with the controverted transaction or were kept in the ordinary course of business.\") (citation omitted),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guang Dong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2053665\">\n    2008 WL 53665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding custodian's affidavit sufficient where it attested that custodian had reviewed the documents and they were \"kept by [the business] in the regular course of its business, some of which constitute electronic mail communications which are between [the business's] employees and representatives in the regular course of its business[ ]\").

Doc. 87-3 at 10 (Jackson Dep. 145:13-146:15). During her January 4, 2017, meeting with Ms. Miller, plaintiff expressed concerns for her safety. So, plaintiff was placed on administrative leave with pay during the investigation.

Ms. Miller secured a statement from Keyannah Johnson about the incident. Doc. 87-4 at 4 (Miller Aff. \u00b6 18). Ms. Johnson reported that plaintiff got upset, started \"talking reckless,\" and called Mr. Swygert a \"bastard\" and \"ignorant.\" Doc. 87-1 at 39. As a result of the investigation, Ms. Miller determined that plaintiff also had engaged in inappropriate conduct during the altercation and violated Board of Education policies.

Plaintiff denied violating the policies and procedures. She told Ms. Miller she thought the investigation was a witch hunt. And, plaintiff asserts, Ms. Miller did not deny this allegation. During their meeting, Ms. Miller advised plaintiff that she had the option to resign in lieu of termination, which plaintiff declined. Ms. Miller requested that plaintiff turn in her employee badge, and plaintiff complied. Last, Ms. Miller informed plaintiff that there would be a meeting a few days later to dismiss plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Later that same day, plaintiff called Ms. Miller. Plaintiff told Ms. Miller that she intended to seek legal assistance.

Dr. Mather stated that defendant would send a letter. Dr. Mather also said that plaintiff could appeal the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiff received a letter from Ms. Miller dated February 2, 2017.

The policy prohibits the use of profanity or abusive language; prohibits personal conduct that is detrimental to personnel, which could cause undue disruption of work; and prohibits conduct that may be characterized as workplace violence.

First, plaintiff contends that Mr. Swygert, a co-worker, sexually harassed her by sticking out his tongue and circling it around; winking at plaintiff; and exhibiting inappropriate body language. Plaintiff claims that this happened in September 2016. But, plaintiff did not report Mr. Swygert's actions to any supervisor. Second, plaintiff alleges that her female co-worker-Keyannah Johnson-bullied her sometime around October 2016. According to plaintiff, Ms. Johnson told plaintiff that if she was not 65 years old, Ms. Johnson would have \"kick[ed] her ass.\" Plaintiff asserts she reported Ms. Johnson's threat to Ms. Miller, but Ms. Miller took no corrective action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, plaintiff alleges, Ms. Johnson's harassment continued, later becoming sexual in nature.

Third, plaintiff contends that Mr. Swygert made offensive sexual comments to plaintiff during an argument they had with one another on December 21, 2016.

Plaintiff called Ms. Miller on December 22, 2016-one day after the incident with Mr. Swygert. December 22 was the employees' last day of work before the District's winter break. Plaintiff testified that she understood she would need to write a statement about her complaint after winter break when she returned from out of town on January 2, 2017. She did so. On January 4, 2017, Mr. Swygert was placed on administrative leave pending investigation into plaintiff's allegations that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior. As a result of this investigation, Ms. Miller determined that Mr. Swygert had engaged in inappropriate conduct that violated defendant's policies. And, Ms. Miller recommended terminating Mr. Swygert's employment with the District. In short, defendant removed the harasser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The governing standard in our Circuit requires employers-once presented with a report of sexual harassment-to take \"remedial and preventative action [that is] reasonably calculated to end the harassment.\"\n   <em>\n    Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1306858\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/664/#p670\">\n    144 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is impossible to imagine a remedial or preventive action more fulsome than the District's here. It received plaintiff's complaint on December 22, 2016-the day after it occurred. It so happened that this was the last work day for plaintiff and the reported harasser before the year-end semester break. Plaintiff submitted her written narrative of what had happened to her on the first day back after the break-January 2. The defendant placed the alleged perpetrator on administrative leave by January 4. This action removed him from the workplace altogether. And, after completing her investigation of the December 21 incident, Ms. Miller recommended terminating Mr. Swygert's employment for violating the District's policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   At summary judgment, plaintiff \"bears the burden of presenting evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact that the employer's response was unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

Instead, defendant contends, the uncontroverted facts show that\n   plaintiff received a letter after the meeting on February 2, 2017, which detailed the charges against her and the recommendation for termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter also stated that the recommendation would be forwarded to Human Resources. The uncontroverted facts also establish that plaintiff spoke with Jody Mitchell-the District's Human Resources Advisor-on February 13, 2017, to schedule a\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   hearing. Plaintiff then spoke with Ms. Miller on February 24, 2017, and Ms. Miller presented plaintiff with a final opportunity to request a\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   hearing. In response, plaintiff agreed to attend a\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   hearing on February 27, 2017. But ultimately, plaintiff did not appear for the hearing. Then, about two weeks later, on March 13, 2017, the Board terminated plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff then received a letter, which advised her of her right to request a termination hearing within 10 days. Plaintiff did not request that hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   In short, plaintiff appears to argue that defendant's decision was a pretext because it did not follow its termination policies. But, the uncontroverted facts can't possibly support that argument. They show that defendant followed its policies by offering plaintiff a\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   hearing. And, plaintiff has adduced no evidence that defendant's policies require the\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   hearing to be offered during the meeting where she learns that termination has been recommended.
