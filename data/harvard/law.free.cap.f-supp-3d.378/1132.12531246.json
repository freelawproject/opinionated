MENDOZA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE is before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (\"Motion,\" Doc. 5). Plaintiff filed an untimely Response (Doc. 13). As set forth below, the Motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that over the course of three hours, he consumed approximately eight Keystone Ice beers, which are manufactured by Defendant. (Compl., Doc. 1-2, at 4). As a result, Plaintiff alleges he \"ended up in jail ... [without] knowing what had transpired\" and with a \"stab wound to [his] left hand\" and a cut on his pointer finger. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Plaintiff brings one claim, alleging that Defendant failed to warn him \"of the dangers of blacking out due to consuming their product.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4). Defendant has moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"A pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state\n   a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" In determining whether to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court accepts the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construes them in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Techs. Corp. v. Mazer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3332347\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/1260/#p1269\">\n    556 F.3d 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1269 (11th Cir. 2009). Nonetheless, \"the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions,\" and \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.
