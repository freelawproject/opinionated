He submits that the removal order that underlies the sole count of illegal reentry is unlawful and thus there is no valid removal to form the necessary predicate for the charged offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Castillo-Martinez primarily relies upon the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.

He contends that without such jurisdiction, the Immigration Judge lacks authority to issue a valid order of removal. Furthermore, he contends that his original removal order, based on an incorrect determination that his drug conviction was for an \"aggravated felony\", was wrongful and that he was not therefore automatically removable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is not controlling and the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to issue Castillo-Martinez's order of removal. Moreover, defendant cannot satisfy the factors set forth in \u00a7 1326(d) to attack collaterally his prior order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Criminal History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Castillo-Martinez was born in the Dominican Republic in 1973. He became a Lawful Permanent Resident (\"LPR\") in July, 1981, when he was eight years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August, 1996, at age 23, Castillo-Martinez was convicted in Massachusetts state court of Distribution of a Class D Controlled Substance (marijuana) in violation of M.G.L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C. He received a two-year suspended sentence and probation. In December, 2010, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") officials encountered Castillo-Martinez at a jail in New Hampshire while he was awaiting trial on another drug trafficking charge for the sale of OxyContin. ICE lodged a detainer at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In June, 2012, Castillo-Martinez was convicted in New Hampshire state court on the second drug-trafficking charge. He received a suspended sentence of 5 to 10 years. Defendant was then transferred\n   into ICE custody and removal proceedings were initiated against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Removal Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Castillo-Martinez was served an NTA while in ICE custody. It notified him that he was removable from the United States based on his conviction of an aggravated felony but did not state a date, time or place for his removal hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The sole grounds for removal listed in the NTA was defendant's 1996 drug conviction in Massachusetts state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July, 2012, counsel for Castillo-Martinez filed a responsive pleading with the Immigration Court conceding defendant's removability but indicating that he would apply for deferral of removal pursuant to the Convention Against Torture (\"the CAT\"). After a hearing in November, 2012, the Immigration Judge denied defendant's application for relief under the CAT. Castillo-Martinez appealed that denial to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"the BIA\") but it denied the petition and ordered his removal. The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") deported Castillo-Martinez to the Dominican Republic in April, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Subsequent Reentry and Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August, 2016, Castillo-Martinez was arrested in Massachusetts and taken into administrative custody by ICE. DHS reinstated his prior order of removal and he was again deported to the Dominican Republic in November, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In June, 2018, Castillo-Martinez was again arrested in Massachusetts and charged with trafficking in heroin. In August, 2018, he was charged in a one-count indictment with illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b)(2). That charge was based on the 2016 removal order which was itself a reinstatement of the initial 2013 removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In February, 2019, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that 1) based on a broad reading of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to enter the initial order of removal in 2013 that forms the basis of the present prosecution and 2) the sole charge of removability in the 2012 NTA was not based upon an \"aggravated felony\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(B) and thus he was not removable as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss the Indictment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2019), the Ninth Circuit held that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to order the defendant removed despite the failure of the initial NTA to list the time and place of the removal hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court found that the decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   did not control because that case dealt only with the stop-time provision and not the distinct issue of the Immigration Judge's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit emphasized that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   relied on the fact that\n   the stop-time provision specifically cross-referenced the statutory definition of NTA which required both time and place whereas the regulations defining an NTA for purposes of vesting jurisdiction contained no such requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court concluded that the regulatory definition of an NTA therefore applied with respect to jurisdiction vesting and that an NTA lacking the time or place of the removal hearing was sufficient to vest the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction to order removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1160-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Santos-Santos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barr\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit also rejected the defendant's contention that the Immigration Judge lacked jurisdiction to issue an order of removal where the initial NTA failed to list the time and place of the removal hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 489-91. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit held that the regulatory definition of an NTA controls for purposes of vesting jurisdiction and that so long as the non-citizen was subsequently notified of the time and place of the removal hearing in a separate Notice of Hearing, the Immigration Judge is properly vested with jurisdiction under the regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 490.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court adopts the reasoning of the Sixth and Ninth Circuits and concludes that the regulatory definition of an NTA applies for purposes of vesting jurisdiction with the Immigration Judge. Furthermore, courts normally defer to an agency's interpretation of a statute where 1) the statute is ambiguous and 2) the agency's interpretation of the statute is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    467 U.S. 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843-44,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Notwithstanding that Congress explicitly defined an NTA in the INA, the statute is silent with respect to the vesting of jurisdiction in the Immigration Judge and is thus ambiguous as to that issue. Moreover, an agency is not required to incorporate a statutory definition of a term into its regulations that use the same term so long as the regulatory definition is a permissible interpretation of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Envtl. Def.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Duke Energy Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553650\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/561/#p574\">\n    549 U.S. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574-76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553650\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/561/#p574\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553650\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/561/#p574\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, the regulatory definition of an NTA for purposes of vesting jurisdiction is a reasonable interpretation of the INA given the statute's silence in that regard. The fact that Congress defined an NTA elsewhere in the statute does not require a contrary conclusion. The Supreme Court itself acknowledged that an NTA could serve different functions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2115 n.7. To serve the notice function the non-citizen must actually be notified of the time and place of the removal hearing so that he or she can appear.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, the function of vesting jurisdiction is directed toward the Immigration Judge rather than the non-citizen and thus notification of time and place is unimportant for that distinct purpose.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ramos-Delcid\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:18-cr-00020,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205833081\">\n    2018 WL 5833081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 n.6 (W.D. Va. Nov. 7, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because Castillo-Martinez was served with an NTA containing all of the required information and was presumably served a separate Notice of Hearing informing him of the time and place of his removal hearing (given that he actually appeared at that hearing), the DHS complied with all of the regulatory requirements for vesting the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction. Castillo-Martinez was thus subject to a valid order of removal both in 2013 and in 2016 when that order was reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Section 1326(d) Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Because the Court concludes that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to enter Castillo-Martinez's order of removal,\n   defendant cannot satisfy the \u00a7 1326(d) factors to prevail on a collateral attack against that order. Castillo-Martinez has not demonstrated that he has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to the alleged jurisdictional issue but rather asserts that the exhaustion requirement should be excused because the removal proceedings were void\n   <em>\n    ab\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    initio\n   </em>\n   . Given the Court's determination that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction to enter the subject order of removal, that argument is rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206050905\">\n    2018 WL 6050905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. The arguments of Castillo-Martinez with respect to the opportunity for judicial review are rejected for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, defendant cannot establish that the entry of his removal order was fundamentally unfair pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . Specifically, Castillo-Martinez cannot demonstrate that the result of the removal proceedings would have been different but for the defect in the initial NTA because he actually appeared at those proceedings with counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206050905\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the alleged jurisdictional defect will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Aggravated Felony Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In addition to his jurisdictional claim under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , Castillo-Martinez seeks to attack collaterally his prior removal order on the grounds that his Massachusetts state court conviction for Distribution of a Class D Substance (which formed the basis of that removal) is not an aggravated felony.\n   <em>\n    Moncrieff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    569 U.S. at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[i]f a noncitizen's conviction for a marijuana distribution offense fails to establish that the offense involved either remuneration or more than a small amount of marijuana, the conviction is not for an aggravated felony under the INA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even assuming that the subject Massachusetts state court conviction is not an aggravated felony, Castillo-Martinez cannot satisfy the \u00a7 1326(d) factors to collaterally attack his prior order of removal. Castillo-Martinez concedes that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and was not denied an opportunity for judicial review. Indeed, he admits that his counsel at the removal hearing conceded his status as an aggravated felon and defendant did not appeal that determination to the BIA. Rather, Castillo-Martinez now submits that his counsel during the removal proceedings was constitutionally ineffective and thus his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies or seek judicial review should be excused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Assuming such an exception to the exhaustion requirement exists, defendant has not established that he is entitled to it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Soto-Mateo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339853\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/117/#p121\">\n    799 F.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121 (1st Cir. 2015).

While Castillo-Martinez's counsel conceded removability based on the prior state court conviction, his determination that the conviction was an aggravated felony was based on the controlling law in the First Circuit at the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Julce\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232474\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/30/\">\n    530 F.3d 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2008) (holding that a conviction under M.G.L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C constitutes an aggravated felony conviction for purposes of the INA),\n   <em>\n    abrogated by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232474\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/30/\">\n    530 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Castillo-Martinez would not have been allowed automatically to remain in the United States had his prior conviction not been considered an aggravated felony but rather would have had to apply for and be granted discretionary relief from removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i) (providing that any non-citizen \"convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance ... other than a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable\").
