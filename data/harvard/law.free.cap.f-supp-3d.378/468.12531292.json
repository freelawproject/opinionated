The defendants have also moved for attorney's fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-223.2\">\n    Va.

The court held a hearing on October 29, 2018, after which it ordered Edwards to file a supplemental brief (henceforth \"Supplemental Memorandum\") identifying which of the numerous statements set forth in the Amended Complaint allegedly give rise to causes of action under Count I and Count II. The court requested the Supplemental Memorandum include only those statements that fall within Virginia's statute of limitations period for defamation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n    Va.

Schwartz and Mays filed a response on November 16, 2018, ECF No. 30, and Lambrinidou filed a separate response on November 21, 2018, ECF No. 31. Upon thorough examination of the voluminous submissions made by the parties and for the reasons set forth herein, the motion to dismiss for want of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED in part,\n   </strong>\n   and the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts I-V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The controversy giving rise to this case relates to protracted personal, professional, and advocacy-related disputes concerning the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (\"Virginia Tech\") professor involved in exposing the contamination in Flint, Michigan, claims that prior to the events giving rise to this case, he \"enjoyed a distinguished reputation in the community at large and an unblemished professional reputation in the fields of education, science, and community advocacy.\" ECF No. 9, at 2-3. Edwards' causes of action in Counts I-V are predicated upon an allegedly defamatory letter (\"Letter\") published on May 10, 2018, \"as well as numerous subsequent dates,\" and a multitude of other statements made via \"Facebook posts, Twitter tweets, television interview, radio interviews, emails, correspondence,\n   and other public fora.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n    at 5, 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statements alleged as defamatory or defamatory per se fall into two categories: (1) those contained in the Letter, and (2) and those contained in communications made via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and elsewhere. It is the Letter, however, that by Edwards' own characterization, is \"at the heart of this case.\" ECF No. 21, at 4 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he case arises from this Letter ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Edwards asserts that the Letter marked the \"crescendo\" of a concerted and ongoing disparagement campaign conducted by the defendants against him that began in 2016. ECF No. 9, at 4. The Letter accuses Edwards of, among other things, speaking on behalf of Flint residents without their consent, engaging in \"[u]nsubstantiated defamation of Flint residents,\" and obstructing \"Flint's right for self-determination.\" ECF No. 9-1 ; ECF No. 27-1, at 2. In the course of this litigation, Edwards submitted three versions of the Letter for the court's review. Though each version of the Letter is substantively the same, the quantity and identities of the signatories differ. The first version of the Letter was submitted with the Amended Complaint as Exhibit 1, ECF No. 9-1, and featured the signatures of 39 Flint workers, parents, and residents, including Melissa Mays, as well as an Episcopal priest. It is this first version of the Letter that was apparently sent on May 10, 2018 as an email attachment to, among others, Virginia Tech president Timothy Sands, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the National Academy of Sciences, the Association of Environmental and Engineering Science Professors, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Science Foundation, and several individuals within Edwards' professional community or associated with the aforementioned organizations. ECF No. 9, at 6. The content of the email is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Esteemed President Sands,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Residents of Flint request you tell us where we can file a formal complaint against the behavior, since January 2016, of Professor Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech.

This was false because, on information and belief, Schwartz, Lambrinidou, and perhaps others participated in writing the Letter. According to an article for the East Village, the origins of the Letter were \"strategically cloaked a little bit because the idea is to avoid its being associated too closely with any one individual or individuals.\" An anonymous Facebook page created to disseminate the letter, flintcomplaints.com, stated that the Letter was \"crafted for us.\" According to an article published in the Roanoke Times, counsel for [d]efendants stated he did not know who compiled the Letter and, when asked who operated flintcomplaints.com, stated \"that information isn't public.\" This explicitly false statement that the Letter was entirely the work of Flint residents - without outside input - was intended to, and did in fact, add to the Letter's sting and thereby increase its damaging effect on Edwards professional reputation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ECF No. 9, at 12 ; ECF No. 27, at 2.

Elsewhere in his pleadings, Edwards similarly avers that the defendants, \"both individually and acting as conspirators in concert and together, and as members and representatives of a non-profit organization known as the Campaign for Lead Free Water, participated in drafting, signing, electronically communicating and/or mailing a damaging defamatory and tortious letter and email.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many of the allegedly defamatory statements in paragraphs 13(a) - 13(i) featured hyperlinks to third-party online materials, including newspaper articles, blog posts, an audio recording, and a transcript of remarks made by Edwards at Swarthmore College.

It was initially unclear to the court which of these communications (and statements contained therein) Edwards was alleging gave rise to causes of action for defamation, which were being offered as circumstantial evidence of intent, which were included in support of Counts III-V only, and which were presented merely to provide context. Following a hearing on October 29, 2018, the court requested, and Edwards later produced, the Supplemental Memorandum. In this memorandum, Edwards identified six communications and/or instances of alleged defamation besides the Letter. ECF No. 27, at 3-6. These additional communications are contained in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 63 of the Amended Complaint. Edwards also attached, as discussed above, the second and third versions of the Letter as exhibits. In this Supplemental Memorandum, Edwards also conceded that statements contained in paragraphs 49-51 of the Amended Complaint do not provide a basis for liability under Count I or Count II because they are time-barred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%208.01-247.1\">\n    Va.

For the reasons explained below, Edwards has failed to make a prima facie showing of specific personal jurisdiction as to the six claims arising out of the defamatory communications alleged in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 63 of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Edwards cannot satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   \"effects\" test, as elucidated in\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , to establish this court's jurisdiction over his claims that arise out of the defendants' social media activity (paragraphs 52, 55, 56, 63), Lambrinidou's late 2017 keynote presentations and related \"live tweet[s]\" made by an unnamed third party (paragraph 53),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   or Mays' February 27, 2018 interview on CAN TV, apparently available on YouTube (paragraph 54). Though alleging numerous instances of defamation arising out of communications on various media, Edwards does not separate these claims and/or causes of action into separate counts. Nor does he apparently regard any of the six additional communications identified above as separate claims for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction. That these six additional claims were pled collectively and presented under two umbrella counts, however, belies the fact that each constitutes a discrete cause of action arising under distinct circumstances for which a separate jurisdictional analysis is required. In other words, Edwards' pleading numerous instances of defamation under two counts does not relieve him of establishing, nor the court of evaluating, jurisdiction on a claim-by-claim basis. Indeed, \"it is well-settled that 'repeated defamations do not constitute a [single] continuing tort,' \" but\n   rather, \"as courts have uniformly recognized, each separate defamatory statement itself constitutes a separate and distinct cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

The\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   court reiterated that mere injury to a Virginia resident is not a sufficient connection to Virginia, and therefore, per\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , posting defamatory statements on social media, without more, does not constitute purposeful availment. The court then rejected McNeil's ancillary specific jurisdiction argument, refusing to allow those communications which did not arise from contacts with Virginia to piggyback on Count 5, which did involve communications (and statements) which the court concluded were expressly directed at Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Vis-\u00e0-vis those statements made during the \"telephone [call] and email\" to a police department in Virginia alleged in Count 5, the court held that \"[t]hat contact supports a finding of personal jurisdiction on Count V, which alleges defamation stemming from those precise communications.

There is no factual matter in Edwards' pleadings suggesting that the authors of these communications took affirmative steps to direct these communications into Virginia or had any intent to target or focus on Virginia readers or otherwise avail themselves of the benefits and protections of the laws of Virginia. Nor are there any facts indicating that a Virginia resident, or anyone at Virginia Tech, read, \"liked,\" reposted, or was even aware of the communications in question.

Lastly, there are no facts suggesting that any of the communications were published from Virginia, routed through servers located in Virginia, or were of special interest to Virginia readers. While it may be the case that Edwards' reputation, professional or otherwise, was damaged in Virginia, as discussed above, the \"Fourth Circuit ha[s] brushed back attempts to vest jurisdiction in a [s]tate based entirely or predominantly on the locus of the plaintiff's injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The court, on this record, cannot determine with any certainty the nature of defendants' contacts with Virginia vis-\u00e0-vis the claims identified in the Supplemental Memorandum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, that the allegedly defamatory post in paragraph 63 mentions Virginia Tech by name is insufficient to confer specific jurisdiction over Mays as to that claim.

To the extent Edwards bases Count I and Count II on statements alleged in paragraphs 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and 63, the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   These claims are\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED without prejudice.\n   </strong>\n   With that, the sole remaining source of liability are the allegedly defamatory statements contained in the Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Notwithstanding the dismissal of the claims above, the court will exercise specific jurisdiction over Mays as to the communication (and statements contained therein) \"at the heart of this case,\" namely the Letter sent via email to Timothy Sands, the president of Virginia Tech. ECF No. 21, at 4. Here, Edwards' averments satisfy the three-part test articulated by the Fourth Circuit allowing the exercise of jurisdiction in the Internet context. With respect to the first prong-direction of electronic activity in the forum-Edwards avers that the \"defendants each, both individually and acting as conspirators in concert and together, and as members and representatives of a non-profit organization known as the Campaign for Lead Free Water, participated in drafting, signing, electronically communicating and/or mailing\" the Letter to Edwards' employer, Virginia Tech. ECF No. 9, at 2. More specifically, Edwards claims that the Letter was sent to the president of Virginia Tech, Timothy Sands, (1) via email to president@vt.edu, and (2) via Twitter in a tweet to the \"handle\" @VTSandsman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. With respect to the second prong, Edwards'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   pleadings also adequately show that the email and accompanying Letter, on their face, evince a manifest intent to target Virginia Tech. Lastly, Edwards has adequately alleged that the Letter \"creates ... a potential cause of action [for defamation] cognizable\" in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   It is well established that transmission into the forum state of a communication can constitute purposeful availment if the content of that communication directly gives rise to an intentional tort cause of action. Here, the defamation claim arising from the Letter sent to the president of Virginia Tech, like the telephone call and email alleged in Count 5 in\n   <em>\n    McNeil\n   </em>\n   , manifests an intent to engage in interactions within Virginia. The Letter was clearly directed and \"expressly aim[ed]\" at a Virginia resident with the intent to effectuate an outcome in Virginia which, according to Edwards, was to \"attack and damage [his] professional reputation\" and \"discredit [his] work in his professional capacity as an employee of a University owned by the Commonwealth [of Virginia].\" ECF No. 21, at 29. Where an allegedly defamatory communication has been sent to particular recipient, courts have been willing to exercise specific jurisdiction. Indeed, cases involving analogues to emails, such as faxes, phone calls, and letters made or sent by out-of-state defendants to forum residents are routinely held to support specific jurisdiction when they directly give rise to the cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Neal v.

Further, they claim that the only jurisdictionally salient acts are the \"transmission of one or two tweets or emails from outside [Virginia]\" that went to dozens of individuals and organizations within the scientific and engineering communities writ large, of which Virginia Tech is only one institution out of many.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In short, the defendants assert that there was no purposeful availment, and that any tortious injury in Virginia was, at most, incidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The record, however, indicates that the sender(s) of the email (and Letter) specifically contemplated an \"effect\" in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The email containing the Letter was specifically addressed to the president of Virginia Tech, and requested that \"you,\" (president of Virginia Tech), (1) \"send representatives to Flint as soon as possible for a meeting ... to hear directly from us about our experiences with Mr. Edwards,\" and (2) conduct an investigation into Edwards' conduct and \"the harm his actions have caused.\" ECF No. 9-1. Thus, while it may have been the intention of the sender(s) to affect Edwards' conduct primarily as it relates to Flint, Michigan, there was clearly an intent to also affect Edwards at Virginia Tech. Indeed, the Letter, which paints a highly unflattering picture of Edwards, closes with the following statement: \"We are reaching out to you, key representatives of the scientific and engineering communities who keep awarding and rewarding Mr. Edwards for his behavior, because we need full protection from Mr. Edwards immediately. We also need an immediate investigation....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These statements clearly contemplate that some action be taken in Virginia by Virginia Tech to address Edwards' alleged misbehavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The argument that \"one or two tweets or emails\" is insufficient to establish purposeful availment is, as discussed above, without merit.

In light of the targeted nature of the email sent directly to the president of a university located in Virginia, and given the potential consequences to Edwards' career and contemplated \"effect\" of the email, this transmission suffices to sustain a finding of purposeful availment as to whatever defamatory statements are connected with this communication only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Having established that whomever sent the Letter via email to the president of Virginia Tech did so purposefully,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , with the manifest intent that some action be taken in Virginia, and that said transmission creates a potential cause of action cognizable in Virginia, the question then becomes whether Edwards has adequately connected each of the defendants to the transmission in question. In connection with Mays, Edwards specifically alleges that \"[p]ublicly available metadata from the Microsoft W[ord] document of the defamatory Letter ... indicates the Letter was saved on and distributed from ... Melissa Mays' computer (the Letter may have also been saved on and distributed from other defendants' computers).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.

Lastly, Edwards' Exhibit 1 indicates that Mays was a signatory to the Letter. While it is true, of course, that metadata suggesting the Letter was saved on Mays' computer does not prove definitively that it was also distributed from her computer, the allegations circumstantially connecting to her to its transmission, construed in the light most favorable to Edwards, suffice, if only just barely, to support the court's finding\n   that Edwards has carried his burden as to Mays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Edwards' allegations connecting Schwartz and Lambrinidou to the transmission of the Letter, however, are, as one court put it, \"gossamer thin and reed slender.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Indeed, Edwards concedes that the Letter only \"may have ... been saved on and distributed from other defendants' computers.\" ECF No. 9, at 23. To compensate for factual deficiencies as to these two defendants, Edwards quotes an article in the\n   <em>\n    East Village Magazine\n   </em>\n   explaining that \"the origins of the Letter were 'strategically cloaked a little bit because the idea is to avoid being associated too closely with any one individual or individuals.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.

Virginia has a strong interest in providing effective means of redress for its residents, including Edwards, who is also an employee of a public research university located in Virginia. Edwards also has an interest in litigating in his home state, and his interest in effective and efficient litigation is also satisfied in Virginia. The burden placed upon Mays in litigating in Virginia simply is not so great as to make unfair on that basis alone the exercise of jurisdiction. Lastly, the judicial system's interest in efficient litigation is also served by litigating defamation cases in the state where the statements were clearly directed and in which an \"effect\" was clearly contemplated. Mays has not met her burden of presenting other considerations that would make it unreasonable for the court to assert jurisdiction. Thus, the court holds that it may exercise specific jurisdiction over Mays vis-\u00e0-vis the allegedly defamatory statements contained in the Letter only.

The challenged Letter was, in fact, responding directly to disputes arising out of Edwards' Flint-related advocacy work. Finally, as for the fifth\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   factor, the record demonstrates that Edwards retained his limited-purpose public figure status at the time of the alleged defamation.

The court thoroughly reviewed the Letter as a whole and each of the allegedly defamatory statements in paragraphs 13(a) - 13(i) in the context in which they were made, as well as all of the parties' arguments. Many of the statements alleged in paragraph 13 plainly qualify as constitutionally protected opinion under\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   and its progeny because they are incapable of being proven true or false by a core objective evidence or are so tightly wrapped in loose, figurative, or hyperbolic language that they cannot be reasonably interpreted as stating or implying actual facts. Those few statements appearing to assert verifiable facts either lack the requisite defamatory sting, or are of such a character that a reasonable reader would recognize them as expressing only the speakers' subjective views on contested and emotionally-fraught matters of public concern. In assessing paragraphs 13(a) - 13(i), it is the task of the court not only to determine whether a statement is capable of a defamatory meaning, but also to \"examine ... the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see whether they are of a character which the principles of the First Amendment ... protect.\"\n   <em>\n    N.Y.

Edwards asserts, however, that the presence of a public debate does not provide license to intentionally publish falsehoods injurious to his reputation. The court agrees on both points. It is self-evident that the disagreements between the parties, recapitulated in Letter, are inextricably intertwined with the highly publicized health crisis in Flint, Michigan. The extent of the contamination of Flint's municipal water supply, once revealed, drew national media coverage and generated an emotionally supercharged public discourse, of which the Letter and many of the social media posts by and between the parties may properly be considered a part. In January 2016, both the state of Michigan and the federal government declared states of emergency in Flint, Michigan, and the crisis led to numerous congressional hearings, partisan finger-pointing, and substantial litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Flint Water Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527043\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/369/#p380\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380 (E.D.

That said, inasmuch as such a controversy informs the way in which a reasonable reader would interpret any given claim uttered in this context, the fact that the parties are \"opposing partisans in a heated and emotional public health debate,\" ECF No. 22, at 21, shades every statement made in the Letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwager v.

Edwards acknowledges that the acrimony between the parties derives from \"differences regarding community activism,\" the defendants' belief that he \"represents government interests and does not perform objective water testing,\" and disagreements regarding the \"results and methods of Edwards' water testing\" as well as his \"public statements.\" ECF No. 9, at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The parties each appear to operate or contribute to blogs and various social media accounts to advance their respective positions vis-\u00e0-vis the Flint water crisis and debate other advocacy-related issues. These same online media are also apparently being used by the parties to critique, ridicule, cast aspersions upon, and question each other's motives and/or intentions. In a series of emails and Facebooks posts to varied (or unspecified audiences), the defendants accuse Edwards of, among other things, (1) \"being co-opted by the [s]tate,\" (2) promulgating an \"imperial and colonial version of 'saving' us\" by \"belittling our knowledge, demands, organizing and mobilization in defense of our health,\" (3) engaging in conduct that \"silences and erases the people who are suffering from the multiple contaminants,\" (4) \" 'pimp[ing]' the disaster for personal and professional gain while ... compound[ing] our suffering by trotting us out when it is convenient\" and fits Edwards' \" 'hero' and 'rescue' story line,\" and (5) \"arrogat[ing] power and credit for [himself] and [his] chosen band that rightly belonged to the people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-22. In response to these and other statements, Edwards and a student apparently published blog posts wherein they attempted to counter some of the accusations levelled against. Indeed, there appears to have been an extensive and acrimonious back-and-forth between the parties via email, text message, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media spanning several years. These exchanges and the statements above reflect a discourse devolved in mudslinging of the sort that is, regrettably, commonplace today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Edwards' pleadings reveal that the extreme distrust between the parties spilled into the public sphere. In 2017, for example, Edwards states that\n   <em>\n    New York Times Magazine\n   </em>\n   published a profile article about him, in which defendants all made \"negative and harmful statements regarding [him] to a reporter that were included in the article.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The publication of the Letter, and presumably its contents, was also covered in an article published by\n   <em>\n    East Village Magazine.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Further, the Letter itself contains hyperlinks to online newspaper articles and posts from detroitnews.com, michiganradio.org, and theguardian.com, with headlines such as, \"Edwards: Flint witness falsified research claims,\" \"Scientific disagreements could affect special prosecutor's case in Flint water crisis,\" and \"Flint lead tainted water ... safe to use,\" respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-1, at 2. Insofar as the controversy surrounding the Flint water crisis and the disputes between the parties over advocacy-related matters were known to the public, this backdrop is probative as to how a reasonable reader of the Letter, fully aware of\n   the biases and confrontational posture of the parties in relation to one another, would react to and interpret the statements contained in paragraphs 13(a) - 13(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"628946,3805683\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/970/\">\n    750 F.2d at 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is one thing to be assailed as a corrupt public official by a soapbox orator and quite another to be labelled corrupt in a research monograph detailing the causes and cures of corruption in public service.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   With respect to the third\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   factor-the context of the challenged statements within the writing as a whole-the Letter is replete with emotional and polemical language, rhetorical hyperbole, and unmistakable indicia of partisanship. Indeed, there is absolutely no pretense of objectivity or disinterestedness. The email in which the Letter was attached begins by requesting those to whom it is addressed \"tell us where we can file a formal complaint against the behavior, since January 2016,\" of Marc Edwards, and states that the attached Letter is \"our full complaint\" expressing some of the signatories' \"concerns.\" ECF No. 9-1, at 1. The Letter is organized around four points numbered accordingly: (1) \"Violation of principle # 3 of the Jemez principles for democratic organizing,\" (2) \"Obstruction of Flint's right for self-determination,\" (3) \"Unsubstantiated defamation of Flint residents,\" and (4) \"To our knowledge, there is no one in the scientific community overseeing Mr. Edwards' work or the way he uses his power over powerless residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Under the first point, the authors express their frustration with Edwards about a formal complaint he allegedly filed against a Wayne State University professor. The authors claim that the complaint \"does nothing to help the residents of Flint move toward recovery,\" \"has caused more strife, stress and drama that we do not need, want or deserve,\" and was presented by Edwards as the grievances of Flint residents \"without speaking to us first or securing our permission to take this action on our behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. The authors sarcastically state that the formal complaint filed against this professor, Shawn McElmurry, should have been titled \"Marc Edwards v. Whomever He Chooses,\" and reaffirm that \"Flint residents have their own voice and never asked [Edwards] to speak for us....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They then state that Edwards' claims of representing Flint residents is \"hollow,\" and \"[t]hose who haven't figured this out yet should ask themselves why it is that Mr. Edwards' only evidence of working with 'the residents' is a tired show of the same group of 2-3 individuals who are embedded with Mr. Edwards and loyal to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Under the second point, the authors state, among other things, that the \"[r]esidents of Flint object to Mr. Edwards fighting his own petty and vicious fights against anyone and everyone he sees as a challenger or competitor ... all under the guise of 'protecting' and 'saving' us, or 'defending' science.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. They further claim that many residents of Flint are \"exhausted\" with Edwards' \"Hollywood antics - this is not Entertainment Tonight,\" and are fearful that Edwards' \"glib, reckless, and egotistical conduct may hamper the ongoing criminal investigation into the Legionnaires deaths in our city, which we see as the only form of justice we might achieve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Edwards' conduct, the authors claim, creates \"additional and totally undeserved worry [that] suddenly adds to the stress and chaos we already feel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Under the third point, the authors take umbrage with several of Edwards' purported statements concerning bathing habits in Flint and express their disapproval of accusations Edwards allegedly leveled against those they consider allies to their cause in Flint and who provided Flint residents\n   with certain information about bacteria growth on filters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The authors further criticize Edwards' alleged portrayal of them, stating that \"we WANT science that addresses our questions, experiences, and needs,\" and that \"[w]hat scares us is Mr. Edwards who uses his position as a scientist to misrepresent us and silence us.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Finally, under the fourth point, the authors, among other things, call on Edwards to focus \"on our LIVES, our first-hand EXPERIENCES, our NEEDS, and on the fact that we are still suffering.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Letter closes by requesting that \"you, key representatives of the scientific and engineering communities,\" provide \"full protection from Mr. Edwards immediately,\" an \"immediate investigation\" that puts their \"voices at the center,\" and \"a committee that that includes academics, professionals, and Environmental Justice leaders who have expertise in abuses of professional power against poisoned communities like Flint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Lastly, there is a definite and palpable current of exasperation throughout the Letter, as evidenced by use of capitalization to underscore words such as NEEDS, LIVES, EXPERIENCES, and statements such as (1) \"WE are the ones who have always led and continue to lead the activism on the ground ... Mr. Edwards' work wouldn't be possible without US,\" and (2) \"Mr. Edwards' choice to initiate drama distracts from the real suffering in Flint and needs to stop NOW.\" ECF No. 9-1, at 1-4. The emphasis on the first-person tense (\"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\") and exaggerated rhetoric (e.g., \"this is not Entertainment Tonight,\" \"Mr. Edwards v. Whomever He Chooses\") put the reader on notice the Letter is an \"inherently subjective enterprise.\"\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"628946,3805683\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/970/\">\n    750 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   988 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCabe v.

It is possible that a particular statement may imply an assertion of objective fact and thus constitute actionable defamation. The court will, as it must, proceed by assessing the allegedly defamatory statements contained in paragraphs 13(a) - 13(i) individually. The court will pay close attention, per the first and second\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   factors, to whether the authors' choice of words supports or negates any impression that a challenged statement asserts or implies defamatory facts and to the question of verifiability.

In\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   , the court explained the significance of verifiability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   The reason for this inquiry is simple: a reader cannot rationally view an unverifiable statement as conveying actual facts. Lacking a clear method of verification with which to evaluate a statement ... the trier of fact may improperly tend to render a decision based upon approval or disapproval of the contents of the statement, its author, or its subject.

Further, merely calling for an \"investigation,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an inquiry, in the context of an ongoing public controversy, does not, in and of itself, imply a defamatory fact.

What is clear, however, is that context is frequently dispositive as to whether imputing dishonesty is actionable or qualifies as non-actionable opinion or hyperbole. In his treatise on defamation, Judge Robert D. Sack explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   The terms 'lie' and 'liar' are frequently used to characterize statements with which the speaker vehemently disagrees. If in context the words mean that the defendant disapproves, it is a protected epithet.

Following an appearance on a live broadcast program during which she spoke on the topic of \"homosexuals in the military,\" Faltas offered and subsequently wrote a newspaper op-ed in\n   <em>\n    The State\n   </em>\n   arguing that homosexuality was rarer than science suggested.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 640.\n   <em>\n    The State\n   </em>\n   ultimately published four critical responses to Faltas' op-ed piece, only one of which (dated May 23, 1993) was the subject of the defamation action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 641. The author of the May 23 response, who was also a named defendant, first criticized the newspaper for initiating a \"campaign of homophobia,\" and then made the following allegedly defamatory statement: \"Marie Faltas in her op/ed piece amazed us with her spurious and twisted logic. When she stated that gay men are likely to have taken estrogen, she offered no statistics to back up her claim and showed us how much she will lie to suit her agenda. The study that she espoused as the truth-the study that claims that only 1 percent of the population is gay-did not have a representative population or a scientifically correct questioning method ... Faltas views her status as physician as an opportunity to present lies as truth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Faltas alleged that the author and several of the newspaper defendants defamed her by printing the May 23 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   The court, after finding that Faltas qualified as a limited-purpose public figure because she voluntarily assumed a role of special prominence in a public controversy and \"volatile debate,\" distinguished the facts before it from those in\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   . While both the May 23 response in\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   and the article in\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   involved \"statements that someone lied or is a liar,\" the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court held that the \"similarity ends there.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 645, 647. In\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court noted, the challenged statements had been written by a sports writer who stated in his regular column that Michael Milkovich, a local high school coach, had lied under oath, an indictable offense, during a hearing into the cause of\n   a physical altercation at a wrestling match.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 647-50. The column bore the heading, \"[High School] beat the law with the 'big lie,' \" and subheading, \"[the author] says [High School] told a lie.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The column itself contained the following language which, in context, clearly referred to Milkovich: (1) \"[the students learned a] lesson which, sadly, in view of the events of the past year, is well they learned early,\" (2)\"[i]t is simply this: If you get in a jam, lie your way out,\" and (3) \"[i]f you're successful enough, and powerful enough, and can sound sincere enough, you stand an excellent chance of making the lie stand up, regardless of what really happened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unlike the author of the May 23 letter, the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court noted that the columnist in\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   (1) \"described himself as perhaps the only disinterested person to observe the match,\" (2) \"repeatedly and clearly stated that the plaintiff had lied under oath (the crime of perjury),\" using the terms \"lie\" or \"liar\" nine or more times, and (3) indicated that the plaintiff \" 'had lied, under oath, about what occurred on a given date at a given time - an 'objectively verifiable' event.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 647-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court noted that the May 23 letter was responding to Faltas' own op-ed piece, which was itself written on a \"highly controversial topic\" \"as to which 'experts' obviously disagree, often in less than collegial tones.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In this context, the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"reasonable reader would presume the letter is an impassioned response to the positions taken by ... Faltas in her article, and nothing more.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that the allegedly defamatory statements in question, in context, translate to an accusation that plaintiff \"baldly states conclusions without data\" or, at worst, \"manipulated or ignored statistics.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 649. The court held that \"[w]hen it comes to 'imaginative expression' and 'rhetorical hyperbole,' few terms have enjoyed so frequent an association in the common culture as the term[ ] 'lie' and 'statistic.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The author's statements in the May 23 response, written on a topic as to which \"emotions and verbal exchanges often ran hot,\" were therefore found to \"fall within the protection afforded for 'hyperbole.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, in support of finding the accusations of lying about issues concerning homosexuality non-actionable, the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court noted that underlying scientific issues were not \"easily susceptible (if at all) to 'proof' one way or the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The facts before the court in this case, as well those pertaining to the challenged statements specifically at issue in paragraph 13(d), are of a feather with those in\n   <em>\n    Schnare, Arthur\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Faltas.\n   </em>\n   Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Schnare\n   </em>\n   , the parties have \"positioned themselves on opposite sides of [a] controversy\" related to the Flint water crisis, and the \"ongoing tension [between the parties] figures prominently\" throughout the Letter and would not go unnoticed by readers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177748\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/104/847/#p851\">\n    104 F. App'x at 848-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The particular characteristics (e.g., responsive posture, derisive tenor, and loose language) immediately surrounding the challenged statements in paragraph 13(d) are closely analogous to those characteristics present in the aforementioned cases, alerting readers that the Letter generally is akin to an \"opinionated and hyperbolic screed\" within which the statements at issue are construable only as an \"expressions of disagreement\" or \"expression[s] of contempt toward [an] adversary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177748\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/104/847/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2177748\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/104/847/#p851\">\n    at 852-853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   What is more, determining the falsity of the claim that Flint residents caused or contributed to the shigella outbreak by altering their bathing habits, as in\n   <em>\n    Arthur\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   , would mire the court in a scientific debate of the sort courts are loathe to resolve in defamation actions. Indeed, Edwards has explicitly stated his\n   intent to lead the court, and trier of fact, into just such a morass about the causes of the shigella outbreak by introducing at trial a CDC presentation \"explicitly stating that altered bathing habits contributed to Flint's shigella outbreak.\" ECF No. 21, at 24.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwager v. Salter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511243\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/22/730/#p736\">\n    22 F.3d 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 736 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding that \"[the plaintiffs] cannot, simply by filing suit and crying 'character assassination,' silence those who hold divergent views,\" and that \"[S]cientific controversies must be settled by the methods of science rather than by methods of litigation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Furthermore, several crucial dissimilarities the\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   court identified between the facts before it and those in\n   <em>\n    Milkovich\n   </em>\n   apply with equal force in the present matter. First and foremost, there is no pretense of disinterestedness nor any semblance of non-partisanship on the part of the authors of the Letter. The authors and/or signatories do not claim to be \"disinterested\" or impartial observers, nor would a reasonable reader come away with that impression. It would be extremely apparent to even the most credulous reader that the parties are adversaries in a heated public controversy, and that any statement uttered in this context should be received with a heavy dose of skepticism or discounted altogether. Moreover, as in\n   <em>\n    Faltas\n   </em>\n   , the underlying issues in paragraph 13(d), what \"Flint residents\" in general were told about shigella and when and what caused the reported outbreak are unamenable to being proved true or false by a core of objective evidence or by reference to \"what occurred on a given date at a given time - an 'objectively verifiable event.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3464527\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/928/637/#p649\">\n    928 F.Supp. at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, a reasonable reader would recognize that the authors are merely labelling positions with which they vehemently disagree as lies, and would recognize the use of the term \"lie\" in paragraph 13(d) as expressions of dissent rather than as assertions that Edwards made a specific claim knowing it to be false.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwager v.

He claims these alleged implications are factually false because he has never used his position as a scientist to misrepresent or silence Flint residents or anyone else. ECF No. 9, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The complained-of statement is plainly non-actionable both because it is a rhetorical statement employing loose, figurative language and because it is unverifiable. No reasonable reader would believe the authors use of the word \"silence\" to mean that Edwards was literally silencing the signatories. Nor would a reasonable reader interpret the use of the term \"misrepresent\" as implying an assertion of fact, rather than reflecting authors' subjective views. Indeed, it is clear that \"[s]uch words\n   were ... used ... in a loose, figurative sense\" to demonstrate the signatories' disagreement with Edwards generally over a variety of matters. Indeed, considering the general tenor of the language immediately surrounding the challenged statement: \"We (of course) bathe, which is why we have been saying that the problems with our water are not over.... \"[W]e WANT science that addresses our questions, experiences and needs ... [s]cience has [never] scared us ...,\" it is apparent that the authors were expressing frustration and indignation at claims by others regarding an emotionally-charged and sensitive subject, namely the personal hygiene and bathing habits of Flint residents, and used hyperbolic, freewheeling, figurative speech to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Further, paragraph 13(e) does not contain provably false content required to support a defamation claim. The court cannot imagine a circumscribed basis or core of objective evidence by which a jury could verify the challenged statement in paragraph 13(e) given the absence of any discernible, objective parameters in the statement itself. Indeed, any attempt to prove the falsity of the statement in paragraph 13(e) would engender an open-ended inquiry into the subjective judgments of the thirty-nine signatories of the Letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Finally, for the same reasons that the statement is unverifiable, no reasonable reader would interpret paragraph 13(e) as implying that the authors possess knowledge of damaging, undisclosed facts of the sort necessary to support a defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ollman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"628946,3805683\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/970/\">\n    750 F.2d at 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Insofar as a statement lacks a plausible method of verification, a reasonable reader will not believe that the statement has specific factual content.\").\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    (6) Paragraph 13(f)\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   In May 2016, Mr. Edwards erroneously accused Scott Smith and Water Defense of scaring residents out of bathing ...

No reasonable reader would conclude that Edwards uttered this objectionable phrase or that it was otherwise a faithful recitation of comments and positions taken by Edwards vis-\u00e0-vis issue of Flint residents' bathing habits. Though Edwards quarrels with the negative implications of this, and other characterizations throughout the Letter, such implications do not transform what is plainly an expression of opinion into a statement of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Lastly, Edwards claims he never \"made erroneous accusations regarding Scott Smith, Water Defense or FACHEP,\" as he always \"referred to and cited ... CDC statistics regarding Flint bathing habits in keeping with his professional obligations.\" ECF No. 9, at 10. This ambiguous averment admits of two possible interpretations: (1) Edwards is claiming to have never accused Scott Smith, Water Defense, or the FACHEP of scaring Flint residents out of bathing in the first place, or, (2) although Edwards did accuse the aforementioned parties of scaring Flint residents, it was not incorrect (\"erroneous\") of him to do so. The court assumes that Edwards' intended the latter interpretation, as it appears to comport more with the plain language of his claim to have always \"referred to and cited ...

ECF No. 9, at 10. Here, again, it is theoretically possible to verify whether Edwards has \"repeatedly spoken and written about how there are no bacteria or dangerous pathogens in Flint residents' water.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tharpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Va.%20476\">\n    285 Va. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=737%20S.E.2d%20890\">\n    737 S.E.2d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the critical defamatory statement was not embedded in the content of the quotation attributed to the plaintiff, but rather in the objectively verifiable fact that the statement was never made). It may also be the case that making such a \"sweeping generalization\" is, as Edwards claims, in some contexts \"inappropriate\" or \"irresponsible\" for a scientist. Nevertheless, no reasonable reader would conclude, given the \"sweeping,\" categorical nature of the attributed statement, that it represents anything other than the authors' tendentious paraphrasing or subjective, oversimplified rendering of a statement that may or may not have been made by Edwards. In other words, a reasonable reader of the Letter or observer of this controversy is unlikely to construe any allegedly attributed statement or claim literally, or as a reliable indicator of what Edwards actually said or meant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Yet, even if the court assumes otherwise, the allegedly false attribution at issue and those implications averred by Edwards, lack the requisite \"sting\" for actionable defamation under Virginia law. While there is no uniform standard in Virginia for assessing actionable \"sting,\" especially where false attribution is at issue, several cases suggest the degree of injury to a person's reputation required to state a claim for defamation and defamation per se. In\n   <em>\n    Echtenkamp v. Loudon Cty. Pub. Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9118335\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/1043/#p1063\">\n    263 F.Supp.2d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063-64 (E.D. Va. 2003), for example, the court found that the following statements by the defendant about Echtenkamp in the employment context were neither defamatory per se, nor bearing sufficient \"sting\" under a general defamation standard: (1) Echtenkamp behaved inappropriately during a student-counseling group by \"insulting\" and \"contradicting\" the defendant; (2) Echtenkamp was inept at handling a situation involving two disabled students; (3) Echtenkamp must continue to become more accepting of others' opinions and that many colleagues perceive her as \"manipulative and defensive,\" and (4) Echtenkamp needs to develop greater sensitivity to the reactions of others and to monitor her behavior. The\n   <em>\n    Echtenkamp\n   </em>\n   court found that these statements were not defamatory because \"they cannot be construed to imply that [Echtenkamp] is unfit for or lacks integrity in performing her duties or to prejudice the plaintiff in her profession, nor are they severe enough to make plaintiff appear odious, infamous, or ridiculous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9118335\" index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/1043/#p1063\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9118335\" index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/263/1043/#p1063\">\n    at 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Here, of course, Edwards claims that the statement at issue was falsely attributed to him rather than made about him to a third party. The holding in\n   <em>\n    Echtenkamp\n   </em>\n   , however, suggests that regardless of whether the statement was made by or about Edwards, substantially greater sting is necessary to state a claim than that which Edwards asserts the allegedly false attribution at issue in paragraph 13(g) is imbued with. In other words, that Edwards may have made a single \"inappropriate\" or \"irresponsible\" comment, especially a comment as facially unremarkable as the one at issue, is not sufficiently prejudicial to Edwards' professional reputation to constitute defamation per se or defamation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sepmoree v.

In light of the defendants' admission that Edwards never \"technically\" uttered the word \"tribal,\" enclosing \"tribal\" in quotation marks makes this statement qualitatively different and potentially more misleading than the rest of the allegedly defamatory statements in the Letter. Typically, the use of such punctuation signifies verbatim speech. Indeed, quotation marks are \"used chiefly to indicate the beginning and the end of a quotation in which the exact phraseology of another or of a text is directly cited,\" and, under most circumstances, a reader would expect quotations marks denote a faithful representation of language used by another. Merriam-Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 942 (1981). In the present case, however, a reasonable, circumspect reader of the Letter, (1) cognizant of the broader and immediate context in which this statement was made, (2) buffeted by roughly twelve paragraphs of emotionally-charged commentary and criticisms of Edwards, and, crucially, (3) mindful of the way in which quotations marks were consistently used throughout the Letter, would not interpret the challenged statement as a direct quotation, but rather as yet another subjective characterization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Trading, Inc. v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   , the Letter is manifestly not a piece of journalistic writing, and no reasonable reader would credit any of its contents as such. Nor would a reasonable reader expect scrupulous factual accuracy from a document purporting to represent the views of dozens of individuals sent from a generic, semi-anonymous email address (flintcomplaint@gmail.com) unconnected to a single speaker. Moreover, the Letter is at no point framed in a way which might lull a reasonable reader into taking any of\n   part of the statements contained therein at face value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   To the contrary, the exasperated tenor, advocative style, and responsive posture would invariably lead a reasonable person to expect something less than scrupulous factual accuracy. The sentence immediately preceding the statement at issue, for example, reads: \"Ultimately, Mr. Edwards' focus, and the focus of any specialist claiming 'save' us, should be on our LIVES, our first-hand EXPERIENCES, our NEEDS, and on the fact that we are still suffering.\" ECF No. 9-1, at 3. Later in the same paragraph of the Letter, the authors state: \"We believe it would be best that Mr. Edwards now leaves our town alone.... Mr. Edwards' choice to initiate drama distracts from the real suffering in Flint and needs to stop NOW.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108062\" index=\"498\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/496/#p511\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, the sentences surrounding the challenged statement are among the more rhetorically saturated and emotionally charged in the whole of the Letter, with a predominate tone of urgency, exasperation, and resentment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   Most importantly, throughout the Letter, quotation marks are used rhetorically in a manner that cannot rationally be interpreted as verbatim representations of words Edwards actually uttered. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   , where Malcolm provided no reason for a reasonable reader to conclude that the quoted attributions to Masson were anything but verbatim, the consistent (and nearly exclusive) use of quotation marks in the Letter as a rhetorical device make it unreasonable for a reader to construe the use of this punctuation around the word \"tribal\" as a direct quotation faithful to Edwards' words. The following are salient examples of the rhetorical use of quotation marks in the Letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-273\">\n   (1) Michigan residents never asked Mr. Edwards to file this complaint on our behalf, nor do we as a \"group\" support it, so the complaint should be titled \"Marc Edwards vs. Whomever He Chooses ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   (2) Mr. Edwards' claims that he represents \"the people of Flint\" or works \"with Flint residents\" are hollow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   (3) Mr. Edwards fighting his own petty and vicious fights ..., all under the guise of \"protecting\" and \"saving\" us, or \"defending\" science.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-276\">\n   (4) Far too many residents in Flint are exhausted from Mr. Edwards's bullying, his claims to be the \"humanitarian\" who so \"cares\" for the people, and his Hollywood antics - this is not Entertainment Tonight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Nowhere in his pleadings does Edwards allege that the use of quotation marks in any of the above statements would be understood as direct quotations. Nor could Edwards advance such an argument. The authors are obviously employing quotations marks around single words, such as \"save,\" \"humanitarian,\" or \"cares,\" or short phrases, such as \"the people of Flint,\" to express sarcasm, skepticism, and contempt, or to draw attention to propositions with which the authors disagree or wish to distance themselves. This peculiar use of quotations marks, colloquially referred to as \"sneer\" or \"scare\" quotes, throughout the Letter would substantially negate any impression that the complained-of statement represents a direct quotation or straightforward reproduction of Edwards' remarks. Edwards' failure to specifically allege false attribution as to any of the above statements appears to be a tacit acknowledgment of this point. In sum, unlike the article that was the subject of the defamation suit in\n   <em>\n    Masson\n   </em>\n   , the Letter provides numerous clues that quotation marks are being used rhetorically, such that a reasonable reader would not assume\n   the marks imply that Edwards himself used the word \"tribal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   In sum, none of the statements alleged by Edwards to be defamatory are of such a character sufficient to support a defamation action.
