Good Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The fundamental issue in this case is the likelihood that Petitioner will be removed from the United States in the \"reasonably foreseeable future\" as defined in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas.\n   </em>\n   Respondents contend that \"there is a significant likelihood of [Petitioner's] removal in the foreseeable future\" and \"Petitioner's detention is thus legally justified.\" Resp. to Pet. 3, ECF No. 7. They state that Petitioner is a native and citizen of Cambodia, and that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement \"submitted a request for travel documents to Cambodia for Petitioner in January 2019.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 5. Respondents have also asserted that Petitioner was to attend a \"citizenship interview\" with the Cambodian government on March 25, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. They argue these actions render Petitioner's claim to be \"without merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner has shown good cause for discovery by making specific allegations that are both capable of further factual development and fundamental to the merits of his claim for relief. In his motion seeking discovery, he insists he \"needs access to information clarifying a factual question created by existing information in the case.\" Pet'r's Mot. for Discovery 5. He also states that, while \"the Cambodian Government has corresponded with the United States while Petitioner has been detained[,] Petitioner has never been interviewed or otherwise met with Cambodian Government officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Petitioner also claims that his assigned Deportation Officer informed him that the Cambodian government has previously \"claimed that Petitioner was not Cambodian but Vietnamese.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Notably, Petitioner's assertion that he has not been interviewed by Cambodian officials was made after the March 25, 2019, date Respondents claimed he would be doing so, and has not been contradicted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Respondents also do not explicitly contradict Petitioner's claim that he was told the Cambodian government does not recognize him as one of their citizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. to Mot. for Discovery 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Respondents' assertions that Petitioner seeks to go on a \"fishing expedition\" and is making claims based on \"mere speculation[,]\" are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Respondents essentially ask the Court to deny Petitioner discovery because he has failed to obtain material which would be in their possession if it exists, and thus only available to Petitioner through discovery. Further, their contention that \"Petitioner's proposed discovery requests would trigger an obligation for Respondents to search, review, and produce countless hard copy and electronic documents and files,\" is not a substantive argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Petitioner has shown good cause exists to authorize limited discovery, his motion seeking the authorization of discovery (ECF No. 9 ) is granted in part and denied in part. The parties are to confer and submit a joint discovery plan within fourteen (14) days. If the parties are unable to agree on such a plan, they are to notify the Court and provide three agreeable dates for a hearing or telephone conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SO ORDERED, this 5th day of April, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (\"Habeas Rules\") are applicable to petitions brought under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Annamalai v.
