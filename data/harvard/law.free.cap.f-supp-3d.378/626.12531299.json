Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in this proposed putative class action allege that Defendant FCA's 2007-2012 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 diesel trucks (the \"Trucks\" or \"Affected Vehicles\"), equipped with 6.7-liter Turbo Diesel engines manufactured by Defendant Cummins Inc., emit nitrogen oxides (\"NOx\") at levels that exceed federal and state emissions standards and the expectations of reasonable consumers. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased their trucks on the basis of advertising from defendants that touted the trucks as more fuel efficient and environmentally friendly than other diesel trucks. Plaintiffs allege that despite marketing the trucks as containing \"clean diesel engines,\" Defendants knew the trucks discharged emissions at levels greater than what a reasonable customer would expect based on the alleged representations. The instant Complaint alleges violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO Act\"), the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"), and consumer protection, breach of contract, and fraudulent concealment laws of 50 states as well as the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' second consolidated and amended class action complaint (ECF Nos. 67, 68) pursuant, in part, to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b), 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). For the reasons outlined below, Defendants' motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice as they pertain to the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act, but\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as they pertain to all other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs seek to bring claims on behalf of themselves and a nationwide class of all persons or entities in the United States who, as of November 1, 2016, owned or leased a 2007 to 2012 Dodge Ram 2500 or Dodge Ram 3500 pickup truck equipped with a Cummins 6.7-Liter diesel engine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also seek to establish sub-classes representing owners and/or lessees of the Trucks in every state and the District of Columbia, alleging deceptive advertising, breach of contract, and fraudulent concealment claims under the laws of those respective states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The instant complaint-the Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\")-is Plaintiffs' third complaint before this Court on these claims. This Court previously granted Defendants' motions to dismiss Plaintiffs' first amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, ECF No. 22 ; Motions to Dismiss, ECF Nos. 26 &amp; 27; Op. and Order, ECF No. 60. In that Opinion, this Court explained the role of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") in determining acceptable levels of emissions from diesel-engine vehicles. ECF No. 60, PageID.8281-83. This Court observed that Plaintiffs' claim that Defendants' installed a \"defeat device \"in the trucks was supported by four purported factual allegations. ECF No. 60, PageID.8288. Despite these allegations, Plaintiffs' complaint failed to state a claim for relief that was plausible on its face.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

FCA Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 68, PageID.10250-10251 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe v. FCA US LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524939\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/307/646/#p657\">\n    307 F.Supp.3d 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657-59 (E.D. Mich. 2018) (available at ECF No. 60 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This is an incorrect reading of the Court's previous Order. While that Order made it clear that other decisions had found complaints to plausibly allege the presence of specific defeat devices by coupling PEMS testing results with testing from third-parties, the Court did not create any specific two-factor test or requirement. The key inquiry, as the Court explained is whether \"the totality of the allegations amounted to plaintiffs having plausibly pled that the products received did not live up to the claims made by Defendants.\" ECF No. 60, PageID.8305 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Mercedes-Benz Emissions Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207106020\">\n    2016 WL 7106020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.N.J. Dec. 6, 2016) ) (quotation marks omitted). Plaintiffs need to make specific allegations of fact capable of plausibly showing the\n   presence of a defeat device. Here, Plaintiffs present a detailed accounting of their own extensive PEMS testing, plus chassis dynamometer testing, plus data logging, plus an allegation of a specific defeat device that causes the vehicle to enter active regeneration more frequently in real world driving than when the vehicle senses it is being tested for regulatory compliance. In other words, Plaintiffs have included allegations of considerably expanded testing, extensive details about the nature of the testing, and have alleged the presence of at least one specific defeat device. They also provided factual allegations of an alleged \"motive\" by defendants for engaging in the alleged fraud. Defendants have each moved for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 8(a), 9(b), 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Motions to Dismiss, ECF Nos. 67, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a. AECDs and Defeat Devices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Every vehicle that is sold in the United States must first be issued a certificate of conformity (\"COC\") by the EPA that indicates the vehicle meets federal emissions standards, and an Executive Order (\"EO\") by the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") indicating it meets California's emissions regulations (if it is to be sold in California). ECF No. 62, PageID.8385-8390. When an automobile manufacturer seeks to obtain a COC and an EO they must disclose all Auxiliary Emission Control Devices (\"AECDs\") present in the vehicle. ECF No. 62, PageID.8340-8341; Cummins Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 67, PageID.9685-9686; FCA Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 68, PageID.10258. AECDs are devices that alter the normal operation of the emissions system in a vehicle. ECF No.67, PageID.9685-9686; ECF No. 68, PageID.10258-10259. AECDs are necessary to ensure adequate performance in certain scenarios, and are not illegal on their own. ECF No. 68, PageID.10259. But when an AECD is designed to circumvent emissions standards requirements, and is not disclosed in the application for a certificate of conformity, it is called a \"defeat device,\" and it is illegal. ECF No. 68, PageID.10259. The discovery of \"defeat devices\" in certain Volkswagen vehicles created an international scandal that led to billions of dollars in fines and awards against that company, as well as tremendous reputational harm. ECF No. 62, PageID.8340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vehicle emissions testing commonly occurs on a device called a chassis dynamometer. ECF No. 62, PageID.8430. This device works like a treadmill for cars and trucks: the wheels are on rollers that allow them to spin freely, but the vehicle never moves. ECF No. 62, PageID.8422. This setup allows test operators to run the vehicle through a variety of tests that simulate actual load on the engine as if they are driving on a road, but without moving the vehicle at all.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207106020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Volkswagen vehicle scandal, a \"defeat device\" was installed on millions of vehicles that was designed to recognize when the vehicle was being tested,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to\n   change the vehicle's emissions to meet the standards, even though actual on-road emissions were much higher. ECF No. 62, PageID.8472-8473. Those \"defeat devices\" were first discovered by researchers at the Center for Alternative Fuels Engines and Emissions (\"CAFEE\") at West Virginia University who examined results obtained through a \"portable emission measurement system,\" or \"PEMS\" test. ECF No. 62, PageID.8436. Those researchers were operating under a contract from the International Council on Clean Transportation, which mandated that they use PEMS testing. ECF No. 62, PageID.8436; ECF No. 62, PageID.8429 at n.60. Furthermore, Plaintiffs allege that \"both CARB and EPA make wide use of PEMS to evaluate vehicles for the presence of defeat devices.\" ECF No. 62, PageID.8429. For instance, Plaintiffs allege that CAFEE worked in collaboration with CARB in discovering the VW defeat devices. ECF No. 62, PageID.8429.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs allege here that \"the vehicle[s] perform ... differently in a test environment (on the dynamometer) than in the real world (PEMS testing), which should not be the case unless the emissions system has been set up with a device to turn the system off or down during real-world testing.\" ECF No. 62, PageID.8337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiffs also allege Defendants manufactured the Trucks to include \"defeat devices\" that alter the Trucks' performance so that they perform within the range of compliance when tested under regulatory conditions, but not during normal on-road use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs rely centrally on twelve main factual allegations in their Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") to support these claims. ECF No. 62. To ensure that their complaint crosses the threshold line of plausibility-and therefore survives the motions to dismiss-plaintiffs need to allege enough factual matter to allow this Court to draw a reasonable inference that there is a \"defeat device\" in the trucks, and that presence of such a device caused economic harm to plaintiffs, creating a right of action under federal and state laws. Plaintiffs made the following twelve well-pleaded factual allegations in support of their claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. Diesel engines pose unique environmental challenges, and the U.S. responds with specific regulations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   B.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In their previous motions to dismiss, defendants called on the Court to decide how much factual matter must be pleaded to establish more than conclusory allegation. Defendants make the same request now. They say that Plaintiffs have filed a repackaged version of the dismissed amended complaint, and failed again to plead more than conclusory allegations related to the presence of \"defeat devices\" in the trucks. As noted above, although the Court accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, conclusory allegations are not entitled to the same assumption of truth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eidson v.

Plaintiff's Vehicle Testing Supports a Plausible Allegation That \"defeat devices\" are Present in the Trucks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In their first amended complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that they conducted portable emission measurement system (\"PEMS\") testing on a single 2012 Dodge Ram 2500, and that this testing showed high levels of NOx emissions. First Amended Complaint, ECF No. 22, PageID. 1567-69. But plaintiffs did not include relevant and material information about the condition of the truck, or the parameters of the testing, such as the altitude or incline at which testing occurred. Put simply, Plaintiffs failed to plausibly allege the presence of a defeat device-the results from their PEMS testing results could have been explained in\n   other ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons and others, this Court granted defendants' motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiffs' SAC has far more detailed information\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   about the PEMS testing they conducted in furtherance of this lawsuit, and a better explanation of why this level of testing should be acceptable to the Court. Plaintiffs PEMS-tested three Dodge Ram 2500 trucks equipped with the 6.7 liter Cummins diesel engine: a 2007 with 41,000 miles, a 2009 with 48,000 miles, and a 2012 with 73,000 miles. ECF No. 62, PageID.8427.

ECF No. 62, PageID.8423; PageID.8437-38. The FTP-75 cycle has three phases to recreate the dynamic changes in speed and acceleration experienced during city driving and the steady high speeds of highway driving.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though the FTP-75 is normally performed on a dynamometer, Plaintiff's aver that they designed on-the-road testing that recreated the stop-and-go conditions created in the FTP-75 cycle, but with a PEMS device attached to the truck. ECF No. 62, PageID.8438.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The trucks in question are outfitted with a \"Diesel Particulate Filter\" that traps and removes particulate matter from the trucks' emissions. ECF No. 62, PageID.8342. The trucks also have a \"NOx adsorber catalyst\" that captures and reduces NOx into less harmful substances before releasing those into emissions. ECF No. 62, PageID.8342. Because it traps particulates, the Diesel Particulate Filter is prone to getting bogged down and clogging. To avoid this, the aftertreatment engages in \"regeneration,\" where the particulate matter in the Diesel Particulate Filter is burned off at very high temperatures. ECF No. 62, PageID.8398-8399. Regeneration can be passive or active. Passive regeneration is when the Diesel Particulate Filter has high enough levels of NOx that the temperature inside gets hot enough on its own to burn the particulate matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.8398. Active regeneration is when the temperature is not hot enough on its own, so a small amount of fuel is injected directly into the Diesel Particulate Filter, causing a small combustion reaction and burning the particulate matter off.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.8398-8399. Active regeneration destroys certain particulate matter, but also creates additional NOx pollution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because it uses fuel and creates a combustion reaction that is downstream of other elements of the exhaust cleaning system, active regeneration creates higher than average emissions,\n   and the EPA limits how frequently a vehicle enters active regeneration in normal use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.8399.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that most diesel aftertreatments are configured in this order:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   DIESEL OXIDATION CATALYST ? DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER ? NOX REDUCTION CATALYST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ECF No. 62, PageID.8399.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This arrangement works well because NOx passes through the Diesel Particulate Filter first, helping to cause passive regeneration to occur. Also, the NOx Reduction catalyst is positioned to capture the additional NOx pollution created by regeneration events before it is expelled from the vehicle. Plaintiffs allege that the 6.7L Engine's aftertreatment is instead configured like this:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   DIESEL OXIDATION CATALYST ? NOX ADSORBER CATALYST ? DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ECF No. 62, PageID.8400. Plaintiffs allege that this arrangement removes NOx before it enters the Diesel Particulate Filter, so the Diesel Particulate Filter is unable to engage in passive regeneration as often as needed to prevent particulate build up. To compensate, the aftertreatment must engage in relatively frequent active regeneration, which should-according to Plaintiff-cause excessively high emissions and poor fuel efficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Using the 2007 truck, Plaintiffs performed stop-and-go testing over 506 miles, conducting 90 individual tests. ECF No. 62, PageID.8438. Plaintiffs allege that the average emissions produced in these tests were 4.4 times the standard, and the vehicle entered active regeneration cycles 10 times more frequently than disclosed in certification documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The 2009 truck was also tested in stop-and-go conditions over 453 miles, over a total of 92 tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This truck averaged 5.3 times the standard for emissions, and also entered active regeneration cycles 10 times more frequently than required by certifications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, the 2012 truck was tested in stop-and-go conditions over 987 miles, for a total of 181 individual tests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638319\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/631/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.8439. This truck averaged 3.8 times the standard for emissions, and entered active regeneration cycles six times more frequently than required by certification. ECF No. 62, PageID.8439.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the results of their tests, plaintiffs allege that \"Cummins introduced a defeat device to dramatically increase the active regeneration frequency to an average of 14.6% in driving closely approximating the FTP-75 certification cycle and 13.3% in steady speed highway driving-7 to 10 times the values permitted by the reported upward adjustment factors.\" ECF No. 62, PageID.8426. Plaintiffs allege that the defeat device recognizes when the vehicle is being tested or not, allowing the vehicle to meet emissions standards in testing only. Plaintiffs allege that their test results have been controlled for other variables and can only be explained by the presence of a \"defeat device.\" Reviewing all of these detailed allegations, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have corrected the deficiencies in their previous complaint and has plausibly alleged that the trucks have a \"defeat device\" in them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court must also answer the question of whether this well-pleaded allegation-that the trucks contain a \"defeat device\"-is enough to plausibly support state law claims of deceptive practices (consumer protection), fraudulent concealment, and breach of contract, as well as federal claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ) and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202301\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ).
