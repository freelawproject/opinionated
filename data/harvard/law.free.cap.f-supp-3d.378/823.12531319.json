Orrick, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Genus Lifesciences Inc. (\"Genus\") is a competitor of Lannett Company Inc. and Cody Laboratories, Inc., Lannett's wholly owned subsidiary, in the market for cocaine hydrochloride nasal spray. It is suing Lannett and Cody for false advertising and maintaining a monopoly related to Lannett's production of C-Topical\u00ae (\"C-Topical\"), a cocaine hydrochloride solution that competes with Genus' own cocaine hydrochloride solution, GOPRELTO\u00ae (\"Goprelto\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also sues First Databank, Inc. a pricing list company that compares drug products and their prices so that wholesalers and customers can see all the alternatives available for a particular medication, for false advertising and contributory false advertising. Some of Genus's claims against Lannett and Cody are plausibly stated, but none against First Databank is because First Databank's challenged statement in the pricing list was not \"commercial speech\" and First Databank did not influence Lannett's conduct about which Genus complains. Accordingly, First Databank's motion to dismiss is granted and Lannett and Cody's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Genus claims that Lannett and Cody falsely advertise, market, and promote C-Topical as approved when it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). Complaint at \u00b6\u00b6 1-5 [Dkt. No. 1]. It also asserts claims against Lannett and Cody for engaging in anticompetitive conduct aimed at maintaining a monopoly and preventing Genus from occupying a place in the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Otolaryngologists (commonly known as ear, nose and throat specialists, or ENTs) use Lannett's product, Goprelto, while performing intranasal medical procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. On December 14, 2017, the FDA granted approval of Goprelto's New Drug Application 209963.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. To gain\n   approval, Genus performed five clinical trials and ten non-clinical trials involving over 700 human subjects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. The FDA approved Goprelto \"for the induction of local anesthesia of the mucous membranes when performing diagnostic procedures and surgeries on or through the nasal cavities in adults.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. The FDA determined that Goprelto's route of administration is \"nasal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The drug's packaging, label, and package insert are regulated and approved by the FDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34. As the first FDA approved cocaine product, Goprelto was awarded new chemical exclusivity, which bars any third-party applicant from seeking FDA approval until December 14, 2022.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 135.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   C-Topical and Goprelto have the same active ingredient, the same strength, and the same dosage form, making them commercially equivalent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127. Both drugs are interchangeable for certain medical uses, including Goprelto's approved indicated use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Unapproved Marketed Drugs and FDA Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Today, most prescription drugs marketed in the United States must have FDA approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36. To legally market a drug, a company has several options. It may obtain approval of a new drug application (\"NDA\") or approval of an abbreviated new drug application (\"ANDA\") for generic drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67. A drug may also be exempt from the NDA requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exempt drugs include \"grandfathered\" drugs, drugs subject to an ongoing drug efficacy study implementation proceeding, drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective, and drugs marketed in accordance with a final or tentative over-the-counter drug monograph.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 1984, after about 40 infants died after taking unapproved vitamin intravenous injections, the FDA created a program called the \"Prescription Drug Wrap-Up\" to identify the universe of unapproved drugs in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40. The FDA identified approximately 5,150 unapproved, marketed products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the FDA, each of these drugs is illegally marketed unless the manufacturer establishes that the drug is \"grandfathered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A drug is grandfathered if, among other requirements, its composition and labelling have not changed since the October 10, 1962 enactment date of an amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2006 and 2011, the FDA published \"guidances\"-nonbinding recommendations-to encourage makers of unapproved drugs to seek formal NDA approval for their products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. The stated goals of the 2006 guidance were to \"(1) clarify to FDA personnel and the regulated industry how we intend to exercise our enforcement discretion regarding unapproved drugs and (2) emphasize that illegally marketed drugs must obtain FDA approval.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The FDA's 2006 guidance also stated that in cases where one drug was approved but had unapproved competitors, there would generally be a grace period of one year before the FDA initiated enforcement action against the unapproved drug. Guidance for FDA Staff and Industry: Marketed Unapproved Drugs-Compliance Policy Guide (2006) at 6, attached as Exhibit 6 to Compliant [Dkt. No. 1-1]. Although C-Topical's grace period would have ended in December 2018, the FDA does not appear to have taken any action against Lannett or Cody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The FDA has Not Approved C-Topical\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lannett commercially launched C-Topical at least as early as 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Lannett was the sole supplier of cocaine hydrochloride solution products to ENTs from 2012 until Genus's launch of Goprelto\n   in 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. C-Topical had a monopoly on the market after Lannett's only competitor at the time withdrew from the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Genus claims that Lannett falsely advertises C-Topical as \"grandfathered,\" as a \"preliminary new drug application\" product, as FDA approved, as a generic of Goprelto, or as a branded drug pursuant to a NDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 12, 2015, the FDA rejected Lannett's request that C-Topical be grandfathered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-60; Exhibit 15 (\"FDA Rejection Decision\") attached to Compl [Dkt. No. 1-1]. The FDA found that the evidence provided by Lannett was inadequate to support a conclusion that either cocaine hydrochloride products in general, or Lannett's drug in particular, met the requirements of the grandfather clause. Compl. at \u00b6 59; FDA Rejection Decision at 16. Nevertheless, Lannett claimed that C-Topical was grandfathered in a number of Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings and investor calls in between December 2017 and September 2018. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 51-54; Exhibits 10-14 attached to Compl. [Dkt. No. 1-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Genus also claims that Lannett has advertised C-Topical as being legally marketed under a \"preliminary new drug application\" in a number of SEC filings. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 63-66; Exhibits 2, 13, 14 attached to Compl. [Dkt. No. 1-1]. It argues that the FDA does not permit production or marketing of prescription drug products under a \"preliminary new drug application\" and that the phrase is a fictitious regulatory category fabricated by Lannett. Compl. at \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Genus points out that Lannett's meta description for its C-Topical webpage is misleading: it states, \"Learn more about the facts and characteristics of the generic pharmaceutical C-Topical\u00ae Solution CII.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74. A meta description is the one or two sentences that appear underneath the blue clickable links in a search engine results page.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. Meta descriptions come from HTML code written by the owner of the webpage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78. But C-Topical is not a generic pharmaceutical product because it does not have an approved ANDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. At the time the complaint was filed, the FDA had not approved any ANDAs for any cocaine hydrochloride products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Genus also accuses Lannett and Cody of intentionally misleading customers into falsely believing that C-Topical is FDA approved by making the product packaging look like an approved FDA drug, maintaining a website with the package insert information, and registering a trademark for C-Topical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-88. For example, the C-Topical bottle label contains what Genus describes as the hallmarks of an FDA approved label: storage conditions, prescribing information, national drug codes, controlled substance marks, lot numbers, expiration dates, the date when the bottle label was last revised, the \"Rx Only\" symbol, strength of the dosage form, bar code, \"Lannett\" as the labeler, and \"Cody Laboratories, Inc.\" as the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. Genus points out that C-Topical's packaging and packaging insert do the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. Lannett also has maintained a website for C-Topical that displays similar sections as the package insert for an FDA approved product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In addition, Genus complains that Lannett and Cody maintain misleading general websites. Lannett's website identifies it as a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer whose leadership is committed to adherence to FDA standards and compliance with regulatory requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-91. Similarly, Cody's website states that \"Cody Laboratories is committed to compliance with all Local, State, and Federal requirements and regulations governing\n   [its] business, especially FDA, DEA,\" that Cody's \"active pharmaceutical ingredients are used in FDA approved commercial drug products,\" and that Cody is \"actively engaged in continuous improvement of [its] quality systems in accordance with current FDA guidance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. Genus contends that this is misleading because the FDA has not approved C-Topical but the drug is listed as a product on both websites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Lannett Advertises C-Topical as Appropriate for Oral, Laryngeal, or Nasal Topical Administration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lannett advertises C-Topical as a \"topical solution ... indicated for the introduction of local (topical) anesthesia of accessible mucous membranes of the oral, laryngeal, and nasal cavities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107. Genus claims that this falsely implies that a cocaine hydrochloride solution product has been approved by FDA for oral or laryngeal uses, when no such product has ever been approved in that way.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111. By advertising C-Topical for oral and laryngeal use, Lannett misleads customers into believing that C-Topical has more uses than Goprelto, making it a more desirable and better product because Goprelto is only approved as an intranasal product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 112-113\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    The Role of Third Party Intermediaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Genus further contends that Lannett provides incomplete or false information to third party intermediaries in the supply chain of pharmaceutical products, including wholesalers, group purchasing organizations (\"GPOs\"), integrated delivery networks (\"IDNs\"), and third party managed price lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95. In the pharmaceutical industry, customers (pharmacists, hospitals, and doctors) often purchase prescription drugs from wholesalers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96. Manufacturers contract with wholesalers to provide a certain amount of a product and the wholesaler advertises the product to customers through proprietary databases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wholesalers collect information about the product directly from the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For instance, Lannett sells C-Topical to McKesson Corp., a wholesaler who distributes in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   McKesson's website indicates that C-Topical is generic and does not state that it is unapproved by the FDA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As an alternative to wholesalers, some hospitals and hospital pharmacies form GPOs and IDNs to negotiate discounts with manufacturers and wholesalers in exchange for ordering a greater volume of products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97. They also collect information about particular products directly from the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Wholesalers, GPOs, and IDNs also rely on companies that aggregate third-party drug pricing information (\"price lists\"), including defendant First Databank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. Price lists provide pricing information for drugs and their pharmaceutical equivalents by maintaining databases that compare drugs and their prices so wholesalers and customers can see the available alternatives to a particular product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These companies, including First Databank, assign unique identifying codes for each drug, allowing for price comparisons of equivalent products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, a customer can search for \"cocaine hydrochloride\" and pull up all available cocaine hydrochloride products and their associated prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Price list companies also collect information about a particular product directly from the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Genus accuses Lannett of providing incomplete or incorrect information to wholesalers, GPOs, IDNs, and price lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 99. It states that Lannett does not identify C-Topical as unapproved to these third party intermediaries, and as a result, they are unable to accurately describe C-Topical\n   as unapproved and customers are unable to differentiate Goprelto and C-Topical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 100. It argues that this results in a material misrepresentation to customers because FDA approval status carries with it an assurance as to the quality of the product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101. It also cites a study that states that in a nationwide survey of pharmacists, 91% thought all products pharmacists dispense are FDA approved.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102. Taken together, Genus argues that customers are misled to believe that C-Topical is FDA approved and choose to purchase C-Topical over Goprelto on that basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    First Databank's Listing Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First Databank assigns a unique clinical formulation ID (\"CFI\") to drugs based on ingredients, strength, dosage form, and route of administration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116. Drugs with the same attributes are assigned the same CFI and \"linked\" so that when a customer searches for one product on First Databank's database, the other will appear as a substantive alternative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Genus complains that since C-Topical's route of administration is listed as \"topical\" and Goprelto's is listed as \"intranasal,\" the two drugs are given different CFI numbers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117. As a result, third parties and customers searching for, or reordering, C-Topical may not see Goprelto listed as an alternative and will be misled into believing that C-Topical is the only cocaine hydrochloride drug available on the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 118-120. Genus further states that First Databank knowingly contributes to Lannett's false advertising because it notified First Databank about the allegedly misleading advertisement of C-Topical no later than October 2, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Lannett and Cody's Anticompetitive Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even after the launch of Goprelto, Lannett and Cody have maintained more than 99% of the market of cocaine hydrochloride in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 125. Genus alleges that the relevant market to determine if Lannett and Cody engaged in anticompetitive conduct is the market for cocaine hydrochloride solution, including both FDA approved and unapproved versions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126. Cocaine hydrochloride solution is unique because it is the only nasal product that is both a vasoconstrictor and local anesthetic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 128. No other drugs on the market, besides Goprelto and C-Topical, combine these two characteristics.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Genus alleges that a small, but significant, non-transitory price increase would not induce customers to shift their purchases to an alternative drug or combination of drugs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Genus accuses Lannett and Cody of devising an anticompetitive scheme to interfere with Genus's access to potential customers and exclude it from the market by manipulating First Databank's product categorization processes. Since the route of administration listed for C-Topical is different, C-Topical would have a different CFI number than Goprelto and customers would not find Goprelto, as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 136-144. Genus believes that if both products were assigned the same CFI number, they would compete for customers on the basis of price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 142. But because the CFI numbers are different, and C-Topical had a monopoly on the market for a number of years, customers are generally not aware that Goprelto exists and will not find it when searching for or reordering C-Topical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 143. As a result, between June 2018 and September 2018, Genus sold only 544 bottles of Goprelto while Lannett sold over 45,000 bottles of C-Topical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 145. This difference is even starker given that Goprelto is sold for a lower price than C-Topical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Genus's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Genus brings claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act, California's false advertising law, California's unfair competition law, and monopolization under the Sherman Act against Lannett and Cody.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 150-177, 213-219. It asserts claims for contributory false advertising against Cody and First Databank under the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 178-188, 200-212.

This rationale does not extend to false advertising to price lists and other third party intermediaries because there are no other supporting allegations, such as the surveys Genus cites with relation to its customers.

These cases are unhelpful to Lannett. Its landing page would not disabuse a consumer of the notion that C-Topical is generic based on the meta description.

Compl. at \u00b6 116. But Lannett's allegations related to Genus's efforts on only a single promotional channel cannot give rise to a monopolization claim because \"[i]f competitors can reach the ultimate consumers of the product by employing existing or potential alternative channels of distribution, it is unclear whether such restrictions foreclose from competition any part of the relevant market.\"\n   <em>\n    Omega Envtl., Inc. v.

Further, Genus does not contend that First Databank will be more successful or have a monetary interest in whether customers of cocaine hydrochloride choose to buy C-Topical, rather than Goprelto. The complaint does not assert that there is some particular quid-pro-quo relationship between Lannett and First Databank, where First Databank gets a kickback from sales of C-Topical that it would not receive from sales of Goprelto.

But this would be true for every drug listed on the pricing database, including Goprelto, and cannot reasonably be characterized as a quid pro quo relationship for the purposes of this case.

Servs.\n   </em>\n   test).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Under this test, Genus's claims fail as well because it has not alleged that First Databank intentionally induced the primary Lanham Act violation by Lannett, or that First Databank continued to supply an infringing product to Lannett. Although the tests in\n   <em>\n    Duty Free\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ADT Sec. Servs.\n   </em>\n   are different, the same theory animates both: the party accused of contributorily infringing essentially drives the infringing party's conduct. Here, Genus's theory is the opposite. It cannot state a claim for contributory false advertising under its preferred test or under First Databank's preferred test. Genus's contributory false advertising claim against First Databank is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Lannett's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Genus's claims based on its statements contained in SEC forms or made during investor calls, its alleged misstatements to third party intermediaries, the statements on Lannett's own website, the label and package of C-Topical, and on its Sherman Act claims are dismissed with leave to amend. It is denied in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   First Databank's motion to dismiss is granted. Genus's false advertising claim is dismissed with leave to amend. Its contributory false advertising claim is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    Genus's apparent attempt to add a sheen of criminality by calling C-Topical \"Lannett's Cocaine Drug\" is not well taken.
