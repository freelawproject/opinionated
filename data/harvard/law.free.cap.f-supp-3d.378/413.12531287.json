Briefing having been completed, the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For the following reasons, defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case returns to this court following dismissal of plaintiff's original complaint, in order entered July 25, 2017,\n   <em>\n    Hancock v. Americo Fin. Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273255\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/272/763/#p779\">\n    272 F.Supp.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 (E.D.N.C. 2017), and mandate of the Fourth Circuit, dismissing appeal and remanding to this court, with instructions to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=723%20F.%20App%27x%20241\">\n    723 F. App'x 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (4th Cir. 2018). In accordance with that mandate, plaintiff filed amended complaint on July 11, 2018. Where plaintiff's amended complaint is substantially similar to the original complaint, and where it fails to state a claim for many of the same reasons relied upon in order entered July 25, 2017, the court reiterates herein many components of that order, augmented through discussion of law and issues raised in the instant amended complaint and briefs of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on October 14, 2016, asserting claims against defendants arising from the sale by defendant Investors Life Insurance Company of North America (\"Investors Life\") of a \"Flexible Premium Adjustable Life Insurance Policy\" to plaintiff in February 1985,\n   policy number 303 1163280 (the \"policy\"), and collection of premiums thereunder through October 2013. Plaintiff claims that defendant Investors Life, in conjunction with the other defendants who are allegedly affiliated entities, breached the terms of the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his original complaint, plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract; declaration and injunction; equitable rescission; unjust enrichment and constructive trust; fraudulent suppression and concealment; fraud; breach of duties of good faith and fair dealing; as well as violations of North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDTPA) and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In his amended complaint, plaintiff again asserts claims for breach of contract; declaration and injunction; equitable rescission; unjust enrichment and constructive trust; as well as violation of UDTPA. He has not reasserted the remaining tort claims from the original complaint. Plaintiff continues to seek compensatory, trebled, and punitive damages and certification of the case as a class action on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, as well as attorney's fees. As before, plaintiff attaches a copy of the policy to the amended complaint. He also relies in this instance upon a declaration of Tim Cody Ryles, Ph.D., an accredited advisor in insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion to dismiss on August 24, 2018, asserting that all claims fail as a matter of law and should be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The court stayed scheduling activities pending decision on the motion. Plaintiff responded in opposition to the instant motion on October 5, 2018, and defendants replied on October 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The facts alleged in the complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   may be summarized as follows.

If the policy is surrendered before the Maturity Date, the proceeds shall be the cash surrender value described in the Nonforfeiture Provisions section, less any Indebtedness. On the Maturity Date, the proceeds shall be the cash value, less any indebtedness.

The cash value and monthly deduction are described in the Nonforfeiture Provisions section. If such premium is not paid within the grace period, all coverage under this policy will end at the end of the grace period, We will mail to the last known address of you and any assignee of record a written notice of insufficient cash value at least 31 days before the end of the grace period. If the Insured dies during the grace period, we will deduct any overdue monthly deductions from the benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). The \"PREMIUMS\" section of the policy also includes provisions regarding \"reinstatement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thereafter, the policy includes a section titled \"INSURANCE COVERAGE PROVISIONS\" providing information about termination of coverage and death benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The next section of the policy titled \"NONFORFEITURE PROVISIONS\" includes the following additional provisions, pertaining to \"CASH VALUE\" and deductions therefrom:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   CASH VALUE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   On each Monthly Anniversary Day, the cash value shall be calculated as (1), plus (2), plus (3), minus (4) where:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) is the cash value on the prior Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) is all premiums received since the prior Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) is interest on items (1) and (2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   If premium is received at any time other than the Start of a policy month, the rate of interest will be determined pro rata from the date of receipt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (4) is the monthly deduction for the month after the Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   On a day other than a Monthly Anniversary Day, the cash value shall be the cash value as of the prior Monthly Anniversary Day; plus all premiums received since The prior Monthly Anniversary Day, increased by interest. The cash value on the Date of issue shall be the initial premium received, less the monthly deduction for the policy month after the Date of Issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The policy then separately defines the \"MONTHLY DEDUCTION\" to include a charge for \"COST OF INSURANCE,\" which in turn is calculated as set forth in the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   COST OF INSURANCE RATES\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The monthly cost of insurance rate is based on the sex, age on the prior policy anniversary, and premium class of the Insured. Monthly cost of insurance rates will be determined by us, based on our expectations as to future mortality of people in the same class. Any change in cost of insurance rates will apply to all people of the same class as the Insured. The cost of insurance rates will never be more than those shown on the Insured Table of Guaranteed Maximum Insurance Rates page. Such guaranteed maximum rates are based on the 1958 Commissioners' Standard Ordinary Mortality Table, Age Nearest Birthday; plus any risk factors for any rated premium class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13). The table referenced is one of the four initial tables at the front of the policy, which shows the cost of insurance for each age group, between 0 and 94 years. For example, the rate for age 33 (plaintiff's age at policy inception) is 0.29008, whereas the rate for age 65 (plaintiff's age at filing of complaint) is 3.98456. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \"INTEREST RATE\" is defined as set forth in the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   INTEREST RATE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The guaranteed interest rate applied in the calculation of cash value is .32737 percent per policy month, compounded monthly. This is the same as 4 percent per year, compounded yearly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Interest in excess of the guaranteed rate may be applied in the calculation of cash values. Such increased rates will be set in such manner as we may determine. They may change from time to time, but not below the guaranteed rate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   A different rate of interest may be applied to the part of the cash value which secures a policy loan. This rate will not be less than the guaranteed interest rate of .32737 percent per policy month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The policy then includes the following further provisions regarding cash value:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   INSUFFICIENT CASH VALUE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   If the cash value, less any Indebtedness, on the day before a Monthly Anniversary Day is not enough to cover the monthly deduction for the month after such Monthly Anniversary Day, the policy will end as provided in the Grace Period provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   CONTINUATION OF INSURANCE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In the event planned periodic premium payments are not continued, insurance coverage under this policy and benefits provided by rider will be continued until the cash value, less any Indebtedness, is not enough to cover the monthly deduction, except as provided in the Grace Period provision. This provision shall not continue the policy beyond the Maturity Date. It will not continue riders beyond the date for their termination, except as provided in the riders. At the Maturity Date, we will pay you the cash value if the Insured is living.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The remainder of the policy includes provisions concerning surrender, policy loans, settlement options, a waiver of monthly deduction disability benefit rider, an other insured convertible term insurance rider, and a children's term life insurance rider. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Subsequent to issuance of the policy, defendant Investors Life began to increase plaintiff's monthly premiums \"and the cash value of his policy was taken by Investors Life and used to pay itself the increased premium.\" (Compl. \u00b6 54). Plaintiff first became aware of this increase via communications with defendant Investors Life in October 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that point, plaintiff became aware that \"Investors Life had increased his premiums over a decade earlier and had been taking money from the cash value of the policy to cover the difference between the $ 44.62 (after a rider was added increasing the initial $ 41.27 premium) he dutifully paid every month and the steadily increasing premiums [defendant] Investors Life was charging.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"When Investors Life had completely depleted the cash value of [plaintiff's] policy so that his cash value could no longer be used to pay the increasing premiums, his monthly premium payments skyrocketed from approximately $ 41.00 a month to $ 160.00 a month.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant Americo Financial Life and Annuity Insurance Company (\"Americo\") purchased defendant Investors Life in 2008.

Premiums\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiff's breach of contract claim based upon increased premiums fails because the policy allows for increased premiums and sets out circumstances in which increased premiums will be necessary to keep the policy active.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Multiple provisions, read in context of the policy as a whole, allow for increased premiums. The cover of the policy states that it is a \"flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy,\" and it says nothing about all premiums remaining constant during the term of the policy. (DE 32-2 at 1). The policy specifications state \"THE MINIMUM INITIAL PREMIUM IS $ 41.27,\" and the \"PLANNED PERIOD PREMIUM [IS] $ 41.27.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At the middle of the same page, the specifications provide a \"NOTE\" stating that \"THE AMOUNT OF CASH VALUE PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE DEPENDS UPON\n   <em>\n    THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUMS YOU PAY\n   </em>\n   ,\" and \"COVERAGE WILL END PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE SHOWN WHERE ...\n   <em>\n    SUBSEQUENT PREMIUMS ARE INSUFFICIENT\n   </em>\n   TO CONTINUE COVERAGE TO DATE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   These provisions are further informed by additional terms and details in the policies demonstrating that premiums may increase. For example, the policy states, under bolded heading \"INSUFFICIENT CASH VALUE,\": \"If the\n   <em>\n    cash value\n   </em>\n   , less any Indebtedness, on the day before a Monthly Anniversary Day is not enough to cover the\n   <em>\n    monthly deduction\n   </em>\n   for the month after such Monthly Anniversary Day, the policy will end as provided in the Grace Period provision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13) (emphasis added). That \"GRACE PERIOD\" provision provides, in turn: \"If the\n   <em>\n    cash value\n   </em>\n   , less any Indebtedness, on the date before a Monthly Anniversary Day is less than the\n   <em>\n    monthly deduction\n   </em>\n   for the month after that Monthly Anniversary Day, you will have a grace period of 61 days from that Monthly Anniversary Day\n   <em>\n    to pay a premium which is enough to cover that monthly deduction\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10) (emphasis added). As such, the policy states in plain terms that a premium payment may be needed \"which is enough to cover [the] monthly deduction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Where the terms \"cash value\" and \"monthly deduction\" are further defined in the policy, this provision also points to further details regarding how the premium payment may change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In particular, under the bold section head \"NONFORFEITURE PROVISIONS\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   and subsection \"CASH VALUE,\" the policy provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   On each Monthly Anniversary Day, the\n   <em>\n    cash value\n   </em>\n   shall be calculated as (1), plus (2), plus (3), minus (4) where:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) is the cash value on the prior Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (2) is all premiums received since the prior Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (3) is\n   <em>\n    interest\n   </em>\n   on items (1) and (2)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (4) is the\n   <em>\n    monthly deduction\n   </em>\n   for the month after the Monthly Anniversary Day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12) (emphasis added). In turn, the \"MONTHLY DEDUCTION\" is defined as including a charge for \"cost of insurance\" calculated according to a table which shows the cost of insurance for each age group, between 0 and 94 years. The rate for age 33 (plaintiff's age at policy inception) is 0.29008, whereas the rate for age 65 (plaintiff's age at filing of complaint) is over ten times that amount, 3.98456. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The \"interest rate\" is defined as a \"guaranteed interest rate\" of \"4 percent per year, compounded yearly,\" which is a guaranteed minimum insurance rate that \"may change from time to time, but not below the guaranteed rate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Accordingly, in order to maintain the cash value of the policy, in light of deductions for cost of insurance, premiums necessarily must rise substantially as the cost of insurance increases ten-times in amount over a period of 30 years, unless there is a corresponding\n   <em>\n    rise\n   </em>\n   in interest rate to offset the increase in monthly deduction. As noted by plaintiff, interest rates did not remain at their initial applicable rate; indeed, \"interest rates were certain to decrease,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53), and in fact \"interest rates returned to historic norms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). Therefore, premium increases were allowed and nearly inevitable based on the terms of the policy and the interest rates applicable to the policy. As such, defendants did not breach the terms of the policy by increasing plaintiff's premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the policy is ambiguous as to whether premiums can rise, pointing to policy provisions that plaintiff contends suggest otherwise. For example, plaintiff notes that the \"planned periodic premium\" was specified in the policy as $ 41.27 and that \"this nomenclature gives no hint that the premium was variable\" and language in the policy \"clearly suggests that coverage would continue unless the planned periodic premium payments are not continued.\" (Pl.'s Mem. (DE 40) at 12). Plaintiff quotes the \"PLANNED PERIODIC PREMIUMS\" section of the policy, which states, inter alia, \"Changes in the amounts or frequency of planned periodic premium payments and payment reminder notices will be subject to our approval,\" and \"You may change the planned periodic premium to any amount not less than $ 20.\" (DE 32-2 at 9). Plaintiff argues that these provisions make clear that only the insured can increase his premiums, and that defendant Investors Life has no authority to increase premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   A policyholder could only interpret the policy in this manner, however, by ignoring key remaining terms in the policy, including those in the \"GRACE PERIOD\" and \"CASH VALUE\" provisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 12). The fact that the policyholder can change the amount of planned premium payments does not extinguish other provisions in the policy that require maintenance of cash value, dependent upon an accounting of all premiums received and interest against deductions. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   32-2 at 10 (providing grace period to \"pay\n   <em>\n    a premium which is enough\n   </em>\n   to cover that monthly deduction\" and stating \"[i]f\n   <em>\n    such premium\n   </em>\n   is not paid within the grace period, all coverage under this policy will end at the end of the grace period); 12 (defining \"cash value\" as including \"\n   <em>\n    all premiums\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   \" and interest minus monthly deduction, and then tying monthly deduction to cost of insurance); 13 (providing that \"[i]f the cash value, less any Indebtedness, on the day before a Monthly Anniversary Day\n   <em>\n    is not enough to cover the monthly deduction\n   </em>\n   ... the policy will end as povided [sic] in the Grace Period provision.\")) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   It is impossible to read all the terms of the policy together, to credit \"[e]ach word,\" and construing all clauses \"to bring them into harmony,\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8561396\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/276/348/#p354\">\n    276 N.C. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20S.E.2d%20518\">\n    172 S.E.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without allowing for increases in premiums to make up for insufficient cash value to maintain coverage. The only way plaintiff's construction of the policy could function, with planned period premiums alone guaranteed to continue coverage until maturity date, would be by deleting altogether or substantially altering multiple provisions of the policy, including the \"GRACE PERIOD,\" \"CASH VALUE,\" \"MONTHLY DEDUCTION,\" \"INTEREST RATE,\" \"COST OF INSURANCE,\" \"COST OF INSURANCE RATES,\" and \"INSUFFICIENT CASH VALUE\" sections of the policy. (DE 32-2 at 10, 12-13). This court \"may not, under the guise of interpreting an ambiguous provision, remake the contract and impose liability upon the company which it did not assume and for which the policyholder did not pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Wachovia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8561396\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/276/348/#p354\">\n    276 N.C. at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20S.E.2d%20518\">\n    172 S.E.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Other arguments by plaintiff follow a similar pattern. For example, plaintiff contends the \"GRACE PERIOD\" section \"could reasonably lead the average consumer to believe that this grace period provision would apply only if the insured had elected to incur 'indebtedness,' which could occur either by borrowing from the policy's cash value or choosing to decrease the monthly premium payments.\" (Pl.'s Mem. (DE 40 at 24)). The \"GRACE PERIOD\" provision, however, is not limited to circumstances in which a policyholder incurs Indebtedness. Rather, the \"less any Indebtedness\" phrase is necessary because the \"CASH VALUE\" formula does not itself include a reduction for Indebtedness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 32-2 at 12). Moreover, limiting the \"GRACE PERIOD\" provision to instances of Indebtedness would lead to absurd consequences because coverage would continue indefinitely even if the cash value was insufficient to pay the monthly deduction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiff also suggests that the policy does not allow defendants to use variations in interest rate to require an increase in premiums. For instance, plaintiff argues that \"the policy does not state that the interest rate to be used in calculating cash value was variable.\" (Pl.'s Mem. (DE 40) at 26). The policy expressly states, however, that \"Interest in excess of the guaranteed rate may be applied in the calculation of cash values,\" and that interest rates \"may change from time to time, but not below the guaranteed rate\" specified at 4%. (DE 32-2 at 12). The policy also directly ties the cash value, in part, to the amount of interest applied to the prior month's cash value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Thus, by virtue of the cash value formula, without an increase in premiums received, the cash value of the policy may decrease in the event of an interest rate decrease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiff cites five out-of-circuit district court cases as examples of instances where courts allowed breach of contract claims to continue on the basis that \"universal life policies like the one at issue here are ambiguous.\" (Pl.'s Mem. (DE 40) at 27-78). These cases, however, are instructively distinguishable for multiple reasons. As an initial matter, two of the cases apply contract law from different jurisdictions that, as stated, is in conflict with North Carolina law as set forth herein.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feller v.

Plaintiff does not make similar factual allegations here, and the law as stated herein does not allow the court to avoid rules of construction in favor of using parol evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, plaintiff fails to demonstrate a breach of contract based upon increased premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   b. Improper drafting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that defendants have breached \"their contracts of insurance with\" plaintiff and putative class members by \"wrongfully and improperly drafting universal life insurance policies to be ambiguous and nearly indecipherable\" to plaintiff with regard to key contract provisions. (Compl. \u00b6 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   As an initial matter, this part of plaintiff's claim fails as a matter of law because plaintiff has not alleged facts permitting an inference of the existence of any \"contracts of insurance\" with plaintiff apart from the policy. Thus, drafting provisions of the policy in a certain manner cannot constitute a breach of \"contracts of insurance\" because there are no such contracts of insurance alleged in the complaint. Otherwise, it is circular to claim that the drafting of terms\n   in the policy is itself a breach of the policy, where the policy does not restrict itself to being drafted in any particular manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Plaintiff suggests that an increase in premiums should not be allowed under the policy without a plain disclosure or illustration of the risk thereof. In particular, plaintiff asserts the policy should have specified \"whom may change the amount of the premium paid, that such policies were volatile investment products subject to interest rate market fluctuations[,] and how the cash value of the policy would be drained to pay for the increased cost of insurance over the passage of time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The fact that such disclosures could have been made consistent with the operation of the policy in practice, however, proves the point that there is no breach of the policy due to increased premiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, while plaintiff suggests that such statements or illustrations of the risks of the policy should have been disclosed in the policy to benefit the purchasing consumer, in the vein of a regulatory or statutory protection, such disclosures are not required by contract principles to make the policy function as a contract for universal life insurance. Accordingly, plaintiff's breach of contract claim premised upon improper drafting must be dismissed as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   c. Cost of insurance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that defendants breached the terms of the policy by \"wrongfully and improperly assessing or requiring cost of insurance charges in excess of those permitted by mortality tables.\" (Compl. \u00b6 82). Plaintiff recognizes that the policy specifically defines the charges defendants may deduct as cost of insurance charges. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   DE 32-2 at 6). As such this claim is not based on the language of the contract, but rather on whether defendants performed under the contract.

As discussed above with respect to the contract claim, the policy provides that interest rates applicable to the policy can change, and that interest rates are a component of determining cash value.

SUBSEQUENT PREMIUMS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO CONTINUE COVERAGE TO SUCH DATE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).
