(\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action on\n   February 5, 2015, against Airborne, Inc. d/b/a/ Firstflight (\"Defendant\"), for damages allegedly sustained when Defendant breached a contract to purchase an aircraft from Plaintiff. (Dkt. 1). Following the filing of the parties' competing motions seeking various forms of relief (Dkt. 30; Dkt. 39; Dkt. 47; Dkt. 57), the Court issued a Decision and Order on August 2, 2017, granting Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissing Plaintiff's Complaint based upon Defendant's perfect tender defense (Dkt. 71). On September 5, 2017, Plaintiff appealed the judgment entered against it. (Dkt. 73). On July 3, 2018, the Second Circuit issued a summary order vacating the judgment and remanding the case for this Court to consider Plaintiff's motion for contract reformation before addressing Defendant's perfect tender defense. (Dkt. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 15, 2018, Defendant's counsel filed a motion to withdraw as attorney of record. (Dkt. 75). The Court ordered Defendant's counsel to file proof of service that its motion papers were served upon Defendant and Defendant's CEO, John H. Dow (\"Dow\"). (Dkt. 77). Defendant's counsel complied with the Court's order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 78; Dkt. 79). On October 3, 2018, Dow filed an affidavit stating that Defendant had no objection to the motion to withdraw, and that Defendant \"has ceased all operations, ... has no assets and no employees[, and]... [t]here are no plans for [Defendant] to ever resume any operations or activities.\" (Dkt. 80 at \u00b6\u00b6 2-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court held a telephonic motion hearing on October 17, 2018, which was attended by Defendant's counsel and Dow. (Dkt. 85). Dow again raised no objections to the motion to withdraw. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court advised the parties that it would grant the motion to withdraw and cautioned Dow that a corporation may not proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   The Court informed Dow that Defendant would have 30 days to retain new counsel and to file a Notice of Appearance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 18, 2018, the Court issued an Order, granting the motion to withdraw and memorializing the admonishments it made to Dow at the motion hearing the previous day. (Dkt. 84). In particular, the Court advised Defendant \"that failure to retain another attorney within the prescribed time may result in a default judgment against it because a corporation may not proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). In spite of the Court's cautionary warning, no notice of appearance was filed within the 30-day deadline set by the Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for default judgment based upon Defendant's failure to retain new counsel as ordered by the Court. (Dkt. 89). The Court issued a motion scheduling order and required that Plaintiff serve Defendant and Dow with a copy of the order and Plaintiff's motion papers. (Dkt. 90). The Court reminded Dow that \"a corporation may not proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   ,\" and indicated that while he \"may inform the Court of any progress made towards securing legal representation, any papers submitted in opposition to Plaintiff's motion must be filed by an attorney and be preceded by a notice of appearance filed on behalf of Defendant by that attorney.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). The next day, Plaintiff filed a certificate of service indicating that Defendant and Dow had both been served. (Dkt. 91). No other papers have since been filed by either party, and no attorney has appeared on Defendant's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard for Seeking a Default Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55 is the basic procedure to be followed when there is a default in the course of\n   litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Vt.

For example, default judgment was warranted where corporate defendants were \"ordered on no fewer than two occasions to appear through counsel\" and yet failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

Accordingly, Defendant's failure to appear by counsel sufficiently establishes willfulness and favors granting Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, given Defendant's apparent insolvency, there is no indication in the record that Defendant ever intends to comply with this Court's prior orders requiring that it secure legal representation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, if the motion for default judgment is denied, Plaintiff, as the non-defaulting party, would be substantially prejudiced \"as there are no additional steps available to secure relief in this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Bridge Oil Ltd. v.

Accordingly, the prejudice that would result to the non-defaulting party also favors granting Plaintiff's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court acknowledges that it had previously granted Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings based upon its \"perfect tender\" defense. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 71). In vacating that judgment and remanding the case, the Second Circuit instructed only that this Court should first address Plaintiff's argument for contract reformation before it reached Defendant's perfect tender defense. (Dkt. 74). Stated differently, the Second Circuit did not reject the merits of Defendant's perfect tender defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nonetheless, whether or not Defendant could assert a meritorious defense does not preclude entry of default judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Integrity Commc'ns Corp. v.

Because Defendant has willfully defaulted in this action, and since Plaintiff would be significantly prejudiced by the denial of its motion for default judgment, the existence and viability of Defendant's previously-asserted perfect tender defense does not preclude entry of default judgment. Indeed, by defaulting Defendant abandons its assertion of the perfect tender defense-or any other defense-to Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Therefore, because the Court concludes that, on balance, the foregoing three factors weigh in favor of granting default judgment, the only remaining question is whether Plaintiff has stated a facially valid claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Dkt. 1 at 9-10). Under New York law, a breach of contract claim has four elements: \"(1) a contract; (2) performance of the contract by one party; (3) breach by the other party; and (4) damages.\"\n   <em>\n    First Inv'rs Corp. v.

Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Complaint states a claim for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it and Defendant entered into a contract for the sale of a 1999 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-83 aircraft carrying the tail number N973TW and the serial number 53623 (the \"Aircraft\"). (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 30). Incorporated as part of that contract was a Technical Summary Report with information/specifications pertaining to a McDonnell Douglas MD-83 that, as it turns out, was not the Aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Ultimately, Defendant rejected the Aircraft because it did not comply with the information/specifications contained in the Technical Summary Report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's mistaken belief that the Technical Summary Report attached to the contract was related to the Aircraft was a \"unilateral mistake\" and did \"not relieve [Defendant] of its obligations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43). Plaintiff further alleges that the sales contract was a \"binding and enforceable agreement under New York law,\" and that Defendant materially breached that contract when it refused to purchase the Aircraft. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). Because Defendant refused to purchase the Aircraft, Plaintiff found another buyer and sold the Aircraft for $ 575,000.00-$ 1,575,000 less than what was agreed upon in the sales contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). As such, Plaintiff alleges $ 1,575,000 in damages resulting from the breach (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48), and seeks an award of damages, litigation costs, prejudgment and post-judgment interest, and \"such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Therefore, taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiff sufficiently stated a claim upon which relief can be granted. As a result, default judgment is granted in favor of Plaintiff on its cause of action for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff is Entitled to Prejudgment Interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff also demands an award of prejudgment interest at a rate of nine percent\n   per annum beginning from April 9, 2014, or, alternatively, June 6, 2014, to the present day pursuant to the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.

Plaintiff proposes that the Court use one of two dates in computing the amount of interest owed: (1) April 9, 2014, the date Defendant allegedly breached the sales contract; or (2) June 6, 2014, the date Plaintiff resold the Aircraft for $ 575,000.00.
