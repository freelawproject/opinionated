STAN BAKER, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   This matter is before the Court on a number of motions including Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, (doc. 10), Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification, (doc. 55); Defendants' Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment, (doc. 65); Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, (doc. 94); and Plaintiffs' Request for Oral Argument on All Pending Motions, (doc. 101). Plaintiffs Lloyd Murray, Jr. (\"Mr. Murray\") and Jennifer McGhan (\"Ms. McGhan\") filed this putative class action against Defendants ILG Technologies, LLC (\"ILG\") and Baris Misman (\"Mr. Misman\"), based on allegations that a software created by Defendants incorrectly calculated Plaintiffs' bar exam scores. (Doc. 1-3.) Plaintiffs originally filed this suit in the Superior Court of Bryan County, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and Defendants subsequently removed to this Court, (doc. 1). After Defendants filed their first Motion for Summary Judgment, (doc. 10), Plaintiffs filed a Response, (doc. 38), and Defendants filed a Reply. (Doc. 44.) Plaintiffs subsequently filed an Amended Complaint, (doc. 63).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants filed a Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment addressing the additional causes of action, (doc. 65), to which Plaintiffs responded, (doc. 77), and Defendants replied, (doc. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This case arises out of a cruel twist of events. Plaintiffs were originally told that they had failed the exam to gain admission to the State Bar of Georgia only to find out\n   months later that they had actually passed the exam. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants are to blame for their agonizing and costly journey because ILG, a company solely owned by Mr. Misman, provided a software system to aid in the administration of the entire bar admission process. ILG provided this system pursuant to a contract with the Georgia Office of Bar Admissions. In their initial Complaint, Plaintiffs levy claims of Breach of Contract, Negligence, and Negligent Misrepresentation. (Doc. 1-3.) Plaintiffs also assert a claim for the Regrading of Bar Exams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10.) In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs reassert their original claims (with the exception of their request for a regrade) and allege additional claims of Defamation, Negligent Design, and Strict Liability. (Doc. 63.) Factually, the parties dispute whether the disastrous glitch in grading Plaintiffs' exams was caused by errors in Defendants' software or errors elsewhere in the examination, grading, and communication process. Regardless, in their Motions for Summary Judgment, Defendants contend that even if their software factually caused the grading error, Plaintiffs cannot legally recover the damages they seek through any of the asserted claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants' Motions call for this Court to resolve the parties' arguments based on the substantive law of Georgia as set forth by the Georgia General Assembly and the state's appellate courts. After a thorough review of that law and its application to the facts of this case, the Court finds that it must grant Defendants' Motions. As explained below, Plaintiffs cannot recover for breach of contract because they are not in privity of contract with Defendants and are not third-party beneficiaries of Defendant ILG's contract with the Office of Bar Admissions. Moreover, Georgia's economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs' general negligence, strict liability, and negligent design claims, and the undisputed evidence thwarts Plaintiffs' claims of negligent misrepresentation and defamation. The Court is mindful that this result may seem like another hapless turn in Plaintiffs' harrowing saga. However, this Court's obligation is to say what the law is, not what it should be. Having fulfilled that responsibility and applied that law to the facts of this case, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, (docs. 10, 65) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES as moot\n   </strong>\n   all other pending motions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The incidents giving rise to this action came to light on September 6, 2016. (Doc. 10-2, p. 1.) On that day, the Georgia Board of Bar Examiners announced that ninety people who took the July 2015 and February 2016 Georgia bar exams-forty-five from each exam-were incorrectly assigned failing scores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, these ninety individuals had passed their respective exams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs Murray and McGhan were two such persons. (Doc. 1-3, p. 2.) Plaintiffs filed this putative class action against Defendants on behalf of all ninety test takers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 3, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Bar Admission Process and Exam Scoring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A person who wishes to practice law in the state of Georgia must first be admitted pursuant to the Rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of Georgia. (Doc. 10-3, p. 5.) This process is handled by two boards-the Board to Determine Character and Fitness, and the Board of Bar\n   Examiners. (Doc. 38, p. 3.) The Office of Bar Admissions (\"OBA\") provides administrative support to both Boards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to sitting for the Georgia Bar Exam, applicants' credentials are reviewed by the Board to Determine Character and Fitness. (Doc. 37-12, p. 9.) Applicants who pass this stage are then permitted to take the bar exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The bar exam itself is a two-day test that is written and administered by the Board of Bar Examiners. (Doc. 38, p. 3.) The exam consists of a multiple-choice component known as the \"MBE\" and two separate writing components-two essays collectively called the \"MPT\" and four Georgia-specific essays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the exam, the completed MBE answer sheets are sent to the National Conference of Bar Examiners to be graded by a machine. (Doc. 37-12, p. 33.) The scores are sent to the OBA, and any individual who does not score at least a 115 on the MBE portion of the exam is deemed an \"automatic fail,\" meaning the applicant's essays are not submitted for grading. (Doc. 38, p. 7.) The essays that are submitted for grading are then graded by the Board of Bar Examiners, and the completed scores are entered into a database. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.) A score of 270 or higher qualifies as a \"passing score.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Before the scores are finalized, the essays of individuals who received an initial score within five points below 270-or 265 to 269-are regraded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once the regrades are complete, the new scores are entered into the database. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Applicants are then notified of the results electronically. (Doc. 10-2, p. 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Software Program and Underlying Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant ILG is a technology company that creates custom software, and Mr. Misman is ILG's sole proprietor. (Doc. 37-9, p. 16; doc. 38, p. 3.) At all times relevant to this action, Defendants had a contract with the OBA to create and provide a computer program that would facilitate the entire bar admission process (hereinafter \"the Contract\"). (Doc. 38, p. 3; doc. 38-1.) It is undisputed that Plaintiffs were not parties to the contract between Defendants and the OBA. (Doc. 10-1, p. 2; doc. 38-6, p. 2.) The Contract states that Defendants \"promise[d] to provide, and OBA promise[d] to pay for, a complete, customized, turn-key system of enterprise for digitizing and electronically administering the entire bar admission process.\" (Doc. 38-1, p. 3.) The system was intended to be a \"user-friendly\" way for the OBA to organize \"the data that is received from the fitness application and the data that's received from the [ ] bar examination process.\" (Doc. 38, p. 3.) It was also intended to efficiently and effectively communicate the relevant data to bar applicants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The software designed by Defendants was used by the OBA and the Boards to calculate the scores and communicate the results of the July 2015 and February 2016 bar exams. (Doc. 10-1, pp. 2-3; doc. 38-6, pp. 2-3.) All communications through the software came from the OBA and the Board of Bar Examiners; Plaintiffs were never contacted by Defendants. (Doc. 38-6, p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Overview of Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this lawsuit, Plaintiffs request relief for: (1) the cost of taking additional bar exams; (2) the cost of additional study materials; (3) loss of income; (4) injury to their property right in the employment of the legal profession; and (5) injury to their reputations. (Doc. 63, pp. 8-9.) To seek these damages, Plaintiffs assert six theories of liability. First, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants committed acts of negligence by \"failing to accurately calculate, record, and/or report Plaintiffs' and the class\n   members', Bar Exam Grades.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8.) Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants breached their contract with the OBA, and that Plaintiffs were third-party beneficiaries to that contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 11-12.) Further, Plaintiffs claim that because they relied on the incorrect results to their detriment, Defendants are liable to them for negligent misrepresentation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10.) Plaintiffs also allege Defendants breached their duties to exercise reasonable care in designing a software free of unreasonable risks and to provide a merchantable product, meaning Plaintiffs are entitled to damages in strict products liability and for negligent design. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 12-13.) Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that the software's incorrect results constitute false publications and that Defendants are thus liable for defamation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs initially requested a regrade of July 2015 and February 2016 bar exams scoring between 259 and 264. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiffs \"withdrew\" this claim in their Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, (doc. 38, p. 26), and indicate the claim as \"withdrawn\" in their Amended Complaint, (doc. 63, p. 10). Finally, Plaintiffs seek attorney's fees due to Defendants' alleged bad faith, stubborn litigiousness, and having caused Plaintiffs unnecessary trouble and expense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In their Motions, Defendants seek summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims asserted in Plaintiffs' initial and Amended Complaints.

In response, Plaintiffs rely on Section 1.1 of the Contract, which states in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ILG promises to provide, and OBA promises to pay for, a complete, customized, turn-key system of enterprise software for digitizing and electronically administering the entire bar admission progress (hereinafter the \"\n   <em>\n    Solution\n   </em>\n   \").

The parties disagree on how this section should be interpreted. According to Plaintiffs, \"[t]he whole purpose of the contract, as stated on the contract's first page [in Section 1.1], was to benefit the Plaintiffs[.]\" (Doc. 38, p. 25.) Plaintiffs claim Section 1.1's use of the word \"applicants\" demonstrates that \"[t]he cornerstone of the contract was to communicate with bar applicants regarding whether the applicants were admitted to the practice of law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The record before the Court demonstrates that, as a matter of law, Plaintiffs are not third-party beneficiaries of the contract between Defendants and the OBA\n   <em>\n    for purposes of this action.\n   </em>\n   As noted above, \"a third party is entitled to enforce only those specific provisions of a contract of which he is an intended beneficiary.\"\n   <em>\n    Archer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652626\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/292/219/\">\n    735 S.E.2d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, Section 1.1 unambiguously provides that ILG was to: (1) create software for the OBA; (2) tailor it to the OBA's particular needs; (3) so the OBA could carry out its duties of facilitating admission to the Georgia bar. (Doc. 38-1, pp. 3-4.) Contrary to\n   Plaintiffs' interpretation, the mention of \"applicants\" in this section is in the course of describing how the software created by ILG will assist\n   <em>\n    the OBA\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   communication with bar applicants-a necessary aspect of the OBA's admission process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5613607\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/519/60/#p72\">\n    519 F.Supp. at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fact that a third party is mentioned in [a] contract does not necessarily indicate that a third party beneficiary situation is created.\").

Thus, for Plaintiffs to be deemed third-party beneficiaries, there would need to be an agreement between the promisor-Defendants-and the promisee-the OBA-that Defendants would do something for Plaintiffs. The Contract has several provisions in which Defendants promised to provide support and make certain features available to applicants. Specifically, Defendants promised to: (1) make an electronic communication portal for use by bar applicants, (doc. 38-1, p. 4); (2) provide support to bar applicants who sought to use Defendants' software or encountered difficulty, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 9, 11); and (3) maintain the confidentiality of all information regarding individual bar applicants, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 16). While Plaintiffs may have been intended beneficiaries of these contractual provisions, they are not intended to be beneficiaries of the provisions that they claim Defendants breached. As discussed above, the contractual provision that Plaintiffs are attempting to enforce provides that Defendants promised the OBA to create a software program capable of calculating scores for the OBA-not Plaintiffs; as such, Plaintiffs have no standing to enforce it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LF Factors, LLC v.

For example, the Georgia Supreme Court denied third-party beneficiary status to plaintiffs that suffered wrongful death and personal injury during the tragic bombing in Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympic Games.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Plaintiffs argued that as visitors to a park that defendants had contracted to secure, the plaintiffs were intended beneficiaries of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-350. The Georgia Supreme Court rejected this argument because the contract did not evidence intent to confer a benefit on park visitors and the defendants did not assume or owe a duty to park visitors to protect or warn them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gay v.

There, residents of the City of Atlanta sued companies that had contracted with the city to provide water and sewer services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 111. Pursuant to the contract, the defendant companies had installed new technology to read and transmit the plaintiffs' water consumption from the plaintiffs' water meters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs alleged that a malfunction in the defendants' computer software caused their water consumption to be miscalculated resulting in overbilling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Georgia Court of Appeals found that the plaintiffs were not third-party beneficiaries to the contract between the city and the defendant companies. The court held that, while the contract contained provisions regarding installation and customer service, those provisions did not \"manifest a clear intent to confer the specific benefit claimed by the plaintiffs in this case with regard to the accuracy of their water bills.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 115. Though the contract benefitted plaintiffs indirectly, the court found those benefits \"only incidental\" and thus denied them third-party beneficiary status. Like the situation in\n   <em>\n    Benator\n   </em>\n   , the Contract in this case certainly contemplates that Plaintiffs will receive some benefits. However, even if the purpose of the Contract was for Defendants to provide the OBA with accurate test results so that the OBA would then communicate those results to Plaintiffs, that general purpose does not make Plaintiffs intended beneficiaries. Put another way, the Contract does not \"manifest a clear intent to confer the specific benefit claimed by the plaintiffs in this case with regard to the accuracy of their [bar exam results].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12166278\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/310/825/\">\n    714 S.E.2d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no third party beneficiary status and denying argument similar to Plaintiff's \"whole purpose\" argument when rejecting plaintiff's position that \"where an owner takes his vehicle to a mechanic and the mechanic takes the vehicle to another, more specialized repair facility, both the mechanic and the specialized repair facility know or should know that the beneficiary of the work is the vehicle's owner\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The record demonstrates that Plaintiffs are not in privity of contract with Defendants. Further, under Georgia law, Plaintiffs were not intended beneficiaries of the contractual provisions that they seek to enforce.

(Doc. 1-3, pp. 7-8; doc. 63, pp. 7-10.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached their\n   duties to: (1) ensure accurate grading of the July 2015 and February 2016 exams; and (2) accurately report the results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In their original Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants argue Georgia's economic loss rule prohibits Plaintiffs from basing a negligence claim on a breach of those duties. (Doc. 10-2, p. 7.) Specifically, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs have no evidence of injuries to their person or property, that any duty owed to Plaintiffs was a consequence of Defendants' contract with the OBA, and, because Plaintiffs were not parties to the Contract, \"Georgia law recognizes no legal duty running from Defendants to Plaintiffs that would permit Plaintiffs to recover[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 7-10.) In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs add a claim of strict liability, arguing they are entitled to damages due to Defendants' software being a defective product. (Doc. 63, p. 12.) Plaintiffs also assert a claim of negligent design and allege that Defendants \"breached their duty to exercise reasonable care to design, test, develop, inspect, market, distribute and sell the subject product free of an unreasonable risk of injury to users and others reasonably affected by the software, including Plaintiffs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.) In their Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants argue that the economic loss rule argument applies with equal force to these additional claims as it did to Plaintiffs' ordinary negligence claim. (Doc. 65, pp. 3-5.) Plaintiffs oppose the application of the economic loss rule in both of their Responses. (Doc. 38, pp. 12-15; doc. 77, pp. 5-6.) Accordingly, a brief discussion of the economic loss rule in Georgia is in order before assessing the rule's application to Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. History of the Economic Loss Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Stated most basically, the economic loss rule limits the ability of contracting parties to sue one another for negligence and is used \"to distinguish between those causes of action that may be brought only in a contract [ ] action and those that give rise to an action in tort.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flintkote Co. v.

The economic loss rule has its foundation in cases that limited the ability of contracting parties to sue one another for negligence. In essence, Georgia courts do not allow contracting parties to bring negligence claims for pure economic losses against one another unless some special relationship between the parties exists, such as the relationship between an attorney and her client.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orkin Exterminating Co. v.

(Doc. 38, p. 13.) Plaintiffs contend that Defendants owed them a duty to provide \"software suitable to its intended purpose\"-that is, software that would not produce or report \"erroneous results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants maintain that their alleged negligence pertained to the performance of the Contract, meaning the economic loss rule bars Plaintiffs' claim. (Doc. 10-2, pp. 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants. The two purportedly negligent acts raised by Plaintiffs-scoring and reporting test results-are functions explicitly contemplated in their contract with the OBA. In the Contract, Defendants represent that the software will allow the OBA to \"[g]enerate exam documents\" including \"[e]xam scores,\" (doc. 38-1, p. 48), and that the software could be used for \"[p]ublishing\n   exam results,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 33). The Contract also contains language demonstrating that ILG had a duty to ensure these functions operated properly, such as: (1) discussing the inclusion of certain features to \"prevent errors during data entry,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 39); (2) promising to use their best efforts to \"cure\" errors, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 66); (3) to provide \"hot fixes\" as necessary, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 62); and (4) promising to provide no-cost \"correction[s]\" or \"improvement[s],\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7). Thus, the Contract created Defendants' duties to provide a software that adequately scored and reported exam scores-the breach of which Plaintiffs seek to recover for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that \"[t]he duty in this case 'arises out of the general duty one owes to all the world not to subject them to an unreasonable risk of harm.' \" (Doc. 38, p. 13) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bradley Center, Inc. v.

However, Georgia courts have not found that this type of \"general duty\" exempts claims from the economic loss rule.

In their Motion, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' claim fails as a matter of law because Defendants did not communicate with Plaintiffs; rather, the OBA informed Plaintiffs of their bar exam results. (Doc. 10-2, p. 15; doc. 38-6, p. 2.) Defendants reason that this complete lack of communication to Plaintiffs necessarily shows that no misrepresentation was made, meaning \"Plaintiffs cannot prove an essential element of [their] claim.\" (Doc. 10-2, p. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs maintain \"it is clear that Plaintiffs actually relied upon the misrepresentations by ILG,\" and \"this representation was that ILG was accurately scoring and reporting bar exam scores.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 38, p. 21.) Though it is less\n   than clear, Plaintiffs seemingly argue that Defendants made this representation in two different ways. Plaintiffs initially point to the contract between Defendants and the OBA, stating that \"the contract clearly provides that [the software] would include application communication, online pass and fail letter management, and publishing exam results.\" (Doc. 38, p. 22.) Plaintiffs also assert that \"[t]hrough [Defendant's software], Plaintiffs were falsely informed that they had failed the Georgia Bar Exam.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Despite the factual accuracy of Plaintiffs' arguments, neither the contractual terms nor the use of Defendants' software to communicate results constitute an \"affirmative misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prince Heaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228222\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/117/1357/#p1360\">\n    117 F.Supp.2d at 1360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence before the Court demonstrates that Defendants never made\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   representations to Plaintiffs. First, Plaintiffs do not put forth any evidence showing they were aware of the Contract and the terms therein prior to receiving the incorrect results. A misrepresentation cannot be \"affirmative\" if it is never communicated at all. Additionally, while it is undisputed that bar exam results were communicated via Defendant's software, Plaintiffs admit that all communications they received were from the OBA-not Defendants. (Doc. 38-6, p. 2.) Finally, to the extent Plaintiffs argue that the software itself made the representation as the platform through which OBA sent its messages, they have not supplied the Court with any law to support this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because the existence of a misrepresentation is an essential element in a negligent misrepresentation claim and because the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, demonstrate that Defendants did not make any representations to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' claim fails as a matter of law.

A viable defamation claim under Georgia law has four elements: \"(1) a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff; (2) an unprivileged communication to a third party; (3) fault by the defendant amounting at least to negligence; and (4) special harm or the actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

First, Defendants point to the undisputed fact that it was the OBA-not Defendants-that disseminated bar exam scores, meaning Plaintiffs cannot prove the essential element of publication. (Doc. 65, p. 7.) Second, Defendants maintain that, even if the generation of scores by the OBA via Defendants' software constituted a defamatory statement, the communication was within the scope of their contractual duties and would be privileged-and therefore not published-as a matter of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 10.) In response, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the OBA actually released the results, but instead argue that because Defendants' software was \"so integral to the defamatory communications, [ ] the software [ ] published the results.\" (Doc. 77, pp. 7-8.) Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the incorrect scores were not privileged as a part of any contractual duties between Defendants and the OBA because the error was \"the exact opposite of the contracted-for performance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8.) Despite Plaintiffs' creative arguments, the Court agrees with Defendants for the reasons explained below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiffs contend that the defamatory statements, the \"false exam scores,\" were published by Defendants when they were generated \"via their software.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7.) This theory necessarily assumes that automated results from a software program can constitute a published statement. Plaintiffs have not cited to, and the Court is not aware of, any law that supports this contention. However, even if the software's computations were published statements, \"Georgia law provides a well-established exception to the broad definition of publication.\"\n   <em>\n    Koly v.

Here, the custom software was operated by employees of the OBA and the scores were then communicated to the OBA in the same way a calculator communicates calculations to its operator. The only persons to see the scores prior to the OBA's publication of the results were employees of the OBA, and Plaintiffs do not allege that anyone without the proper authority at the OBA received the information. Thus, the software's communications-to the extent they are otherwise actionable-would not constitute a publication as they would be \"intracorporate.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127404\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/295/128/\">\n    670 S.E.2d at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ga.

As Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that a software program can produce an actionable defamatory statement and because, even assuming any such statement was produced, it was communicated exclusively within the OBA and done in the performance of a contractual duty, Plaintiffs have not satisfied the required element of publication and their defamation claim cannot succeed.
