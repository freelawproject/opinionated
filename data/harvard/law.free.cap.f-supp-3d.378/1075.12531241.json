The State Act does not prohibit an artist from offering his or her art and crafts for sale in Oklahoma; it restricts the manner of how these goods are marketed. As noted, this restriction applies to in-state and out-of-artists equally: those artists who are members of federally recognized tribes-whether they be in-state or out-of-state-may market and sell their art and crafts in Oklahoma as American Indian-made, and those artists who are members of only state-recognized tribes-again, whether they be in-state or out-of-state-may not market or sell their art and crafts in Oklahoma as American Indian-made.
