Prior Proceedings Before This Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Backus brought his initial complaint in this Court on July 12, 2016, asserting causes of action under state law, including: (1) California's UCL; (2) nuisance; and (3) the implied warranty of merchantability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 107-141.

No. 32. First, the Court held that Backus's claim that the use of PHO was unlawful under the UCL failed because his interpretation of California's Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law (\"Sherman Law\") was preempted by Section 754.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6. Second, the Court held that use of PHO was not unfair under the UCL because it was similarly preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Finally, the Court rejected Backus's nuisance and implied warranty of merchantability claims.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-8. The Court granted Backus leave to amend his complaint but noted that his \"entire theory as to each cause of action currently pled is deficient as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Backus filed an amended complaint on April 17, 2017, asserting two UCL-based causes of action. First, Backus claimed that Biscomerica's use of PHO was unlawful under the UCL because the products were adulterated, thus violating the FDCA and the Sherman Law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-84, 107-20. Second, Backus claimed that Biscomerica's\n   use of PHO was unfair under the UCL.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-76, 121-27. He purported to bring his claim on behalf of himself and a nationwide class of people who had purchased Biscomerica cookies containing partially hydrogenated oil between January 1, 2008 and June 16, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Biscomerica filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on May 5, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 38 (\"Mot.\"). Backus opposed on May 19,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 40 (\"Opp.\"), and Biscomerica replied on June 1,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The Stay and Ninth Circuit Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 22, 2017, the Court stayed the action, over Biscomerica's opposition, until two cases asserting similar claims were resolved by the Ninth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 45. In the first of those cases,\n   <em>\n    Hawkins v. AdvancePierre Foods, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit assumed, without deciding, that the plaintiff's PHO claims were not preempted by federal law, but the court held that the plaintiff had nonetheless failed to state a claim for violation of the UCL or for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20F.%20App%27x%20906\">\n    733 F.

With the two cases decided, the Court lifted the stay on October 24, 2018 and ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressing the impact of the two\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 55. Both Backus and Biscomerica filed supplemental briefs on November 8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 56, 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But according to Backus, PHO was unsafe from January 2008 until the FDA's Final Determination in June 2015, safe from June 2015 until the compliance date in June 2018, and unsafe again beginning in June 2018. Not only does Backus's formulation of Section 754 make little sense from a practical standpoint, but it would \"impose a new duty ... in respect to transactions or considerations already past,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vartelas v.

The Court finds that Section 754 is retroactive, meaning that Biscomerica did not violate federal law by selling cookies containing PHO during the class period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Even if Section 754 was not retroactive, two years before it was enacted the FDA recognized that PHOs \"have a long history of use as food ingredients\" dating back to the 1930s.

Although two of the PHOs most commonly used in the food industry in 2013 were not \"listed as GRAS in FDA's regulations ... these and other commonly used PHOs ... have been considered GRAS (through a GRAS self-determination) by the food industry for use in food at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice based on a history of use prior to 1958.\" Tentative Determination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067169\">\n    78 Fed.

In other words, even before Section 754 and the Final Determination created a compliance period, the FDA stated that PHO had historically been generally regarded as safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Because PHO was permitted prior to the 2018 compliance date and the FDA recognized that it was generally regarded as safe, Backus has not pled a plausible claim that Biscomerica violated federal law by selling cookies containing PHO prior to June 17, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Backus v.

The Use of PHO Could Not Have Been Unlawful Under State Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, Backus asserts that Biscomerica's use of PHO during the class period was unlawful under California's Sherman Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 113-15. Once again, the Court finds that \"to interpret the Sherman Law's broad prohibition of 'adulterated' food as covering PHO would effectively negate Congress' decision to set the compliance date in June 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 32 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Sherman Law does not specifically prohibit the use of PHO nor completely ban the use of trans fats. Rather, the Sherman Law largely tracks federal law, prohibiting the sale or advertisement of \"adulterated\" food and food additives.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20110398\">\n    Cal.

App'x at 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Backus also argues that PHO is a \"poisonous and deleterious substance,\" thus rendering food containing PHO \"adulterated\" under California law independent of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 3-4. But the Sherman Law could not independently prohibit the use of PHO, because federal law would preempt such a conclusion. In 2013 (during the amended complaint's class period), the FDA noted that there was a changing scientific consensus on the safety of PHOs, which had been generally regarded as safe and used in food products for decades.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tentative Determination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2067169\">\n    78 Fed. Reg. at 67170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FDA and Congress later declared in a rulemaking and in legislation that foods containing PHO would not be deemed unsafe or adulterated until June 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 754, 129 Stat. at 2284; Final Determination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034650\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 34651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This three-year compliance period was necessary to minimize \"market disruptions\" and ensure that there was \"sufficient time to identify suitable replacement ingredients.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Determination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034650\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. at 34657, 34669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If Backus was correct that PHO was independently prohibited under state law, this prohibition would \"stand[ ] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Ting v. AT &amp; T\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9337333\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/1126/#p1136\">\n    319 F.3d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (9th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation omitted). In effect, he would be creating an immediate (albeit belated) ban on the use of PHO from the beginning of the class period in January 2008 to the FDA's Final Determination in June 2015. But such a delayed and drastic measure would stand as an obstacle to the FDA's careful considerations in 2013, the FDA's regulatory scheme creating a three-year window to minimize disruption and identify replacements, and Congress's ratification of the decision to allow partially hydrogenated oils until the 2018 compliance date. And it would negate Congress's decision to create a compliance date which, as discussed above, had retroactive effect. Accordingly, the Court finds that Backus's interpretation of the Sherman Law is barred based on the principle of conflict preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Unfair Business Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Backus also claims that Biscomerica's use of PHO was unfair under the UCL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 71-76, 121-27. Just as before, this cause of action fails because it is preempted by the FDCA. The FDA recognized that PHO was historically generally recognized as safe and Congress established a compliance date, before which time companies could still use PHO in their products. Backus cannot sidestep these decisions by the federal government by \"relabel[ing] the nature of the action as one brought under the unfair competition statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Cel-Tech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"829708\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/20/163/#p180\">\n    20 Cal. 4th at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20548\">\n    83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=973%20P.2d%20527\">\n    973 P.2d 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). And Backus has not identified any action that Biscomerica took independent from the use of PHO in its cookies to support his unfair practice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Backus's allegations in his amended complaint-which, other than the end date of the class period are the same as those in his original complaint-are deficient as a matter of law. Because the Court has already granted Backus leave to amend once before, and any further amendment would\n   be futile, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss without leave to amend. The Clerk is directed to close the case and enter judgment in favor of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court finds that this matter is appropriate for disposition without oral argument.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Civ.
