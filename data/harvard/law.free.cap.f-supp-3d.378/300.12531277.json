May 1, 2018). The Court details below only those aspects of this case's facts and procedural history most relevant to the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 18, 2015, Plaintiffs commenced this action against the Welsh Government and various media companies for infringement of Plaintiffs' copyrights in two photographs depicting the poet Dylan Thomas. (Dkt. No. 1.) The nub of Plaintiffs' claims against the Welsh Government is that it has \"published, displayed, distributed, and otherwise used unauthorized copies of Plaintiff[s'] copyrighted photographs to in [sic] advertisements, publications, and other promotional materials directed at and specifically targeted towards New York residents,\" all with the purpose of increasing tourism to Wales. (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 26 \u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (similar allegations in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   By an Opinion and Order dated March 16, 2016, this Court granted the Welsh Government's motion to dismiss all claims asserted against it in Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint on the grounds of improper service and improper venue. (Dkt. No. 53.) With respect to venue, the Court held in relevant part that Plaintiffs had not alleged facts sufficient to justify venue in this district because they had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   not alleged that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the specific conduct at issue occurred in this district, let alone a \"substantial part\" of it. Neither Plaintiffs nor the Welsh Government reside in the United States. The only concrete infringing materials that Plaintiffs can identify are materials that were available online. But the fact that an infringing material is accessible via the internet in a jurisdiction is hardly sufficient to conclude that this infringement\n   <em>\n    occurred\n   </em>\n   in this district for the purposes of venue. Indeed, all of the Welsh Government's relevant conduct-including the creation and maintenance of the websites at issue-appears to have occurred abroad. On this basis, the Court cannot conclude that a substantial part of the events giving rise to this claim occurred in New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Dkt. No. 53 at 16 (internal citations and footnotes omitted).) Plaintiffs then moved for reconsideration of that decision (Dkt. No. 58), and the Court denied that motion on May 11, 2016 (Dkt. No. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs subsequently moved for leave to replead their allegations against the Welsh Government (Dkt. No. 73), attaching to their motion a proposed new pleading that is now the operative Second Amended Complaint (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 75-1,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99). Defendant TCA filed an opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for leave to replead, asserting in substance that granting Plaintiffs leave to replead would be futile because this district remained an improper venue for Plaintiffs' claims against the Welsh Government. (Dkt. No. 78.) The Court disagreed. By an\n   Opinion and Order dated May 1, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs leave to file the Second Amended Complaint, holding that Plaintiffs' new \"allegations, taken as true, plausibly establish[ed] that the Welsh Government undertook significant actions in this district that [were] material to its allegedly unauthorized copying of Plaintiffs' photographs.\" (Dkt. No. 96 at 5.) Among \"Plaintiffs' factual allegations [relevant to that conclusion] include[d] the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Welsh Government has a permanent presence in New York and maintains offices in New York City. The Welsh Government created infringing \"promotional materials\" such as \"advertisements, brochures, pamphlets, [and] New York City walking tour maps,\" which included unauthorized copies of Plaintiffs' photographs. In addition, the Welsh Government created display panels for an exhibition called \"\n   <em>\n    Welsh in America\n   </em>\n   ,\" which made unauthorized use of Plaintiffs' photographs. Prior to creating these materials, the Welsh Government drafted a report detailing its strategies to promote tourism to Wales, and identified the United States as one of its key target markets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that \"the Welsh Government distributed and loaned out copies\" of the infringing promotional materials from its offices in New York City, and loaned out and \"publicly displayed the infringing panels of the\n   <em>\n    Welsh in America\n   </em>\n   exhibition in New York City.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Dkt. No. 96 at 4-5 (citing SAC \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18, 22-23; 27-29; 32-34; Dkt. Nos. 75-2, 75-3) (footnotes omitted).) In response to TAC's contention that the Court had previously rejected similar arguments when denying Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the Court explained that \"unlike at the motion-for-reconsideration stage, the Court ... [was required to] draw all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs\" in connection with their motion to replead, and concluded that \"any deficiencies addressed in the Court's opinion on reconsideration ha[d] been remedied by the plausible information-and-belief allegations of the\" Second Amended Complaint. (Dkt. No. 96 at 6 n.5.) Finally, the Court also declined to address TAC's one-sentence suggestion that the Welsh Government might be immune from suit on the basis of sovereign immunity, explaining that the \"Welsh Government will be free to raise any immunity defense on its own behalf in response to the SAC.\" (Dkt. No. 96 at 7 n.6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the operative Second Amended Complaint on May 8, 2018. (Dkt. No. 99.) The Welsh Government has now filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' newly repleaded claims against it pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), asserting that it is immune from suit on the basis of sovereign immunity.

Accordingly, when considering a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of sovereign immunity, \"the Court generally must accept the material factual allegations in the complaint as true, but does not draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.

Finally, because \"foreign sovereign immunity's basic objective [is] to free a foreign sovereign from\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   , ... court[s] should normally resolve those factual disputes and reach a decision about immunity as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bolivarian Republic of Venez. v.

Nos. 105, 106 at 1.) In support of its motion, the Welsh Government submits various exhibits and affidavits. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. Nos. 106-2-106-4, 107-09.) Plaintiffs, in contrast, do not present to the Court any new evidence in opposing the instant motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 119.) Still, as the Court recently explained in granting Plaintiffs leave to replead,\n   Plaintiffs' factual allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, including some of the same allegations that the Court held to be sufficient to establish venue in this district, are also supported in part by a number of exhibits attached to Plaintiffs' pleading. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 96 at 4 (citing Dkt. Nos. 75-2, 75-3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 99-1-99-14 (exhibits to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint).) To the extent that any of Plaintiffs' factual allegations in the Second Amended Complaint are both supported by evidence attached to the Second Amended Complaint and unrebutted by the Welsh Government's evidence, they are properly considered in connection with Plaintiffs' burden of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anglo-Iberia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224563\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/171/#p175\">\n    600 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court turns now to consider that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As an initial matter, the Welsh Government has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that it is a political subdivision of a foreign state within the meaning of the FSIA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 121 at 2 (citing Gov't of Wales Act \u00a7 A1 (\"[T]he Welsh Government ... [is] a permanent part of the United Kingdom's constitutional arrangements.\")).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Accordingly, \"the burden [now] falls on [Plaintiffs] to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that an exception under the FSIA permits jurisdiction over [the Welsh Government].\"\n   <em>\n    Swarna v.

Plaintiffs contend that three of the general exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity that are outlined in \u00a7 1605(a)(2) of the FSIA permit them to sue the Welsh Government for the alleged acts of copyright infringement at issue in this suit: (1) the commercial activity exception (Dkt. No. 119 at 5-11); (2) the noncommercial tort exception (Dkt. No. 119 at 11-17); and (3) the expropriation exception (Dkt. No. 119 at 17-18). The Court addresses only the commercial activity exception, concluding both that Plaintiffs have met their burden of production with respect to the that exception to sovereign immunity, and that the Welsh Government has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that this exception does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Among the FSIA's \"[g]eneral exceptions to the jurisdictional immunity of a foreign state\" is what is commonly referred to as the \"commercial activity\" exception.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).

Instead, because \"jurisdictional facts are [now] disputed, the Court has the power and the obligation to consider matters outside the pleadings, such as affidavits, documents, and testimony, to determine whether jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270926\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/304/#p307\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court considers the extent to which the Second Amended Complaint's attached exhibits are sufficient to carry Plaintiffs' evidentiary burden of showing that the Welsh Government's commercial activities were \"carried on in the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), particularly in light of the evidence now presented by the Welsh Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court concludes that Plaintiffs' evidence is sufficient to carry their burden. Most relevant to the Court's conclusion in this regard are the exhibits attached to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint in which the Welsh Government itself represents that at least some of the infringing materials at issue in this suit were \"developed by the Welsh Government in New York\" and were available to order \"for distribution free-of-charge ... from the\n   Welsh Government in New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-2 at 2-3.) Buttressing this conclusion is Plaintiffs' evidence showing that some of the Welsh Government's infringing materials were also published in the United States by United States news outlets in furtherance of the Welsh Government's attempts to promote tourism to Wales. (Dkt. Nos. 99-6-99-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The most persuasive evidence submitted by the Welsh Government in support of its attempts to rebut this conclusion is the affidavit of Rob Holt, the Deputy Director of Tourism Development and Major Events of the Department of Economy, Skills and Natural Resources for the Welsh Government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 2.) Holt confirms that the Welsh Government does maintain an office in New York. (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 3.) But Holt represents that the Welsh Government's activities in furtherance of its promotion of tourism and culture are conducted entirely from Wales (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 6), and that the computer servers that host the webpages appended to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint are also located in Wales (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99-4). Holt further represents that the Welsh Government never offered copies of Plaintiffs' photos for sale or distributed them for profit, and that the Welsh Government expressly forbade its licensees from using Plaintiffs' photographs for \"promotion of non-tourism related, non-inward investment related or commercial products.\" (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 107 at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Many of Holt's representations are immaterial to the Court's inquiry at this stage: It does not matter whether Wales distributed copies of the photograph for sale or for profit, or only for purposes of promoting tourism. Instead, it matters only where the relevant copies of Plaintiffs' photos were made and distributed. In that respect, Holt's affidavit is conspicuous for what it fails to say. This is particularly true with respect to Holt's failure to call into questions Plaintiffs' allegations regarding some of the particular activities the \"Welsh Government has engaged in and undertaken ... in this District,\" which is of course located in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 99 \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.) As already discussed, Plaintiffs support these allegations with documentary evidence in the form of a walking tour mapped onto New York City streets (Dkt. No. 99-1), a map that would presumably be useful only if distributed in a manner that had \"substantial contact with the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. 1603(e). These allegations are further supported by an exhibit consisting of a webpage published by the Welsh Government that includes copies of Plaintiffs' photos alongside an offer of sale of tickets to \"the Official Dylan Thomas Walking Tour of New York,\" a tour the Welsh Government then describes as \"a collaboration\n   of the Welsh Government\n   <em>\n    in New York\n   </em>\n   and the family of Dylan Thomas.\" (Dkt. No. 99-2 (emphasis added).) In addition, that website explains that copies of the infringing materials are available to order \"for distribution free-of-charge ... from the Welsh Government\n   <em>\n    in New York.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) Finally, that same website also confirms that the \"Dylan Thomas Walking Tour of Greenwich Village\" that is attached to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. No. 99-1) \"was [also] developed by the Welsh Assembly Government\n   <em>\n    in New York\n   </em>\n   \" (Dkt. No. 99-2 at 2 (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Holt's affidavit fails to rebut what the exhibits to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint persuasively demonstrate: that \"the Welsh Government\n   <em>\n    in New York\n   </em>\n   \" played an active role in the development and distribution of the promotional materials which included copies of Plaintiffs' photographs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Moreover, Plaintiffs' other exhibits also corroborate Plaintiffs' allegation that \"the Welsh Government contracted with private businesses located in New York City to publish, print, display, and distribute the Infringing Promotional Materials, including the infringing walk tour maps and infringing\n   <em>\n    Welsh in America\n   </em>\n   display panels.\" (Dkt. No. 99 \u00b6 25;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. Nos. 99-6-99-9 (evidence of Welsh Government's coordination with other United States news outlets).) Taken together, all of this evidence persuasively demonstrates that the Welsh Government's \"commercial activity ... [had] substantial contact with the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201603\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In summary, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have produced evidence that establishes that their claims are \"based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by [a] foreign state,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and that the Welsh Government has not carried its burden of \"show[ing] that the alleged [commercial activity] exception does not apply [to its conduct] by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Anglo-Iberia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224563\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/171/#p175\">\n    600 F.3d at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 107 at 33.) But it is entirely unclear from that Irish judgment whether Pablo Star Ltd. was also a party\n   to that suit, or whether Plaintiffs' claims failed because of a jurisdictional bar sufficiently similar to that at issue here to warrant\n   <em>\n    res judicata.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

The Welsh Government's passing suggestion that international comity warrants dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims before this Court is insufficient to carry its \"burden of proving that comity [is] appropriate\" in this case.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Life Ins.

(Dkt. Nos. 121 at 1, 121-1 \u00b6 4, 121-1 at 3-4.) The Court notes that this evidence does nothing to rebut the standing of at least one Plaintiff to proceed in this action.

Plaintiffs' Berne Convention Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the Welsh Government moves pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims brought under the Berne Convention. (Dkt. No. 106 at 1, 16-17.) However, Plaintiffs disclaim any attempt to state independent claims under the Berne Convention, and explain that their allegations regarding the Berne Convention are relevant only to their attempts to demonstrate a violation of international law sufficient to trigger the expropriation exception to the FSIA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). (Dkt. No. 119 at 17-18;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 102.) Because Plaintiffs have disclaimed any attempt to state a claim in this action under the Berne Convention, the Welsh Government's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims brought under the Berne Convention is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Welsh Government's motion to dismiss is DENIED. The Welsh Government is directed to file an answer to the Second Amended Complaint within 21 days of the date of this Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motion at Docket Number 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Plaintiffs contend that \"[i]n an FSIA case,\" courts will grant a motion to dismiss for lack of subjection matter jurisdiction only where a pleading is \"wholly insubstantial or frivolous,\" and that in doing so courts \"must accept as true all of the factual allegations set out in plaintiffs' complaint, draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, and construe the complaint liberally.\" (Dkt. No. 119 at 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).) Plaintiffs are incorrect. The legal standard governing the instant motion to dismiss is that outlined by the Court above.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    Section II.

(\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) The contents of these articles corroborate Plaintiffs' allegations: The articles not only favorably depict and encourage travel to Wales, but also link directly to the website for Visit Wales (\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , 99-7 at 6-7), which according to a Welsh Government official is \"an administrative division of the Welsh Government charged with carrying out the Government's policy to promote tourism to Wales\" (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 5). Plaintiffs also attach to their Second Amended Complaint a \"Framework Action Plan\" from the Welsh Government in which it resolved to \"[r]e-launch websites for US and German markets providing [them with] tailored content.\" (Dkt. No. 99-14 at 6.) A Welsh official has confirmed that the Government of Wales does license images for purposes of tourism promotion (Dkt. No. 107 \u00b6 8), and the Welsh Government offers no evidence to rebut Plaintiffs' allegations that the Welsh Government did in fact provide United States news outlets with infringing copies of Plaintiffs' photos. The Court concludes that Plaintiffs have produced evidence sufficient to corroborate their allegations that the United States news articles appended to the Second Amended Complaint were published in coordination with the Welsh Government.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Alternatively, Plaintiffs could make a showing under the statute's second and third prongs that their suit is \"based ... upon an act performed in the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere,\" or \"upon an act outside the territory of the United States in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the United States.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2).
