The report, authored by Dr.\n   Thomas J.

The City's decision in 1992 to change its name from East Detroit to Eastpointe is reported as emblematic of its desire to dissociate the predominantly white municipality from predominantly African American Detroit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636571\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/613/#p622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.1784-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Beginning in the 2000's, the City's African American population began to grow rapidly-part of a wave of what the expert report calls \"black flight\" out of the City of Detroit to the inner-ring suburbs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636571\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/613/#p622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PageID.1784, 1792-93.

Consistent with this trend, information collected by the United States Census Bureau in the 2000 and 2010 censuses demonstrates Eastpointe's black voting age population (\"VAP\") rose from 4.25% in 2000 to 25.53% in 2010. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1600 tbl. 2 (Expert Report of Dr. Lisa Handley). Similarly, data on citizen voting age population (\"CVAP\") by race gathered in the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Surveys (the sole source of citizenship data published by the Census Bureau), which pool data from five-year periods, shows Eastpointe's black CVAP increasing from 21.45% in 2005-2009 to 36.65% in 2011-2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636571\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/613/#p622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By the most recent census estimate, African Americans now comprise 41.2% of Eastpointe residents.

Additionally, statistics in the record demonstrate that major disparities exist between the City's black and white residents. Between 2006-2010, more than one in four of Eastpointe's black residents suffered unemployment, for example, compared to one in seven white residents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636571\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/613/#p622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID.1810.

Ecological inference is another method of inferring individual behavior from aggregate data where actual individual-level data is unavailable.

ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1606; ECF No. 26-2 PageID.727-28. The bounds method, according to Dr. Handley, \"uses more of the data available from precinct returns as well as providing more of the information about the voting behavior being estimated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523437\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/1088/#p1118\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   PageID.1606. An example of how the bounds method works to preclude estimates of voting patterns by race that are less than 0% or more than 100% would be the case where a precinct has 100 voters, of which 75 are black and 25 are white, and an African American candidate had received 80 votes in that precinct. In estimating how the black voters voted, the bounds method takes into account that, because she received 80 votes, at least 55 (and at most 75) of the black voters must have voted for the African American candidate. Similarly, at least 5 and as many as 25 white voters must have cast their ballots for the African American candidate. Ecological regression, in contrast, can produce estimates of less than 0% or more than 100% because its estimates are not limited by the minimum and maximum percentage of votes a candidate could have received.

Dr. Handley turned to BISG because VAP (again, \"Voting Age Population\") data from the 2010 census (the most recent census) may be outdated in light of the increases in the black population of Eastpointe since 2010, and neither VAP nor CVAP (\"Citizen Voting Age Population\") data records Eastpointe's voter turnout or voter registration by race.

And the government contends \"[b]lack Voters preferred Monique Owens.\" ECF No. 38 PageID.1580 \u00b6 55. Because this February 2015 election is one of only four endogenous elections in which both black and white candidates ran, and in which the government alleges Eastpointe's at-large voting system enabled the\n   white majority voting bloc operated to prevent black voters from electing their preferred candidate, the facts surrounding which candidate black voters preferred in this election are material. They are also plainly in dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The parties also disagree to some extent on whether black voters were able to elect their preferred candidate in the November 2015 City Council election for two open full-term seats. Three candidates ran in that election: Sarah Lucido and John Marion, who are white, and Alexandria Bibb Williams, who is black. ECF No. 38 PageID.1541 \u00b6 142. According to the government, Williams was black voters' preferred candidates and Lucido their second choice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144. Defendants, however, assert \"[b]lack voters' first choice for the November 2015 elections [was] Lucido.\" ECF No. 26 PageID.616 \u00b6 20. Lucido, who won 47.7% of the overall vote, and Marion, who won 31.8%, were elected to the city council. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1615 tbl. 4. Williams received only 20.5% of the overall vote and accordingly did not win a City Council seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Both Dr. Handley and Dr. Alford's ecological inference and ecological regression analyses of CVAP data show Lucido received the most support among black as well as white voters, while Williams received the second-most support from black voters (but minimal support from white voters).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 2602 PageID.733 tbl. 1. Specifically, Dr. Handley's application of ecological inference and ecological regression to CVAP data shows Lucido received between 42.3% and 44.6% of black votes, and Williams between 30.5% and 32.2%. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1615 tbl. 4. But Dr. Handley's BISG analysis suggests Williams-not Lucido-was black voters' first-choice candidate, and that Williams received between 79.2% and 87.1% of black votes while Lucido received between 66.9% and 70.6%. ECF No. 38-2. PageID.1617 tbl. 4a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants' analysis of the November 2015 election equivocates between the ability of Eastpointe's black voters to elect their first-choice as opposed to second-choice candidate. While Defendants say they have accepted the results of Dr. Handley's BISG methodology for summary judgment purposes, their analysis largely ignores the fact that BISG shows Williams, the black candidate, (not Lucido) was black voters' preferred candidate. ECF No. 26 PageID.618 \u00b6 44, PageID.619 \u00b6 49. Specifically, Defendants conclude that because Lucido was elected to the City Council, black voters were able to elect their preferred candidate in the November 2015 election. But this fails to consider the BISG data showing that Lucido was black voters'\n   <em>\n    second-choice\n   </em>\n   candidate, not their first. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1617 tbl. 4a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Throughout their analysis of the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition, Defendants lean heavily on their assertion that \"black-preferred candidates win 60% of the time in the most probative elections - elections involving black and white candidates for the Eastpointe City Council.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.590. Closer examination of this figure reveals that it in fact includes this February 2015 election in which, based on BISG data, black voters were only able to elect their second-choice candidate, Lucido, who happened to also be white voters' first-choice candidate. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1615 tbl. 4; ECF No. 26-2 PageID.733 tbl. 1; ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1617 tbl. 4a. Marion, who was white\n   voters' second-choice candidate, won the other open seat. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1615 tbl. 4. Accordingly, based on both CVAP and BISG data, white voters successfully elected both their first and second-choice candidates to the City Council in this election while black voters, as indicated by BISG data, were only able to elect their second-choice candidate to one of the available seats; the other seat was won by black voters' last-preferred candidate, Marion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.1617 tbl. 4a. Disagreement between the parties as to whether black voters were able to elect their preferred candidate in the November 2015 election is another dispute of material fact that weighs in favor of denying summary judgment on the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The most recent endogenous elections in which both black and white candidates ran are the November 2017 Eastpointe City Council elections to fill one partial-term seat, and two full-term seats. ECF No. 38-5 PageID.1658 (Supplemental and Rebuttal Expert Report of Dr. Lisa Handley). Defendants' expert has not provided any analysis of the 2017 elections, nor do Defendants address those elections in detail in their brief. ECF No. 26. Because Defendants have accepted Dr. Handley's analysis for summary judgment purposes, the Court relies only on the data set forth in her reports concerning the 2017 election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26 PageID.596.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Two candidates competed for the available partial-term seat in the 2017 election: Tonia Gladney, who is African American, and Michael Klinefelt, who is white. ECF No. 38-5 PageID.1658. It is undisputed that black voters supported Gladney over Klinefelt. ECF No. 26 PageID.619 \u00b6 46; ECF No. 38 PageID.1542 \u00b6 141. Dr. Handley's analysis of CVAP data shows between 52.6% and 60% of black voters supported Gladney while white voters overwhelmingly supported Klinefelt. ECF No. 38-5 PageID.1680 tbl.1. BISG data indicates as many as 79.3% of black voters supported Gladney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.1681 tbl. 2. Both Dr. Handley's CVAP and BISG results thus demonstrate Gladney was black voters' preferred candidate in the 2017 election for a single partial-term seat. Yet Klinefelt received 65% of the overall vote, and Gladney only 35%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.1680 tbl.1. The results of this 2017 election therefore suggest that Eastpointe's white voters were able to elect their preferred candidate over black voters' preferred candidate in the 2017 election for one partial-term seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Six candidates initially entered the competition for two fullterm seats up for election in the general November 2017 City Council race. ECF No. 38 PageID.1541-42 \u00b6 137. Only two candidates, Cardi DeMonaco, Jr. and Michael Klinefelt, are white, and Klinefelt dropped out of the race to run instead for the open partial-term seat.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The remaining candidates: Clarence Duren, Edward Williams, Monique Owens, and R.J. Johnson, are all black.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Handley's CVAP analysis shows black voters' first-choice candidate was Owens, and their second choice Johnson. ECF No. 38-5 PageID.1680 tbl. 1. Those two candidates received the least support among white voters, whose first-choice candidate was DeMonaco, the only white candidate left in the race after Klinefelt dropped out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   BISG analysis yields similar conclusions for this election but suggests black voters slightly preferred Johnson to Owens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   PageID.1681 tbl. 2. Analyses of both data sets establish Owens and Johnson were the two preferred candidates among black voters while white voters by a great margin supported DeMonaco, the only remaining white candidate. It was DeMonaco who ultimately received the most overall votes, winning 30% of the electorate in Eastpointe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because there were two City\n   Council seats up for election, and only one white candidate in the running, the election of an African American candidate to one of the two seats was essentially a foregone conclusion.

ECF No. 38 PageID.1562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because there were fewer white candidates than open seats in the 2017 general City Council election, the government contends Owens won election under \"special circumstances\" and therefore that her election should not weigh against finding that Eastpointe's white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat the minority-preferred candidate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">\n    478 U.S. at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Yet because Owens was black voters' first-choice candidate in this election, Defendants consider the 2017 general City Council election one in which black voters were able to elect their preferred candidate. ECF No. 26 PageID.597-98. They also counted this election in determining that black voters successfully elected their preferred candidate in 60% of endogenous elections in which both black and white candidates ran.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416316\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/1382/#p1389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants failed in any way to differentiate this election from one in which election of an African American candidate was not predetermined, further calling into question their 60% figure.

Further, under\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   , the availability of more seats than white candidates in the 2017 general City Council election demands that results of that election be given less probative weight in determining whether Eastpointe's white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to defeat black voters' preferred candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Factual disputes about whether black voters were able to elect their preferred candidates in recent endogenous elections involving both black and white candidates-undisputedly the most probative here-preclude summary judgment on the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition. The Court's finding that Owens, the only black candidate to successfully run for the Eastpointe City Council, was elected in an election characterized by special circumstances also weighs in favor of denying summary judgment on the final\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   prerequisite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1618-25 tbls. 5-8. Exogenous elections that \"occurred on the same day as City Council elections, involved the same citywide electorate, and featured African-American candidates\" are more probative than other exogenous elections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Euclid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3891355\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/584/#p596\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of the elections Dr. Handley studied, only the 2014 East Detroit Public Schools election involved nearly the same electorate as a City Council race. ECF No. 38 PageID.1568.

ECF No. 38 PageID.1545 \u00b6 156. Dr. Handley's analysis of this election using CVAP data and applying both ecological regression and ecological inference shows black voters' preferred candidate was Calvin Washington, an appointed incumbent and the only black candidate in the race.

ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1618 tbl.5, PageID.1619 tbl.5a. Results of the November 2009 and November 2014 East Detroit School Board elections further suggest there is, at minimum, a triable issue of fact as to whether white voters in the City of Eastpointe vote sufficiently as a bloc in a manner sufficient usually to defeat black voters' preferred candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court has examined the parties' respective analyses of the remaining exogenous elections examined by Dr. Handley but finds that material issues of fact remain as to whether African American voters in Eastpointe were able to elect their preferred candidates in exogenous elections. For instance, Dr. Handley, the government's expert, asserts that all six of the contested exogenous elections that included black candidates were racially polarized and that, while black-preferred candidates were more successful in these exogenous contests than in Eastpointe City Council races, these were elections that coincided with a presidential race. ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1612.

Principally, while Defendants say they accept the analysis of the government's expert, Dr. Handley, for summary judgment purposes, including her use of BISG data, they repeatedly dispute her factual findings, or rely on different factual findings that contravene Dr. Handley's analysis. This is particularly true for endogenous elections involving black and white candidates. Because the parties disagree about material facts central to the elections undisputedly most probative here, the Court declines to enter summary judgment in favor of Defendants on the third\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, Defendants argue BISG-created data is inadmissible under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence because Dr. Handley's analysis relies on \"insufficient, untested, and unreliable methods to arrive at its conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3891355\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/584/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The admissibility of expert testimony under Rule 702 \"entails a flexible inquiry, and is addressed to the trial judge's discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Rochow v.

Dr. Handley, who applied the BISG data-creation method at issue in Defendants' motion to exclude, has provided sufficient facts and data to support the reliability of BISG data in this case, and to show that it was applied in a reliable manner.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 38-2 PageID.1632-34 (Appendix to Dr. Handley Expert Report). The explanation contained in her three expert reports, as well as the peer-reviewed analysis of BISG contained in articles she cites, satisfies the Court that her testimony will be the product of reliable principles and methods, applied reliably to the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 38-2, 38-5, 38-7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 12-19.
