Susan Wiley, individually and d/b/a Place On The Pointe, Place On The Pointe, Inc., Eric R. Bailey and Lauren T. Bailey, individually and d/b/a The Market Place Boutique\n   </em>\n   , civil action file number 17SCV104 (the \"underlying suit\"). (Doc. 18 \u00b6 1.) In the underlying suit, the Stewart Defendants seek damages and other relief against The Market Place Defendants, as well as Defendant Wiley and Defendant Place On The Pointe, Inc., related to alleged bodily injury and other alleged injuries and damages suffered as a result of an alleged slip and fall incident on or near the Market Place Defendants' premises on or about January 11, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2; Doc. 13-1.) The Market Place Defendants apparently contend that they are not at fault for the slip and fall and are not sure whether it occurred on their property. (Doc. 17 at 5; Doc. 13-11 at 6.) In the underlying suit, Plaintiff is providing a defense under a \"complete reservation of rights,\" reserving the rights to either \"withdraw its defense and/or disclaim coverage and indemnification for all or part of any judgment that may be obtained against the Market Place Defendants.\" (Doc. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although the Market Place Defendants were served with a copy of the summons and complaint in the underlying suit on May 16, 2017, they did not timely file an answer on or before June 15, 2017 to prevent the case from automatically going into default. (Doc. 18 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; Doc. 17-8 at 1-2.) They did, however, file an answer on June 21, 2017, which the State Court of Dougherty County treated as sufficient to open default as a matter of right. (Doc. 17-8 at 1-4.) The Market Place Defendants also did not timely serve responses to the Stewart Defendants' requests for admissions, but were thereafter granted permission to serve responses, and those responses have been deemed timely. (Doc. 17-8 at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It appears that the Market Place Defendants notified Plaintiff of the underlying lawsuit for the first time on October 30, 2017, almost six months after the Stewart Defendants filed the underlying suit. (Doc. 18 \u00b6 22.) Thereafter, counsel retained by Auto-Owners moved to open default and to withdraw the Market Place Defendants' Admissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; Doc. 13-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the instant lawsuit, the Market Place Defendants' Answers to the Complaint were due in May 2018, but to date, they have filed no Answer. (Doc. 18 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff issued policy number 49-176-398-00 to named insured The Market Place with effective dates from June 1, 2015 through June 1, 2016 (the \"policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The policy expressly contained the following conditions precedent to coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   2.

If a claim is made or \"suit\" is brought against any insured, you must see to it that we receive prompt written notice of the claim or \"suit\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   c. You and any other involved insured must:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (1) Immediately send us copies of any demands, notices, summonses or legal papers received in connection with the claim or \"suit\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (2) Authorize us to obtain records and other information;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (3) Cooperate with us in the investigation, settlement or defense of the claim or \"suit\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (4) Assist us, upon our request, in the enforcement of any right against any person or organization that may be liable to the insured because of injury or damage to which this insurance may also apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   d.

(Doc. 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also asks the Court to find that the Market Place Defendants are in default for failing to respond to the Complaint and that they have admitted the factual allegations in the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) Notably, after the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed, the Stewart Defendants voluntarily dismissed the underlying suit and filed an identical suit, promptly serving Plaintiff.

Moreover, a \"district court has the authority to enter default judgment for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence or to comply with its orders or rules of procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Wahl v.

Numerous courts have indicated the importance of prompt notice.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Se. Express Sys. v. S. Guar. Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"952260\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/224/697/#p701\">\n     224 Ga. App. 697\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 701,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"952260\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/224/697/#p701\">\n     482 S.E.2d 433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 436 (1997) (\" 'The purpose of notice is to enable the insurer to inform itself promptly concerning the accident, so that it may investigate the circumstances, prepare for a defense, if necessary, or be advised whether it is prudent to settle any claim arising therefrom.' \") (citation omitted);\n    <em>\n     Ill. Union Ins. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3785635\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/846/1366/#p1372\">\n     846 F. Supp. 2d at 1372\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[The insured] had a duty to report the accident so that [the insurer] could promptly investigate the facts surrounding the incident while they were still fresh and to prepare a defense of the action or determine the feasibility of settlement of the claim.\"). Such case law supports Plaintiff's argument that it has suffered some prejudice.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court finds this consistent with the first claim in the Complaint for a judgment declaring that \"Auto-Owners has no duty to defend or indemnify The Market Place Defendants because they failed to provide timely notice of the claim or suit pursuant to the terms and conditions of the policy.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 45(a).) The Court does not reach the second claim in the Complaint about whether the Market Place Defendants qualify as \"insureds\" because the policy names \"The Market Place\" as the insured.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9-11. The second claim was not raised in the summary judgment motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
