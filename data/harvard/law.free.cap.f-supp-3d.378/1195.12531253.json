Fatzinger, Tomas Jiminez, Aileen C. Dowell, Gene Ruffin, Catherine Jannick Downey, Terrance Schneider, Corey Hughes, Rebecca A. Lawler, and Shenna Perry (collectively, \"Defendants\") in their individual and official capacities pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. As alleged in the 83-page, 470-paragraph First Amended Complaint, at the time of filing this suit, Plaintiffs were students at Georgia Gwinnett College (\"GGC\"). [Doc. 13]. Defendants each have official roles at GGC; for example, Defendant Preczewski is the President and Defendant Dowell is the Director of the Office of Student Integrity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As alleged in the First Amended Complaint, in July 2016, Plaintiff Uzuegbunam, while a student at GGC, began distributing religious literature (or leafleting) in a plaza on the GGC campus, and a short time later, Defendant Perry, a Campus Safety/Security Officer for Campus Police, stopped Plaintiff Uzuegbunam and explained that he was not allowed to distribute literature at that location. Upon Plaintiff Uzuegbunam's inquiry, Defendant Downey, the Head of Access Services and Information Commons at GGC, later explained to Plaintiff Uzuegbunam that he could not distribute written materials outside of GGC's two speech areas and that he would need to reserve a speech area before he could distribute his literature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August 2016, Plaintiff Uzuegbunam applied for, and was granted, a reservation of the speech area for three separate dates, including August 25, 2016. Thereafter,\n   on August 25, 2016, Plaintiff Uzuegbunam went to the reserved speech area, stood on a stool, verbally shared his religious views, and distributed his religious literature. After approximately thirty minutes, Defendant Hughes, a Lieutenant for Campus Police, informed Plaintiff Uzuegbunam that he could not speak publicly in the area because GGC had received calls from people complaining about Plaintiff Uzuegbunam's expression. Defendant Hughes further explained that Plaintiff Uzuegbunam's speaking constituted \"disorderly conduct\" because it was disturbing the peace and tranquility of individuals in the area, was in violation of GGC policy, and that if Plaintiff Uzuegbunam continued to speak, he could be prosecuted. Plaintiff Uzuegbunam stopped speaking publicly and left the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Bradford desires to engage in similar expressive activities on campus like Plaintiff Uzuegbunam, including literature distribution and public speaking, but claims that Defendants' policies and practices prevent him from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   There were two GGC policies at the time that these events occurred: (1) Prior Speech Zone Policy and (2) Prior Speech Code Policy (collectively, \"Prior Policies\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These Prior Policies are discussed in detail below, but for background, the Court summarizes the Prior Policies here. The Prior Speech Zone Policy limited public speech to speech zones on campus, which were available only on certain days and times. The Prior Speech Zone Policy did not allow public speech on campus, including leafleting, unless the speaker applied for a reservation with GGC and received permission from GGC to speak in the speech zone. If GGC granted permission, then the speech was regulated to the speech zone at a specific date and time. The Prior Speech Code Policy prohibited behavior which disturbed the peace and/or comfort of persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs bring facial and as applied challenges to the Prior Policies, alleging that the Prior Policies violate their freedom of speech and exercise of religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages, as discussed more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Importantly, after Plaintiffs filed suit against Defendants, GGC amended its Speech Zone and Speech Code Policies. The Court will refer to these amended policies collectively as \"Amended Policies\" and individually as the \"Amended Speech Zone Policy\" and \"Amended Speech Code Policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims due to mootness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second, [the Court] ask[s] whether the government's decision to terminate the challenged conduct was \"unambiguous.\" This requires [the Court] to consider whether the actions that have been taken to allegedly moot the case reflect a rejection of the challenged conduct that is both permanent and complete. Third, [the Court] ask[s] whether the government has consistently maintained its commitment to the new policy or legislative scheme. When considering a full legislative repeal of a challenged law-or an amendment to remove portions thereof-these factors should not be viewed as exclusive nor should any single factor be viewed as dispositive. Rather, the entirety of the relevant circumstances should be considered and a mootness finding should follow when the totality of those circumstances persuades the court that there is no reasonable expectation that the government entity will reenact the challenged legislation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1257 (citation omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While some of the language quoted above refers specifically to government legislation, which is not at issue here, intervening governmental action need not rise to the level of legislation for this mootness analysis to apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1256. \"Indeed, even where the intervening governmental action does not rise to the level of a full legislative repeal,\" court have held that \" 'a challenge to a government policy that has been unambiguously terminated will be moot in the absence of some reasonable basis to believe that the\n   <em>\n    policy\n   </em>\n   will be reinstated if the suit is terminated.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Troiano v.

In conducting this analysis, the Court will rely on two affidavits presented by Defendants. First is the Affidavit of Defendant Dowell, who is the Director of Student Integrity at GGC. Dowell Aff. at \u00b6 2 [Doc. 21-2]. Defendant Dowell is \"responsible for implementing programmatic and policy changes, supervising the Office of Student Integrity staff, and adjudicating all disciplinary and non-disciplinary infractions for GGC, including academic integrity violations, disorderly conduct, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3. Second is the Affidavit of Marc Cardinalli, who is the Executive Director of Legal Affairs at GGC. Cardinalli Aff. at \u00b6 2 [Doc. 21-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Substantial Deliberation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As for the first factor, substantial deliberation, both Defendant Dowell and Mr. Cardinalli state in their affidavits that \"[o]n February 28, 2017, the GGC Cabinet approved revisions to GGC's Freedom of\n   Expression Policy [Prior Speech Zone Policy], as well as revisions to the Student Code of Conduct Section [Prior Speech Code Policy] in the GGC Student Handbook for 2016-2017.\" Dowell Aff. at \u00b6 4; Cardinalli Aff. at \u00b6 3. While these statements at a minimum inform the Court that there is a GGC Cabinet and the revisions to the Prior Policies were approved by that Cabinet, it is unclear what deliberation may have occurred. Importantly, however, there is no allegation or evidence to suggest that GGC acted in secrecy or departed from its own procedures, such that the Court has \"pause about the level of deliberation attending a change in policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Flanigan's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267130\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/1248/#p1255\">\n    868 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1260 (citing to cases where policy was changed in secrecy behind closed doors and where the governmental actors departed from their own procedures).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court also considers the timing of the changes to the Prior Policies. Plaintiffs filed suit on December 19, 2016. GGC changed the Prior Policies on February 28, 2017, or approximately 10 weeks later.

GGC adopted the Amended Policies over a year ago, on February 28, 2017. Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence that GGC has changed the Amended Policies or reenacted or enforced the Prior Policies. In addition, GGC has taken actions to implement the Amended Policies. Mr. Cardinalli states in his affidavit that legal counsel for the Georgia Board of Regents has provided GGC employees with four training sessions on the Prior Speech Zone Policy. Cardinalli Aff. at \u00b6 5.

Additionally, Mr. Cardinalli states that \"[a]dditional training will be on-going as needed.\" Cardinalli Aff. at \u00b6 8.

Nominal Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having found that Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot, the Court must now determine whether Plaintiffs' remaining claim for damages is sufficient to support standing and save this case. Plaintiffs argue that the Court may still render an opinion on the Prior Policies and whether they violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights because Plaintiffs have alleged damages. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have only prayed for nominal damages and attorneys' fees, and neither is sufficient to save this case from being dismissed as moot. Plaintiffs argue in response that they pleaded in their First Amended Complaint for an award of monetary damages and for damages in an amount to be determined by the evidence and the Court. Plaintiffs assert that the Court must construe their First Amended Complaint broadly for a claim of actual, compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs are correct that in several instances in their First Amended Complaint they request \"monetary damages and equitable relief.\" First Am.

Thus, in their Prayer for Relief, wherein they set forth the exact relief they seek including an injunction and declaratory relief, Plaintiffs specify that they are seeking nominal damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiffs' after-the-fact contentions now - that they are seeking compensatory damages - are not supported by the First Amended Complaint. \"[C]ompensatory damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit [must] be based on actual injury caused by the defendant rather than on the 'abstract value' of the constitutional rights that may have been violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Slicker v.

Plaintiffs contend that the Prior Policies violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief, along with nominal damages, and they did not seek compensatory damages. The Court has found that Plaintiff Uzuegbunam's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot because he has graduated from GGC. The Court has also found that Plaintiff Bradford's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot because GGC has unambiguously terminated the Prior Policies and there is no reasonable basis to expect that GGC will return to them. As explained above, a fair reading of Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint reveals that all of their alleged injuries would be remedied by the removal of the Prior Policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flanigan's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267130\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/1248/#p1255\">\n    868 F.3d at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
