Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Taking Plaintiff's allegations as true, the factual background is as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In or about October 2011, Plaintiff was interested in purchasing a car from JAS, for whom Plaintiff had been employed for less than six months. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.) On or about October 6, 2011, at the direction, advice, and encouragement of JAS's employees, Plaintiff purchased a 2008 Cadillac DTS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) On the same date, at the direction, advice, and encouragement of JAS, Plaintiff also purchased a 2012 Sorento. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) When Plaintiff purchased both vehicles, Tom Seltzer, JAS's finance manager, completed an \"Applicant's Credit Statement\" (\"Credit Statement\") for Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19.) The Credit Statement indicated that Plaintiff was a retired individual collecting Social Security and a pension, had earned a monthly salary of $ 2,500 for five years, and made $ 500 per month as a driver for JAS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) The Credit Statement also stated that Plaintiff had a mortgage and other financial obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Plaintiff alleges that she informed JAS that she earned approximately $ 1,100 per month, consisting of less than $ 500 from JAS and $ 750 in Social Security. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) According to Plaintiff, Seltzer did not show her the first page of the Credit Statement, so Plaintiff signed the signature page of the Credit Statement without realizing what she was signing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on the Credit Statement, the same loan officer from VNB approved Plaintiff to receive $ 68,000 in credit to purchase both vehicles on the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   VNB made two loans to Plaintiff. The first was a $ 39,922.10 loan, which Plaintiff used to purchase the Sorento. (ECF 43-2, Sparkes Decl. Ex. A.) According to the Installment Sale Contract for the loan, Plaintiff traded in a Hyundai Sonata, which had a lien attached to it, for the Sorento. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) The second was a $ 22,\n   494.55 loan, which Plaintiff used to purchase the Cadillac. (Sparkes Decl. Ex. B.) The Installment Sale Contract for the Cadillac loan states that Plaintiff traded in a Ford Mustang for the Cadillac. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Ford Mustang also had a lien attached to it that had to be paid off. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) VNB assigned both loans to its wholly-owned subsidiary, VNB Loan Servicing, Inc. (\"LSI\"). (MTD at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When Plaintiff returned home with both vehicles, she realized that she could not afford them and did not want them, so she returned to JAS less than twenty-four-hours after signing the contracts to return them. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) JAS refused to rescind the transactions because the paperwork had been put through. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff voluntarily surrendered both vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) In December 2011, Plaintiff contacted VNB to surrender the Sorento after making one payment. (MTD at 3; ECF 43-3, Gonzalez Decl. \u00b6 5.) In 2015, Plaintiff defaulted on the Cadillac. (MTD at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. State Court Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   LSI sold both cars but did not recover sufficient funds to satisfy the loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 34.) As a result, LSI sued Plaintiff for the Sorento deficiency (\"Sorento action\"), and after Plaintiff failed to respond, default judgment was entered against Plaintiff in the amount of $ 8,092.34 on April 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   LSI also sued Plaintiff for the Cadillac deficiency (\"Cadillac action\"), and default judgment was entered against Plaintiff in the Magisterial District Court in the amount of $ 9,880.45 on April 5, 2016. (MTD at 4; Gonzalez Decl. \u00b6 11, Ex. E.) Plaintiff filed an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, after which LSI filed a Complaint, alleging breach of contract and unjust enrichment. (MTD at 4; Gonzalez Decl. \u00b6 13.) Plaintiff filed an \"Answer with New Matter\" setting forth forty-four defenses, including fraud, \"the doctrine of illegality,\" and unconscionability, to which LSI replied. (MTD at 4; Gonzalez Decl. Ex. E.) The lawsuit proceeded to arbitration, where Plaintiff stipulated to the entry of an arbitration award of $ 9,716.95 on December 7, 2016. (MTD at 4; Gonzalez Decl. Exs. H, I.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   LSI filed a \"Notice of Judgment\" and \"Praecipe for Judgment\" for that amount\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   on March 31, 2017. (MTD at 4; Gonzalez Decl. Exs. H, I; VNB Supp. Ex. A.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both judgments against Plaintiff were entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County, Pennsylvania. (Compl. \u00b6 37.) Plaintiff did not appeal either award. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Supp. at 3) (\"Plaintiff has never sought the judicial vacation of those [state] judgments in this matter.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Federal Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed the original Complaint in this Court on October 3, 2016 against Defendants JAS and Iannicelli (ECF 1). Defendants filed an Answer on December 30, 2016 (ECF 6). Plaintiff moved for leave to join VNB as a Defendant on May 23, 2017 (ECF 14), which the Court granted on July 24, 2017 (ECF 15). Plaintiff filed the amended Complaint against all Defendants, including VNB, on September 12, 2017 (ECF 16). JAS filed an Answer on November 10, 2017 (ECF 17). The action was dismissed with prejudice as to JAS on March 19, 2018, and as to Iannicelli on April 13, 2018, pursuant to agreement of counsel under Local Rule of Civil Procedure 41.1(b) (ECF 27, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed an Affidavit of Service of the Summons and the amended Complaint on VNB (ECF 18). On January 9, 2018, Plaintiff filed a request for entry of default of judgment against VNB pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 55(a) and (b)(1) in the amount of $ 85,851.31 (ECF 19). Default was entered by the Clerk on the same date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 22, 2018, the Court held a hearing pertaining to case management and Plaintiff's request for a default judgment against VNB (ECF 23). On September 18, 2018, default judgment was entered against VNB in the amount of $ 104,477.60, and the case was closed (ECF 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   VNB filed a Motion to Vacate Entry of Default Judgment and to allow VNB twenty days to file a response to the Complaint on October 12, 2018 (ECF 35). Plaintiff filed a Response on October 26, 2018 (ECF 36), and VNB filed a Reply on November 2, 2018 (ECF 37). The Court granted VNB's Motion to Vacate on January 15, 2019 (ECF 39, 40). The Court concluded that the default judgment was void pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) because the default judgment granted Plaintiff relief against VNB to which Plaintiff was not entitled in violation of Rule 54(c).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20199897\">\n    2019 WL 199897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court held a pretrial conference on February 4, 2019 (ECF 42). On February 11, 2019, VNB filed a Motion to Dismiss (ECF 43); Plaintiff filed a Response on February 28, 2019 (ECF 45, \"Resp.\"); and VNB filed a Reply on March 8, 2019 (ECF 46, \"Rep.\"). On April 8, 2019, the Court ordered counsel to file supplemental memoranda addressing whether the arbitration award in the Cadillac action was confirmed by the state court and, if so, whether Plaintiff appealed that award (ECF 47). Pursuant to the Court's order, Plaintiff filed a Supplemental Response on April 16, 2019 (ECF 48), and VNB filed a Supplemental Memorandum on April 18, 2019 (ECF 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   VNB first contends all Counts against it-Counts I, II, III, IV, and VII-must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) because this Court lacks jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine. (MTD 10-11.) Specifically, VNB argues that Plaintiff attacks the validity of the state court judgments by using the judgments as the measure of damages in the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   VNB then contends that Plaintiff's claims must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for several reasons. First, Plaintiff's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the state and federal court actions both arise out of the same Installment Sale Contracts executed in October 2011; Plaintiff could have brought all defenses and claims asserted in this action in state court; both the state and federal actions involve the same parties, as LSI, the plaintiff in the state court actions, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of VNB; and both parties are acting in the same capacity as in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-10.) Next, VNB contends that the UTPCPL claim in Count II and the fraud claim in Count IV must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. With respect to Count II, VNB argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege that VNB engaged in deception on which Plaintiff justifiably relief, as required to state a claim under the UTPCPL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) As to Counts II and IV, VNB avers that Plaintiff fails to allege facts with sufficient particularity to withstand dismissal under Rule 9(b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff, on the other hand, contends that Counts I, II, III, IV, and VII should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(1) because\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable. (Resp. at 11.) Plaintiff argues that she is not challenging the state court deficiency judgments, but rather is seeking damages based on VNB's predatory lending practices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Regarding VNB's Motion under Rule 12(b)(6), Plaintiff argues that res judicata does not bar Plaintiff's claims because the state court entered a default judgment and an arbitration award, and so no issues were actually litigated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Plaintiff also avers that based on discovery produced in this matter, VNB deliberately hid documents and information to obtain deficiency judgments, which prevented Plaintiff from fully litigating her claims in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff then argues that Counts II and IV should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim. The Complaint states a viable UTPCPL claim against VNB, Plaintiff contends, because Count II specifically identifies VNB as a violating party and VNB participated in a predatory lending scheme by approving Plaintiff's Credit Statement, even though VNB knew that the stated income would not support the monthly loan payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) VNB approved Plaintiff's loan applications, Plaintiff avers, because they stated that\n   Plaintiff earned approximately $ 30,000 annually-the minimum amount required for automobile dealers to qualify for VNB's promotion at the time-which approved loans up to $ 30,000 if the applicant earned $ 30,000 annually. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) According to Plaintiff, even if Plaintiff had earned $ 30,000 annually, that amount would not support one loan, let alone two loans to the same person on the same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   VNB's Reply specifically refutes Plaintiff's contention that default judgments lack preclusive effect, arguing that Plaintiff confuses the doctrine of res judicata with collateral estoppel. (Rep. at 1-2.) Next, VNB seeks to clarify that VNB did not withhold documents in state court, explaining that VNB produced additional documents in federal court because the subpoena in federal court was broader than the document demand served in state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Lastly, VNB characterizes Plaintiff's argument regarding the facts alleged in support of Counts II and IV as \"legal conclusions and hyperbole,\" as opposed to factual assertions that VNB acted improperly, as necessary to sustain fraud claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Plaintiff does not allege that VNB denied or revoked\n   her credit, refused to grant Plaintiff credit, or changed the terms of the Installment Sale Contracts.

(Compl. \u00b6 105.) As Plaintiff does not allege that VNB was involved in completing the Credit Statement, the Court may infer that this allegation pertains only to former Defendants and is not at issue in the present Motion. The Court also notes that even if this allegation applied to VNB, Plaintiff does not allege any facts demonstrating that the alleged conduct amounts to a violation of \u00a7 1638(a)(3), which requires a creditor to disclose the \"finance charge.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
