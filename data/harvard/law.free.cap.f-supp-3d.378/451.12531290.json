Defendant claims that the 2017 Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   , which declared SEC disgorgement a penalty, bars pursuit of the instant criminal action under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because Defendant has already been punished for some of the activity with which he is charged. Def.'s Br. 2, ECF No. 140. The Government replied on December 11, 2018, arguing (1) that Defendant unfairly delayed filing the\n   instant motion, (2) that he waived his right to pursue a Double Jeopardy claim, (3) that he cannot claim Double Jeopardy because he only received a\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   punishment, and (4) that, even if Double Jeopardy applied, it would only apply to the pending criminal charges associated with the specific investment activities involved in the civil action. Gov't Resp., ECF No. 147. Defendant filed a reply on December 20, 2018, contesting most of the Government's assertions, but conceding that Double Jeopardy would\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   bar\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the charges in the indictment because only a portion of the criminal allegations are related to the investment activities punished by the civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 155.

Other courts suggest disgorgement is an ancillary equitable power available to courts under the statutory provisions that grant courts the authority to issue injunctions in securities law violation cases ( 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77t(b) and 15 U.S.C. 78u(d) (1) ).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Which statute actually authorizes disgorgement does not impact the Court's analysis on the issue of whether Congress intended disgorgement to be civil or criminal because, as explained below, the language of each statute impliedly indicates a preference for the civil label.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, the language of sections 77v(a) and 78aa authorizes district courts to exercise jurisdiction over suits in equity in securities litigation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77v(a) (\"The district courts of the United States ... shall have jurisdiction ... of all\n   <em>\n    suits in equity\n   </em>\n   and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this subchapter.\") (emphasis added); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa (\"The district courts of the United States ... shall have exclusive jurisdiction ... of all\n   <em>\n    suits in equity\n   </em>\n   and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder.\") (emphasis added). Though the language of these statutes does not expressly label such jurisdiction as \"civil,\" the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have made it clear that suits in equity are considered\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   actions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 2 advisory committee's note to 1937 amendment (\"Reference to actions at law or suits in equity in all statutes should now be treated as referring to the civil action prescribed in these rules.\"). Because suits in equity are treated as\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   actions, the references to suits in equity in sections 77v(a) and 78aa, impliedly indicate a preference for the\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, sections 77t(b) and 78u(d) (1) both state that, where someone is engaged in or about to engage in conduct that violates the securities laws, the SEC \"may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district court of the United States ... to enjoin such acts or practices.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b), 78u(d) (1). Both statutes also authorize the SEC to \"transmit such evidence as may be available concerning such acts or practices to the Attorney General who may, in his discretion, institute the necessary criminal proceedings.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b), 78u(d) (1). Though the statutory language authorizing injunctions does not expressly label such authority as \"civil,\" the reference to criminal proceedings as a distinct process controlled by the Attorney General suggests that injunction proceedings are not criminal. This distinction, along with the fact that injunctions are equitable remedies available in suits in equity (which this Court just noted are\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   actions), impliedly indicates a preference\n   for the\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   label in sections 77t(b) and 78u(d) (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This Court finds that the language of these statutes ( 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b), 77v(a), 78aa, 78u(d) (1) ) indicates that Congress preferred the civil label. Because the disgorgement ordered in\n   <em>\n    Janus Spectrum\n   </em>\n   was necessarily authorized by at least one of these statutes, it logically follows that, despite the lack of\n   <em>\n    express\n   </em>\n   statutory authority for disgorgement, in each of these statutes Congress impliedly indicated a preference that disgorgement be civil in nature. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit noted, \"[t]he disgorgement remedy, which has long been upheld as within the general equity powers granted to the district court, ... has not been considered a criminal sanction.\"\n   <em>\n    Palmisano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11872317\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/135/860/#p865\">\n    135 F.3d at 865-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

For example, the civil equitable power of district courts can be contrasted with the courts' power to impose criminal sanctions for securities law violations, as expressly authorized by 15 U.S.C \u00a7 77x, upon which this criminal indictment rests, and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78ff, upon which criminal charges under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78a et seq. may be based.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787659\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/242/#p248\">\n    448 U.S. at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787659\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/242/#p248\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the Court looks to whether these statutes that authorize disgorgement as an equitable remedy require scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b), 77v(a), 78aa, 78u(d) (1).

Therefore, the Court takes into account the three additional considerations below to determine whether the \"clearest proof\" exists to transform disgorgement from civil to criminal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Punitive Nature\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   clearly impacted the analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   factors. Most notably, it shifted the \"traditional aims of punishment\" factor in Defendant's favor.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.C.2.d. However, Defendant's argument asks this Court to find that\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   did more than just shift one factor in his favor; Defendant asks the Court to find that\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   impacted the\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   analysis to an extent that it made disgorgement so punitive in nature that disgorgement now qualifies as criminal punishment. The question of whether disgorgement is a criminal punishment for Double Jeopardy purposes, as Defendant asks this Court to decide, \"is\n   <em>\n    distinct\n   </em>\n   from (although overlapping with) the question of whether [disgorgement] is a penalty rather than a remedy,\" as the\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   Court decided.\n   <em>\n    Saad v.

There is overlap in these questions because both the issue in\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   and the issue presented to this Court depend on the punitive nature of disgorgement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604676\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1635/\">\n    137 S.

However, they are distinct issues because they deal with different types of punishments.\n   <em>\n    Kokesh\n   </em>\n   only analyzed whether disgorgement was punitive enough to qualify as a\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   penalty for purposes of the statute of limitations provision at issue there, but the Double Jeopardy analysis asks whether disgorgement is punitive enough to be a\n   <em>\n    criminal\n   </em>\n   punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That distinction is important to the analysis here.
