For the reasons set forth herein, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Shkelzen Berisha is the son of Sali Berisha, the former Prime Minister (and before that the President) of Albania.\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Stmt. of Facts\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 139 (\"\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   \"), at \u00b6 3. In this defamation action, Plaintiff challenges statements made about him by Defendant Lawson, principally in Lawson's book entitled \"Arms &amp; The Dudes: How Three Stoners from Miami Beach Became the Most Unlikely Gunrunners in History,\" published by Defendant S &amp; S in June 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. The book tells the \"unlikely\" story of Efraim Diveroli,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Packouz and Defendant Podrizki, Florida residents and childhood friends who became international arms dealers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. The challenged statements are all to the effect that Plaintiff was involved in corrupt arms dealing, and that he was affiliated with the Albanian mafia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Albanian Deal and Its Aftermath\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, Defendant Packouz began working for AEY, Inc., a company run by his childhood friend Diveroli.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. AEY made its money by bidding on and satisfying arms procurement contracts posted online by the United States military.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2006, AEY won a contract to provide equipment to the Afghan military, a deal worth approximately $ 300 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. The largest component of the deal was the delivery of 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition to Afghanistan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Using a middleman, AEY found a trove of the required ammunition in Albania, at what appeared to be a bargain price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. AEY's plan was for its middleman to use a shell company to buy the ammunition from Albania's Military Export Import Company (\"MEICO\"), a state-owned company tasked with disposing of the immense stockpiles of weapons left over from the Cold War.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12. The middleman would then sell the ammunition to AEY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Realizing that AEY needed someone \"on the ground\" in Albania, Packouz enlisted another childhood friend, Defendant Podrizki.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. Packouz chose Podrizki because of the latter's familiarity with firearms and, evidently, with illicit trafficking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stmt. of Facts\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 154 (\"\n   <em>\n    PSOF\n   </em>\n   \"), at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Podrizki traveled to Albania and met Ylli Pinari, the head of MEICO.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. Pinari showed the supply of Cold War-era ammunition to Podrizki, who determined that it was of good quality despite its age.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12. However, Podrizki noticed that some of the ammunition's packaging bore Chinese markings, a potential deal-breaker given that there was an embargo barring American companies from selling Chinese-made ammunition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Podrizki told Packouz about the markings, but AEY decided to try to conceal the ammunition's Chinese origin and ship it in contravention of the embargo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To that end, Podrizki engaged an Albanian businessman, Kosta Trebicka, to remove\n   the ammunition from its original packaging and place it into nondescript plastic bags and cardboard boxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Once on the job, Trebicka discovered that AEY's middleman was selling the ammunition to AEY at nearly double the price he was paying to MEICO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. Packouz speculated that the price differential was being funneled into \"kickbacks\" for Albanian officials, perhaps including Pinari.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2007, Diveroli learned about the situation and flew to Albania to negotiate directly with MEICO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Diveroli and Podrizki met with Pinari in Tirana, the Albanian capital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. They also met\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Pinari's business associate, Mihail Delijorgji, and another individual, about the same age as Podrizki, who remained silent and was not introduced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19-22. Diveroli was informed that AEY could have a price reduction on the ammunition if the contract for the repackaging was taken away from Trebicka and given to a company controlled by Delijorgji.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. Later, Diveroli and Trebicka told Podrizki that the silent, unidentified man at the meeting was the son of the Albanian Prime Minister.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Per the new arrangement reached at the meeting, Delijorgji's company was given the repackaging deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Trebicka, having been cut out, started communicating with journalists, including at the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   , in an effort to expose those involved in the AEY deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. In an effort to collect incriminating evidence, Trebicka recorded one of his telephone calls with Diveroli.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. During that recorded call, Diveroli told Trebicka that he could not bring him back into the deal because the corruption surrounding it \"went up higher to the prime minister and his son.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. \"I can't fight this mafia,\" Diveroli told Trebicka, adding: \"It got too big. The animals just got out of control.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 23, 2007, AEY's office in Miami Beach was raided by federal investigators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. Throughout the ensuing investigation, both Packouz and Podrizki cooperated with law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29. Diveroli, Packouz and Podrizki were all ultimately indicted and entered guilty pleas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. Packouz and Podrizki were sentenced to house arrest, while Diveroli received a four-year prison sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Gerdec Explosion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 15, 2008, a factory where workers were dismantling ammunition for scrap exploded in the Albanian town of Gerdec.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30. The explosion killed 26 people and injured hundreds of others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Gerdec disaster, dubbed a \"Political Hiroshima\" by the local press, grew into a major scandal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114. It led to the arrests and convictions of MEICO chief Pinari and his associate Delijorgji, who were found to have been involved in the corrupt dealings that resulted in stockpiles of heavy munitions being dismantled by untrained civilians in the middle of a residential area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31;\n   <em>\n    Ex. 8 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   News reports suggested that both Plaintiff and the Albanian Defense Minister were involved as well, but neither individual was prosecuted.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Quoting the recording that Trebicka had made of Diveroli, including the latter's statement that \"the prime minister and his son\" were involved in \"mafia\" dealings, the article stated that the \"secretly recorded\" conversation \"suggested corruption\" in AEY's Albanian deal.\n   <em>\n    Ex. 2 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126-2, at pp. 2, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff was aware of the\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   article shortly after it was published, but never sued the\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   or asked it to issue a correction.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.

The article noted that Trebicka had been a witness in the investigation into the Gerdec explosion and, while the police had ruled his cause of death to be a car crash, that finding was being \"strongly questioned\" by the Albanian media, with some suspecting a \"more sinister\" cause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Paraphrasing the contents of Trebicka's recorded call with Diveroli, the article stated that \"Mr. Diveroli [had] said the corruption went all the way up to the Albanian prime minister, Sali Berisha, and his son.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The article again noted Trebicka's recorded call with Diveroli, stating that \"Mr. Diveroli [had] said the corruption went all the way up to the Albanian prime minister, Sali Berisha, and his son.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Later articles in the\n   <em>\n    Broward Palm Beach New Times\n   </em>\n   and the\n   <em>\n    New Republic\n   </em>\n   repeated this information about Plaintiff's alleged involvement in the AEY deal.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 97;\n   <em>\n    Ex. 7 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126-7, at p. 2 ;\n   <em>\n    Ex. 16 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126-17, at p. 6. Indeed, it was not only in articles that this claim appeared but also in two books published prior to Lawson's-one in the United States and one in Albania.\n   <em>\n    Ex. 10 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126-10, at pp. 6-7 ;\n   <em>\n    Ex. 15 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126-16, at pp. 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff argues that all of the publications that followed the original\n   <em>\n    Times\n   </em>\n   article were merely repeating what that first article had said, and that article, in turn, was based solely on Diveroli's comments in the recorded call with Trebicka.\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 153, at p. 19. Thus, rather than representing the independent investigations of so many news sources, all of these stories boiled down to a single comment made by Diveroli, whom Plaintiff more than once describes as a \"pathological liar.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10, 19, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   There are several problems with this argument.

First, and critically, Lawson relied on the account given to him by Podrizki, who identified Plaintiff as being at the Tirana meeting.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101. Lawson also interviewed Erion Veliaj, the mayor of Tirana, who told Lawson that he believed \"Plaintiff was involved in the corrupt AEY deal[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 126, at \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.

In fact, there was an entire body of reporting about Plaintiff's alleged involvement in the Gerdec disaster, not the least of which was the half-hour Al Jazeera segment entitled \"Bullets and Bucks,\" which Plaintiff himself concedes was \"damning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90. Diveroli's recorded comments were not the only evidence underlying this reporting, as Plaintiff appears to have been explicitly referred to in documents tied to the Gerdec project.\n   <em>\n    See Ex. 8 to Lawson Decl.\n   </em>\n   There were also the cables of the former U.S. Ambassador to Albania, disseminated by WikiLeaks in 2011.\n   <em>\n    DSOF\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92. In one of those cables, the Ambassador reported that the former head of the Albanian army had come to him out of fear for his own safety, stating that Plaintiff had put him under \"direct pressure\" to continue delivering \"high caliber ammunition to Gerdec and to do so without delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As Defendants note, a critical consideration in any defamation case under Florida law is the \"gist or sting\" of the challenged statements.\n   <em>\n    Levan v.

Here, the gist of Lawson's book about AEY and the gist of the reporting on Gerdec were the same, insofar as they related to Plaintiff. The gist of both stories was that Plaintiff had been involved in corrupt dealings surrounding Albania's vast, largely defunct, but still dangerous Cold War arsenals. Thus, it was not Lawson who broke the story about Plaintiff-as Defendants put it, by the time Lawson's book came out in 2015, these allegations were already \"old news.\"\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 138, at p. 2.

But that does not mean that Diveroli, Pinari and Trebicka are the ones who must be believed. A review of the record in this case indicates that arms dealing has at times been a shady business. Here, Lawson, an experienced investigative journalist reporting on the AEY controversy, had to rely on the witnesses to the story whom he found to be most credible. Lawson concluded that Packouz and Podrizki were those witnesses, and the Court declines to second guess him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The remainder of Plaintiff's response papers is devoted to cataloguing examples of Defendants' \"elaborate deceptions\" and \"slipshod, bad-faith reporting.\"\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 153, at p. 1.
